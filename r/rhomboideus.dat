50|$|The <b>Rhomboideus</b> capitis is {{the most}} cranial of the deeper muscles. It is {{underneath}} the Clavotrapezius. Its origin is the superior nuchal line, and its insertion is at the scapula. Action draws scapula cranially.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rhomboideus</b> is a thick, large muscle {{below the}} Trapezius muscles. It {{extends from the}} {{vertebral}} border of the scapula to the mid-dorsal line. Its origin is from the neural spines of the first four thoracic vertebrae, and its insertion is at the vertebral border of the scapula. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal.|$|E
50|$|The Splenius is {{the most}} {{superficial}} of all the deep muscles. It is a thin, broad sheet of muscle underneath the Clavotrapezius and deflecting it. It is crossed also by the <b>Rhomboideus</b> capitis. Its origin is the mid-dorsal line of the neck and fascia. The insertion is the superior nuchal line and atlas. It raises or turns the head.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{triangle}} {{is situated}} behind the scapula. It is bounded above by the trapezius, below by the latissimus dorsi, and laterally by the vertebral {{border of the}} scapula; the floor is partly formed by the <b>rhomboideus</b> major. If the scapula is drawn forward by folding the arms across the chest, and the trunk bent forward, parts of the sixth and seventh ribs and the interspace between them become subcutaneous and available for auscultation. The space is therefore known as the triangle of auscultation.|$|E

It is often grown with other {{bivalves}} (Venerupis pullastra, Venerupis <b>rhomboideus,</b> Venerupis aurea, Dosinia exoleta and Tellina incarnate). Their main predators are shore crabs (Carcinus maenas); starfish (Asterias rubens and Marthasterias glaciais); gastropods (Natica sp.); and birds (Larus sp). An individual Carcinus maenas (6.5 cm width) can consume 5 or 6 clams per day. Marine aquaculture production of grooved carpet shell in 2003 was 3,007 t in Portugal, which excludes non-aquaculture harvesting of the species.|$|E
5000|$|The masseter, or cheek muscle, {{opens and}} closes the jaw and allows chewing. The Brachiocephalicus is a wide {{strap-like}} muscle that begins {{at the base of}} the skull behind the jaw and ends below the point of the shoulder to the humerus. This muscle moves the head from side to side, pulls the scapula forward, raises it in collection, and swings the foreleg forward. It is well developed for good movement, and too strong a rein contact inhibits free forward movement. The Sternocephalic begins at the jowl and ends at the sternum. This muscle moves the head and neck. In ewe-necked or bull-necked horses, this muscle is overdeveloped, and is difficult to get into a relaxed shape. The <b>Rhomboideus</b> begins at the Nuchal ligament and ends at the scapula. It lifts the shoulder and forehand, and pulls the scapula forward. The Splenius begins behind the poll and ends at the beginning of the Trapezius. This muscle turns and extends the neck, and makes up the topline if well developed. The Trapezius is a flat, sheet-like muscle that begins at the Occipital bone and ends at the spines of the 7th cervical and all the thoracic vertebrae. It lifts the shoulder and forehand, and if this muscle is well developed, the horse will work in a good outline. The Nuchal ligament begins at the poll and ends at the withers, and helps the muscles in the neck support the head. The deltoid begins at the scapula and ends at the humerus. The deltoid flexes the shoulder joint, and will load the shoulder if overdeveloped. The Supraspinatus begins below the trapezius and ends at the point of the shoulder; it maintains the shoulder in extension. The Latissimus dorsi begins at the lower thoracic vertebrae and ends at the back of the humerus; it flexes the shoulder and pulls the foreleg back. The Triceps flex the shoulder and extend the elbow; the Biceps flex the elbow and extend the shoulder. The pectoral muscles help pull the foreleg forward. The Triceps Brachii extend the elbow joint; the Biceps Brachii flex the elbow joint. The Extensor carpus extends the knee. The Flexor carpus flexes the knee. The Digital extensor extends the toe and knee. The digital flexor flexes the toe and knee and extends the elbow.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of sex on histochemical and morphometrical characteristics of muscle fibres (myocytes) in this pure breed and to verify the presence of giant fibres as well as vascularity of the muscle. Finally, maximum shortening velocity and isometric tension were measured in single muscle fibres. Sixteen Casertana pigs (8 males, 8 females) from a farm in Campania (Italy) were slaughtered at one year of age. Muscle tissues were obtained from psoas minor, <b>rhomboideus</b> and longissimus dorsi. Myofibres were stained for myosin adenosine triphosphatase, succinic dehydrogenase, and α-amylase-periodic acid schiff. For all fibre types, the area and perimeter were measured. Slowtwitch oxidative fibres, fast-twitch glycolytic fibres and fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibres were histochemically differentiated; an image-analyzing system was used. The results showed significant differences between the sexes in the size of all three fibre types. The psoas minor muscle had a high percentage of slow-twitch oxidative fibres and contained more capillaries per fibre and per mm 2 than <b>rhomboideus</b> and longissimus dorsi, in which fast-twitch glycolytic fibres dominated. The cross-sectional area of all fibre types was larger in longissimus dorsi than in <b>rhomboideus</b> and psoas minor muscles; the giant fibres were present in the longissimus dorsi muscle only. Besides, isometric tension values were higher in fast-twitch glycolytic fibres than in the other ones. Variations in fibre type composition may contribute to meat quality...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the Late Cretaceous (Santonian) {{terrestrial}} vertebrate locality at Iharkut (western Hungary) has yielded well-preserved remains of lizard taxa besides the remains of fishes, amphibians, turtles, crocodiles, pterosaurs and dinosaurs. Previously the polyglyphanodontine lizard Bicuspidon aff. hatzegiensis has been reported from Iharkut. However, recent excavations at this site produced more lacertilian remains including new polyglyphanodontine material, namely a maxilla and two dentaries which suggest {{the presence of a}} new genus in the Iharkut fauna. This previously unknown lizard (described here as Distortodon <b>rhomboideus</b> n. g. n. sp.) is distinct from other polyglyphanodontines such as Bicuspidon, Paraglyphanodon, Polyglyphanodon, Dicothodon and Peneteius. It differs from these genera mainly in having the lingual cusp situated more distally compared to the labial one on its bicuspid teeth located in the distal part of the tooth row, thus the crowns having a unique rhomboidal shape in occlusal view. Distortodon <b>rhomboideus</b> further strengthens the dominance of borioteiioid lizards in the Iharkut fauna. The growing presence of borioteiioids in European localities supports previous theories which suggest some paleobiogeographic connections between the western Tethyan archipelago and North America in the Late Cretaceous.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIn the {{literature}} which is written on rodent myology {{there is not}} much reference made to the morphology of the golden hamster. Parsons (1896) reports on some hamsters that he dissected. Priddy and Brodie (1948) have published the only recent work on the morphology of the golden hamster. This study is concerned with the myology of the pectoral girdle of the golden hamster. The pectoral girdle is compared with that of the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935), the wood rat (Howell, 1926), the kangeroo rat (Howell, 1932), the pocket gopher (Hollinger, 1916) and the rabbit (Bensley, 1938). Parsons work on the comparative myology of the sciuromorphine, hystricomorphine and myomorphine rodents (1894 and 1896) is referred to extensively. The following muscles are included in this study: M. clavotrapezius, M. acromiotrapezius, M. spinotrapezius, M. sternomastoideus, M. cleidomastoideus, M. subclavius, M. atlantoscapularis, M. occipitoscapularis, M. levator scapulae, M. seratus magnus, M. <b>rhomboideus</b> anticus, M. <b>rhomboideus</b> posticus, M. acromiodeltoideus, M. spinodeltideus, M. suspraspinatus, M. infraspinatus, M. subscapularis, M. teres major, M. teres minor, M. coracobrachialis, M. pectoralis, M. latissimus dorsi, M. epitrochlearis, M. anconeus, M. triceps longus, M. triceps lateralis, M. triceps medialis, M. biceps brachii and M. brachialis. The origins and insertions or the following muscles had the normal relationships in the golden hamster: sternomastoideus, cleidomastoideus, subclavius, acromiodeltoideus, spinodeltoideus, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, anconeus, triceps longus, triceps lateralis, triceps medialis and brachialis. The trapezius muscle in the hamster is clearly divided into three parts: clavotrapezius, acromiotrapezius and spinotrapezius. The origin of the spinotrapezius showed some variation in the animals that were dissected. The trapezius complex of muscles showed differences in the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) and in the pocket gopher (Hollinger, 1916). The atlantoscapularis in the hamster arises from the atlas only, but in the rabbit the atlantoscapularis arises from the sphenoocipital synchondrosis. Parsons reports that in the sciuromorphine and hystricomorphine rodents (1894) the origin may be from either place mentioned above. The occipitoscapularis is a distinct muscle in the hamster, laboratory rat and the wood rat. Bensley (1938) treats this muscle {{as a part of the}} levator scapulae complex. Parsons (1894 and 1896) and Howell (1932) treat the occipitoscapularis as part of the <b>rhomboideus</b> complex. The levator scapulae in the hamster originates from the lateral processes of the last three cervical vertebrae and from the first three ribs. The other animals in this study vary considerably as to points of origin. The serratus magnus in the hamster originates from the third to the ninth rib. The other animals in this study vary considerably as to points of origin. Most of the authors in this study treated the levator scapulae as part of the serratus magnus complex and treat them both as one muscle. Greene (1935) treats them as separate muscles and so does Howell (1926). The <b>rhomboideus</b> complex in the hamster can be divided into a <b>rhomboideus</b> anticus and a <b>rhomboideus</b> posticus. Most of the authors consider them as one muscle consisting of two parts. Parsons (1896) considers the occipitoscapularis as a component of the <b>rhomboideus</b> complex and terms it the <b>rhomboideus</b> capitis. The teres minor is not distinguishable as a separate muscle in the golden hamster and is treated as part of the infraspinatus complex. Parsons (1896) reports that this is true in all the Myomorpha. The other authors treat the teres minor as a distinct muscle. In the hamster the coracobrachialis is treated as one muscle. Howell (1932) describes a pars profunda and a pars media in the kangeroo rat. Parsons (1894 and 1896) divides the coracobrachialis into three parts. The other authors included in this study treat the coracobrachialis as just one muscle. The pectoralis muscle in the golden hamster is divided into four parts. The first and second elements insert upon the deltoid crest of the humerus while the third and fourth elements are inserted slightly higher on the shaft, head and tuberosities of the humerus. The laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) has a xiphihumeralis that inserts upon the coracoid process of the scapula. The wood rat (Howell, 1926) is very similar to the hamster in the morphology of the pectoralis muscle. Parsons (1894 and 1896) describes a fourth part arising from some of the true ribs and inserting onto the shoulder capsule. Bensley (1938) reports that in the rabbit there is a pectoral element running from the sternum to the spine of the scapula. In the hamster and the wood rat the epitrochlearis runs between the latissimus dorsi and the inner elbow. In both animals it is a ribbon-like muscle and has a muscular origin and insertion. In the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) the epitrochlearis is more compressed and has a tendinous origin and ins ertion. Bensley (1938) and Parsons (1894 and 1896) do not report this muscle. The biceps brachii in the golden hamster has two heads as is characteristic of the Myoraorpha (Parsons, 1896). The insertion of the biceps brachii varies slightly in the different animals of this study. In the pocket gopher (Hollinger, 1916) it inserts on the ulna. The insertion of the biceps brachii in the laboratory rat (Greene, 1935) is similar to that in the hamster, which is on the radius. The wood rat (Howell, 1926) is identical with the hamster. In the kangeroo rat (Howell, 1932) the two heads remain separate and the long head inserts upon the ulna while the short head inserts on the radius...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the order}} Carnivora, the {{phylogeny}} {{of the red}} panda (Ailurus fulgens) is contentious, with morphological and molecular studies supporting {{a wide range of}} possible relationships, including close ties to procyonids, ursids, mustelids and mephitids. This study provides additional morphological data, including muscle maps, for the forelimb of Ailurus, based on the dissection of four cadavers from the National Zoological Park, Washington, DC, USA. The red panda forelimb is characterized by a number of primitive features, including the lack of m. <b>rhomboideus</b> profundus, a humeral insertion for m. cleidobrachialis, the presence of mm. brachioradialis, articularis humeri and coracobrachialis, a single muscle belly for m. extensor digitorum lateralis with tendons to digits III–V, four mm. lumbricales, and the presence of mm. flexor digitorum brevis manus, adductores digiti I, II and V, and abductor digiti I and V. Red pandas resemble Ailuropoda, mustelids and some procyonids in possessing a soft tissue origin of m. flexor digitorum superficialis. In addition, red pandas are similar to ursids and procyonids in having a variable presence of m. biceps brachii caput breve. Furthermore, Ailurus and some ursids lack m. <b>rhomboideus</b> capitis.

40|$|Published online by Cambridge University Press 09 Mar 2007 Energy intake profoundly {{influences}} many endocrine axes {{which in}} turn {{play a central role}} in development. The specific influence of a short period of mild hypothyroidism, similar to that induced by undernutrition, in regulating muscle development has been assessed in a large mammal during early postnatal life. Hypothyroidism was induced by providing methimazole and iopanoic acid in the feed of piglets between 4 and 14 d of age, and controls were pair-fed to the energy intake of their hypothyroid littermates. Thyroid status was evaluated, and myofibre differentiation and cation pump concentrations were then assessed in the following functionally distinct muscles: longissimus dorsi (l. dorsi), soleus and <b>rhomboideus.</b> Reductions in plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T 4; 32 %, P < O·Ol), triiodothyronine (T 3; 48 %, P < 0 · 001), free T 3, (58 %, P < 0 · 001) and hepatic 5 '-monodeiodinase (EC 1. 11. 1. 8) activity (74 %, P < 0 · 001) occurred with treatment. Small, although significant, increases in the proportion of type I slow-twitch oxidative fibres occurred with mild hypothyroidism, in l. dorsi (2 %, P < 0 · 01) and soleus(7 %, P < 0 · 01). Nuclear T 3 -receptor concentration in l. dorsi of hypothyroid animals compared with controls increased by 46 % (P < 0 · 001), a response that may represent a homeostatic mechanism making muscle more sensitive to low levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Nevertheless, Na+, K+-ATPase (EC 3. 6. 1. 37) concentration was reduced by 15 – 16 % in all muscles (l. dorsi P< 0 · 05,soleus P < 0 · 001, <b>rhomboideus</b> P < 0 · 05), and Ca 2 +-ATPase (EC 3. 6. 1. 38) concentration was significantly reduced in the two slow-twitch muscles: by 22 % in <b>rhomboideus</b> (P < 0 · 001) and 23 % in soleus (P < 0 · 05). It is concluded that during early postnatal development of large mammals a period of mild hypothyroidism, comparable with that found during undernutrition, induces changes in myofibre differentiation and a down-regulation of cation pumps in skeletal muscle. Such changes would result in slowness of movement and muscle weakness, and also reduce ATP hydrolysis with a concomitant improvement in energetic efficiency. A. P. Harrison, D. R. Tivey, T.

40|$|The {{domestication}} {{process of}} pigs {{was associated with}} substantial morphological and physiological changes. The {{aim of this study}} was to comparatively investigate muscle microstructure and biochemical properties of four different skeletal muscles (M. longissimus, M. semitendinosus, M. psoas major, M. <b>rhomboideus)</b> in growing domestic pigs (n= 5) and wild boars (n= 4). The superiority of domestic pigs in body and muscle growth at three months of age was reflected by a 4 -fold body weight and higher absolute weights of heart, liver and muscles. Relative muscle weights of M. psoas major and M. <b>rhomboideus</b> were reduced, whereas a 1. 6 -fold heavier M. semitendinosus was observed in domestic pigs compared with wild boars. In addition, the muscle cross-sectional area was greater in all muscles of domestic pigs resulting from about 3 -fold fibre cross-sectional area, whereas total fibre number remained unchanged. As a consequence of intensified fibre hypertrophy, the fibre area per capillary is higher in all muscles of domestic pigs. Thus, the impaired supply with oxygen and nutrients may be one reason for the shift to the glycolytic muscle metabolism as indicated by a greater proportion of fast-twitch glycolytic fibres at the expense of fast-twitch oxidative fibres. This is also reflected by a higher ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Our data suggest that the intensified muscle growth was realized by myofibre hypertrophy at unchanged myofibre number in growing domestic pigs. It seems that domestication-induced changes were most pronounced in M. semitendinosus as the exterior ham muscle which may be related to muscle specific selection for lean growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{feeding of}} {{ruminants}} in the Democratic Republic of Congo {{is based on}} the use of natural vegetation. This vegetation is characterised by grasses and rarely legumes. In addition to this, the lack of legumes {{in the southern part of}} the country means that the dry season becomes longer (over 6 months). This leads farmers with the financial means, to use commercial foods, most of which are imported. Grasses which form the basis of forage remain as straws in the dry season. They have a digestibility of less than 45 %, and are very low in nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as other minerals, which further limits their feed intake (Chenost and Kayouli 1997; Jarrige 1987). The use of locally available protein banks to supplement poor foods is therefore essential. In the same region, soils are increasingly contaminated with heavy metals from mining activities. The choice of sustainable and high protein plant species should be dictated by their adaptation to environmental conditions, including high levels of heavy metals in soil. They must also be adapted to the long dry season and provide fodder throughout the year. Among the species encountered, Adenodolichos <b>rhomboideus</b> is the most resistant to drought and is widespread in the region (INEAC 1954). It grows on normal soil or that contaminated by heavy metals (Faucon 2009; Meerts 2008 and Tshibangu et al 2014 c). Two other species, Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guianensis are durable and are used in ruminant diets, but are neither widespread nor adapted to the contaminated soil Tshibangu et al 2014 ab. The objective of this study was to compare the use of A. <b>rhomboideus,</b> L. leucocephala and S. guianensis forage as a complement to grass hay on the growth of local goats at Lubumbashi.

Researches have been done to characterize meat quality through the chemical composition of three muscles from some bovines races specialized on milk and meat production, by gender, which have not been subjected to a process of conditioning before slaughter.  Rhomboideus, Longossimus dorsi and Triceps brachial muscles were characterized by protein and lipid composition.  Protein content ranged from 20. 8 % in <b>Rhomboideus</b> muscle from the males of Fleickveih breed and 21. 83 % in Longissimus dorsi muscle obtained at the same sex but at Pinzgauer race. The fat content varied in wide limits around 3 %. Analysis of chemical composition of meat revealed the influence of sex, race, anatomical positioning of the muscle. Meat obtained has a poor quality, which revealed the need of refurbishment of these animals before slaughter...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. The <b>Rhomboideus</b> {{muscle is}} made up of the Rhomboid minor and Rhomboid major muscles. The {{collective}} term for theses two separate muscles is commonly referred to as the Rhomboid muscle (Moore, 1999). For {{the purpose of this study}} the term Rhomboid muscle will also be referring to the two separate muscles as one, namely the Rhomboid muscle or the Rhomboids. Rhomboid trigger points are one of the main causes of inter-scapular pain because the referral pattern of this muscle is on the medial border of the scapula (Smith, Padgett and Kaufmann, Harrington, An and Irby, 2004). Articular dysfunction associated with Rhomboid trigger points can involve any of the spinal segments from C 7 to T 5 usually two or three segments are involved. It is therefore, evident that Rhomboid trigger points in conjunction with articular dysfunction can thus be the primary cause of inter-scapular pain (Travell and Simons, 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|Melese Abdisa Yadata and Markos Tibbo are ILRI authorsThe {{objective}} of this work was to assess sensory quality and retail life of Horro beef muscles in Ethiopia. Six muscles: M. <b>rhomboideus</b> (RM), M. infraspinatus (IS), M. longissimus lumborum (LL), M. semimembranosus (SM), M. biceps femoris (BF) and M. rectus femoris (RF) were considered. Sensory quality of the muscles was rated by a 9 -member trained panel for palatability, tenderness, juiciness, amount of connective tissue (ACT), lean color and surface discoloration and measured by Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF). Retail life of the six muscles were evaluated for CIE 1976 L*a*b* color values across 6 days. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) between muscles for all sensory attributes and WBSF were found. Significant L*a*b* color values of muscles and USDA quality grades by retail life were found (p < 0. 05). Significant correlations (p < 0. 05 or p < 0. 01) of key parameters were also identified...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the features of satellite cells and other adult stem cells in skeletal muscle. Satellite cells are located between the basal membrane and the sarcolemma of each muscle fiber. First, we developed a mode! based on muscle satellite cell c ulture to investigate the regulation of adult Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC) isoform expression in pig muscle. Satellite cells were harvested from the mostly fast-twitch glycolytic longissimus (LM) muscle collected at the fast rib leve!, and the predominantly slow-twitch oxidative <b>rhomboideus</b> (RM) muscle of 6 -week-old piglets. Then, we investigated more extensively the features of ali adult stem cells in both muscles of growing and adult pigs using flow cytometry. The first study demonstrated that satellite cells from LM and RM only expressed the embryonic and fetal MyHC isoforms in ce li culture, without any of the adult MyHC isoforms expressed in vivo. The second study clearly indicated that adult stem cells from pig skeletal muscles expressed a panel of stem ce li markers exhibiting age-related changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{proximate}} {{chemical composition}} of hump, known in Brazil as cupim, <b>Rhomboideus</b> m. (RB), of Nelore (Bos indicus) aged 24 months revealed {{it to be}} a unique beef muscle. It presents a lipid fraction 14 -fold as high as that of Longissimus dorsi m. (LD) taken from the same animal (p< 0. 05), the highest value reported so far. This was unequivocally observed by the histological evaluation. Proportionally more protein fraction and conversely less moisture were also observed in RB. Analysis of collagen and its crosslinking with hydroxylysylpyridinium (HP) showed there to be 22. 9 % more collagen and 14 -fold as much HP in RB as in LD. Contrary to the expectations, the tenderness of fresh samples evaluated by Warner Bratzler shear force measurements led to values of 8. 05 and 5. 81 kgf for LD and RB, respectively (p< 0. 05). These results showed that the abundant fat in fresh RB acted as a lubricant for the needle penetration, irrespective of {{the quantity and quality of}} collagen fibres present...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn pigs, {{the optimal}} {{utilization}} of energy substrates within muscle fibers {{is a prerequisite}} {{of the utmost importance}} for successful adaptation to extra-uterine life. In the present work we demonstrate that fatty acid (FA) oxidative capacities increased within the first five days of life in piglet skeletal muscle. Mitochondrial FA oxidation capacities increased more in the <b>rhomboideus</b> oxidative than in the longissimus lumborum glycolytic muscle (+ 114 % vs. + 62 %, P $<$ 0. 001). The apparent rate of fatty acid degradation by peroxisomes represents 30 to 40 % of total FA oxidation capacities and increased by about 170 % (P $<$ 0. 001) with age in both muscles. The postnatal enhancement of skeletal muscle oxidative capacities was further supported by a rise in acid-soluble and long-chain acylcarnitine tissue levels (+ 67 %, P $<$ 0. 01), and plasma levels of albumin (+ 160 %, P $<$ 0. 001). Cold stress had no effect on mitochondrial and peroxisomal FA oxidation but greatly enhanced (+ 61 %, P $<$ 0. 05) the circulating levels of non-esterified fatty acids at five days of life...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe forelimbs {{of higher}} {{vertebrates}} {{are composed of}} two portions: the appendicular region (stylopod, zeugopod and autopod) and the less prominent proximal girdle elements (scapula and clavicle) that brace the limb to the main trunk axis. We show that {{the formation of the}} muscles of the proximal limb occurs through two distinct mechanisms. The more superficial girdle muscles (pectoral and latissimus dorsi) develop by the “In–Out” mechanism whereby migration of myogenic cells from the somites into the limb bud is followed by their extension from the proximal limb bud out onto the thorax. In contrast, the deeper girdle muscles (e. g. <b>rhomboideus</b> profundus and serratus anterior) are induced by the forelimb field which promotes myotomal extension directly from the somites. Tbx 5 inactivation demonstrated its requirement for the development of all forelimb elements which include the skeletal elements, proximal and distal muscles as well as the sternum in mammals and the cleithrum of fish. Intriguingly, the formation of the diaphragm musculature is also dependent on the Tbx 5 programme. These observations challenge our classical views of the boundary between limb and trunk tissues. We suggest that significant structures located in the body should be considered as components of the forelimb...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} the superior colliculus (SC) {{is involved in the}} initiation and execution of forelimb movements. In the present study we investigated the tectofugal, in particular the tecto-reticulo-spinal projections to the shoulder and arm muscles in the rat. We simultaneously retrogradely labelled the premotor neurons in the brainstem by injection of the pseudorabies virus PrV Bartha 614 into the m. <b>rhomboideus</b> minor and m. acromiodeltoideus, and anterogradely visualized the tectofugal projections by intracollicular injection of the tracer FITC dextrane. Our results demonstrate that the connection of the SC to the skeletal muscles of the forelimb is at least trisynaptic. This was confirmed by long survival times after virus injections into the muscles (98 - 101 h) after which numerous neurons in the deep layers of the SC were labelled. Transsynaptically retrogradely labelled brainstem neurons connected disynaptically to the injected muscles with adjacent tectal terminals were predominantly located in the gigantocellular nuclear complex of the reticular formation. In addition, putative relay neurons were found in the caudal part of the pontine reticular nucleus. Both tectal projections to the nucleus gigantocellularis and the pontine reticular nucleus were bilateral but ipsilaterally biased. We suggest this projection to be involved in more global functions in motivated behaviour like general arousal allowing fast voluntary motor activity...|$|E

From zero to eight parasites {{were found in}} 98 percent of the B. brevicauda. From zero to five parasites were found in 92 percent of the S. cinereus. Longistriata depressa, Porrocaecum americanum, P. encapsulatum, Capillaria blarinae, Protogynella sp., Hymenolepis anthocephalus, Panopistus pricei, Entosiphonus thompsoni, Brachylaima <b>rhomboideus,</b> Trichuris sp., Parastrongyloides winchesi, and a larval spirurid nematode, probably Physaloptera limbata, parasitized B. brevicauda. Larval nematodes, which may be Angiostrongylus michiganensis were abundant in the digestive and respiratory tracts. B. brevicauda also contained a minute, unidentifiable nematode from the small intestine. Tapeworms from four different B. brevicauda were in such poor condition as to make positive identification difficult. These were probably H. blarinae. H. parva; H. serrula; H. faculata; H, longi; two different unidentifiable hymenolepids; P. americanum; P. encapsulatum; A. michiganensis; Pseudophysaloptera formosana soricina; L. depressa; P, pricei; C. rauschi; P. winchesi; larval capillarid nematodes from the liver, probably C. hepatica; and three small unidentifiable nematodes parasitized S. cinereus. First reports include: P. winchesi in an American Sorex sp., Trichuris sp. from the intestine of B. brevicauda, P, pricei in S. cinereus, and larval capillarids, possibly C. hepatica, from the liver of S. cinereus.
