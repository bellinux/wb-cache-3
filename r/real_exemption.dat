5000|$|When {{asked for}} comment, Sarah M. King, the President General of the DAR, told the Washington Post that the DAR's {{chapters}} have autonomy in determining members.

5000|$|Bainum's {{political}} career {{is best known}} for his successful efforts to end special tax breaks for private clubs, such as the all-male Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. Bainum and his sister, Barbara Bainum, filed a lawsuit against the club. In 1984, as a result of the lawsuit, a Montgomery County, Maryland, judge ruled that Burning Tree must give up its $186,000 yearly <b>real</b> estate tax <b>exemption</b> if it does not allow women. In 1986, legislation he sponsored that barred private clubs that exclude women from receiving state tax breaks became law. This effort earned him “the hostility of Washington’s politico-golfing community”. As a Maryland lawmaker, Bainum sponsored a child support bill to require employers to deduct court-ordered payments, similar to how taxes are deducted, as well as legislation requiring public officials to disclose withdrawals from failed savings and loans, increase penalties for illegal handgun use, make information public on toxic substances and hazardous waste, increase fees on heavy trucks to offset road repair costs, and tax relief for low-income tenants.|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} the self-managing {{democracy}} in a large town consists in the workers 2 ̆ 7 self-management of the surplus labour. A town originated in the surplus of agricultural products; it was developing as an institution of the handicraft and industrial surplus labour, and consequently, the establishing of the workers 2 ̆ 7 self-management {{by means of the}} surplus labour is, in fact, the original self-management with a town. A worker is no more exposed to the economic chaos being caused by the town industry privately organized. The novelty, emerging from it, has been the passing of the surplus labour from the shell of the private property (profit, income, interest) into the social, public sphere, by means of the self-managing democracy. The novelty consists {{in the fact that the}} production in towns, out of the form of wage slavery, has been transformed into the liberty in the sphere of the decision making about labour, to grow later into the practice of labour exemption. Self-decision making is considered to be a shorter way to the <b>real</b> labour <b>exemption.</b> A town is a manufacturing unit and a self-managing form of that decision making. In a self-managing town the majority of the social energy the worker-managers still spend on pushing back the capital-relationship by means of the governing of manufacturers that is being established. If methodically observed, the manufacturers have thus been introduced in the political system of self-managing. They have gained victory in the ideological forms, but they have not really governed the division of labour. Not only haven 2 ̆ 7 t they governed the division of labour but, it has governed them. They are forced to perform just one single social activity if they do not want to lose their life resources. The town communities also find themselves in such a position. Each of them has a definite sphere of activity it is attached to. The change of specialized town activity would have a disastrous meaning for the rhythm of the total production; it would cause disturbances in the harmony of supply and demand and alike. The fixation of a town to a particular economic activity necessarily causes their mutual collaboration. With the greater economic specialization in towns, the stronger mutual collaboration must be present in order to satisfy the many-sided needs of the workers and citizens. That collaboration takes place by means of the self-managing agreement as well as the social agreement, through federal and republic laws and else, which makes the content of the self-managing democracy in large towns...|$|R
5000|$|One {{source of}} {{controversy}} is how same-sex marriage affects freedom of religion. [...] There is concern that religious communities {{might not be}} legally able to decide what type of marriages to solemnize. [...] Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs. Opponents of same-sex marriage have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms. [...] For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing. Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status. [...] In addition, religious opponents of same-sex marriage express concern about several specific instances in which they contend that religious freedoms have been abridged due to legal recognition of same-sex unions, including (a) an incident in Canada (which is subject to {{a different set of}} laws concerning same-sex marriage than the United States), in which the Knights of Columbus were sued for declining to allow a same-sex wedding reception on their property; (b) removal of <b>real</b> property tax <b>exemption</b> from a New Jersey Christian organization that did not allow a civil union ceremony to be performed on their property; (c) requirements that judges and justices of the peace perform same-sex wedding ceremonies; and (d) the forced closing of Catholic adoption agencies which refused to place children in the homes of married same-sex partners.|$|R
