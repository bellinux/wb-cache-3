50|$|A <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> holder {{is used to}} hold Test Tubes. It is {{used for}} holding a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> in place when the tube is hot or should not be touched. For example, a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> holder {{can be used to}} hold a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> while it is being heated. Moreover, when heating the tube with liquid or solid {{contained}} inside, the tube holder ought to tightly hold a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> in order for the tube to be safely held while heating.|$|R

50|$|Test tube rack is a {{laboratory}} equipment {{that is used}} to hold upright multiple <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> at the same time. It is most commonly used when various different solutions are needed to work with simultaneously, for safety reasons, for safe storage of <b>test</b> <b>tubes,</b> and to ease the transport of multiple tubes. Test tube racks also ease the organizing of <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> and provide support for the <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> being worked with.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm for designing the equilibrium base-pairing properties of a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> of interacting nucleic acid strands. A target <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> is specified {{as a set}} of desired “on-target” complexes, each with a target secondary structure and target concentration, and a set of undesired “off-target” complexes, each with vanishing target concentration. Sequence design is performed by optimizing the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect, corresponding to the concentration of incorrectly paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of the <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> To reduce the computational cost of accepting or rejecting mutations to a random initial sequence, the structural ensemble of each on-target complex is hierarchically decomposed into a tree of conditional subensembles, yielding a forest of decomposition trees. Candidate sequences are evaluated efficiently at the leaf level of the decomposition forest by estimating the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect from conditional physical properties calculated over the leaf subensembles. As optimized subsequences are merged toward the root level of the forest, any emergent defects are eliminated via ensemble redecomposition and sequence reoptimization. After successfully merging subsequences to the root level, the exact <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect is calculated for the first time, explicitly checking for the effect of the previously neglected off-target complexes. Any off-target complexes that form at appreciable concentration are hierarchically decomposed, added to the decomposition forest, and actively destabilized during subsequent forest reoptimization. For target <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> representative of design challenges in the molecular programming and synthetic biology communities, our <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> design algorithm typically succeeds in achieving a normalized <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect ≤ 1 % at a design cost within an order of magnitude of the cost of <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> analysis...|$|R

30|$|For {{the test}} of {{parasite}} eggs detection, initially, half a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> was filled with zinc sulfate solution.

30|$|If an AD is effective, it {{will keep}} {{asphaltenes}} in the solution {{and there are no}} asphaltene agglomerate particles. Therefore, the mean transmittance remains constant along the Turbiscan <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> (Fig.  2 a). For semi-stability mixtures, the received light varies with time (Fig.  2 b). For ineffective ADs, agglomeration occurs and asphaltene particles deposit {{at the bottom of the}} <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> Hence, the mean transmittance increases towards the top of the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> as the upper part of the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> becomes less dense (Fig.  2 c). In this case, the change in the stability of the fluid depends mostly on the fluid characteristics.|$|R

The <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> containing 4  mL of sterile TSB were inoculated with 0.5  mL of overnight bacterial culture (108 CFU/mL). Biosurfactant at different concentrations (from 0.10 to 100.0  mg/mL) was taken in sterile phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.0) and added to the <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> containing different bacterial pathogens. The final volume in each <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> was adjusted to 5  mL with TSB. A <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> without bacterial strain and a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> without biosurfactant were also prepared and used as negative and growth controls, respectively. Tubes were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C. After incubation, the absorbance at 600  nm of each tube was measured using a spectrophotometer (UV- 1800, Shimadzu, USA). MIC was determined for each strain as the lowest concentration of biosurfactant that completely inhibited measurable growth (A 600 [*]=[*] 0).|$|R

30|$|Minimum {{inhibitory}} concentration {{is defined as}} the minimum concentration of the material that inhibits the growth of the particular microorganisms. The method is based on growing microorganisms at varying concentrations of AgNPs in suspension. Sterile <b>test</b> <b>tubes,</b> containing 5 [*]ml of Luria-Bertani broth were taken. In the <b>test</b> <b>tubes,</b> varying concentrations of AgNPs were added and one <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> was taken as control. Then, the <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> including the control were inoculated with an equal volume (200 [*]μl) of freshly prepared bacterial suspension diluted to an optical density of 0.5. The inoculated <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> were incubated in a shaker incubator at 250 [*]rpm and 37 [*]°C for 24 [*]h. The next day, absorbance was taken using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 600 [*]nm, and the graph was plotted against optical density and the concentration of AgNPs. The concentration giving the least optical density corresponds to MIC of silver nanoparticles for that particular microorganism. The above method is repeated with all the three microorganisms, namely E. coli, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.|$|R
