40|$|James C. Hoe, Assistant Professor of ECE Due {{to growing}} {{complexity}} {{and costs of}} hardware systems, computer architects traditionally rely on software simulation to evaluate new designs. Although software simulation excels in convenience and flexibility, it suffers from prohibitively long turnaround time. Researchers are constantly searching for methods to accelerate software simulations. SMARTS is a framework that uses rigorous statistical sam-pling to accelerate simulation time without sacrificing accuracy. Its turnaround time {{is limited by the}} speed of the functional warming mode, which updates architectural state and select microarchitectural structures. This paper presents direct warming as an efficient technique for accelerating functional warming. Direct warming extends direct execution, in which the simulated program code is executed natively on the host machine hardware rather than through emulation. To achieve identical simulation behavior to func-tional warming, direct warming integrates instrumentation code for <b>record</b> <b>generation</b> into the direct execu-tion code. In this paper, we investigate and analyze several implementation alternatives to maximize the performance of direct warming by evaluating a collection of benchmarks on the RSIM simulator. On aver-age, Direct SMARTS achieves a 96 x speedup over full detailed simulation, with a maximum speedup o...|$|E
40|$|By definition, Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) {{addresses}} all {{facets of}} industrial business, from marketing planning through engineering to manufacturing final inspection and shipment. Computer Aided Design (CAD) is meant to assist {{the front end of}} the product life-cycle and to focus on engineering, design, and drafting-related activities. An integration of the two systems is proposed, founded on a data base level. Sample features of the integrated system include automatic part master <b>record</b> <b>generation,</b> product structure initiation and engineering change control via pictorial information. A multi-database interoperability approach is expected to develop the necessary theoretical background to support this project. The definition of a language to specify update dependencies and the communications protocol will be the means to implement the proposed integration. Eventually, a fast interpreter and the relational database system will provide the vehicle for this and future projects. It is estimated that a large number of companies already using or planning to use MRP II and CAD will beneflt substantially from such an integrated set which ensures a smooth and effective flow of information. Future plans include the establishment of more links between MRP II and CAM, CAT, and Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP), all of them leading to the ultimate goal of using a single Computer Integrated Manufacturing System...|$|E
40|$|Single-photon sources {{based on}} optical {{parametric}} processes {{have been used}} extensively for quantum information applications due to their flexibility, room-temperature operation and potential for photonic integration. However, the intrinsically probabilistic nature of these sources is a major limitation for realizing large-scale quantum networks. Active feedforward switching of photons from multiple probabilistic sources is a promising approach {{that can be used}} to build a deterministic source. However, previous implementations of this approach that utilize spatial and/or temporal multiplexing suffer from rapidly increasing switching losses when scaled to a large number of modes. Here, we break this limitation via frequency multiplexing in which the switching losses remain fixed irrespective of the number of modes. We use the third-order nonlinear process of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing as an efficient ultra-low noise frequency switch and demonstrate multiplexing of three frequency modes. We achieve a <b>record</b> <b>generation</b> rate of 4. 6 × 10 ^ 4 multiplexed photons per second with an ultra-low g^ 2 (0) = 0. 07, indicating high single-photon purity. Our scalable, all-fiber multiplexing system has a total loss of just 1. 3 dB independent of the number of multiplexed modes, such that the 4. 8 dB enhancement from multiplexing three frequency modes markedly overcomes switching loss. Our approach offers a highly promising path to creating a deterministic photon source that can be integrated on a chip-based platform. Comment: 28 pages, 9 figures. Comments welcom...|$|E

30|$|Clustering is {{a popular}} {{approach}} taken by researchers to detect botnets using flow based features. Zeidanloo et al. have proposed a botnet detection framework that can detect botnets without prior knowledge of them by finding similar communication patterns and behaviors among the group of hosts that are performing at least one malicious activity using X-means clustering [21]. Using Audit <b>Record</b> <b>Generation</b> and Utilization System (ARGUS) [22], the authors have collected flow based information such as source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, duration, protocol, number of packets, and number of bytes transferred in both directions, which are later used to detect the group of hosts that exhibit similar behavior and communication pattern. Karasaridis et al. [23] have developed a K-means based method that employs scalable non-intrusive algorithms that analyze vast amounts of summary traffic data. Gu et al. [24] have proposed a novel anomaly-based botnet detection system that is independent of the protocol and structure used by botnets. This detection system has exploited the essential definition and properties of botnets, i.e., bots within the same botnet exhibit similar C&C communication patterns and similar malicious activities patterns. It utilizes a number of flow based information such as time, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, duration, {{and the number of}} packets and bytes transferred in both directions. A C-plane clustering method is used to read the communication logs generated by C plane monitor and finds clusters that share similar communication pattern. Arshad et al. [25] have developed an anomaly-based method that require not a priori knowledge of bot signatures, botnet C&C protocols, and the C&C server addresses. Flow characteristics such as IP, port, packet event times, and bytes per packet are examined by Amini et al. [26] to detect botnets where these NetFlow data is collected, filtered, and is finally clustered using hierarchical clustering. Rule based methods are then applied to refine the clusters to reduce the percentage of false positives.|$|E
40|$|Most {{scientific}} {{organizations have}} established bibliographic databases {{to collect and}} present the scholarly output generated by their researchers and research projects. Additional requirements arise from increasing OpenAccess requirements by funders more and more paired with direct data delivery (e. g. Horizon 2020). To alleviate the burden of administrative reporting JOIN² has broadened the scope of traditional OpenAccess repositories to include these additional, administrative data like funding, licencing, cost information (e. g. APC based Gold OpenAccess). Recent developments include DOI minting via DataCite and ORCiD integration. However, to fulfill all the detailed requirements {{a very high level}} of normalization is required, traditionally not available in Dublin Core based repositories. Based on invenio and the much broader Marc 21 meta data schema, JOIN² repositories implemented this normalization based on authority records right from the start. To this end JOIN² holds about 118. 000 authority records used by and interchanged between all partners. About 72. 000 of these refer to scientific journals that need to be updated once a year to reflect changes in statistical keys required for evaluation procedures. Currently operating seven independent, on site implementations in production, for JOIN² it is vitally important to implement a collaborative curation of these records and effective sharing mechanism to minimize the work for partners. For evaluation purposes, JOIN² is currently investigating the bibliographic subset of the upcoming national German evaluation schema Kerndatensatz Forschung (KDSF). Though, JOIN² was designed long before the discussion on this schema started, it turned out that almost all criteria can be met out of the box by means of JOIN²'s authority control mechanisms, while trouble usually results from flaws in the KDSF defintions and should be addressed there. Data delivery in CERIF formats may thus be a feature for future implementation. This poster will outline procedures for authority <b>record</b> <b>generation</b> and interchange between JOIN² partners as well as some usage scenarios implemented...|$|E
