25|$|Overhand right : The {{overhand}} {{right is}} a punch {{not found in}} every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the right cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand <b>right</b> <b>has</b> a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions Rocky Marciano and Tim Witherspoon, as well as MMA champions Chuck Liddell and Fedor Emelianenko. The overhand <b>right</b> <b>has</b> become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking.|$|E

Did I ever give you any right? Honest indeed! What <b>right</b> <b>have</b> you {{to talk to me about}} being honest?" ...|$|R

25|$|The {{argument}} over {{the existence of}} such a <b>right</b> <b>has</b> perpetuated the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and the failure of the peace process is due, in large part, to the inability of the two parties to achieve a solution with justice for both sides.|$|E
25|$|The vapor {{pressure}} chart to the <b>right</b> <b>has</b> graphs of the {{vapor pressure}}s versus temperatures {{for a variety}} of liquids. As {{can be seen in the}} chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.|$|E
25|$|Religion plays {{a smaller}} part in Pacific Northwest {{politics}} {{than in the}} rest of the United States. The religious <b>right</b> <b>has</b> considerably less political influence than in other regions. Political conservatives in the Pacific Northwest tend to identify more strongly with free-market libertarian values than they do with more religious social conservatives.|$|E

25|$|Depictions of {{the cross}} within the Orthodox Church are {{numerous}} and often highly ornamented, but its use does not extend to all Orthodox traditions. Some carry special significance. The Tri-Bar Cross, popular in Russia, Ukraine, and Belorussia, but common throughout the Orthodox world, seen to the <b>right,</b> <b>has</b> three bars. Its origins are in the early Byzantine Church of the 4th century AD.|$|E
25|$|Due {{diligence}} {{is required}} in making application for relief, and, {{in the absence of}} a valid excuse for delay, the petition will be denied. The mere naked allegation that a constitutional <b>right</b> <b>has</b> been invaded will not suffice. The application should make a full disclosure of specific facts relied upon and not merely state conclusions as to the nature of such facts.|$|E
25|$|The writ is {{available}} {{where there is}} no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ {{even in the face of}} an alternative remedy (see May v Ferndale Institution). Under the Criminal Code the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this <b>right</b> <b>has</b> been exercised.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, but that's not {{the whole}} question,' Ernest answered, looking at the curate fixedly. 'What <b>right</b> <b>have</b> you and I to spend so much when others are wanting for bread? And what <b>right</b> <b>have</b> you or I to make other people work at {{producing}} these useless trinkets for our sole selfish gratification?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stared in}} wonder {{at his own}} wife as she told him his own heart so callously. And he was indignant. What <b>right</b> <b>had</b> she to sit there telling him these things? She was his wife, what <b>right</b> <b>had</b> she {{to speak to him}} like this, {{as if she were a}} stranger.|$|R

25|$|In the 1950s, {{as part of}} {{the larger}} Civil Rights Movement, {{interest}} emerged in giving DC full representation. As a compromise, the Twenty-third Amendment was adopted in 1961, granting the District a number of votes in the Electoral College in measure to their population, but no more than the smallest state. This <b>right</b> <b>has</b> been exercised by DC residents since the presidential election of 1964.|$|E
25|$|Pournelle {{was one of}} the few {{close friends}} of H. Beam Piper and was granted by Piper the rights to produce stories set in Piper's Terro-Human Future History. This <b>right</b> <b>has</b> been {{recognized}} by the Piper estate. Pournelle worked for some years on a sequel to Space Viking but seems to have abandoned this in the early 1990s, however John F. Carr intends its completion for release in 2018.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Right</b> <b>has</b> {{gone through}} five {{distinct}} historical stages: (I) the reactionary right sought {{a return to}} aristocracy and established religion; (II) the moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government; (III) the radical right favored a romantic and aggressive nationalism; (IV) the extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism; and (V) the neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional Right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.|$|E

25|$|At the 2000 show, Atkin {{announced}} that the music conglomerate BMG, which had acquired the RCA catalogue and <b>rights,</b> <b>had</b> finally released the master recordings for the final four of his albums. They were subsequently re-released on CD {{in the same fashion}} as the first two, whose <b>rights</b> <b>had</b> been owned by a different company.|$|R
6000|$|His quiet tone {{instantly}} infuriated the ruffian. Shaking {{his fist}} {{close to the}} ranger's nose, he shouted: [...] "I'll do for you, you loafer! What <b>right</b> <b>had</b> you to arrest them kids? What <b>right</b> <b>had</b> you to help them witnesses to the train? You're off your beat, and you'd better climb right back again." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{game on the}} <b>right</b> <b>has</b> two players: 1 and 2. The numbers {{by every}} non-terminal node {{indicate}} to which player that decision node belongs. The numbers by every terminal node represent the payoffs to the players (e.g. 2,1 represents a payoff of 2 to player 1 and a payoff of 1 to player 2). The labels by every edge of the graph are {{the name of the}} action that edge represents.|$|E
25|$|Progress has {{occurred}} primarily in cases recently {{filed with the}} Mexican Central Authority. The six cases raised by the U.S. delegation in the Binational Commission meetings illustrate the delays in cases when {{the location of the}} child is not known and/or an amparo appeal (a provision of the Mexican Constitution where a claim is made that a civil <b>right</b> <b>has</b> been violated) is filed. There has been progress in one of those cases.|$|E
25|$|Officially, second-generation Americans are U.S. {{citizens}} by birth. U.S. {{citizenship is}} guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; but political debate over repealing this <b>right</b> <b>has</b> increased in recent years. Advocates of this motion {{claim that this}} right attracts unauthorized immigration to the U.S. The repeal of birthright citizenship would have {{the greatest impact on}} second-generation Americans who are Mexican Americans, as Mexico is the country of origin for the majority of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Yes, it’s true: Workers are human, {{they are}} not commodities, {{they are not}} factors of production. People with an {{interest}} in human rights should therefore be as interested in the oppression of workers as they in the oppression of people of colour or women or disabled people. But labour rights and human rights are not easily collapsed into a single category. Labour <b>rights</b> <b>have</b> historically been framed as collective, human rights as individual, labour rights are class-based, human rights claim to be universal in their justification and application. Labour <b>rights</b> <b>have</b> generally been vindicated through economic and political action, human <b>rights</b> <b>have</b> been advanced through cultural and social change and, more recently, through litigation. Labour has tended to assert its rights {{at the level of the}} workplace and the nation state, human rights movements in recent years have tended to be trans-national. And a point of some importance: Labour <b>rights</b> <b>have</b> tended to be marginalized in the shaping of the new global economic order, while human <b>rights</b> <b>have</b> been embraced by adherents of the Washington consensus as both a precondition and consequence of global capitalism...|$|R
