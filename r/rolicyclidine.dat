The best known of these are <b>rolicyclidine</b> (PCPy or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine); eticyclidine (PCE or N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine); and tenocyclidine (TCP or 1-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine). Only of {{a few of these}} compounds were widely used.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rolicyclidine</b> (PCPy) is a dissociative {{anesthetic}} drug with hallucinogenic and sedative effects. It {{is similar}} in effects to phencyclidine but is slightly less potent and has less stimulant effects [...] instead producing a sedative effect described as being somewhat similar to a barbiturate, but with additional PCP-like dissociative, anaesthetic and hallucinogenic effects. Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, PCPy was placed into the Schedule I list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although {{it has never been}} widely abused and is now little known.|$|E
