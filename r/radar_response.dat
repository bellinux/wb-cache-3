50|$|Introducing {{a unique}} {{identification}} would enable Enhanced RADAR positioning through {{the ability to}} correlate the <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> of a RACON with the known position of that RACON.

40|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed in the literature to invert radar measurements to estimate surface soil moisture. The objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the performance of the most common surface back scattering models including the theoretical integral equation model (IEM) of Fung et al. (1992), and the semi-empirical models of Oh et al. (1992, 1994, 2002 and 2004) and Dubois et al. (1995). This analysis uses four AIRSAR data in L and C band together with in situ measurements (soil moisture and surface roughness) over bare soil and vegetation covers area and three different soil depths. The results show that Dubois model tend to over-estimate the <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> in both bands while IEM model and Oh model frequently over-estimate the <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> in L band but under-estimate them in C band. By evaluating of all models in different soil depths, the best results were obtained in 0 – 3 cm depths. For vegetation area poor correlation between models backscatter simulation and <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> was observed...|$|E
40|$|Between 1000 and 2000 {{infrared}} (eclipse) and radar anomalies {{have been}} mapped on the nearside hemisphere of the moon. A study of 52 of these anomalies indicates that most {{are related to}} impact craters and {{that the nature of}} the infrared and <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> is compatible with a previously developed geologic model of crater aging processes. The youngest craters are pronounced thermal and radar anomalies; that is, they have enhanced eclipse temperatures and are strong radar scatterers. With increasing crater age, the associated thermal and <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> become progressively less noticeable until they assume values for the average lunar surface. The last type of anomaly to disappear is radar enhancement at longer wavelengths. A few craters, however, have infrared and radar behaviors not predicted by the aging model. One previously unknown feature - a field strewn with centimeter-sized rock fragments - has been identified by this technique of comparing maps at the infrared, radar, and visual wavelengths...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiative}} transfer theory {{is applied to}} interpret polarimetric radar backscatter from pine forest with clustered vegetation structures. The scattering function of each cluster is calculated by incorporating the phase interference of scattered fields from each component. The resulting phase matrix {{is used in the}} {{radiative transfer}} equations to evaluate the polarimetric backscattering coefficients from random medium layers embedded with vegetation clusters. Upon including multiscale structures (trunks, primary and secondary branches, and needles), polarimetric <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> from pine forest for different frequencies and looking angles are interpreted and simulated. Preliminary results are shown to be in good agreement with the measured backscattering coefficients at the Landes maritime pine forest during the MAESTRO- 1 experiment...|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} predict the radar {{backscattering}} coefficient from crops must include the geometry of the canopy. Radar and ground-truth data taken on wheat in 1979 indicate that the model must include contributions from the leaves, from the wheat head, and from the soil moisture. For sorghum and corn, radar and ground-truth data obtained in 1979 and 1980 support {{the necessity of a}} soil moisture term and a leaf water term. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an appropriate input for the leaf contribution to the <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> for wheat and sorghum, however the LAI generates less accurate values for the backscattering coefficient for corn.

Seasat synthetic-aperture radar images of small terrestrial craters at high resolution (about 25 m) and Soviet Venera images of comparatively large Venusian craters at low resolution (1000 to 2000 m) and shorter wavelength show comparable <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> to crater morphology. At low incidence angles, {{it is difficult to}} locate the precise position of crater rims on images, while at higher incidence angles, images show less distortion of crater morphology. Magellan will obtain images through a range of incidence angles varying from about 45 deg at low latitudes to 16 deg at polar latitudes.

40|$|Freeze-thaw (FT) and {{moisture}} dynamics within the soil active layer are critical elements of boreal, arctic and alpine ecosystems, and environmental change assessments. We evaluated {{the potential for}} detecting dielectric changes within different soil layers using combined L- and P-band radar remote sensing as a prerequisite for detecting FT {{and moisture}} profile changes within the soil active layer. A two-layer scattering model was developed and validated for simulating <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> from vertically inhomogeneous soil. The model simulations indicated that inhomogeneity in the soil dielectric profile contributes to both L- and P-band backscatter, but with greater P-band sensitivity at depth. The difference in L- and P-band responses to soil dielectric profile inhomogeneity appears suitable for detecting associated changes in soil active layer conditions. Additional evaluation using collocated airborne radar (AIRSAR) observations and in situ soil moisture measurements over alpine tundra indicates that combined L- and P-band SAR observations are sensitive to soil dielectric profile heterogeneity associated with variations in soil moisture and FT conditions...|$|R
40|$|The images {{obtained}} by the Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR) -A and -B systems over the southwestern Egypt and northwestern Sudan were coregistered with the Landsat images and the existing maps to aid in extrapolations of the buried paleodrainages ('radar rivers'), first discovered by SIR-A. Field observations explain the <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> of three types of radar rivers, RR- 1 (broad, aggraded valleys filled with alluvium), RR- 2 (braided channels inset in the RR- 1 valleys), and RR- 3 (narrow, long, bedrock-incised channels). A generalized model of the radar rivers, based on field studies and regional geologic relations, shows inferred changes in river regimen since the large valleys were established during the later Paleogene-early Neogene. It is suggested that a former Trans-African master stream system may have flowed from headwaters in the Red Sea Hills southwestward across North Africa, discharging into the Atlantic at the Paleo-Niger delta, prior to the Neogene domal uplifts and building of volcanic edifices across the paths of these ancient watercourses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we first}} review the Phase Extracted (PE) basis {{functions}} by recalling the derivation {{which shows that}} the induced current on a PEC surface has the propagating phase factor {{the same as the}} incident wave in a scattering problem. The wide band characteristic of this PE basis functions has been investigated by demonstrating that very wide band <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> from PEC objects can be simulated accurately by using PE bases, only based on a single coarse mesh grid. Besides, the resulted current coefficients are shown to vary slowly and smoothly with frequency changing and can be interpolated and extrapolated in very wide band easily. The piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation/extrapolation method with respect to the current coefficients is used to obtain the coefficients in the frequency band of interest. Numerical examples demonstrate very good accuracy and high efficiency in wide band <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> prediction in terms of the amplitude of the scattering field as well as its phase distribution. 1...|$|E
40|$|Landmines are a {{major problem}} {{in many areas of the}} world. In spite of the fact that many {{different}} types of landmine sensors have been developed, the detection of non-metallic landmines remains very difficult. The objective of this contribution is to synthesize our work related to the effects of soil texture and soil water content on the detection of non-metallic anti-tank landmines using ground penetrating radar (GPR). We present a model for the prediction of <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> under a wide range of soil texture and soil water content conditions. Next we present measurements from field experiments in a sand and a silt loam which validate the <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> model. The spatial variability of soil water content in field soils may strongly decrease the effectiveness of GPR for anti-tank mine detection. Uniform wetting of sand and loam soils by irrigation or rain will improve the radar signal. Radar detection in clay soils will be most effective under dry conditions...|$|E

40|$|Landsat and Shuttle Imaging Radar-A L band (23. 5 cm wavelength) {{data from}} 1981 {{were used to}} analyze areas of intact {{tropical}} forest and areas recently cleared from forest for agriculture and pasture in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Portions of SIR-A Data Takes # 24 C and # 31 film were digitized using a microdensitometer. Landsat MSS data of July 1981 were also examined. The digital values from SIR-A DT 31 were compared with the normalized difference vegetation index values (NDVI) from the Landsat data for the same sites. Contrary to expectations some cleared areas had brighter <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> than surrounding forest. The explanation {{seems to be that}} a recently cleared forest (cut and burned during the dry season) is texturally very rough as the exposed standing and fallen boles and woody litter may function as effective corner or dihedral reflectors. Combining radar data with NDVI data may help to assess the relative age of forest clearings and determine differences in both woody and green leaf biomass of primary and secondary tropical forests...|$|R
40|$|The high {{sensitivity}} of imaging radars to slope at moderate to low incidence angles enhances {{the perception of}} linear topography on images. It reveals broad spatial patterns that are essential to landform mapping and interpretation. As <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> are strongly directional, the ability to discriminate linear features on images varies with their orientation. Landforms that appear prominent on images where they are transverse to the illumination may be obscure to indistinguishable on images where they are parallel to it. Landform detection is also influenced by the spatial resolution in radar images. Seasat radar images of the Gran Desierto Dunes complex, Sonora, Mexico; the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province; and accreted terranes in eastern interior Alaska were processed to simulate both Venera 15 and 16 images (1000 to 3000 km resolution) and image data expected from the Magellan mission (120 to 300 m resolution.

The Magellan simulation also shows that fluvial processes have dominated erosion and exposure of the folds...|$|R
40|$|Permafrost is {{degrading}} in high alpine areas, presumably due {{to global}} warming. This causes instabilities of slopes in mountainous areas. Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) is a promising remote sensing technique which enables accuracies of millimeters for landslide monitoring over large areas. However, the following factors complicate its application. The specific imaging geometry of radar systems causes several distortions in SAR images of areas with topographic relief (shadowing and layover of <b>radar</b> <b>responses).</b> These effects deteriorate the application of InSAR. Advanced D-InSAR techniques, such as the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) require a stack of at least 15 – 50 SAR images. This makes its processing very time-consuming and expensive. Precondition of successful PSI application is a high enough number of persistent scatterers (PS) at which the deformation of the ground is analyzed. Here, exemplified for {{a case study in}} the Ötztal Alps, Austria, we present the application of lowcost methods enabling objective pre-survey suitability evaluation of D-InSAR—prior to recording of the area of interest (AOI). This feasibility assessment includes (a) the simulation of layover and shadowing areas (to determine the best suited imaging geometry to monitor a certain landslide) and (b) the estimation of PS based on freely available geodata (to test the applicability of PSI) ...|$|R

This approach has the advantage that the height distribution of meteors expected to be observed by a radar meteor system is able to be accurately modeled and insights into the meteoroid chemistry to be gained. The meteor <b>radar</b> <b>response</b> function is also an important tool with regard to the interpretation of meteor backscatter in other areas, e. g., modeling the expected diurnal variation of sporadic meteors, investigating the expected echo distribution over the sky, and the calculation of the expected rate curves of meteor showers. We exemplify each of these techniques from the analysis of meteor data collected by the Buckland Park 2 MHz system during October 1997. In addition, we show that the response function may be used to quantify the echo rate of a given shower relative to the sporadic background and thus determine if that shower is able to be detected by the radar.

Shale statistics are computed from outcrop observations. Histograms of shale length and variograms of shale occurrence on accretionary surfaces indicate only slight anisotropy in shale dimensions. The estimated mean shale lengths in paleoflow-parallel and paleoflow-perpendicular directions are 4. 9 and 6. 0 m, respectively. The anisotropy in mean shale length (L/W = 1. 2) {{is similar to the}} ratio of the integral ranges of Gaussian correlograms for the shale indicator in the corresponding directions (L/W = 1. 3).

Two tracers (bromide and uranine) were injected to form a plume over a 4 -m interval that spanned the contact between hydrostratigraphic units with contrasting permeability. The tracer plume traveled 6. 9 m to well B 6, passing through well A 1 instrumented with 20 sampling zones over a 5 -m interval that spanned the injection interval. Radar tomographic data were collected periodically on cross-sectional and longitudinal planes, two of which passed through well A 1 for quantitative calibration of radar attenuation tomograms in terms of solute concentration. Pre-test three-dimensional modeling was used to provide estimates of bromide concentration distributions {{under a variety of}} scenarios to help optimize (a) <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> in tomographic planes, and (b) pumping rate from B 6 to minimize influence on the plume while ensuring plume passage through A 1 and complete breakthrough in two weeks. Bromide breakthrough occurred first and with greatest concentration in the higher permeability unit as expected. Time-lapse cross-hole radar data show plume-related differences in expected regions with time-lapse level runs and time-lapse attenuation-difference tomograms.

40|$|Increasing {{resolution}} and accuracy {{is an important}} issue in almost any type of radar sensor application. However, both {{resolution and}} accuracy are strongly related to the available signal bandwidth and energy that can be used. Nowadays, often several sensors operating in different frequency bands become available on a sensor platform. It is an attractive goal to use the potential of advanced signal modelling and optimization procedures by making proper use of information stemming from different frequency bands at the RF signal level. An important prerequisite for optimal use of signal energy is coherence between all contributing sensors. Coherent multi-sensor platforms are greatly expensive and are thus not available in general. This paper presents an approach for accurately estimating object <b>radar</b> <b>responses</b> using subband measurements at different RF frequencies. An exponential model approach allows to compensate for the lack of mutual coherence between independently operating sensors. Mutual coherence is recovered from the a-priori information that both sensors have common scattering centers in view. Minimizing the total squared deviation between measured data and a full-range exponential signal model leads to more accurate pole angles and pole magnitudes compared to single-band optimization. The model parameters (range and magnitude of point scatterers) after this full-range optimization process are also more accurate than the parameters obtained from a commonly used super-resolution procedure (root-MUSIC) applied to the non-coherent subband data...|$|R

40|$|The use of lidar and radar {{instruments}} to measure forest structure attributes such as height and biomass are {{being considered for}} future Earth Observation satellite missions. Large footprint lidar makes a direct measurement of the heights of scatterers in the illuminated footprint and can yield information about the vertical profile of the canopy. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is known to sense the canopy volume, especially at longer wavelengths and is useful for estimating biomass. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) {{has been shown to}} yield some forest canopy height information.

Lidar and radar sense different parts of the forest canopy (lidar to the green leaves, and radar to the wet structures of a canopy). Because of the ecological and biophysical nature of the forest canopies, the amount and spatial position of various components of a forest canopy are closely correlated.
