5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area.

On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter.

Plans exist for stadiums for 22,000 spectators, which would be expandable to 32,000. Part of the <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> their own stadium is that Vålerenga traditionally is the east side team, while Ullevaal is located {{in the heart of the}} west side.

Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> {{the building of the}} station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with the Oslo Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. The Oslo Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the {{measurement}} model of <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> homelessness and the structural model of pathways to homelessness. In the absence of specific method for combining individual and structural accounts with respect to how individuals become homeless, the study created the homeless individuals' self-perceived <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> homelessness covering ten indicators from both individual and structural accounts. The study also developed structural model overarching from adverse childhood experiences to pathways to chronic homelessness. In addition, the multilevel model was created and tested in order to test the impact of two aggregated variables of rent rate and unemployment rate in macro-level on the measurement model of <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> homelessness in micro-level. It was hypothesized that the measurement model created the second-order latent variable of homelessness, significant associations among experiences in childhood and adulthood with pathways to become homeless, and a significant influence of macro-level factors to <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> homelessness.; This study was a cross-sectional, quantitative survey of 3, 226 homeless individuals across the County of Los Angeles. To address the study's hypotheses, bivariate analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling with binary indicators were performed.; The measurement model fitted well to the data and configural invariance was found across gender, ethnicity, and the type of homelessness. Moreover, the structural model fitted well to the data. Gender differences were found in pathways both to become homeless, and to become chronic homeless. Adverse childhood experiences significantly explained to become homeless directly and indirectly. Additionally, the results from the multilevel model showed that the rate of rent was found to be significant and explained the majority of variances in the between-level model. The findings from three model tests clearly presented that the combination of individual and structural accounts explained both <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> homelessness and pathways to homelessness...|$|R
