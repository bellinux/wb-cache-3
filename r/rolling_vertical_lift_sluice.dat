5000|$|Marking {{the start}} of the FRC [...] at Ware, the channel is {{incorporated}} into the Lee Navigation. It flows through Hardmead Lock and Stanstead Lock, which have had automatic sluice gates installed to cope with high water levels. At Feildes Weir a parallel channel has been constructed. The channel then skirts the 120 acre Glen Faba Lake and passes under Dobbs Weir Road before entering the North Lagoon of the Nazeing Meads lake complex and leaving at the South Lagoon at Nazeing Weir. Continuing under Nazeing Road (B194), the channel flows through the River Lee Country Park at Holyfield Lake and out through Holyfield Weir. Flowing under Stubbins Hall Lane, it merges with the old River Lea at Fishers Green. After skirting Seventy Acres Lake and then Hooks Marsh Lake, the channel is incorporated into the Horsemill Stream, also known as Waltons Walk. The water forms a natural boundary for the Royal Gunpowder Mills as it passes through the mechanically controlled radial gates of the David Stoker sluice near Waltham Abbey. Now flowing parallel with the Lee Navigation, and only yards apart, the channel flows firstly under the A121 road and through Rammey Marsh Sluice - a set of three computer-controlled <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>sluice</b> gates and then under the M25 motorway to be joined by Cobbins Brook before flowing through Newman's Sluice - a set of four computer-controlled <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>sluice</b> gates.|$|R

In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach {{for the next generation}} <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. It indicates that 80 percent of decision points for the DoD <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> fleet to either extend the life, retire, or replace with a new solution occurring in the next eight-ten years. Implementation of the FVL Strategic Plan which will impact <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aviation operations for the next 50+ years. The U.S. Navy is a partner to the Army on the effort, so a derivative of FVL may be used in the Navy's MH-XX program to replace the service's MH-60S/R helicopters.|$|R
