5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of <b>rubble</b> <b>stone.</b> The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|Field House on Windy Nook Road {{was built}} in the 19th century in <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> and Welsh slate. It has been {{described}} as a remnant of Sheriff Hill's rural past and was listed on 13 January 1983. Thornlea on Church Road is one of the oldest buildings in the suburb. It is built in stone ashlar with a low hipped slate roof and the doorpiece has two intact Greek Ionic columns. Much of the original grounds have survived intact, as have the original walls of locally quarried stone. It was listed on 13 January 1988. Additionally, Sheriff Hill has ten locally listed buildings. These are the Zion Methodist Chapel, six stone cottages at Sheriff's Highway, The Three Tuns and Old Cannon public houses, and houses at 13–14 Egremont Drive.|$|E
5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of <b>rubble</b> <b>stone,</b> with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is {{in the form of}} an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E

Frank Corey, Benton & Bowles' creative head for the Post Cereal business suggested the alternative names Cocoa Pebbles and Fruity Pebbles, which were adopted.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the church, solely using bricks as the medium, is very unusual in Byzantine architecture. The church foundation was made of stone. In 1900, John Winter Crowfoot reports a pinkish external layer covering the brick walls. In-between the walls, base material, consisting of <b>rubble,</b> <b>stones</b> and other fillers, was used. The filler material {{was supported by a}} wooden-beam structure.|$|R
5|$|When Sir William Sharington {{purchased}} {{the remains of}} the Augustinian nunnery in 1540, after the dissolution, he built a country house on the cloister court. He retained the cloisters and the medieval basement largely unaltered and built another storey above, so that the main rooms are on the first floor. The house is constructed of ashlar and <b>rubble</b> <b>stone,</b> the roofs are of stone slates and there are many twisted, sixteenth century chimney stacks. The house is a blend of different styles but lacks a cohesive plan; the four wings of the house are built above the cloister passages, but the house cannot be entered from the cloisters, and the cloisters cannot be seen from inside the house. The abbey underwent substantial alterations in the Gothic Revival style in the 1750s, under the ownership of John Ivory Talbot. The great hall was redesigned during this period, the architect being Sanderson Miller.|$|E
25|$|Although no {{sketches}} or historic {{descriptions of}} the fort are available, observation of the ruins has given {{an idea of the}} structure. It was rectangular, composed of 10 feet high <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> walls provided with an arch-shaped brick gate for the guards to pass in and out.|$|E
25|$|The {{house itself}} is a two-and-half-story five-by-four-bay {{building}} sided in stucco over <b>rubble</b> <b>stone,</b> with two frame wings on the north and south.

25|$|Abbot Suger's {{innovative}} {{choir of}} the Abbey of Saint-Denis, 1140–44, {{led to the}} adoption of the Gothic style by Paris and its surrounding area, but other parts of France were slower to take it up, and provincial churches continued to be built in the heavy manner and <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> of the Romanesque, even when the openings were treated with the fashionable pointed arch.|$|E
25|$|The door {{giving access}} to the minaret is framed by a lintel and jambs made of {{recycled}} carved friezes of antique origin. There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, {{and they have been}} reused {{at the base of the}} tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers of carefully cut <b>rubble</b> <b>stone,</b> thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.|$|E
25|$|From the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building, which {{required}} {{as much by}} its massive ocher walls of 1.90 meters thick composed of well-worked stones, courses of <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> and courses of baked bricks, as the square angle towers measuring 4.25 meters on each side and the solid and projecting buttresses that support and bind. More than a defensive role, the buttresses and towers full serve more to enhance {{the stability of the}} mosque built on a soil subject to compaction. Although a seemingly harsh, the external facades, punctuated with powerful buttresses and towering porches, some of which are surmounted by cupolas, give to the sanctuary a striking aspect characterized by majestic sobriety.|$|E

50|$|A Heavy Neolithic {{archaeological site}} of the Qaraoun culture was {{discovered}} by Peter Wescombe and J. King in 1966 along a track 200 m north of the Ain el Meten spring and about 300 m west of the road. The tell is cone shaped and composed of <b>rubble</b> <b>stones</b> and grey soil. Imported brown worked flint tools were found along with others made from Nummulitic, Eocene flint in the fields on the lower slopes. Another type of brittle and drab-coloured flint found in the area was unsuitable for toolmaking. The material {{was determined to be}} of Heavy Neolithic or possibly earlier Paleolithic origins.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{buildings}} of South Wraxall are of the 17th and 18th centuries, built from locally quarried dressed <b>stone,</b> or <b>stone</b> <b>rubble</b> construction with <b>stone</b> slates. Besides quarrying, the main occupation around the area was agriculture, including shepherding; there were also weavers in the early 19th century, and some clothworkers by the mid-19th century.|$|R
25|$|Though the Early English {{style was}} Christian's {{favourite}} {{he was not}} restricted to it. Many of his original churches and church restorations display beautiful window tracery in other styles of Gothic architecture. An excellent example of his Decorated Gothic work {{can be seen at}} St John's Church, Kenilworth in Warwickshire built in 1851–52, using rough cut red sandstone for the body of the church with ashlar dressings and displaying a fine south-west steeple with a broach spire. Typically the interior is open and spacious with little division between nave and chancel. Other churches by Christian in the Decorated style include the prominently sited Christ Church, Forest Hill (1852–62) in the London Borough of Lewisham, built in Kentish Ragstone with an impressive tower and spire of 1885, and the charming St Paul's Church, Swanley in Kent completed in 1861 with a west tower added 1862–65 which is built of <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> with bands of red and yellow brick and topped by shingled pyramidal spire. Christian also worked in the Perpendicular Gothic style providing some very attractive Perpendicular traceried windows for the church of St James the Greater (1883), Oaks-in-Charnwood in Leicestershire, which was built in local granite and has a fine west tower, and also for the church of St Dionis, Parsons Green in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, built in red brick with stone dressings in 1884–85, its tower completed after Christian's death in 1896. For the restoration of the ancient Church of St Laurence (1860) in Warkworth, Northumberland, Christian provided a lovely group of chancel east windows in the round-arched Norman style and designed a Neo-Norman organ case for Romsey Abbey in Hampshire in 1858. In 1876–77 he added a Norman style family chapel and vestry to St Andrew's Church near Weston Park in Staffordshire to match the classical work of 1701 a little better than with Gothic. The composition of Minor Canonries (1878–80) that Christian designed as residences for canons of St Paul's Cathedral, London in nearby Amen Court is in the manner of Norman Shaw's Domestic Revival architecture, inspired by original Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings. Here Christian provided a careful design in red brick, beautifully set along the court, with large mullioned and transomed windows; patterned gables and tall chimneys; a tower topped by his usual pyramidal roof and elegant shell hoods over the doors. The court is entered through a pretty gateway, also in red brick, with a Tudor style arch which has an oriel window above on both sides. In a similar Elizabethan style is the bank (1884–86) that Christian designed for Messrs Cox & Co, bankers to the army, in Whitehall, Westminster, though here the building is faced in stone. The former bank is set at the north corner of Craig's Court and has three large gables decorated with a raised grid pattern similar to the work at Amen Court, perhaps alluding to the timber-framed gables of Elizabethan buildings. Below the gables there is an impressively wide expanse of mullioned and transomed windows for each of the upper floors. An extension was added to the corner under a smaller gable in 1900, designed by J. H. Christian. Also in an attractive Shaw style were two large convalescent homes which Christian designed, the first at Folkestone in Kent (1881, chapel added 1888) and the second, the Surrey Convalescent Home at Seaford, East Sussex (1888–91, demolished in the 1960s), both had the usual bold display of heavy mullioned and transomed stone windows, big gables, tall chimneystacks and dormers. Finally, Christian's National Portrait Gallery in London as noted above was designed in a striking Italian Renaissance style.|$|E
