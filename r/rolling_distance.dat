A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225–434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over [...] These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway.

So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{the feet}} of our young discoverers, for such we may truly call them, a deep bay or valley trended away to the right, a large portion of which was filled with the spur of a glacier, whose surface was covered with pink snow!

It seemed as if that valley, instead of forming a portion of the sterile region beyond the Arctic Circle, were one of the sunniest regions of the south, for a warm glow rested on the bosom of the snow, as if the sun were shedding upon it his rosiest hues. A little farther to the north the red snow ceased, or only occurred here and there in patches, and beyond it there appeared another gorge in the cliffs within which rose a tall column of rock, so straight and cylindrical that {{it seemed to be a}} production of art.

After delivery, hASCs that reside and persist in the injured extravascular space have been shown to aid recovery of tissue perfusion and function, although low rates of incorporation currently limit the safety and efficacy of these therapies. We submit that {{a better understanding of the}} trafficking of therapeutic hASCs through the microcirculation is needed to address this and that selective control over their homing (organ- and injury-specific) may be possible by targeting bottlenecks in the homing process.

We developed a multicell agent-based model (ABM) of hASC trafficking during acute skeletal muscle ischemia, based on over 150 literature-based rules instituted in Netlogo and MatLab software programs. In silico, trafficking phenomena within cell populations emerged as a result of the dynamic interactions between adhesion molecule expression, chemokine secretion, integrin affinity states, hemodynamics and microvascular network architectures.

50|$|Putters are {{a special}} class of clubs with a loft not {{exceeding}} ten degrees, designed primarily {{to roll the}} ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, putters do have a loft (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer putters also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases <b>rolling</b> <b>distance</b> and reduces bouncing over the turf. Putters are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two striking faces, non-circular grip cross-sections, bent shafts or hosels, and appendages designed primarily to aid players' aim.|$|E
5000|$|The irons from 5 to 7 are {{typically}} called the [...] "mid irons", and are generally used from the fairway and rough for longer approach shots, between 130-210 yards {{depending on the}} club, player and course. They're also used on hillier fairways to avoid hitting a low rise, which is a risk with long irons. These irons are commonly needed for the second shot of a long par-4 or {{the second or third}} shot of a par-5, and whenever the player must [...] "lay up" [...] their tee or second shot to avoid a hazard in range of their woods or long irons. Lastly, mid irons are common [...] "bump and run" [...] clubs in close-in situations where the player doesn't wish to hit a more lofted chip shot, but needs more <b>rolling</b> <b>distance</b> than a pitch or bump-and-run with a short iron would produce.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{consideration}} is [...] "spin", affected by compression {{and by the}} cover material; a [...] "high-spin" [...] ball allows more of the ball's surface to contact the clubface at impact, allowing the grooves of the clubface to [...] "grip" [...] the ball and induce more backspin at launch. Backspin creates lift that can increase carry distance, and also provides [...] "bite" [...] which allows a ball to arrest its forward motion at the initial point of impact, bouncing straight up or even backwards, allowing for precision placement of {{the ball on the}} green with an approach shot. However, high-spin cover materials, typically being softer, are less durable which shortens the useful life of the ball, and backspin is not desirable on most long-distance shots, such as with the driver, as it causes the shot to [...] "balloon" [...] and then to bite on the fairway, when additional <b>rolling</b> <b>distance</b> is usually desired.|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} and traffic noise {{are two major}} environmental issues associated with road traffic. Increased efforts are made to develop suitable simulation tools for the prediction of tyre rolling losses and rolling noise. The accurate description of the tyre/road interaction under rolling conditions is crucial for these simulations. Besides an accurate contact model, input data of sufficiently high quality is required. Ac- cordingly, the measurement effort for the road roughness profiles is high: in the <b>rolling</b> direction <b>distances</b> of several meters need to be scanned at positions less than a millimetre apart. While in the lateral direction a lower resolution can be accepted, still between ten and twenty parallel profile tracks are required under perfect conditions. Yet, in reality road surface scans are typically restricted to very few lateral tracks due to limited resources. This study evaluates how rolling resistance and rolling noise simulations are affected {{if the number of}} independent lateral road scans is less than the number of lateral tracks in the contact model.

Nine pastes (seven etherified cellulose (methyl cellulose) and the native cellulose (control) were prepared by dispersing them in distilled water (35 % w/v) and heating the eight dispersions to 45 °C with continuous agitation for 15 min. The solutions were then cooled to room temperature and allowed to gel. The effect of DS on the adhesive properties of the pastes (tack strength, rolling ball test, gelation time, drying time, optical clarity, relative viscosity, syneresis) was comparatively investigated. The results showed that the DS in the etherified cellulose ranged from 1. 31 to 1. 98 with the methyl cellulose giving higher values of viscosity and tack strength with increase in DS.

5000|$|The lob wedge can be {{used for}} any shot {{requiring}} a short carry distance (typically 10-50 yards), and/or a very high launch angle, which also results in high backspin and thus little <b>rolling</b> <b>distance</b> after impact. Such shots include tight approaches to the green, shots from close to a tree or other tall obstruction, shots to gain a more favorable lie on the fairway, and certain bunker shots. The high launch angle and thus long carry time can be an impediment in high winds, but skilled golfers can use the long [...] "hang time" [...] of a lob wedge shot {{to take advantage of a}} favorable wind. The wedge typically has low to moderate bounce (0-4°) for fairway and other firm lies, but because of its high loft even 2-3° of bounce will counterbalance the downward force of the wedge's striking face, making a club with this configuration useful in sand as well.

40|$|Running-in of two {{fresh and}} unworn {{surfaces}} in contact is a transient phase where friction and wear vary considerably in time. During running-in the surface {{properties of the}} components are adjusted. If the initial surface roughness of the rubbing surfaces is correctly chosen, the running-in changes into the steady-state phase. At this stage, the rubbing surfaces are in general smoother and their wear rate is low and constant. On the other hand, an inappropriate choice of roughness {{may lead to a}} rapid deterioration of the rubbing surfaces. The micro-geometry of the surface {{is an important factor in}} determining the life of mechanical components. During the running-in phase, the highest asperities are “flattened”, thereby increasing the number of asperities in contact and, as a result, increasing the load-carrying capacity of the surface. Fundamental studies that attempt to consider the details of running-in phenomena are relatively rare. This research is conducted with the aim of exploring the running-in phase for the rolling, sliding and rolling-sliding contact. Finite element simulations are conducted to calculate the stress distributions for the three types of contact motions during the running-in phase. The evolution of the contact pressure for a certain <b>rolling</b> or sliding <b>distance</b> is studied to unravel the running-in phase. During running-in of rolling contacts, the change in the surface topography results in the transformation from a rough surface to a smoother surface: the flattening of the high asperities induces a reduction in surface roughness. This flattening of asperities is due to plastic deformation and causes a higher equivalent residual stress at the surface. The transition of the running-in phase to the steady-state phase of a rolling contact is governed by the transition of plastic to elastic deformation on roughness level. In sliding contacts, the proposed finite element (FE) model combined with the Archard wear equation successfully predicts the contact pressure evolution and change in the topography on a macroscopic point of view. The change in the topography in a sliding contact is mainly caused by wear. A new FE model, with respect to the artificial and real surface roughness, is discussed. It is found that the proposed model is a useful tool to study the running-in of a surface on roughness level. The changes on macroscopic and on microscopic level of the surface are also discussed in the running-in of rolling-sliding contacts considering two aspects: wear and plastic deformation. The geometrical change of the contacting surface due to wear is predicted using the present FEM model, combined with the Archard wear equation, and has been compared with results from the literature. Calculations are performed to predict the wear of an artificial rough hemisphere in rolling-sliding contact with a smooth cylinder. The model also predicts the change of real rough surfaces which were in good agreement with the experimental results. The change of a rough surface, represented by an arithmetic average surface roughness, Ra, is predicted for lubricated rolling-sliding contacts using the load-sharing concept. The results obtained are in good agreement with experimental results. A FEM based model has been developed to study the running-in of rolling, sliding and rolling-sliding contacts on macroscopic level as well as on roughness level. However, the transition between the running-in phase and the steady-state phase for sliding and rolling-sliding contacts cannot be determined by considering only one single parameter; likewise for the rolling contact situation.

Our specially designed setup involved an HF-resistant trough for etching with HF under light focused by a Zeiss optical microscope using different objective lenses of 5 × through 50 × magnification (for sample evolution during this process, see Fig. 1 a and b). Other measurements were performed using illumination from a HeNe laser with maximum output power of 2 mW, as well as a laser with adjustable power (up to 20 mW) and wavelength (535 – 825 nm) with focusing optics or an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of the sample. For all measurements, the intensity of illumination was measured beforehand using a calibrated power meter.

30|$|We {{also found}} that the ESE is time dependent, i.e., the etching time under {{illumination}} determines whether further etching will continue once the illumination is removed. In our experiments, we found that for samples where the high intensity light exposure was kept short, the layers were able to start rolling after being removed from the light source. This effect was found to not only depend on the light intensity but also on the thickness of the AlAs layer, which suggests that the etch suppression is a dynamic process that depends on the access of HF to the AlAs layer and the exchange of products and reactants in this region. This conclusion is further corroborated by the fact that with increasing AlAs thickness the <b>rolling</b> <b>distance</b> of the strained bilayer becomes independent of the AlAs gap size (Fig. 3).|$|E

Selectin kinetics, together with neutrophil hydrodynamics, regu-late the fundamental adhesion cascade of cell tethering and rolling on the endothelium. The current study uses the Multiscale Adhesive Dynamics computational model to simulate, for the first time, the tethering and rolling behavior of pseudopod-containing neutrophils as mediated by P-selectin/PSGL- 1 bonds. This paper looks at the effect of including P-selec-tin/PSGL- 1 adhesion kinetics. The parameters examined included the shear rate, adhesion on-rate, initial neutrophil position, and receptor number sensitivity. The outcomes analyzed included types of adhesive behavior observed, tether <b>rolling</b> <b>distance</b> and time, number of bonds formed during an adhesive event, contact area, and contact time. In contrast to the hydrodynamic model, P-selectin/PSGL- 1 binding slows the neutrophil’s translation {{in the direction of}} flow and causes the neutrophil to swing around perpendicular to flow. Several behaviors were observed during the simulations, including tethering without firm adhesion, tethering with downstream firm adhesion, and firm adhesion upon first contact with the endothelium. These behaviors were qualitatively consistent with in vivo data of murine neu-trophils with pseudopods. In the simulations, increasing shear rate, receptor count, and bond formation rate increased the incidence of firm adhesion upon first contact with the endothelium. Tethering was conserved across a range of physiological shear rates and was resistant to fluctuations in the number of surface PSGL- 1 molecules. In simulations where bonding occurred, interaction with the side of the pseudopod, rather than the tip, afforded more surface area and greater contact time with the endothelial wall...|$|E

Methods: Player movement {{data were collected}} from 19 elite Australian soccer players over 11 competitive matches (77 individual match files) using a 5 -Hz global-positioning system. Raw velocity data were analyzed to determine the period containing the greatest HiVR distance per match half and the distance covered in the subsequent epoch. Intervals were identified using either a predefined (distance covered in 5 min at every 5 -min time point) or <b>rolling</b> (<b>distance</b> covered in 5 min from every time point) method. The percentage difference ± 90 % confidence limits were used to determine differences between methods. Results: Predefined periods underestimated peak distance covered by up to 25 % and overestimated the subsequent epoch by up to 31 % compared with rolling periods. When the distance decrement between the peak and following period was determined, there was up to a 52 % greater reduction in running performance using rolling periods than predefined ones. Conclusions: It is recommended that researchers use rolling as opposed to predefined periods when determining specific match intervals because they provide a more accurate representation of the HiVR distance covered. This will avoid underestimation of both match running distance and the decrement in running performance after an intense period of play. This may have practical implica- tions for not only researchers but also staff involved in a club setting who use this reduction as evidence of transient fatigue during a match...|$|E

All this is seen in relation to the geology. This thesis suggests that foam has benefits in hard rock TBM tunnelling compared to water, but more research must be conducted with longer, and more consistent test periods. After boring 188 metres with foam, split into two intervals, the amount of blocked cutters has decreased with 47. 8 percent. When comparing the foam boring in the period between March 1. and May 12. a reduction in cutter wear of 12. 7 percent was achieved. In the same period cutter life increased with 18. 2 percent cubic metres per cutter and 713 meters longer <b>rolling</b> <b>distance.</b> The amount of time spent on cutter changes is 34. 2 percent less with foam. Temperature and dust measurements show slightly favourable values when boring with foam, but the data for these are too narrow to draw any conclusion. </p...|$|E
