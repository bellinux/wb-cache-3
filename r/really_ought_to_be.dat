2500|$|At the Hallé orchestral concert... I was inhumanly {{tormented by}} a quadrille band which the proprietors of St James's Hall (who <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{examined}} by two doctors) had stationed within earshot of the concert-hall. The heavy tum-tum of the basses throbbed obscurely against {{the rhythms of}} Spohr and Berlioz all the evening, like a toothache through a troubled dream; and occasionally, during a pianissimo, or in one of Lady Hallé's eloquent pauses, the cornet would burst into vulgar melody in a remote key, and set us all flinching, squirming, shuddering, and grimacing hideously.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Originalists like Robert Bork have {{objected to}} {{enforcing}} {{the intentions of}} those framers who may have believed that paper money should be prohibited: [...] "Scholarship suggests that the Framers intended to prohibit paper money. Any judge who thought today he {{would go back to}} the original intent <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by a guardian rather than be sitting on a bench." [...] According to law professor Michael Stokes Paulson, [...] "Among the most common canards in critiques of originalism is that, under the original meaning of the Constitution, the issuance of paper money as legal tender would be unconstitutional, sending our economy into disarray." ...|$|E
60|$|Trafford was one {{of those}} rare {{scientific}} men who <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> engaged in scientific research.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Euphemia, one evening, [...] "what we <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do <b>is</b> <b>to</b> build. Then {{we would}} have exactly the house we want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no,' {{answered}} Lorenzo, gaily. 'We {{were talking}} of Plato. I <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> attending <b>to</b> very {{much more serious}} matters, but I never can resist Pico.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are evidently as sly {{as their}} forefathers," [...] said Dick. [...] "But, <b>really,</b> {{something}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. If we--hullo, there's a horse down in yonder clearing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a little}} more," [...] Philippa agreed. [...] "I don't know why things seem so flat now. We <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> glad that nothing terrible has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I love it. How {{extraordinary}} that {{we should}} have so much in common. You seem to like all the things I like. We <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{have named}} {{you out of}} regard for your feelings,' General Robles remarked. 'Though the woman <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shot for all the harm she has done to the Republic.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. MOUNTCALM-VILLIERS [She {{shakes her}} head.] Something <b>ought</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so late, Father! It's wicked at {{this time}} of year. Who is it--oh! Mr. Pillin, how do you do? Have you had tea? Won't you come to the drawing-room; {{or do you want to}} see my father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Second Miss.--"Don't {{you think}} Jemima decidedly crooked? And those fair complexions, they freckle so, that <b>really</b> Miss Blanche <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called Miss Brown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} girl plaintively. [...] "I don't go quite as far as Mr. Clavering and my cousin do--though Chris {{generally}} talks too much--but Larry is a nuisance, and <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crushed. You see, we had everything we wanted before {{he and the others}} made the trouble here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s so nice having Mr. Lanner here,” confided Mrs. Olston to Clovis {{the next}} afternoon; “he’s always been engaged when I’ve asked him before. Such a nice man; he <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married to some nice girl. Between you and me, I {{have an idea}} that he came down here for a certain reason.” ...|$|E
60|$|VOICE. (In a half chant.) 'And {{it came to}} pass at the {{eleventh}} hour that this poor soul repented.' It knocked at the gates, but they were shut--tight as a plaster--a great, burning plaster. They had pasted our marriage certificate all across the door, and {{it was made of}} red-hot iron--people <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more careful, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Geraldine, the masque {{was a great}} success. People beg to have it repeated, so many {{could not}} get in. And it is worth {{at least a hundred}} pounds to us. People whose opinion is worth having were quite struck. They say your brother <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> a great {{composer}} and singer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a room upstairs as {{you might}} 'ave if you liked," [...] said Mr. Kybird, slowly. [...] "It's <b>been</b> let <b>to</b> a very respectable, clean young man for half a crown a week. <b>Really</b> it <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> three shillings, but {{if you like to}} 'ave it at the old price, you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{certainly}} a wicked piece of work," [...] said Songbird to {{the others in the}} room. [...] "I <b>really</b> think somebody <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I say," [...] said Jenny, [...] "that you {{are really}} morbid {{on the subject of}} dress; you are fastidious and {{particular}} and exacting in your ideas in a way that <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put down. There is not a girl of our set that dresses as nicely as you do, except Emma Seyton, and her father, you know, has no end of income." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Hilda {{was tall}} and beautiful, and Lady Hilda spoke. as she always used to speak, with {{manifest}} sincerity. Now, {{it is not in}} human nature not to feel flattered when a beautiful woman pays one genuine homage; and Arthur Berkeley was quite as human, after all, as most other people. 'You're very kind,' he said, smiling. 'I must make it lunch, then, though I <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working in the mornings instead of running about merely to amuse myself. What day will suit you best?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, again, their {{hearing is}} so terribly weak. It <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen to. People talk and chatter {{at the very}} top of their voices close behind them, and they never hear a word--don't know anybody's there, even. After it has been going on for half an hour, and the people [...] "up stage" [...] have made {{themselves}} hoarse with shouting, and somebody has been boisterously murdered and all the furniture upset, then the people [...] "down stage" [...] "think they hear a noise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, [...] "I <b>ought</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in London, but {{the truth}} is I'm rather expecting {{something}} to happen down here." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "And then, these {{languages}} are not international after all. A <b>really</b> international language <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as acceptable <b>to</b> speakers of Arabic, Chinese or Japanese as to a European." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Locket got up--he too had {{his dignity}} to vindicate. [...] "Such a sum as I offer you <b>ought</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an offset against all claims." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry if}} I did Reddy Fox an injustice," [...] thought he, [...] "but he makes {{so much trouble}} for other people that I guess {{no one else will}} be sorry. He isn't likely to bother any one for some time. Peter <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> punished, but somehow I don't feel so much like {{punishing}} him as I did. I'll just give him a little scare and let the scamp off with that. Now, I wonder where he can be. I have an idea he isn't very far away. Let me see. Seems to me I remember an old house of Johnny Chuck's not very far from here. I'll have a look in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! Dash it, Tony," [...] {{says that}} gentleman, [...] "you <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful how you wound the {{feelings}} {{of a man who}} has an unrequited image imprinted on his 'eart and who is NOT altogether happy in those chords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions. You, Tony, possess in yourself all that is calculated to charm the eye and allure the taste. It is not--happily for you, perhaps, and I may wish that I could say the same--it is not your character to hover around one flower. The ole garden is open to you, and your airy pinions carry you through it. Still, Tony, far be it from me, I am sure, to wound even your feelings without a cause!" ...|$|E
60|$|Thomas isn't a brute, and his business, {{which is}} {{to look after the}} virtuous people, demands that he shall have his {{ammunition}} to his hand. He doesn't wear silk stockings, and he <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> supplied with a new Adjective to help him to express his opinions: but, for all that, he is a great man. If you call him 'the heroic defender of the national honour' one day, and a 'brutal and licentious soldiery' the next, you naturally bewilder him, and he looks upon you with suspicion. There is nobody to speak for Thomas except people who have theories to work off on him; and nobody understands Thomas except Thomas, and he does not always know what is the matter with himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "A groom!" [...] exclaimed Myra, with an elfish laugh; [...] "I believe, if {{the truth}} <b>were</b> <b>really</b> known, we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making our own beds and washing our own dinner plates." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is an {{argument}} that labour hire firms <b>ought</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> calling their employees [...] "contractors" [...] which makes more explicit that such workers are providing subcontracted services.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! It was Gabe Werner's fault entirely! That boy <b>ought</b> <b>really</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in jail! But, Jack, you {{are quite}} sure that your eyes are all right?" [...] she went on anxiously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a {{remarkable}} circumstance,' he mused, dallying lazily with the teaspoon, 'that my friend the madman should have been within an ace of escaping, on his trial; {{and it was a}} good stroke of chance (or, as the world would say, a providential occurrence) that the brother of my Lord Mayor should have been in court, with other country justices, into whose very dense heads curiosity had penetrated. For though the brother of my Lord Mayor was decidedly wrong; and established his near relationship to that amusing person beyond all doubt, in stating that my friend was sane, and had, to his knowledge, wandered about the country with a vagabond parent, avowing revolutionary and rebellious sentiments; I am not the less obliged to him for volunteering that evidence. These insane creatures make such very odd and embarrassing remarks, that they <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hanged for the comfort of society.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} told you what trouble Gilbert had with that [...] rascally Russian merchant, Ivan Snokoff, and with Snokoff's [...] confederate, Captain Barusky, of the Russian army. Well, at [...] Liao-Yang we found Snokoff {{disguised}} as a Chinaman, and [...] Gilbert made the fellow pay over all that was coming to him [...] for the Richmond Importing Company. In the attempt to [...] capture Snokoff, Gilbert {{shot him in the}} leg. It was only a [...] slight wound, but the Russian was as mad as a hornet, and he [...] vowed he would get square some time. He is now in the [...] hospital here, but they expect to let him leave in a few [...] days. He <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put under arrest, but as he has [...] paid up the money he owed, there doesn't seem to be any way [...] of holding him. It's out of the question to go to court with [...] the case. I helped Gilbert to put Snokoff under guard, and [...] he is as angry at me as he is at Gilbert. I don't know if he [...] will dare to do anything or not, but both of us are keeping [...] our eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not hear}} it, he {{concluded}} from her subsequent bearing; but during the supper {{they had in the}} little private dining-room, though she talked cheerfully, he was preoccupied. Whiffs of indistinct conversation, and now and then laughter, came in from the inn parlor through the pelargoniums in the open window. Hoopdriver felt it must all be in the same strain,--at her expense and his. He answered her abstractedly. She was tired, she said, and presently went to her room. Mr. Hoopdriver, in his courtly way, opened the door for her and bowed her out. He stood listening and fearing some new offence as she went upstairs, and round the bend where the barometer hung beneath the stuffed birds. Then {{he went back to the}} room, and stood on the hearthrug before the paper fireplace ornament. [...] "Cads!" [...] he said in a scathing undertone, as a fresh burst of laughter came floating in. All through supper he had been composing stinging repartee, a blistering speech of denunciation to be presently delivered. He would rate them as a nobleman should: [...] "Call themselves Englishmen, indeed, and insult a woman!" [...] he would say; take the names and addresses perhaps, threaten to speak to the Lord of the Manor, promise to let them hear from him again, and so out with consternation in his wake. It <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>really.</b> There <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{some men}} among us--men without morrows. Now, why don't you {{and my husband}} set an example to your sex? Why don't you relax your severe sense of duty? Why need you insist upon being at your offices every morning at nine? Why don't you fling off these habits of lifelong industry, and be {{gracefully}} indolent {{in the interest of}} the higher civilisation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} will go back now, Mr. Pearson. I <b>really</b> think we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very much obliged to those fellows for not sinking us. I wonder what was their motive in letting us off so easily?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy {{shook his}} head. [...] "No; I couldn't. If {{it was a}} case of sickness, of course I'd do it. But I couldn't spare the time; I couldn't <b>really.</b> Why, I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> up on the Common now." ...|$|R
