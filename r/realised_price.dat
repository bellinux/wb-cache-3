Christie's, the art business and a fine arts auction house, has auctioned off some of Ethel's work. One of those pieces was a signed watercolor called On the Sand, Midsummer.

50|$|Paalen´s {{relatively}} small oeuvre of roughly 300 canvases, a few objects and some sculptures was mostly traded privately and through specialized galleries in the past. Only minor works appear {{from time to}} time in public auctions, as most of the major works are in museums or well-established private collections. In 2009 however, Christie's auctioned Paalen's important 1938 surrealist fumage painting Paysage (Pays) médusé (oil and smoke on canvas). Estimated at US$40-50,000, the <b>realised</b> <b>price</b> was US$561,000, setting a new record for the highest price paid at auction for this artist.|$|E

30|$|Broken down to logistics, typical {{objectives}} are {{the achievement of}} cost advantages and the realisation of service leadership to <b>realise</b> <b>price</b> premiums. For logistics, this {{is reflected in the}} dimensions of increased productivity, quality and customer satisfaction [18]. Productivity includes capital investment optimisation (e.g. for logistics equipment and buildings) and the reduction in operational expenses (e.g. personnel costs in warehousing, transportation costs)—both measured against the throughput of the system. In addition, especially in logistics, optimised inventory levels are key [10] not only within a company, but also across the supply chain [52].|$|R
40|$|Most {{reviews of}} {{monetary}} policy concentrate on its appropriate ultimate objective, {{the degree to}} which it is being achieved and, from a macro-economic perspective, why the outcome may be deviating from that envisaged. A different emphasis is given here, which timelessly captures the significance of the financial markets nowadays for the successful operation of monetary policy, and concentrates on how it is conducted from day to day. This account also highlights why the ultimate objective of monetary policy will not be realised unless the cumulative results of the daily operations of monetary policy in the financial markets are compatible with <b>realising</b> <b>price</b> stability over time...|$|R
5000|$|Price tag {{operations}} were originally envisaged as mobilizing actions by settlers throughout the West Bank - retaliating {{in the north}} when outposts in the south were threatened with dismantlement, and [...] "exacting a price" [...] in the south when outposts risked removal in the north. However, by 2009, though considerable damage was wrought to Palestinian property and persons, a coordinated north-south campaign still hadn't been <b>realised.</b> <b>Price</b> tag attacks could, furthermore, also be triggered purely {{on the basis of}} an announcement of government measures or by rumours of an imminent evacuation. Settlers have used the term to describe Israeli government operations that demolish the illegal structures they have built.|$|E
40|$|Using sales {{data from}} 1987 - 2011 we {{investigate}} {{the role that}} pre-sale price information plays in determining hammer prices for Australian Indigenous artworks. Importantly, we control for the degree of market concentration as this might influence buyers&# 039; perceptions of fairness in relation to price estimates which are provided by auction houses. Auction houses therefore act as important intermediaries between art sellers and art buyers. The results suggest that pre-sale estimates and market concentration have a differential impact on hammer prices, depending on {{the point in the}} conditional <b>realised</b> <b>price</b> distribution under examination...|$|E

The mortgage is modelled as an adjustable rate contract covering the remaining life of te house owner. Thus, refinancing concerns only the size of the mortgage, which can be adjusted in any period subject to a constraint on the amount that can be borrowed: the value of the new mortgage cannot exceed the latest <b>realised</b> <b>price.</b> The paper solves the model analytically and then numerically calibrates the refinancing decision. mortgages, refinancing,consumption smoothing...|$|E

40|$|I show {{theoretically}} that {{applying the}} model of K 6 szegi and Rabin (2006) to a simple purchasing decision where consumers are ex-ante uncertain about the price realisation, gives - when changing the underlying distribution of expected prices - rise to counterintuitive predictions in contrast with a 'good deal model" where consumers are predicted to be disappointed (rejoice) when the <b>realised</b> <b>price</b> is perceived as being worse (better) than the other possible realisation. While the underlying ideas of both models are similar with respect to expectation-based reference points, the different results come from the concept of Personal Equilibrium in K 6 szegi and Rabin (2006). The experimental results show some support for the simpler good deal model {{for a number of}} different real consumption goods though the support is weaker for goods that either have a salient market price or no market price outside of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{research}} to examine the determinants of {{the accuracy of the}} target prices of sell-side analysts within a relative context. This is achieved by utilising a within analyst rank-correlation of target price expected returns and <b>realised</b> <b>price</b> returns, which measures whether analysts can accurately rank the price appreciation of stocks within their coverage cluster. The study then investigates whether the factors that determine the absolute accuracy of target prices also explain the relative accuracy of target prices. The evidence suggests that many of the determinants of the absolute accuracy of target prices are not necessarily determinants of the relative accuracy of target prices, providing a more nuanced understanding of their association with analyst forecasts. This thesis is also the first research to examine discordance between analysts’ recommendations and target price expected returns at an individual analyst level, documenting similar discordance to that found in prior research at a consensus level...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{there has been much}} {{controversy}} among market practitioners about the use of relative calls and puts prices as indicators of a market’s underlying trend. In this research, we investigate whether there is any informational value that can be derived from risk reversals (the volatility amount by which, for a given currency, a 25 -delta call is more/less expensive than a 25 -delta put) and used to assess the future evolution of exchange rates. Risk reversals are a measure of the skewness of an asset’s expected price distribution: as they are traded in the marketplace and are therefore directly observable, there is an obvious intuitive appeal to testing whether they effectively tell us something about the <b>realised</b> <b>price</b> evolution. The analysis is applied on daily data, to the USD/JPY, USD/CHF, GBP/USD and AUD/USD exchange rates and risk reversals over the period February 1996 -April 2000. Contrary to many market participants ’ beliefs, it is shown that for the currencies and the period considered, risk reversal data do not help in assessing the future evolution of exchange rates...|$|E

50|$|In this situation, output values {{produced}} by enterprises will typically deviate from output <b>prices</b> <b>realised.</b> Market competition {{for a given}} demand will impose a ruling price-level for a type of output, but the different competing enterprises producing {{it will take more}} or less labour to produce it, depending on productivity levels and technologies they use.
