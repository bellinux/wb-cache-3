50|$|The Nigerian mole-rat (Fukomys foxi) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Bathyergidae. It is found in {{northern}} Nigeria and Cameroon. A colonial, subterranean species, its natural habitats are tropical dry lowland grassland, <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland</b> and rocky places.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} found in southeastern Africa, mainly in southeastern Zimbabwe, eastern Botswana, Mozambique and {{southern}} and eastern South Africa. It frequents dense thickets in forests, mangroves, scrub and gardens. In drier regions, it {{is found in}} <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} is characterised by the Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide) {{in the south}} and the <b>riverside</b> <b>woodlands</b> along the Elbe. Though most of the {{district is}} located south of the river, there is a small portion around the municipality of Amt Neuhaus on the opposite side.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{is named for}} the two main towns. It is {{better known as the}} Wendland, a designation referring to the Slavic people of the Wends from Obotrite tribe Drevani, who lived there till the 18th century — the last known user of the local dialect of Polabian language died in 1752. The landscape is characterised by <b>riverside</b> <b>woodlands</b> along the Elbe river and a hilly countryside.|$|R
50|$|This {{ecoregion}} is predominately coniferous forest. Lower elevation {{forests are}} dominated by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western red cedar (Thuja plicata) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), with smaller populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western white pine (Pinus monticola) and western larch (Larix occidentalis). Subalpine zones {{are dominated by}} Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanni), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and, in areas affected by fire, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). This ecoregion also contains meadows, foothill grasslands, <b>riverside</b> <b>woodlands,</b> and tree line/alpine zone communities.|$|R
50|$|Clackmannanshire Council has {{recognised}} {{the threat}} of flooding along the Devon and has worked {{to address the issue}} on its own account and in partnership with others, including WWF-Scotland. Works undertaken on the Devon catchment include willow walling, <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland</b> and the blocking of wetland drains.|$|E
50|$|This is <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland</b> and a {{large part}} of it has grown up over an old rubbish tip. Thus land has been {{reclaimed}} with any dangerous material being removed first. There are public footpaths at both ends of this ribbon-like site which link with a permissive footpath. Rodborough Fields are {{on the opposite side of}} the river and footpaths link up for extended walks.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} Cuculus clamosus gabonensis is {{a resident}} in Central Africa, whereas the Southern African subspecies Cuculus clamosus clamosus is migratory, breeding in Southern Africa in September to December, then moving in March to Central, Eastern and West Africa. The range {{of this species}} extends from Liberia to Ethiopia {{in the east and}} Angola and South Africa. It is a woodland bird but avoids the interior of dense forests, preferring acacia woodland, thickets, <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland,</b> plantations and trees around villages.|$|E
50|$|Blaine {{is a town}} in Burnett County in the U.S. {{state of}} Wisconsin. The {{population}} was 197 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated communities of <b>Riverside</b> and <b>Woodland</b> Corner {{are located in the}} town.|$|R

500|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the white-breasted nuthatch is woodland across North America, from southern Canada to northern Florida and southern Mexico. In {{the eastern part}} of its range, its preferred habitat is old-growth open deciduous or mixed forest, including orchards, parks, suburban gardens and cemeteries; it is found mainly in the lowlands, although it breeds at [...] altitude in Tennessee. In the west and Mexico, this nuthatch is found in open montane pine-oak woodlands, and nesting occurs at up to [...] altitude in Nevada, California and Mexico. Pinyon-juniper and <b>riverside</b> <b>woodlands</b> may be used locally where available. The white-breasted nuthatch is the only North American nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees; red-breasted, pygmy and brown-headed nuthatches prefer pines.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the area}} was once part of Park Street, {{development}} took place {{in most of the}} agricultural fields around Park Street Lane. Park Street joined the City Council rather than St Stephen civil parish. How Wood has grown to a sizeable residential area: its population in 2001 was 3,542. The area has the physical divide from Park Street of a railway line bridge adjoining two fields and a wood leading down to increasingly <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland</b> in Park Street, which sits on the river Ver in the northwest.|$|E
5000|$|The Great Valley Grasslands State Park {{preserves}} {{an example}} of the [...] habitat in the valley, while oak savanna habitats remain near Visalia. There are areas of wetland and <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland</b> in the north especially on the Sacramento River system including the Nature Conservancy's Cosumnes River Preserve just south of Sacramento, Gray Lodge Wildlife Area, Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area, and other patches in the delta area. Remaining vernal pools include Pixley National Wildlife Refuge between Tulare, California and Bakersfield and Jepson Prairie Preserve in the delta. There are large blocks of desert scrubland in the southern San Joaquin Valley and in the Carrizo Plain which is just outside the valley but has a similar landscape.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Central Valley grassland" [...] is the Nearctic {{temperate}} and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrub lands ecoregion {{which was}} once a diverse grassland containing areas of desert grassland (at the southern end), prairie, savanna, <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland,</b> marsh, several types of seasonal vernal pools, and large lakes such as now-dry Tulare Lake (the largest lake in the United States west of the Mississippi), Buena Vista Lake and Kern Lake. However, much of the Central Valley environment has been removed or altered by human activity including the introduction of exotic plants, especially grasses. The oak woodlands and chaparral that fringe the valley have been categorized as the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} moist wetland habitat, {{including}} bogs and riparian {{areas such as}} riverbanks, floodplains, lakeshores, <b>riverside</b> <b>woodlands</b> and forest, desert springs, and meadows, and human-made habitat such as ditches, reservoirs, and irrigated agricultural settings. In 2005 there were about 52 occurrences. The population size is difficult to count or estimate because the plant spends most of its time in a vegetative or dormant state, {{in which there are}} few or no aboveground plant parts and these may be hidden in dense surrounding vegetation or hard to identify. Some plants may be dormant underground for years at a time. What appear on paper to be larger populations are actually areas that have been more often and intensely surveyed.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the white-breasted nuthatch is woodland across North America, from southern Canada to northern Florida and southern Mexico. In {{the eastern part}} of its range, its preferred habitat is old-growth open deciduous or mixed forest, including orchards, parks, suburban gardens and cemeteries; it is found mainly in the lowlands, although it breeds at 1675 m altitude in Tennessee. In the west and Mexico, this nuthatch is found in open montane pine-oak woodlands, and nesting occurs at up to 3200 m altitude in Nevada, California and Mexico. Pinyon-juniper and <b>riverside</b> <b>woodlands</b> may be used locally where available. The white-breasted nuthatch is the only North American nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees; red-breasted, pygmy and brown-headed nuthatches prefer pines.|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{regimes of}} sheep grazing were {{experimentally}} imposed on moorland that adjoined {{a strip of}} <b>riverside</b> <b>woodland</b> in Derbyshire. It was found that protection from grazing from April to September allowed rowan colonisation, but the saplings were then severely grazed down in the next six-month winter periods. Many saplings recovered in the following six months free from grazing, and fourteen years {{after the start of}} the experiment some reached sufficient size in summer to escape from leader damage in the next winter. The minimum height observed for this was 50 cm, and no saplings taller than 1 m suffered winter leader los...|$|E
50|$|A {{lake and}} bird-hide are located before the car park. The main path runs {{down to the}} <b>riverside.</b> The <b>woodland</b> path {{stretches}} down to the riverside and is mainly on a boardwalk; it also contains a brook. There is also a walk along the entrance road to a large meadow with a lake and picnic site which joins onto the woodland path.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{a school}} for boys only, the school first {{admitted}} girls to the sixth form in 1979 and has been fully co-educational since 1985. The school has continued to expand since its origins, adding modern buildings as required almost continuously over its existence. The school originally sat in a few acres of semi-rural land but now extends over 70 acre of playing fields, <b>riverside</b> and <b>woodlands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Welford Park is {{a private}} residence, {{and for most of}} the year neither it nor its grounds are open to the public. However, in a {{tradition}} that is now over 50 years old, the grounds are opened to enable visitors to view the year's bloom of snowdrops and, to a lesser extent, aconites. The flowers thrive on the chalky soil, forming a white carpet across the estate's <b>riverside</b> beech <b>woodland.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For walkers and ramblers, {{there are}} {{numerous}} footpaths, <b>woodlands,</b> <b>riverside</b> and field walks in the Hailsham district. Information on suitable routes may {{be obtained from the}} Hailsham Town Council and Wealden District Council offices. There is an active branch of Ramblers (formerly known as the Ramblers' Association) in Hailsham, which organises a weekly series of walks.|$|R
50|$|The undulating plateaux {{and steep}} gullies provide {{a variety of}} {{different}} habitats. Pinkwood rainforests occur in the sheltered fire free gullies. Black Ash, Monkey Gum, Messmate, White Ash and Snow Gums occur at higher altitudes. Yellow Box, Manna Gum and Forest Red Gum forests are found at lower altitudes. Other habitats include bogs, dry exposed eucalyptus <b>woodland,</b> <b>riverside</b> forest, swamps and heaths. Rare plants occurring in Wadbilliga National Park include the Deua Gum and the small shrub, Kunzea sp. Wadbilliga.|$|R
50|$|The Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a park in South Belfast, Northern Ireland, {{covering}} almost 130 acre and {{is accessible}} from the Upper Malone Road. It includes meadows, <b>woodland,</b> <b>riverside</b> fields, formal rose gardens, a walled garden and a Japanese garden, {{as well as}} a children's playground, coffee shop, an orienteering course and many walks. It is owned by the people of Belfast and maintained by Belfast City Council's Parks and Amenities Section. On 14 July 2010, the park hosted annual International Rose Trials, the highlight of Rose Week, involving judges from around the world.|$|R
50|$|Leucojum aestivum (summer snowflake) has a wider natural range, {{taking in}} Europe (including the British Isles), {{southwest}} Asia and northern Iran, and growing in wetter habitats including damp <b>woodland,</b> <b>riversides</b> and swamps. Despite its common name it flowers from April to May, though {{later than the}} Spring Snowflake. It is a taller plant than Leucojum vernum, growing to around 60 cm (2 ft), but its flowers are smaller and are carried in an umbel of between three and seven. Its fleshy seed pods are inflated, allowing them to be dispersed by flood water. Leucojum aestivum subsp. pulchellum (Salisb.) Briq., native to the western Mediterranean Basin, is smaller: 20 cm (8 in), and flowers 2 weeks earlier, i.e., from mid-March.|$|R
5000|$|Marsh tits breed {{mostly in}} lowland areas, but can reach altitudes {{of up to}} 1,300 m. They prefer large areas of moist, broadleaved woodland, often oak or beech, though they can occupy wet alder <b>woodland,</b> <b>riverside</b> trees, parks and gardens or orchards. A study at Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire, England, found that marsh tits {{required}} mature trees with a shrub layer below the canopy, but that they avoided parts of the wood with lots of young trees. Another study in the United Kingdom found that during winter and while foraging, marsh tits spent more time than blue tits in the wood's understorey, and more time lower in the woodland canopy and understorey. Trees and shrubs in 10 breeding territories were also compared. The trees varied significantly between territories, but the shrub characteristics did not, suggesting that the shrubs were {{more important to the}} birds. In Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, marsh tits were [...] "largely absent" [...] from parts of the wood with a dense canopy but poor shrub cover.|$|R
