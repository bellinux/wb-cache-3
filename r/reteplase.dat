40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{summarize}} the published data on <b>reteplase,</b> {{the most recent}} thrombolytic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration {{for use in the}} management of acute myocardial infarction in adults. DATA SOURCES: Published data on <b>reteplase</b> identified by MEDLINE searches (January 1985 –June 1997), as well as other pertinent literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: <b>Reteplase</b> is a new thrombolytic agent derived from human tissue plasminogen activator. Its mechanism of action {{is similar to that of}} alteplase, but it differs in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Certain structural changes contribute to differences in pharmacokinetic properties such as a prolonged half-life (15 min), which allows it to be administered as two 10 -MU bolus injections. <b>Reteplase</b> has been shown to have fibrin specificity similar to that of alteplase, but with a lower binding affinity for fibrin. This enables <b>reteplase</b> to bind to the thrombus repeatedly and increases its fibrinolytic potential. In clinical trials, <b>reteplase</b> demonstrated more rapid and complete coronary patency compared with alteplase, without a significant increase in clinical adverse events. However, the improvement in coronary artery patency with <b>reteplase</b> versus alteplase did not result in a reduction in mortality in the GUSTO III trial. CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence that use of <b>reteplase</b> results in an improved coronary artery patency rate versus accelerated infusion alteplase, an improvement in mortality rate with <b>reteplase</b> was not shown. <b>Reteplase</b> may have an advantage over alteplase due to a more rapid and simpler dosing regimen, but the significance of this difference is yet to be determined.

40|$|Background Plasminogen {{activator}} {{therapy for}} {{acute myocardial infarction}} is limited by lack of achievement of early, complete, and sustained reperfusion in a substantial proportion of patients. Many phase II trials have supported the potential of combined fibrinolytic therapy and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition for improving reperfusion. We did a randomised, open-label trial to compare the effect of <b>reteplase</b> alone with <b>reteplase</b> plus abciximab in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Methods 16 588 patients in the first 6 h of evolving ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were randomly assigned standard-dose <b>reteplase</b> (n= 8260) or half-dose <b>reteplase</b> and full-dose abciximab (n= 8328). The primary endpoint was 30 -day mortality, and secondary endpoints included various complications of myocardial infarction. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings At 30 days, 488 (5 · 9 %) of patients in the <b>reteplase</b> group had died, compared with 468 (5 · 6 %) in the combined <b>reteplase</b> and abciximab group (odds ratio 0 · 95 [95 % CI 0 · 83 – 1 · 08], p= 0 · 43). There were fewer deaths or non-fatal reinfarctions with the combination than with <b>reteplase</b> alone, and there was less need for urgent revascularisation and fewer major non-fatal ischaemic complications of acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, there were more non-intracranial bleeding complications in the combination group. The rates of intracranial haemorrhage and non-fatal disabling stroke were similar. Interpretation Although combined <b>reteplase</b> and abciximab was not superior to standard <b>reteplase,</b> the 0 · 3 % absolute (5 % relative) decrease in 30 -day mortality fulfilled the criteria of non-inferiority. Combination therapy led to a consistent reduction in key secondary complications of myocardial infarction including reinfarction, which was partly counterbalanced by increased non-intracranial bleeding complications...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Among {{patients}} with acute myocardial infarction, combination reperfusion therapy with a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (abciximab) {{and a half}} dose of a plasminogen activator (<b>reteplase)</b> did not significantly reduce mortality at 30 days compared with a full dose of <b>reteplase.</b> Rates of nonfatal ischemic complications were significantly diminished. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the beneficial effects of abciximab and <b>reteplase</b> (combination therapy) on early nonfatal complications would translate into {{a reduction in the}} risk of death by 1 year. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: One-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (Global Use of Strategies To Open Coronary Arteries [GUSTO] V). Of 16 588 patients who had been treated in 820 community and referral hospitals in 20 countries between July 1999 and February 2001, mortality data were available for 16 453 (99. 2 %). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive (intravenously) a standard dose of <b>reteplase</b> (two 10 -U boluses, 30 minutes apart) or the combination of a standard dose of abciximab (0. 25 mg/kg bolus, 0. 125 microg/kg per minute infusion [maximum 10 micro g/min for 12 hours]) and a half dose of <b>reteplase</b> (two 5 -U boluses, 30 minutes apart). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: One-year all-cause mortality rates. RESULTS: All-cause mortality at 1 year occurred in 692 (8. 38 %) of 8260 patients in the <b>reteplase</b> group and 698 (8. 38 %) of the 8328 patients in the combination therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 00; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 90 - 1. 11; P>. 99). Reinfarction within the first 7 days occurred in 3. 5 % of patients in the <b>reteplase</b> group and 2. 3 % of patients in the combination therapy group, and was significantly associated with 1 -year mortality (22. 6 % in {{patients with}} reinfarction vs 8. 0 % in patients without reinfarction; HR, 3. 08; 95 % CI, 2. 53 - 3. 75; P<. 001).

We {{sought to}} compare {{platelet}} characteristics after <b>reteplase</b> and alteplase therapy {{in the setting}} of the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) -III trial. Background. Platelet function may be impaired during thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. The effects of <b>reteplase</b> and alteplase on platelet aggregation and major surface antigen expression during the first 24 h of infarction therapy are unknown. Methods. Platelet aggregation and receptor expression by flow cytometry were determined in 23 patients before thrombolysis and thereafter at 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Results. Aggregation was higher after <b>reteplase</b> at 24 h when induced by 5 μmol/liter adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (p = 0. 007), 10 μmol/liter ADP (p = 0. 02), collagen (p = 0. 003) and thrombin (p = 0. 009) than after alteplase. <b>Reteplase</b> therapy exhibited greater glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa (p = 0. 04), very late antigen- 2 (p = 0. 04) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (p = 0. 002) expression at 24 h. Trends toward decreased receptor expression early (3 to 6 h), followed by a progressive increase at 12 h and especially at 24 h occurred after both agents. Conclusions. In this prospective clinical ex vivo platelet study, similar patterns of platelet aggregation and surface receptor expression occurred during the first 24 h of coronary thrombolysis with <b>reteplase</b> and alteplase.

40|$|Background. About {{one third}} of {{patients}} with TIMI 3 after reperfusion have evidence of microvascular obstruction (MO) which represents an independent predictor of myocardial wall rupture.

Twenty male patients, mean age 58 years, affected by acute myocardial infarction, ten anterior and ten inferior, were treated with: full dose <b>reteplase</b> in ten, and half dose <b>reteplase</b> plus full dose abciximab (R+Abcx) in the other ten patients. In the fourth day after hospital admission, MRI STIR T 2 images were used to quantify MIsz, while 2 dflash cineloops were used after the injection of gadolinium, to quantify LV volumes, EF and to detect MO.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{frequency}} and determinants of re-infarction after thrombolytic treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Design: Observational study of national registry. Setting: Emergency ambulance services and admitting hospitals in England and Wales. Patients: 35 356 patients with STEMI given thrombolytic treatment in 2005 – 6. Main outcome measures: Re-infarction during hospital admission. Results: For 22 391 patients (63. 3 %) {{the presence or absence}} of re-infarction was recorded, and 1460 (6. 5 %) had re-infarction. Re-infarction rates with in-hospital treatment were similar for <b>reteplase</b> (6. 5 %) and tenecteplase (6. 4 %). When the interval from pre-hospital treatment to hospital arrival was greater than 30 minutes re-infarction rates were 12. 5 % for <b>reteplase,</b> and 11. 4 % for tenecteplase. Overall, re-infarction rates were higher after pre-hospital treatment with tenecteplase than <b>reteplase</b> (9. 6 % vs 6. 6 %, p = 0. 005). After multivariate analysis independent predictors of re-infarction for tenecteplase were pre-hospital treatment, OR 1. 44 (95 % CI 1. 21 to 1. 71, p< 0. 001) and weight in the highest quartile compared to the lowest, OR 1. 66 (95 % CI 1. 19 to 2. 31, p = 0. 003).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to further clarify the pro-fibrinolytic effects, and to explore the {{possible}} non-beneficial effects in ischemic organs, during exposure to pulsed ultrasound. This was accomplished by studies of the effects of different intensities of pulsed ultrasound exposure on the fibrinolytic properties of streptokinase and <b>reteplase.</b> Measurements were performed both following pre-exposure of the drugs and clots to pulsed ultrasound, and following concomitant exposure of clots and drugs. In the exploration of pro-fibrinolytic effects during ultrasound exposure it was shown that exposure of the streptokinase molecule to low-intensity, pulsed high frequency ultrasound modulates its fibrinolytic properties. The effects were present following ultrasound exposure of streptokinase solution and during ultrasound exposure of clots and streptokinase solution concomitantly. Depending on its intensity, modulation was observed as both increased and decreased fibrinolytic effects. Pre-exposure of <b>reteplase</b> solution to low-intensity ultrasound induced changes in the function of the <b>reteplase</b> molecule associated with enhanced fibrinolytic effects. Enhancement effects were also seen when the clots were pre-exposed to high intensities of ultrasound before or concomitantly with exposure to <b>reteplase</b> solution, suggesting that two different intensity-dependent mechanisms are involved in ultrasound-enhanced <b>reteplase</b> fibrinolysis. No decreased fibrinolytic effect of <b>reteplase</b> depending on ultrasound exposure could be seen. In an initial study of the fibrinolytic effects induced by a combination of Sonazoid® microbubbles and ultrasound, the effects of various ultrasound parameters on the microbubble destruction-rate was studied. It was shown that, at the same intensity level, the destruction-rate was faster outside the resonance frequency range. Five pulses were needed to achieve a fast destruction-rate. An ultrasound intensity of 0. 5 W/cm 2 was shown to be the lowest intensity yielding a fast destruction-rate of Sonazoid® microbubbles. The possible non-beneficial effects in ischemic organs of ultrasound with characteristics used to enhance fibrinolysis in vivo were studied in two different models, one using non-perfused myocardia in pigs, and one using non-perfused brain tissue in rats. It was shown that prolonged exposure of low intensity pulsed ultrasound might increase instantaneous myocardial damage. However, the same frequency, intensity and duration of pulsed ultrasound did not seem to enhance ischemic damage in non-perfused rat brain or induce any damage in the perfused rat brain. In conclusion, ultrasound-enhanced fibrinolysis is induced by multiple mechanisms and drug specific reactions, and this study shows the importance of evaluating the effects of exposure on ischemic tissue, aiming at ultrasound-enhanced fibrinolysis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{studied the}} outcome of diabetics {{enrolled}} in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) V trial to assess whether the combination of half-dose <b>reteplase</b> and abciximab provides any propitious benefits over standard fibrinolytic therapy in diabetic patients. BACKGROUND: Diabetics with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) have a worse outcome compared with nondiabetics. Higher-risk patients are usually more likely to benefit from advances in medical therapy. METHODS: We analyzed diabetic patients enrolled in the GUSTO V trial to assess {{the outcome of}} those randomized to the combination of half-dose <b>reteplase</b> and abciximab versus those randomized to <b>reteplase.</b> We also evaluated whether any differences existed in presentation and outcome of MI among the diabetics versus the nondiabetics enrolled in the study. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 13782 nondiabetics and 2633 diabetics. Compared to nondiabetics, diabetics had a significantly higher mortality at 30 days (8. 5 % vs. 5. 1 %, p < 0. 001) and at 1 year (12. 7 % vs. 7. 5 %, p < 0. 001). Among the diabetic subset, no significant difference existed {{in the incidence of}} 30 -day (8. 8 % vs. 8. 2 %, p = 0. 52) or 1 -year mortality (13. 0 % vs. 12. 4 %, p = 0. 62) among patients randomized to <b>reteplase</b> compared to those receiving combination of abciximab and <b>reteplase.</b> The incidence of reinfarction (2. 5 % vs. 4. 3 %, p = 0. 013), recurrent ischemia (11. 8 % vs. 14. 9 %, p = 0. 017), and urgent revascularization (10. 9 % vs. 13. 3 %, p = 0. 055) at seven days was lower in diabetics treated with the combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to nondiabetics, diabetics continue to have a worse outcome with MI. Although combination therapy did not provide a survival benefit, nonfatal ischemic outcomes, including reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, and urgent revascularization, were substantially reduced. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study {{aimed to}} compare primary {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PPCI) versus <b>reteplase</b> {{in terms of}} clinical and para-clinical outcomes; as well as cost-effectiveness in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the method of choice in all patients especially those at higher risks. But an on-site professional team in a 24 / 7 facilitated system is a difficult goal to achieve in many areas and countries, therefore the cost-effectiveness of these two treatment strategies (PPCI and <b>reteplase)</b> needs to be discussed. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 220 patients presented with STEMI who were admitted to a university hospital between January 2014 to July 2016. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups of 120, either receiving <b>reteplase</b> or PPCI. Clinical outcomes were considered duration of hospital stay and MACE (Major Advanced Cardiovascular Events) including death, cerebrovascular accident, need for repeat revascularization, and major bleeding. LVEF (Left ventricular ejection fraction) was considered as a para-clinical outcome. The outcomes and total hospital cost were compared between two treatment groups. Results: Demographic characteristics between two groups of PPCI or <b>reteplase</b> didn’t show any significant differences. But in para-clinical outcomes, patients in PPCI group showed higher LVEF, compared with <b>reteplase</b> group (45. 9 ± 11. 5 % versus 42. 0 ± 11. 8 %; P = 0. 02). Complication rates were similar in both groups but repeat revascularization or coronary artery bypass surgery was more prevalent in those who received thrombolytic therapy (P < 0. 05). Length of hospital stay in both groups was similar in two groups but total cost was higher in patients who have received PPCI. (147769406. 9 ± 103929358. 9 Tomans vs. 117116656. 9 ± 67356122. 6 Tomans; respectively, P = 0. 01). Conclusions: In STEMI patients who present during off-hours, thrombolytic therapy seems to represent a safe alternative to PPCI. Higher costs for patients with PPCI may be decreased with shorter duration of hospital stays according to guidelines. </p...|$|E

40|$|Vorhaben: In der PROMPT-Studie (Platelet Receptor Antibodies in Order to Manage Peripheral Artery Thrombosis) konnte gezeigt werden, dass bei der Behandlung akuter Gefäßverschlüsse in Becken-Bein-Arterien die Kombinationstherapie mit dem Fibrinolytikum Urokinase und dem Glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa-Rezeptor-Antagonist Abciximab sicher war und durch die Kombination die Effizienz der Therapie verbessert werden konnte. Aufbauend auf den Ergebnissen der PROMPT-Studie war das Ziel der in gleicher Weise prospektiven, randomisiert durchgeführten APART-Studie (Antibodies of Platelet Receptors and <b>Reteplase</b> for Thrombolysis in Peripheral Arteries), die Kombinationstherapie Urokinase+Abciximab mit <b>Reteplase</b> – einem Fibrinolytikum der 3. Generation – ebenfalls in Kombination mit Abciximab auf Thrombolyseerfolg und Sicherheit zu vergleichen sowie Langzeitergebnisse zu erhalten. <b>Reteplase</b> wurde wegen seiner theoretischen Vorteile gegenüber Urokinase ausgewählt. Mit dem Ziel des Datenpoolings wurde in beiden Studien das identische Studiendesign verwendet. Material und Methoden: Im Rahmen der PROMPT-Studie (1998 – 1999) wurden 70 Patienten (m 39 / w 31) behandelt. 50 Patienten wurde Urokinase+Abciximab appliziert. Die 20 Patienten der Kontrollgruppe erhielten Urokinase mit einem Placebopräparat. Die APART-Studie (2000 – 2002) wurde ebenfalls mit 70 Patienten (m 43 / w 27) durchgeführt. Hier wurden 50 Patienten mit Reteplase+Abciximab (R+A) und 20 Patienten mit Urokinase+Abciximab (U+A) therapiert. Nach einer initialen Bolusgabe wurde in beiden Studien die weitere Applikation der Thrombolytika mittels Pulsed-Spray-Technik durchgeführt. Über die ersten 2 Stunden hinweg erhielten die Patienten 4. 000 IU/min Urokinase und wenn nötig anschließend noch 2. 000 IU/min Urokinase. In der R+A-Gruppe wurde den Patienten in den ersten 2 Stunden 1 IU/h <b>Reteplase</b> und bei Bedarf in den folgenden Stunden 0, 5 IU/h <b>Reteplase</b> verabreicht. Während der ersten 2 Behandlungsstunden erfolgte alle 30 Minuten eine digitale Subtraktionsangiographie (DSA) und anschließend alle 60 Minuten. Bei gleichen statistischen Voraussetzungen konnte zur weiteren Datenanalyse aus den U+A-Gruppen beider Studien eine U+A-Behandlungsgruppe (n = 70) gebildet werden, welche mit der R+A-Gruppe (n = 50) verglichen wurde. Das Langzeit-Follow-up wurde in der R+A-Gruppe nach 750 ± 208 Tagen und in der U+A-Gruppe nach 1127 ± 443 Tagen durchgeführt. Die Untersuchungen erfolgten mittels Duplex-Sonographie (FKDS), Kernspin-Angiographie und DSA. Ergebnisse: Hinsichtlich des Thrombolyseerfolgs gab es zwischen den beiden Behandlungsgruppen keinen wesentlichen Unterschied. Mit 120 Minuten vs. 205 Minuten war die Lysegeschwindigkeit in der U+A-Gruppe signifikant höher (p = 0, 001). Major-Komplikationen kamen in der R+A-Gruppe häufiger vor, wobei in beiden Gruppen keine intrakraniellen Blutungen auftraten. Minor-Komplikationen ereigneten sich in der U+A-Gruppe signifikant seltener. Die Reokklusionsrate im Langzeit-Follow-up war mit 48 % in der R+A- und 45 % in der U+A-Gruppe nahezu ausgeglichen. Die Amputationsrate lag bei 1 Major-Amputation (Oberschenkel) pro Gruppe. Schlussfolgerung: Die Thrombolysetherapien mit <b>Reteplase</b> und Urokinase in Kombination mit Abciximab waren insgesamt effektiv und sicher. Jedoch war die Kombinationstherapie mit Urokinase+Abciximab signifikant schneller und mit weniger lysebedingten Komplikationen verbunden. Die niedrige Amputationsrate in beiden Behandlungsgruppen könnte Abciximab zugeschrieben werden. Purpose: The PROMPT-study (Platelet Receptor Antibodies in Order to Manage Peripheral Artery Thrombosis) {{showed that}} a {{combination}} therapy using urokinase plus abciximab – a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex receptor inhibitor – in order to manage acute occlusions in peripheral arteries was safe and efficient. Based on these results the APART-study (Antibodies of Platelet Receptors and <b>Reteplase</b> for Thrombolysis in Peripheral Arteries) was performed to prospectively compare a combination therapy of the third-generation thrombolytic agent <b>reteplase</b> and abciximab with urokinase plus abciximab. Because of its theoretical benefit compared to urokinase, <b>reteplase</b> was selected. To create a data base for further analysis the studies were designed in the same fashion. Material and Methods: From 1998 to 1999 70 patients (m 39 / f 31) were randomized in the PROMPT-study. 50 patients received urokinase plus abciximab and 20 patients were treated with urokinase plus placebo. Also 70 patients (m 43 / f 27) {{were enrolled in the}} APART-study (2000 to 2002). <b>Reteplase</b> plus abciximab was applied to 50 patients and 20 patients were assigned to the urokinase-abciximab treatment group. After a bolus administration in both trials the thrombolytic agents were administered by pulsed spray technique. The dose rate of urokinase was 4, 000 IU per minute for the first two hours and 2, 000 IU per minute until completion of thrombolysis. <b>Reteplase</b> was given at 1 U/h during the first two hours and reduced at a rate of 0. 5 U/h. In the first two hours of treatment digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed every 30 minutes and at 60 -minutes intervals thereafter. On the basis of equal statistical preconditions the two urokinase-abciximab groups were conjuncted for further data analysis. So the created urokinase-abciximab group (n = 70) was compared with the reteplase-abciximab group (n = 50). Long-term follow-up was accomplished after a period of 750 ± 208 days in the reteplase-abciximab group and after 1127 ± 443 days in the urokinase-abciximab group. Doppler ultrasound, MR angiography and DSA were used for the assessment of patency. Results: Respectively there were no differences between the groups in the success of treatment. In the urokinase-abciximab group the required treatment time was significantly (120 min vs. 205 min, p = 0. 001) lower. Major complications occured more often in the reteplase-abciximab group whereas in both treatment groups no intracranial bleedings were counted. The rate of minor complications however was significantly lower in the urokinase-abciximab group. During the long-term follow up the rate of reocclusions was nearly balanced (48 % <b>reteplase</b> plus abciximab, 45 % urokinase plus abciximab). In each group only 1 major amputation was counted. Conclusion: Altogether the thrombolytic therapy performed in the PROMPT- and APART-study using <b>reteplase</b> or urokinase in combination of abciximab was safe and efficient. However in the urokinase-abciximab group the time required for thrombolysis was significant lower combined with less bleeding complications. The low amputation rate in both groups may be attributed to abciximab...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early reocclusion of recanalized arteries {{has been}} {{observed}} after thrombolysis for acute coronary occlusion and {{has been attributed to}} platelet activation after exposure to thrombolytic agents. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the rate of reocclusion during intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke and the effect of reocclusion on functional outcome. METHODS: Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke at our center between September 2000 and May 2002 received a maximum total dose of 4 U of <b>reteplase</b> intra-arterially in 1 -U increments via superselective catheterization. Pharmacologic thrombolysis was supplemented by mechanical thrombolysis with balloon angioplasty or snare manipulation at the occlusion site. Angiography was performed after each unit of <b>reteplase</b> or mechanical maneuver, and the images were interpreted by a blinded reviewer. Reocclusion was defined as partial or complete initial recanalization with occlusion recurring at the same site as documented by angiography during the endovascular treatment. Reocclusions were treated by further pharmacologic and/or mechanical thrombolysis according to the discretion of the treating physician. Clinical evalu-ations were performed before and 24 hr, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months after treatment...|$|E
