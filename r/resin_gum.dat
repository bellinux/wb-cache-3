40|$|Abstract	 Commiphora quadricincta (Schweinf ex. Engl.) has a resin-gum that {{is widely}} used as a folk {{medicine}} in Saudi Arabia. Extracts of the resin-gum, leaves and roots have been studied for their antibacterial activity. The results clearly show that the toluene-methanol extract of the leaves and roots has antibacterial activity against Yersinia enterocolitica and Staphylococcus epidermidis, whereas the toluene-methanol extract of the <b>resin</b> <b>gum</b> has activity against Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of the <b>resin</b> <b>gum</b> is dependent upon the solvent used. Petroleum ether is the best solvent followed by alcohols (ethanol and methanol, respectively). The petroleum ether extract of the resin-gum has activity against {{three out of four}} of the species studied namely, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli. The ethanol extract has antibacterial activity against Y. enterocolitica and S. epidermidis and the methanol extract has activity against E. coli and S. epidermidis. Diethyl ether has an activity pattern similar to ethanol, but it was less potent. Benzene and chlorofo~ extracts have similar activity against E. coli only. The water extract of resin-gum had an inhibitory influence both in vitro and in vivo against bacterial viability. Key Words: Antibacterial, Activity, Commiphora. Quadricincta...|$|E

Curcumin is an antioxidan that can slow cell damagescaused by toxicant. The purpose of this research was to find out the role of Curcuma zedoariaâ€™s rhizome for minimizing damage ofmicroanatomical structure of liver caused by alcoholic toxicant. Samples in the research were 24 mice (Mus musculus) Swiss Webster. They were grouped randomly into 8 groups. Each group was treated as follow. Group A (control group) was given fresh water. GroupB was given whisky. Group C was given 500 mg Curcuma zedoaria/kg body weight. Group D was given 750 mg Curcuma zedoaria/kg body weight. Group E was given Curcuma zedoaria/kg body weight. Group F was given whisky and, 2 hours later, 500 mg Curcumazedoaria/kg body weight. Group G was given whisky and, 2 hours later, 750 mg Curcuma zedoaria/kg body weight. The last groupwas given whisky and, 2 hours later, 1000 mg Curcuma zedoaria/kg body weight. The treatment was carried out during 8 days. Amicroanatomy slide of liver was made by using parafin method and Hematoxylin-Eosin dying. Data was analyzed by using descriptivemethod, comparing between the control group and the experiment groups. The result of the research showed that the powder of the Curcuma zedoariaâ€™s rhizome has been useful in minimizing damage ofhepar microanatomy structure of the mice affected by alcohol.

40|$|The work {{contains}} {{studies of}} the chemical composition of adducts {{on the basis of}} terpenoids and maleic anhydride to provide controlled synthesis {{on the basis of their}} secondary products with specified performance characteristics. The determination of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the mixtures of resin acids of pine turpentine and rosin by their methyl esters was performed with GLC analysis; the components of pine resin, rosin, turpentine, adducts was performed with NMR spectroscopy, functional groups in the original terpenoid resins and products of their interaction with oxygen-containing compounds (maleopimaric acid) and terpenoidmaleic adducts by the method of IR spectroscopy. Good convergence of the results obtained by NMR spectroscopy and GLC analysis on the composition of pine <b>resin,</b> <b>gum</b> rosin and turpentine confirms their authenticity. Using the obtained experimental and calculated data the composition of terpenoidmaleic adducts wasset. When obtaining resin terpenoidmaleic adducts, the composition of turpentine solution of resin varied in the range from 30 / 70 to 70 / 30 wt %, the calculated amount of maleic anhydride to link all resin acids with conjugated double bonds and terpene hydrocarbons varied from 57. 7 to 38. 3 wt %. It is shown that when modification of turpentine composition from 30 / 70 to 70 / 30 wt % with maleic anhydride increases, there is a significant change in the compositions of obtained terpenoidmaleic adducts of rosin. When comparing experimental data and theoretical calculations regularity is established in the change of composition of terpenoidmaleic of rosin adducts obtained from various terpentine: content of maleopimaric acid naturally increases with the increase of resin acids and the content of terpenoidmaleic adducts decreases. It is shown th at terpinoidmaleic adducts are multicomponent sys-tems composed of maleopimaric acid, terpinolene ad ducts, and of resin acids, which do not react with maleic anhydride. By varying the composition of the turpentine and the amount of maleic anhydride, adducts with different content components can be obtained, and hence, regulating their specifications. The efficiency of using the methods of NMR and IR spectroscopy to study the composition terpenoidmaleic adducts is demonstrated...|$|E
