It is shown that a circular notch cut along the free edges of the indenter can totally eliminate the large corner stresses.

Despite {{the fact that}} it is one of the largest {{vascular}} organs in the body, clinical and surgical cases have given an incidence of 3 % of secondary malignances of the organ. Nevertheless, thyroid metastases are not an exceptional finding at autopsy, they are encountered in 2 % to 24 % of the patients with malignant neoplasm. Soft tissue sarcomas metastatic to the thyroid are extremely rare as the majority of thyroid metastasis are caused by tumors of the kidneys, lungs, mammary glands, ovaries, and colon or by melanomas.

40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{the influence of}} pre-existing, elastic surface stresses on instrumented sharp indentation. The surface is modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic elastoplastic solid {{in the context of}} linear elasticity and Mises plasticity with isotropic strain hardening and associative flow rule. Prior to indentation, a homogeneous, biaxial, elastic stress state may exist in the substrate. The influence of the initial elastic surface stresses on the force-depth response of instrumented sharp indentation tests, such as Vickers and Berkovich, was analyzed. The unique connection of the indentation loading response and the average initial stress is based on a relation of the stresses <b>right</b> under the <b>indenter</b> which holds universally for nearly incompressible materials...|$|R

The path of phase transformation and distribution of transformed region on different crystallographic orientations were investigated. The results indicate the anisotropic behavior of monocrystalline germanium. The nanoindentation-induced phase transformation from diamond cubic structure to β-tin-Ge {{was found in the}} subsurface region beneath the tool when indented on the (010) plane, while direct amorphization was observed in the region <b>right</b> under the <b>indenter</b> when the germanium was loaded along the [101] and [111] directions. The transformed phases extend along the <[*] 110 [*]>[*]slip direction of germanium. The depth and shape of the deformed layers after unloading are quite different according to the crystal orientation of the indentation plane. The study results suggest that phase transformation is the dominant mechanism of deformation of monocrystalline germanium film in nanoindentation.|$|R

It does not support footnotes or endnotes.

As such, WordPad is well suited for taking notes, writing letters and stories, or for usage in various tablets, PCs, and smart phones.

A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2013 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to gray. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2013 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange.

40|$|The medical field, and {{surgeons}} in particular, {{are turning}} to engineers to develop systems that help them learn their craft better. Mannequin-based systems, animal labs and surgery on cadavers each have drawbacks that could be addressed through realistic computer-based surgical simulation systems. To generate a simulation that includes both tactile/haptic and visual feedback, one must know what the material properties of tissue are, so that a finite element or other model can generate the proper predictions for interactions between surgical instruments and tissue. This thesis presents the design, construction, characterization, and use of a mini- mally invasive surgical instrument designed to measure the linear visco-elastic prop- erties of solid organs. The Tissue Material Property Sampling Tool, or TeMPeST 1 -D, applies a small amplitude vibration normal {{to the surface of}} an organ such as liver or spleen, and records the applied force and displacement. It has a range of motion of up to lmm, and can apply up to 300 mN force with a 5 mm <b>right</b> circular <b>indenter.</b> The open loop bandwidth of the system is approximately 100 Hz, which is greater than the bandwidth of both the human visual and motor control systems. The relationships between indentation force and displacement and material prop- erties such as the elastic modulus of tissue are presented, and models are developed that show the expected response to a standard tissue model. Characterization and calibration tests demonstrate the response of the prototype components. Experi- ments performed on spring and mass elements and on silicone gel samples, which mimic tissue response, show that the TeMPeST 1 -D can accurately measure their force-displacement responses. (cont.) The TeMPeST 1 -D and its data acquisition system are intended to be portable, to be easily transported to and used in an operating room. The system was used in proof-of-concept experiments performed on live pigs; an example of the measured properties of porcine liver is presented. The TeMPeST 1 -D is {{the first in a series}} of instruments that will be developed to support the generation of a comprehensive atlas of tissue material properties. by Mark Peter Ottensmeyer.
