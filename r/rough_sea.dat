5|$|The Newfoundland Weather Center issued {{severe weather}} {{warnings}} for portions of Atlantic Canada {{prior to the}} arrival of the extratropical remnant of Gabrielle. <b>Rough</b> <b>sea</b> warnings were issued for waters off of the Avalon Peninsula of eastern Newfoundland, and fishermen were recommended to remain away from the sea.|$|E
5|$|As Julia never posed any {{significant}} threat to land, damage {{related to the}} storm was minimal. Trace amounts of rain reportedly fell across the Cape Verde islands, causing locally light flooding and minor inconveniences. Gusts battering the territory peaked at 30mph (48km/h), resulting in some wind damage to crops. In addition, these winds produced <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> conditions, and high waves posed few threats along coastlines.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is <b>Rough</b> <b>Sea</b> at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E

5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis for {{at least}} four days; a total of up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E
5|$|William and a tearful Mary {{were married}} in St James's Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on 4 November 1677. Mary {{accompanied}} her husband on a <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> crossing back to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and {{they were forced to}} land at the small village of Ter Heijde, and walk through the frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On 14 December, they made a formal entry to The Hague in a grand procession.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tropical storm, warnings were issued for the Cayman Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus, and Ciego de Ávila on September28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the Cayman Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams cleaned out storm drains and readied shelters. Thunderstorms in Grand Cayman forced Cayman Airways to cancel all express flights to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman on October29; weather-resistant jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> conditions.|$|E

5|$|New {{terrain is}} {{available}} in the game: Wasteland, which impedes the movement of ground vehicles; Ruins, which provide a minor defense bonus for ground units and hiding places in Fog of War; Fire, which is impassable and illuminates the surrounding area during Fog of War; <b>Rough</b> <b>Sea,</b> which impedes the movement of naval units; Mist, which provides a defense bonus and hiding places for naval units; and Meteors and Plasma. Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance produced days of prolonged {{rainfall and}} gusty winds across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Localized flooding and <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> conditions caused extensive road damage, infrastructure failures, and some beach erosion along coastlines. During {{the passage of}} the storm, numerous residents were left without water and power, and a state of emergency was declared for several Caribbean nations. Schools, businesses and some government offices across all of the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis were closed until storm conditions abated. The weather system ultimately accounted for substantial monetary losses throughout these areas, pinned at over $22million (2010USD). In addition, Otto was widely {{regarded as one of the}} wettest storms in the history of the northeastern Caribbean, repeatedly shattering various rainfall records.|$|E

50|$|Tropical Storm Vicente brought {{showers and}} {{thunderstorms}} to southern China but had little impact. <b>Rough</b> <b>seas</b> {{produced by the}} storm caused the drownings of two swimmers in Ham Tin Wan of Sai Kung.

25|$|At {{around this}} time in his life, John Beckett recollected a journey to the Great Blasket Island, off {{the west coast of}} Ireland, which was made in a currach over a <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> during the 1940s, when the island was still inhabited. He enjoyed the {{experience}} of living and drinking with the locals in their rough cottages and listened to the traditional music and songs that they performed. He relished the earthiness of plain, simple Mediterranean ceramics and loved Byzantine icons (especially those darkened with age).|$|E
25|$|The BRP Alcaraz, is the Philippine Navy's newest warship. BRP Alcaraz (PF-16) is the Philippine Navy's second Hamilton-class cutter {{and sister}} ship of the BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15). The BRP Alcaraz has 14 {{officers}} and 74 crew members led by Capt. Ernesto Baldovino. It {{is capable of}} conducting patrols {{for long periods of}} time and can withstand heavy weather and <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> conditions. BRP Alcaraz was named after Commodore Ramon Alcaraz, a Philippine Navy officer, who commanded a patrol boat that shot down three Japanese aircraft.|$|E
25|$|When transiting a surf line, or {{in other}} <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> conditions, the {{movement}} of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide cylinder racks to stow the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks to stow other heavy equipment. Larger vessels, particularly live-aboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive.|$|E

25|$|Captain Lee {{feared the}} heavy sea could {{break up the}} ship. He {{therefore}} had the crew lower her motor boat and start putting people ashore. The boat completed two trips, putting ashore a total of 63 people including eight women, three babies {{and a number of}} elderly men. Then the <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> disabled the boat and it was stranded on the beach. They were left with no shelter and only the boat's water and food rations to sustain them. Another 42 people, including Captain Lee, were left aboard the beached ship.|$|E
25|$|The English ships {{except in}} the rigging and masts had {{sustained}} only little damage, since the Spanish aim was to board and overpower. None of this was achieved as the English fire or the <b>rough</b> <b>sea,</b> depending on sources, had been strong enough not to allow the Spanish galleys into grappling position. The English casualties were only light at best but soon the wind had died down and therefore were becalmed just before Gibraltar itself. They were {{in desperate need of}} shot and powder as most of the bigger ships were close to being out of ammunition {{by the end of the}} action.|$|E
25|$|Medusa fishes are {{a family}} Centrolophidae of 31 species of perciform fishes. They {{are found in}} {{temperate}} and tropical waters throughout the world, usually feeding on fish, crustaceans and small squid near <b>rough</b> <b>sea</b> floors on continental shelf and slope. Examples are barrelfish, southern driftfish, imperial blackfish, the Japanese and pelagic butterfish, the New Zealand and Tasmanian ruffe, and the common, silver and white warehou. The young of some species associate with jellyfish, which provides them with protection from predators and opportunities to scavenge {{the remains of the}} jellyfish's meals. The young of other species associate with large masses of floating kelp.|$|E
