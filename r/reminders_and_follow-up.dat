40|$|<b>Reminder</b> letters <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> {{telephone}} calls {{were used to}} increase influenza vaccination acceptance by 273 well elderly registered at an urban community health centre. The net effect of the reminder letters was to increase overall coverage to 43 %, from 17 % in the previous year. Follow-up {{telephone calls}} to patients who had not responded to the letters increased coverage to only 55 %. Calculation of costs per additional vaccination given revealed {{that the use of}} reminder letters alone was much more cost-effective than follow-up telephone calls in increasing coverage. However, with the current fee-for-service reimbursement by medical care insurance in Ontario, neither means of improving vaccination coverage would result in net practice earnings. The implications for an effective and efficient annual influenza program in Canada are discussed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ethnic {{minority}} and native Dutch groups {{with a low}} socioeconomic status (SES) are underrepresented in cardiometabolic health checks, despite being at higher risk. We investigated response and participation rates using three consecutive inexpensive-to-costly culturally adapted invitation steps for a health risk assessment (HRA) and further testing of high-risk individuals during prevention consultations (PC). METHODS: A total of 1690 non-Western immigrants and native Dutch with a low SES (35 - 70 years) from six GP practices were eligible for participation. We used a 'funnelled' invitation design comprising three increasingly cost-intensive steps: (1) all patients received a postal invitation; (2) postal non-responders were approached by telephone; (3) final non-responders were approached face-to-face by their GP. The effect of ethnicity, ethnic mix of GP practice, and patient characteristics (gender, age, SES) on response and participation were assessed by means of logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall response was 70 % (n = 1152), of whom 62 % (n = 712) participated in the HRA. This was primarily accomplished through the postal and telephone invitations. Participants from GP practices in the most deprived neighbourhoods had the lowest response and HRA participation rates. Of the HRA participants, 29 % (n = 207) were considered high-risk, of whom 59 % (n = 123) participated in the PC. PC participation was lowest among native Dutch with a low SES. CONCLUSIONS: Underserved populations {{can be reached by}} a low-cost culturally adapted postal approach with a <b>reminder</b> <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> telephone calls. The added value of the more expensive face-to-face invitation was negligible. PC participation rates were acceptable. Efforts should be particularly targeted at practices in the most deprived areas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background International {{health policy}} surveys {{are used to}} compare and {{evaluate}} health system performance, but {{little is known about}} the effects of non-response. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of non-response in the Norwegian part of the Commonwealth Fund international health policy survey in 2009. Methods As part of an international health policy survey in 2009 a cross-sectional survey was conducted in Norway among a representative sample of Norwegian general practitioners. 1 400 randomly selected GPs were sent a postal questionnaire including questions about the Norwegian health care system, the quality of the GPs' own practice and the cooperation with specialist health care. The survey included three postal <b>reminders</b> <b>and</b> a telephone <b>follow-up</b> of postal non-respondents. The main outcome measures were increase in response rate for each reminder, the effects of demographic and practice variables on response, the effects of non-response on survey estimates, and the cost-effectiveness of each reminder. Results After three postal <b>reminders</b> <b>and</b> one telephone <b>follow-up,</b> the response rate was 59. 1 %. Statistically significant differences between respondents and non-respondents were found for three variables; group vs. solo practice (p = 0. 01), being a specialist or not (p Conclusions The response rate in the Norwegian survey was satisfactory, and the effect of non-response was small indicating adequate representativeness.

40|$|Low {{response}} rates {{are a common}} problem in surveys of family physicians leading to uncertainty {{about the validity of}} results. In this study, the authors examined the association between multiple <b>reminders</b> <b>and</b> nonresponse bias, survey estimates and costs in a survey of family physicians in Norway (N = 3, 463). After three postal <b>reminders</b> <b>and</b> one telephone <b>follow-up,</b> the response rate was 65. 9 %. They analyzed differences in nine demographic and practice variables between respondents and nonrespondents, the effect of non-response bias on survey estimates, and the cost-effectiveness of each reminder. Statistically significant differences between respondents and nonrespondents were found for six variables. However, demographic and practice variables had little association with the main outcome variables, and the overall survey estimates changed little with additional reminders. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the final reminders was poor...|$|R

40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1982 routine annual {{influenza}} vaccination was offered, by <b>reminder</b> letters <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> telephone calls, to 273 independent elderly individuals registered at a community health clinic in Hamilton, Ont. The demographic and geographic characteristics and the health beliefs of those who either accepted or did not accept the vaccine were compared. Among those who received reminder letters {{there were no significant}} differences in the rates of vaccine acceptance according to age, sex, household composition or ease of access to the clinic. The patients who reported having previously experienced side effects from the vaccine and perceived a lack of efficacy of the vaccine were more likely not to accept it this time. Both a lack of effort by health care providers (to promote vaccination) and patient behaviour appeared to contribute to pre-existing low levels of influenza vaccination coverage. Although physicians' efforts to inform patients about the vaccination clinics resulted in a tripling of the overall rate of acceptance of the vaccine, there remained a "hard core" of almost half the patients who were unwilling to receive the vaccine, apparently because they perceived its risks to outweigh its benefits...|$|R
40|$|Achieving a high {{response}} rate is often expensive and time consuming. Does an extensive survey effort change prevalence estimates and exposure-disease relations? In 1998 – 1999, the authors conducted a population-based respiratory health survey in two Norwegian counties (Oslo, n = 20, 000; Hordaland, n = 5, 000) of {{a random sample}} of the adult population aged 15 – 70 years. A postal questionnaire was mailed, with as many as two reminder letters. A 25 % random sample of postal nonresponders was contacted by ordinary or cellular telephone. Cumulative {{response rate}}s after the first mailing, first <b>reminder,</b> second <b>reminder,</b> <b>and</b> telephone <b>follow-up</b> were 42. 7 %, 60. 7 %, 68. 3 %, and 79. 9 %, respectively. Compared with initial postal responders, responders at later stages were younger, and more were male. Late responders had a lower educational level, were more often smokers, and were occupationally exposed to dusts or gases more frequently. After the authors adjusted for these factors, late responders were found to have less asthma, attacks of breathlessness, and hay fever. Hardly any changes in prevalences and odds ratios were noted when initial responders were compared with all responders. The additional contribution of sending <b>reminder</b> letters <b>and</b> conducting a telephone follow-up to prevalence estimates and the exposure-disease relation was small. A single letter would have produced nearly the same prevalence estimates and risk factor associations. asthma; data collection; epidemiologic methods; health care; interviews; postal service; questionnaires; sign...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The vast {{majority}} of youth who lived through the Bosnian war were exposed to multiple traumatic events, including interpersonal violence, community destruction, {{and the loss of}} a loved one. This study examined factors that predict post-war psychological adjustment, specifically posttraumatic stress, in Bosnian adolescents. DESIGN: Regression analyses evaluated theorized differential relations between three types of post-war stressors - exposure to trauma <b>reminders,</b> loss <b>reminders,</b> <b>and</b> intrafamilial conflict - specific coping strategies, and posttraumatic stress symptom dimensions. METHODS: We examined 555 Bosnian adolescents, aged 15 - 19 years, to predict their long-term posttraumatic stress reactions in the aftermath of war. RESULTS: Findings indicated that post-war exposure to trauma <b>reminders,</b> loss <b>reminders,</b> <b>and</b> family conflict, as well as engagement and disengagement coping strategies, predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms. Secondary control engagement coping responses to all three types of post-war stressors were inversely associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms, whereas primary control engagement coping responses to family conflict were inversely associated with hyperarousal symptoms. Disengagement responses to trauma <b>reminders</b> <b>and</b> family conflict were positively associated with re-experiencing symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings shed light on ways in which trauma <b>reminders,</b> loss <b>reminders,</b> <b>and</b> family conflict may intersect with coping responses to influence adolescent postwar adjustment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} a nurse-delivered adherence {{intervention in}} a preliminary randomized controlled trial among 70 HIV-positive outpatients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Beijing, China. In both arms, participants received a 30 -min educational session, a pillbox, and a referral to a peer support group.

Survey assessments and blood draws occurred at baseline, post-intervention (13 weeks), <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> (25 weeks). Primary outcomes were 7 -day and 30 -day adherence assessed by self-report and electronic drug monitoring (EDM), and secondary outcomes were HIV- 1 RNA viral load and CD 4 count.
