40|$|Whereas {{a growing}} body of {{research}} has examined the consumer-related implications of deceptive advertising, the stock market consequences stemming from the regulatory exposure of such infractions remain largely unexplored. In a step to address this gap, the current research examines the effect of <b>regulatory</b> <b>reports</b> of misleading ads on firm stock prices. Results from an event study, focusing on the pharmaceutical industry as the empirical context, show an average abnormal return of - 0. 91 % associated with <b>regulatory</b> <b>reports</b> of deceptive advertising. Analysis of the abnormal returns, however, reveals that the stock market response to these reports is shaped by omission bias, in that investors penalize commission violations more than omission violations. Furthermore, firm reputation is found to moderate the penalty for commission violations. In addition, two experiments examine the effect of such violations on investor beliefs. The first helps elucidate the process mechanism underlying the observed stock market effects and the second provides insights regarding the reputation-omission bias interaction for firms committing repeat violations. Overall, our findings provide important theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications regarding the role of financial markets in regulating deceptive ad practices. deceptive advertising, omission bias, firm reputation, event study, experiment, pharmaceutical industry...|$|E

40|$|We hypothesize that, {{in their}} annual {{accounting}} reports, insurers allocate premiums and losses from multistate policies to reduce total state taxes. To test this prediction, we examine firm-level data, {{collected from the}} publicly-available statutory reports used to compute tax bases and filed with each state government. If insurers manage allocations to avoid taxes, we anticipate an inverse relation between the tax rate and the premium-to-loss ratio, which is the industry's standard measure {{of the price of}} a unit of coverage. Firm-specific prices are computed using premium and loss information from the annual <b>regulatory</b> <b>reports</b> filed with each state in which an insurer underwrites. Primary analysis is conducted on 12, 573 insurer-state observations from 1993. We find the premium-to-loss ratio is decreasing in state tax rates, consistent with multistate insurers managing their annual accounting reports to shift premiums (losses) to more (less) favorably taxed states. ...|$|E
