In this paper, the power balance theory based DSTATCOM {{is used for}} power quality enhancement like current harmonic mitigation, power factor correction (PFC), reactive power compensation, load balancing and neural current compensation and load balancing. A non-isolated star/delta transformer is to reduce dc-link voltage v_(dc) of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) and neutral current compensation. The reference source currents can be extracted quickly by using proposed power balance theory.

30|$|However, {{different}} from any cellular channel in the scenario of Fig.  1, there is the same frequency interference among outband D 2 D links since the number of non-overlapping frequency bands used by WiFi links is only 3. Also, since the transmission powers of the outband D 2 D links may be changed at any time, {{the value of the}} same frequency interfering value (i.e., Fi) only comes from what is currently known. The current Fi may also be adapted due to the available information updated by potential interference sources.

The different conflicting objectives are dealt with by using a multi-objective optimization algorithm to generate the trade-off optimal solutions. In this context, a simple tuning rule is determined by using the Nash solutions as a multi-criteria decision making technique. The Nash criteria is shown to provide convenient trade-off solutions for the controller tuning problem. Illustrative simulation examples show {{the effectiveness of the}} method...|$|R

The goal was two-fold: to provide a defensible basis for regulatory oversight, and to encourage nuclear power plant operators to focus their greatest attention and resources in areas of greatest safety significance.|$|R
