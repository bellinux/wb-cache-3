The internal structure of the silk was compared with those from spider Eriophora transmarina (Keyserling) (Araneida: Araneidae) <b>radial</b> <b>thread</b> and silkworm (Bombyx mori).

Tensile tests showed that the silk has considerably weaker mechanical properties than spider silk and silkworm silk. The differences in mechanical properties of K. montana silk compared with spider and silkworm silk are attributed to the distinction in amino acid composition ratio and internal morphology, and are likely to reflect the functions of the silks in these species.

It shows long, spirally arranged peripheral spines on all five whorls (about equal to width of shoulder). The whorls are flat-sided. The early whorls show, on the upper surface, five beaded spirals, between which on the later whorls are intercalated one or more much smaller beaded or simple threads.

50|$|When {{it comes}} to the décor of the jia vessel, simple designs are most common. The lack of complex design is due to the jia vessel being one of the oldest vessel forms.

While one simple band of décor was {{prevalent}} in Early Shang times, towards the middle and late Shang periods more than one band of décor was more common. As the Zhou period began it was not unlikely to see a jia covered in ornamentation. The vessel shape changed to accommodate the change in decoration, and vice versa. When more elaborate designs are seen it is normally the taotie motif, or mask design. The taotie motif shows two dragon-like figures in profile, that together to form the taotie mask.

(2014) studied the manipulation of spiders from the family Araneidae. The studies revealed that the manipulated spider modifies the architecture of its web in various ways. The orb web is modified to the ‘cocoon web’ (termed by Eberhard (2000 a, b) for the first time) when some of its components are reduced (e.g. web spiral, radii) and others are reinforced (e.g. radii, central hub, frame) or multiplied (e.g. threads). The cocoon web is stronger and effectively designed to provide more durable support for the wasp’s cocoon than the normal web (e.g. Eberhard 2000 a, b). The tetragnathid spider Leucauge argyra (Walckenaer, 1841) is manipulated by the larva of Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga Gauld, 2000 to build a web which consists of a low number of <b>radial</b> <b>threads</b> radiating in a plane from a central hub; the architecture of the cocoon web remains two-dimensional (hereafter 2 D) (Eberhard 2000 a, b, 2001).

A similar 2 D architecture of the cocoon web, but protected by the 3 D structure of the tangle positioned below the hub, was recently described in the spider hosts Leucauge mariana (Keyserling, 1881) manipulated by Hymenoepimecis tedfordi Gauld, 1991 (Eberhard 2013) and Leucauge volupis (Keyserling, 1893) manipulated by Hymenoepimecis jordanensis Loffredo & Penteado-Dias, 2009 (Gonzaga et al. 2014).

40|$|International audienceAn {{essential}} {{element in the}} web-trap architecture, the capture silk spun by ecribellate orb spiders consists of glue droplets sitting astride a silk filament. Mechanically this thread presents a mixed solid/liquid behaviour unknown to date. Under extension, capture silk behaves as a particularly stretchy solid, owing to its molecular nanosprings, but it totally switches behaviour in compression to now become liquid-like: it shrinks with no apparent limit while exerting a constant tension. Here, we unravel the physics underpinning the unique behaviour of this " liquid wire " and demonstrate that its mechanical response originates in the shape-switching of the silk filament induced by buckling within the droplets. Learning from this natural example of geometry and mechanics, we manufactured novel programmable liquid wires that present novel pathways {{for the design of}} new hybrid solid-liquid materials. H ybrids made of different materials often display effective properties far exceeding those of their components (1) : zinc-coated steel is both strong and corrosion-resistant, metal foams (hybrids of metal and air) are stiff, light and crush-able at the same time, making them perfect candidates to absorb energy in a car crash (2, 3). Nature also provides many exquisite examples of hybrid design such as the seashell nacre, both stiff and tough thanks to its inner 'brick-and-mortar' structure composed of rigid, though brittle, inclusions surrounded by a crack arresting soft organic matrix (4), or the bamboo stem with its hollow core and honeycomb-shaped cells that maximize the ratio of bending rigidity over weight (5). A most interesting natural hybrid material is the spi-der's capture thread, which consists of a core filament that supports glue droplets. Here we report on the arresting mechanical behaviour of this capture thread, that changes from solid-like in extension to liquid-like in compression. We trace this behaviour back to the core filament's buckling inside the droplets. A synthetic version of this natural system then allows us to copy the remarkable properties of spider's capture thread to a novel type of hybrid material. Spiders use different kinds of silk to build their webs, and a typical ecribellate orb-web combines dry and smooth <b>radial</b> <b>threads</b> with wet and droplet-covered spiral threads (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The adhesive nature of these droplets enables the spiral capture thread to perform its primary function of catching insect preys (6). Apart from being sticky, these capture threads also prove to be particularly resilient to tensile tests: extensive studies on their mechanical behaviour (11, 6) revealed that, when stretched, the thread elongates to three times its web-length without breaking and recoils back with no noticeable hysteresis or sagging when relaxed (12). This stretchiness confers spider silk a strength tenfold that of natural or synthetic rubber (13, 14). These remarkable extensional properties rely on the macromolecular architecture of capture silk (15, 16). The ability to cope with stretch is crucial for spider capture threads for it provides their unusually large toughness (energy required for rupture), which in turn allows them to absorb the kinetic energy of incident preys without breaking. Far less understood is the behaviour of the thread when compressed: unlike any solid fibre that sags or buckles, it keeps taut and self-adapts to compression. Figure 1 illustrates this singular behaviour, reminiscent of the response of liquid films to compression events: liquid films do not buckle upon squeezing, but rather self-adapt (17). And as for liquid films, self-adaptation for the capture thread is an indication for fibre self-tension. This liquid-like behaviour in compression suggests that more than merely endowing the web with adhesion, capture silk might well have the additional mechanical function of preserving the web structural integrity. Indeed, without self-adaptation, single sticky strands would touch during relaxation events and thereby irremediably damage the web. With sagging suppressed, the sticky strands are secured apart...|$|R

At this point, the wire can be maneuvered into the coronary ostia and into the coronary arteries. A catheter is guided over the wire and enters either the left or right coronary artery. In this position, the interventional cardiologist can inject contrast and visualize the flow through the vessel. If necessary, the physician can utilize percutaneous coronary intervention techniques, including the use of a stent (either bare-metal or drug-eluting) to open the blocked vessel and restore appropriate blood flow. In general, occlusions greater than 70% of the width of the vessel lumen are thought to require intervention. However, in cases where multiple vessels are blocked (so called [...] "three vessel disease"), the interventional cardiologist may opt instead to refer the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; see Coronary artery bypass surgery) surgery.|$|R
