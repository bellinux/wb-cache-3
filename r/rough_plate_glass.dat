60|$|St. Louis, Missouri, November, '79.--What do {{you think}} I find manufactur'd out here--and of a kind the clearest and largest, best, and the most finish'd and luxurious in the world--and with ample demand for it too? Plate glass! One would suppose {{that was the last}} dainty outcome of an old, almost effete-growing civilization; and yet here it is, a few miles from St. Louis, on a charming little river, in the wilds of the West, near the Mississippi. I went down that way to-day by the Iron Mountain Railroad--was switch'd off on a side-track four miles through woods and ravines, to Swash Creek, so-call'd, and there found Crystal city, and immense Glass Works, built (and evidently built to stay) right in the {{pleasant}} rolling forest. Spent most of the day, and examin'd the inexhaustible and peculiar sand the glass is made of--the original whity-gray stuff in the banks--saw the melting in the pots (a wondrous process, a real poem)--saw the delicate preparation the clay material undergoes for these great pots (it has to be kneaded finally by human feet, no machinery answering, and I watch'd the picturesque bare-legged Africans treading it)--saw the molten stuff (a great mass of a glowing pale yellow color) taken out of the furnaces (I shall never forget that Pot, shape, color, concomitants, more beautiful than any antique statue,) pass'd into the adjoining casting-room, lifted by powerful machinery, pour'd out on its bed (all glowing, a newer, vaster study for colorists, indescribable, a pale red-tinged yellow, of tarry consistence, all lambent,) roll'd by a heavy roller into <b>rough</b> <b>plate</b> <b>glass,</b> I should say ten feet by fourteen, then rapidly shov'd into the annealing oven, which stood ready for it. The polishing and grinding rooms afterward--the great glass slabs, hundreds of them, on their flat beds, and the see-saw music of the steam machinery constantly at work polishing them--the myriads of human figures (the works employ'd 400 men) moving about, with swart arms and necks, and no superfluous clothing--the vast, rude halls, with immense play of shifting shade, and slow-moving currents of smoke and steam, and shafts of light, sometimes sun, striking in from above with effects that would have fill'd Michel Angelo with rapture.|$|E

40|$|Ratio {{between a}} time {{spectrum}} of differences of {{phases of the}} scattered waves and a time spectrum of speckle brightness is theoretically established. Three experiments in which the difference of phases of waves changed by moving of a <b>rough</b> <b>glass</b> <b>plate,</b> by fatigue of metal, and by the activity of a monolayer of cells are considered. The good agreement of the theory and experiment is received. © 2012 Copyright SPIE...|$|R

50|$|Other {{methods for}} making hand-blown <b>glass</b> {{included}} blown <b>plate</b> <b>glass,</b> crown glass (introduced to England in the 17th century), polished <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> and cylinder blown sheet glass. These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until}} the end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled <b>plate</b> <b>glass,</b> machine drawn cylinder sheet glass, flat drawn sheet glass, single and twin ground polished <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> and float glass.|$|R
5000|$|In 1880, Ford left New Albany {{and opened}} the New York City <b>Plate</b> <b>Glass</b> Company with a plant in Creighton, Pennsylvania.

50|$|The {{polished}} <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> process {{starts with}} sheet or rolled <b>plate</b> <b>glass.</b> This glass is dimensionally inaccurate and often created visual distortions. These rough panes were ground flat and then polished clear. This {{was a fairly}} expensive process.|$|R
40|$|A {{piece of}} <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> {{is used as}} a {{partially}} silvered mirror to achieve the optical illusion of a candle burning in a beaker of water. The image of a candle burning in front of the <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> appears to be in a beaker of water located that same distance behind the <b>plate</b> <b>glass,</b> as shown in Figure 1. As the system is rotated in front of the camera, the candle appears to remain in the beaker of water, showing that the image has a fixed "location" in space. Finally the <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> is removed, revealing the illusion...|$|R
30|$|During impaction, the argon {{absorption}} layer {{was first}} destroyed, and then plates and nanoparticle interacted. Nanoparticle would be pressed and some atoms from nanoparticle {{would be cut}} and absorbed to plates which had an effect of filling for <b>rough</b> <b>plates,</b> which would form a new nanoparticle protective crust and have an effect of filling for <b>rough</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Architectural details {{changed over}} time, as {{building}} and manufacturing process advanced.

50|$|Before the {{development}} of float glass, larger sheets of <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an iron surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> was passed through a lengthy series of inline grinders and polishers, reducing glass losses and cost.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Plate</b> <b>Glass</b> Group traced {{its roots}} to a British {{immigrant}} and entrepreneur who, in 1897, established a <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturing operation in Cape Town, South Africa. Eventually the company became a leading producer {{of safety and}} bullet-proof glass for automobiles. In 1987 the company launched a new subsidiary in the United States in partnership with SAB and Anglo American. When Glass medic, a US-based windshield repair and replacement company, was acquired in 1990, the South African parent company merged the subsidiaries under the name Belron International. Belron became a base from which to launch further acquisitions. When SAB purchased <b>Plate</b> <b>Glass</b> in 1992, it was renamed Shatterprufe Limited.|$|R

50|$|Captain John Baptiste Ford {{found his}} way to Greenville as a 14-year-old runaway from Danville, Kentucky. Ford began as an {{apprentice}} with his future father-in-law in the local saddle shop which led him into his first business venture. Ford purchased the Old Mill and saddle shop from its owner, added a grocery and began making tin pie safes which he sold throughout the country. Later, Ford moved to New Albany and established several businesses, {{and became the first}} man to succeed in making <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> in the United States. That success was the precursor to several glass companies, most notably the Pittsburgh <b>Plate</b> <b>Glass</b> Company now known as PPG.
