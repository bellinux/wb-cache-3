40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{aesthetic}} {{characteristics of the}} Chinese children lips. MethodsFrontal and profile photographs of 653 healthy children were categorized as the attractive and the unattractive by three laypersons and objectively measured for comparison. ResultsThe attractive group tended to be smaller in the upper paramedian <b>red</b> <b>lip</b> height, the lower paramedian <b>red</b> <b>lip</b> height, the midline upper <b>red</b> <b>lip</b> height, the central bow angle, and the lip angle, while greater in the Cupid's bow width. ConclusionsThinner lips {{seemed to be more}} attractive than full ones among Chinese children...|$|R

5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just <b>red</b> <b>lips,</b> {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

I saluted him with a charge as he disappeared; but not the slightest notice was taken of the civility.|$|R
25|$|Whiteface makeup was {{originally}} designed by Joseph Grimaldi in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large <b>red</b> <b>lips</b> {{set in a}} mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, {{it was one of}} the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.|$|E
25|$|The fee plugs {{which had}} aired {{in the middle}} of the show on the CBS version were {{featured}} during the closing credits. The ticket plugs were now shown on every episode. Each ticket plug had two people's faces merged into one image by putting a man's face on a woman's head, putting a mustache on a woman's face, or putting a pair of <b>red</b> <b>lips</b> on a man's face or simply putting two halves of the faces together. The 1990 ABC version used a similar sequence to introduce the stars.|$|E
25|$|Kisses! is a {{controversial}} urinal {{designed by the}} female Dutch designer Meike van Schijndel. It is shaped like an open pair of <b>red</b> <b>lips.</b> In early March 2004, the National Organization for Women (NOW) took offense to the new urinals that Virgin Atlantic Airways decided to install in the Virgin Atlantic clubhouse at JFK Airport in New York City. After receiving many angry phone calls from female customers, Virgin Atlantic Vice President John Riordan called NOW to apologize. Protestors surmised a connection to oral sex or urolagnia, and based their complaints on the urinals being sexist. A McDonald's restaurant in the Netherlands removed them after a customer complained to the head office in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Three {{important}} aspects of Máté's life at this time were to affect her later life and work. Firstly, she discovered her aptitude for story-telling, and often used this skill at school. Secondly, Máté formed a close friendship with a beautiful Jewish girl, Maria, who, with her raven hair, white skin and <b>red</b> <b>lips,</b> became linked in Máté's vivid imagination, alternately with Snow White and the female heroines of the Bible. It was through her association with Maria, whose family disappeared in 1938, that Máté was personally confronted with Aryan racism. The families of the two girls shared a connection with the Viennese Opera. A passionate love of song and dance was to remain with Máté all her life and influence the rhythm of her poetry. The third important aspect of this time was {{the death of her}} beloved uncle, who she nursed through his last illness, doing her homework at his desk by his bedside. This event brought her to a sudden realisation of the reality of death, {{and the fact that she}} herself would die. This was later to become an aspect of her poetry.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Delayed {{reconstruction}} of large lower lip defects after traumatic avulsion {{is a challenge}} in medically compromised patients with concomitant cheek skin burn. Combination of orthograde submental transposition flap and anteriorly based ventral rectangular myomucosal tongue flap is useful. The former reconstructs {{the body of the}} defect, and the latter masks the <b>red</b> <b>lip,</b> resembling vermilion. In this article, the detailed surgical technique is explained. Literature review of tongue flap and submental flap in the lower lip reconstruction is presented...|$|R
