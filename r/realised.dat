5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then <b>realised</b> that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly <b>realised</b> he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} with the {{discovery}} of the first transuranic elements, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was <b>realised</b> that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he <b>realised</b> that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E

5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he <b>realised</b> that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers <b>realised</b> that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E

50|$|In {{line with}} service orientation, the most {{important}} relation between layers is formed by use relations, which show how the higher layers {{make use of the}} services of lower layers. However, a second type of link is formed by realisation relations: elements in lower layers may <b>realise</b> comparable elements in higher layers; e.g., a ‘data object’ (Application layer) may <b>realise</b> a ‘business object’ (Business layer); or an ‘artifact’ (Technology layer) may <b>realise</b> either a ‘data object’ or an ‘application component’ (Application layer).|$|R

5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that the sacrifices {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she <b>realised</b> {{that she needed to}} readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was {{accepted}} into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler <b>realised</b> that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the {{formation}} of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them {{in an attempt to}} cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E

5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently <b>realised</b> that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} {{successfully}} fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens.|$|E
