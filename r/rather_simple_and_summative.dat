The following are the most important findings. (1) Classroom observations showed that there were several problems in the teaching of L 2 writing and feedback methods at the University of Bahrain. (2) The quasi-experimental study showed that even though the students improved {{in the course of the}} experiment, neither type of corrective feedback had a significant effect on their accuracy, grammatical complexity or lexical complexity in writing, and that there was no difference in the effectiveness between the first type of feedback compared to the second. (3) Interviews and questionnaires showed that the students preferred direct corrective to indirect corrective feedback (i. e. they preferred it when their errors were corrected by providing the corrections on their scripts to underlining) and that the teachers and the students valued feedback and believed it was beneficial. Interviews and questionnaires also showed that even though the teachers used a variety of feedback methods, they did not follow up students after the first draft was produced. In the light of the findings, some recommendations are made in the final chapter of the thesis...|$|E

40|$|In {{the fields}} of {{experimental}} geomechanics, the classical or typical triaxial apparatus {{is one of the}} most widely used testing equipments for the estimation of the material parameters. The testing procedure is <b>rather</b> <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> the basic principles of the apparatus are easy to understand. In situ stress states can be (re-) applied to the specimen in a <b>rather</b> <b>simple</b> <b>and</b> effective way. The stresses and/or strains, imposed to the specimen, are also precisely controlled and monitored. However, the experimentalist should always keep in mind the limitations of the apparatus, imposed by its design. In this paper, a critical discussion on the limitations of the classical or typical triaxial apparatus is presented. Modifications of the initial design are suggested in order to overcome such limitations and improve measuring techniques. © 2010 Lavoisier, Paris...|$|R
