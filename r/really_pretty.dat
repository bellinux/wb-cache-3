It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] But I thought it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E

500|$|MTV News {{reporter}} James Montgomery, {{said when}} discussing several tracks on Teenage Dream, {{one of which}} included [...] "Circle the Drain", that [...] "they are all <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> great" [...] and are [...] "destined to be smash hits." [...] Yahoo! Music journalist Chris Parkin found the song {{to be the only}} track on Teenage Dream to offer something deep and dark, citing the lyric [...] "You fall asleep during foreplay because the pills you take are more your fort√©". In his review of the record for PopMatters, Steve Leftridge stated that tracks such as [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] are not strong, edgy or clever enough [...] "to lend any genuine credibility to Perry as a serious artist with anything to actually say." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wings" [...] {{received}} acclaim from critics. Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{said the}} group were poised to succeed [...] "where other X Factor winners have failed by releasing a great single at the right time". Cragg highlighted the song's production, writing that it had [...] "everything you'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012", and likened Little Mix's [...] "ridiculous vocal runs" [...] to those of Christina Aguilera. Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds {{an awful lot like}} 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus". Rivers concluded: [...] "'Wings' is <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> darn good. Not just good-for-X-Factor good, but good-in-the-context-of-all-pop-music good." ...|$|E

We think it might make people question some of the inaccuracies of the 'Holocaust' myth."

2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Lee {{wrote of}} the first game, [...] "it {{combines}} sweet graphics and revolutionary gameplay and design concepts {{to put it in}} a class by itself." [...] GameSpot's Jeff Sengstack called it [...] "frequently fun, sometimes frustrating, full of surprises, and visually stunning." [...] IGN's Jay Boor called the PlayStation version [...] "one of the most impressive PC to PlayStation ports ever seen." [...] GameSpot's Josh Smith called the PlayStation version [...] "something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they're <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all reviews {{were entirely}} positive. Jeffrey Canino of Tiny Mix Tapes criticized the {{introductory}} rap {{section of the}} song, [...] " [...] brings forth an unpleasant memory of Fred Durst. All throughout, the band is experimenting with disparaging sounds, {{and the only thing}} that ties them together is Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee's glossy production." [...] Despite this, Canino still rates the song highly, [...] "The bulk of the middle portion is <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> okay, so we'll concede this one as a success." [...] Similarly, Ira Robbins and Pete Crigler of TrouserPress.com said, [...] "Despite that success, rap is not an advisable direction for Weezer." [...] Alan Shulman of No Ripcord commented that the song did not have much lasting appeal: [...] "The novelty begins to wear after the 4th or 5th listen," [...] and Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly labelled the song a [...] "Bombastic mini-rock opera" [...] but also said the [...] "remedial rhymes" [...] marred an [...] "otherwise intriguing musical experiment." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Josh Smith {{scored the}} PlayStation version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "With {{innovative}} graphics, great level design, and awesome special weapons, everything looks great on paper. A number of flaws limit the game's life span, though, and {{raise questions about}} what's really important in games - style, mood, and vibe or solid gameplay, consistent graphics, and a continual challenge." [...] He was critical of the graphics, saying [...] "you may wish they'd traded {{a little of the}} game's visual inventiveness for some consistent graphical clarity. There's a ton of polygon dropout. And when things get busy, with dozens of onscreen enemies, projectiles, and explosions (which is in almost every scene), things slow way, way down, or animation frames disappear." [...] He also felt the game was too short, concluding [...] "MDK is something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they're <b>really</b> <b>pretty</b> simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding [...] "Black Hole Sun", Cornell stated, [...] "It's {{just sort}} of a surreal dreamscape, a weird, play-with-the-title kind of song." [...] He also said that [...] "lyrically it's {{probably}} the closest to me just playing with words for words' sake, of anything I've written. I guess it worked {{for a lot of}} people who heard it, but I have no idea how you'd begin to take that one literally." [...] In another interview he elaborated further, stating, [...] "It's funny because hits are usually sort of congruent, sort of an identifiable lyric idea, and that song pretty much had none. The chorus lyric is kind of beautiful and easy to remember. Other than that, I sure didn't have an understanding of it after I wrote it. I was just sucked in by the music and I was painting a picture with the lyrics. There was no real idea to get across." [...] Commenting upon how the song was misinterpreted as being positive, Cornell said, [...] "No one seems to get this, but 'Black Hole Sun' is sad. But because the melody is <b>really</b> <b>pretty,</b> everyone thinks it's almost chipper, which is ridiculous."
