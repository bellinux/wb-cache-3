50|$|The {{experiment}} was not successful. The locomotive proved prone to slipping, because its factor of adhesion was very low; {{in simple terms}} it was too powerful {{for its ability to}} grip the <b>rails.</b> John <b>L.</b> McIntyre, the road foreman of engines at Clinton, Illinois where the locomotive was assigned during the 1938-1939 period, made some modifications to the locomotive, including to the weight equalization across the locomotives' wheels and to reduce the cylinder diameter from 27 to 24 in. The latter was to reduce the starting tractive effort to a level the locomotive's grip on the rails could handle. The improvements were successful, but not to the degree that the railroad ordered any further conversions.|$|R

30|$|The {{length of}} a {{regional}} intercity <b>rail</b> transit (<b>L)</b> is {{used to measure the}} regional intercity rail transit scope. Regional population (P), land use area (S), and GDP are viewed as impact social economic factors to be correlated with the lengths of the corresponding intercity rail transit scope. The datasets of 254 intercity rail transit systems from different countries are collected, including 129 samples in Europe, 60 samples in North America, 38 samples in Asia, 13 samples in South America, 7 samples in Pacific, and 7 samples in Africa, which cover both the developed and developing world. These samples are used to explore the correlation between L and P, S, and GDP. The data are mainly from statistic reports about world urban areas [25, 26, 27]. The “Enter” and “Stepwise” methods are then used to develop the regression models that mathematically relate the intercity rail transit length and population, land use, or GDP. Then, the model is applied the PRD region to estimate the suitable scope of intercity rail transit based on the social economy factors in this region. The population, land use area, and GDP data at the city level, the county level, and the town level are from the statistic yearbooks of the cities and counties of PRD.|$|R

This conclusion was tested in subsequent experiments with a fully toroidal lithium limiter that was installed above the floor of the vacuum vessel. The new limiter covered over ten times the area of the L 3 facing the plasma. Experiments with the toroidal lithium limiter have recently begun.

40|$|Part of the {{development}} of liquid metals as a first wall or divertor for reactor applications must involve the investigation of plasma-liquid metal interactions in a functioning tokamak. Most of the interest in liquid-metal walls has focused on lithium. Experiments with lithium limiters have now been conducted in the Current Drive Experiment-Upgrade (CDX-U) device at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Initial experiments used a liquid-lithium <b>rail</b> limiter (<b>L</b> 3) built by the University of California at San Diego. Spectroscopic measurements showed some reduction of impurities in CDX-U plasmas with the L 3, compared to discharges with a boron carbide limiter. While no reduction in recycling was observed with the L 3, which had a plasma-wet area of approximately 40 cm 2, subsequent experiments with a larger area fully toroidal lithium limiter demonstrated significant reductions in both recycling and in impurity levels. Two series of experiments with the toroidal limiter have now be en performed. In each series, the area of exposed, clean lithium was increased, until in the latest experiments the liquid-lithium plasma-facing area was increased to 2000 cm 2. Under these conditions, the reduction in recycling required a factor of eight increase in gas fueling {{in order to maintain the}} plasma density. The loop voltage required to sustain the plasma current was reduced from 2 V to 0. 5 V. This paper summarizes the technical preparations for lithium experiments and the conditioning required to prepare the lithium surface for plasma operations. The mechanical response of the liquid metal to induced currents, especially through contact with the plasma, is discussed. The effect of the lithium-filled toroidal limiter on plasma performance is also briefly described...|$|R

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|R
