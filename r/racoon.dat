5|$|The war, lasting {{less than}} three {{quarters}} of an hour, is considered the shortest in recorded history. Several durations are given by sources, including 38, 40 and 45 minutes, but the 38-minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war. Some sources take {{the start of the}} war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02. The end of the war is usually put at 09:40, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45. The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with St George indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, Thrush at 09:40, <b>Racoon</b> at 09:41, and Philomel and Sparrow at 09:45.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{within about}} a month <b>Racoon</b> participated in two single-ship actions. First, on 11 July 1803, <b>Racoon</b> was sailing between Guanaba and St. Domingo when she sighted a French naval brig {{anchored}} in Léogâne Roads. As <b>Racoon</b> sailed towards her Bissell saw that the French had springs on their cables and were ready to engage. At 2:45 p.m. <b>Racoon</b> anchored, also with springs, 30 yards from the brig. The two vessels exchanged fire {{for half an hour}} before the French vessel cut his cables and tried to sail away. <b>Racoon</b> followed and after about another 10 minutes of fire from <b>Racoon,</b> the French brig surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, on 2 April, <b>Racoon</b> {{captured}} the privateer felucca Jean Baptiste, of 28 men. Three days later, <b>Racoon</b> captured another privateer felucca, this the Aventure, of one gun and 28 men. At {{about the same}} time <b>Racoon</b> re{{captured the}} Elizabeth.|$|E
25|$|Slowworms (Anguis fragilis) {{are found}} on the island, {{although}} they suffered greatly when badgers and <b>racoons</b> were introduced by Lord Ailsa. The badgers did not survive long, but the <b>racoons</b> bred {{for a number of}} years.|$|R

25|$|In April 1796, <b>Racoon,</b> under Captain Edward Roe, {{captured}} the French privateer lugger Furet {{with a crew}} of 13 men armed with blunderbusses and muskets. The privateer {{had been out of}} Dunkirk five days but had captured nothing. On 29 April <b>Racoon</b> re{{captured the}} Sincerity, John Ingham, master, which a rowboat privateer had captured. <b>Racoon</b> sent Sincerity, of Guernsey, into The Downs. Then on 19 July <b>Racoon</b> captured the Aurora.|$|E
25|$|<b>Racoon</b> {{was some}} {{five or six}} leagues SSW of Fairlight at 1 a.m. on 20 April 1797 when she {{encountered}} a cutter to which she gave chase. At 3 a.m. <b>Racoon</b> captured the French privateer Les Amis, which was armed with two 4-pounder guns and six swivels, and had a crew of 31 men. Les Amis had left Boulogne at 7 p.m. the evening before and had captured one vessel. <b>Racoon</b> was able to recapture the prize, Good Intent, James Marshall, master, as well. <b>Racoon</b> shared the capture and recapture with Grace. On 15 November, <b>Racoon</b> and Grace recaptured the cutter Mary.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July 1803, <b>Racoon,</b> under Commander Austin Bissell, was sailing between Guanaba and St. Domingo in the West Indies {{when she}} sighted a French naval brig {{anchored}} in Léogâne Roads. As <b>Racoon</b> sailed towards her, Bissell {{saw that the}} French had springs on their cables and were ready to engage. <b>Racoon</b> was flying the French flag, and although he was unaware that the war had broken out again between France and Britain, the French captain was wary, rightly so as things turned out. At 2:45p.m. <b>Racoon</b> anchored, also with springs, 30 yards from the brig. She then exchanged her French ensign for the British, and opened fire. The two vessels exchanged fire {{for half an hour}} before the French vessel cut his cables and tried to sail away. <b>Racoon</b> followed and after about another 10 minutes of fire from <b>Racoon,</b> the French brig surrendered.|$|E

25|$|The second notable action {{occurred}} on 17 August {{off the coast}} of Cuba. At 1 p.m. <b>Racoon</b> sighted a brig coming along shore and that met up with a schooner that had been avoiding the British all day. At 3 p.m. the two came up together, but <b>Racoon</b> held back. Then at 4:15 the brig hoisted French colours and opened fire on <b>Racoon.</b> <b>Racoon</b> and the brig exchanged broadsides, with Racoons fire bringing down most of the brigs rigging. The brig ran on shore on the rocks in a small bay, where she struck her colours. After some maneuvering, <b>Racoon</b> fired a broadside from her other side to try to destroy the brig. After about half an hour, the brig raised her colours again. <b>Racoon</b> made several passes, firing on the brig, which lost her mainmast near sunset, and fell on her side. The brig sent her crew ashore in boats while <b>Racoon</b> watched all night. In the morning {{it was clear that the}} brig was a complete wreck, having lost her masts and being full of water. Bissell decided not to permit Racoons master to take a boat and some men to the brig to burn her because there were too many armed men on shore who would fire on any boarding party. Also, <b>Racoon</b> had her two lieutenants and 42 men away in the prizes she had taken the previous month.|$|E
25|$|<b>Racoon</b> {{was broken}} up in April 1806.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} between 1 March and 1 June 1805, <b>Racoon,</b> still under Gordon's command, {{captured}} a French sloop with a cargo of fustic. Gordon received his promotion to post captain on 16 May, but {{appears to have}} left <b>Racoon</b> before then, but after the capture of the sloop.|$|E

25|$|In August, Having {{received}} {{information that}} French privateers were {{operating out of}} Cuban ports, Bissell sailed along {{the east end of}} the Jamaican coast and then crossed to Santiago de Cuba. There he saw four schooners, which appeared to be armed. Within a few days <b>Racoon</b> was able to encounter three of them early in the morning. <b>Racoon</b> captured two after tedious chases, as they separated. They were the Deux Amis and the Trois Freres, both of three guns. <b>Racoon</b> was also able to drive the third, of two guns, on shore, where she was wrecked.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August, {{seven or}} eight leagues from Sand Key, Gordon and <b>Racoon</b> were able to lure a large French {{privateer}} to within 3-400 yards. After <b>Racoon</b> had fired on the privateer for about three quarters of an hour she struck. The privateer was the Alliance, of 12 guns, but with only six mounted – four 6-pounder and two 9-pounders. She had a crew of 68 men {{under the command of}} M. Jacques Dunoque, only one of whom was wounded. The privateer was three days out of Samaria and had taken nothing. <b>Racoon</b> sent Alliance into Jamaica.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1805, Crofton and <b>Racoon</b> {{were in the}} {{anchorage}} at Montego Bay {{when they}} sighted an enemy schooner boarding a drogger. <b>Racoon</b> gave chase but in the light winds was unable to catch up before the privateer and his prize reached Cape Cruz. On {{her way back to}} resume her station, <b>Racoon</b> encountered and captured the Spanish privateer felucca San Felix El Socoro, out of Santiago de Cuba. He had 40 men aboard and was armed with one 6-pounder gun that he had thrown overboard during the chase. The privateer had been out 11 days but had only captured a drogger.|$|E

25|$|Roe and <b>Racoon</b> {{were off}} Dungeness on 29 September when they {{captured}} the French privateer cutter Actif. Actif was armed with six 3-pounder guns and several swivel guns {{and had a}} crew of 23 men. Actif was one day out of Boulogne and had taken nothing, but {{was in the process}} of boarding a vessel when <b>Racoon</b> arrived.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1799, <b>Racoon</b> recaptured the West Indiaman Benjamin and Elizabeth, {{which had}} been sailing from Grenada to London, and which two French {{privateer}}s had just captured. Benjamin and Elizabeth was about four leagues off Dungeness during a foggy night, when two French privateer luggers came up and boarded her. The captain, mate, and two seaman resisted but were overwhelmed. The privateers threw the captain overboard, though he was already severely wounded. One lugger picked him up. The privateers also shot the mate and one seaman at point-blank range after they were already wounded and had surrendered (both were expected to survive). <b>Racoon,</b> {{which had been}} escorting the West India convoy, heard the shooting and came up after the privateer vessels had left. She was able to recapture Benjamin and Elizabeth within minutes. Shortly afterwards the fog cleared slightly and <b>Racoon</b> saw the privateers, {{one of which was}} about 3-400 yards away. <b>Racoon</b> immediately fired a broadside, and when the smoke cleared, the lugger had disappeared completely, apparently sunk. The second privateer disappeared as the fog came back in.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, <b>Racoon</b> rescued {{the crew}} of the Volunteer, which had foundered on her way from Jamaica to London.|$|E

50|$|A {{distemper}} {{epidemic in}} 1992 closed the sanctuary {{for almost a}} year. The sanctuary had been treating {{a large number of}} <b>racoons</b> and skunks with canine distemper, which crossed over to the big cats. 18 big cats died in this epidemic.|$|R
25|$|<b>Racoon</b> {{captured}} another privateer on 20 October, but it sank {{shortly after}} capture. <b>Racoon</b> {{was about three}} leagues NW by W of Blackness at 6 a.m. {{in the morning when}} she sighted three luggers ahead. She immediately sailed towards them and after a two-hour running fight was able to capture one. The captive was the Vigilante, of twelve 4-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. She had a crew of some 50 men on board, all under the command of Citizen Muirbassse. When the prize crew went on board Vigilante they found that he was taking on water rapidly due to shot holes in her hull. <b>Racoon</b> tried to stop the leaks, which took up so much time that the other two privateers were able to make their escape. Lloyd was able to get all his prisoners aboard <b>Racoon,</b> leaving only the dead behind, and watched Valiante sink at 9 a.m. Valiante was new and had been out only once before and had not captured anything. One of the luggers that escaped had taken a prize that another British warship recaptured two hours later.|$|E
25|$|Then on {{the morning}} of 2 December <b>Racoon</b> was WSW of Portee when she {{encountered}} a French lugger. After an hour's chase <b>Racoon</b> captured her quarry, which proved to be the Vrai Decide, of 14 guns and four swivel guns. Vrai Decide had 41 men on board, under the command of Citizen Defgardi. The lugger was from Boulogne, had been out 30 hours in company with three other privateers, and had taken no prizes. Cormorant was in sight and joined the chase.|$|E
25|$|Rathborne then sailed her to Jamaica. He was {{promoted}} in Jamaica from <b>Racoon</b> to post captain, with the promotion being dated 18 October 1802.|$|E
