Blog website: [URL] fabrics used in paint <b>roller</b> <b>covers</b> are {{required}} to meet nap height specifications measured as the overall fabric thickness from its backing to meet substrate paint application standards. Consistency in heat setting process is key to achieving customer specifications for nap fabrics. Excessive shrinkage or variation in shrinkage during heat setting will lead to nonconforming nap fabric heights and costly adjustments, tweaking for quality or downgrading in downstream finishing processes. An exploratory analysis in the measure phase revealed significant difference in yarn shrinkage levels between suppliers. Effect of supplier and heat setting temperature levels on yarn shrinkage was statistically significant, F(2, 42) = 19. 78, P=. 000. These exploratory results reveals evidence of significant vendor factor contribution to process variability.

The whole process of washing clothes in two or three waters, and boiling them, can be effected without moving from the spot, or changing the tub. Each successive water is let out at the bottom, while fresh is let on from the top. When the clothes are ready to be boiled, a wooden cover is placed over them, and a stream of scalding steam is directed into the tub, by turning a stop cock; this boils the water in a few moments, effectually cleansing the clothes; they are then whirled in a hollow cylinder till nearly dry, after which they are drawn through two <b>rollers</b> <b>covered</b> with flannel, which presses every remaining particle of water out of them.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Knowledge of {{the dynamic}} and high {{temperature}} properties of polyurethane elastomers is critical to their use in high dynamic stress applica-tions that include automotive belting, <b>roller</b> <b>covers,</b> tires and wheels. The devel-opment of elastomeric systems for such demanding applications requires a means of characterizing these systems in terms of mechanical properties and high-temperature performance using limited quantities of material. Dynamic Mechanical Spectroscopy (DMS) is a powerful and versatile technique which is capable of providing this information with quick turn-around times and small sample size requirements. While highly theoretical and often complex explana-tions of dynamic mechanical measurements exist in abundance, little pub-lished information can be found that is directed towards polyurethane cast systems and expressed in easy to understand terms. This paper attempts to fill this void by offering a qualitative explanation of basic DMS theoretical princi-ples and providing practical guidelines for interpreting DMS data {{for a series of}} cast polyurethane elastomers. To assist the system formulator in the selection of diisocyanate structure, polyol backbone and molecular weight, curative and stoichiometry, the effects of each of these parameters on dynamic properties are demonstrated. DMS test results are correlated to those results generated by other dynamic test meth-ods, and examples of how DMS has been used to accurately predict performance in real-life applications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBurn scars {{remain a}} serious {{physical}} and psychological problem for the affected people. Clinical studies as well as basic scientific research have shown that medical needling can significantly increase the quality of burn scars with comparatively low risk and stress for the patient with regards to skin elasticity, moisture, erythema and transepidermal water loss. However, medical needling has no influence on repigmentation of large hypopigmented scars. The goal {{of this study is}} to evaluate whether two established methods – needling (for improvement of scar quality) and non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (for repigmentation) – can be successfully combined. Twenty subjects with mean age of 33 years (6 – 60 years) with scars from deep second and third degree burns have been treated. The average treated surface area was 94 cm 2 (15 – 250 cm 2) and was focused on prominent areas such as the face, neck, chest and arm. Percutaneous collagen induction or “medical needling” was performed using a <b>roller</b> <b>covered</b> with 3 mm long needles. The roller is vertically, horizontally and diagonally rolled over the scar, inducing microtrauma. Then, non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (NCASCS) was produced and applied using the ReNovaCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patients were followed 12 months postoperatively. Pigmentation changes were measured objectively, as well as with patient and observer ratings. Patient satisfaction/preference was also obtained. Taken together, the pigmentation ratings and objective measures indicate individual improvement in 17 of the study participants. The melanin increases seen 12 months after NCASCS treatment are statistically significant. Medical needling in combination with NCASCS shows promise for repigmentation of burn cars...|$|R

40|$|Background: In present study, {{we tried}} to {{determine}} significant palmar dermatoglyphic parameters in case of essential hypertensive’s in age group between 20 - 50 years and whether the parameters {{can be used for}} screening purpose i. e., early detection of hypertension. Method: With the use of modified Purvis Smith method, Black duplicating ink (Kores, Bombay) was smeared on both hands one by one and prints will be taken by rolling the hands from wrist creases to finger tips on the <b>roller</b> <b>covered</b> with bond paper. While crystal bond paper, applied firmly over a wooden pad, was used for recording the inked epidermal ridge patterns. Rolled finger prints were recorded after applying uniform pressure on white bond paper from ulnar to radial side. Complete palm impression, including the hollow or the palm was obtained over paper. Thus one set of finger prints and palm prints was obtained. The prints obtained were immediately examined with hand-lens. Result: Right hand and left hand of the both male and female study group showed more number of arches than controls. Right hand and left hand of the both male and female study group showed more number of Radial loops than controls. The right hand and left hand of both male and female control group showed more number of ulnar loops than study group. The right hand and left hand of the male control group showed more number of Whorls than study, while in females, the right hand study group showed more number of whorls than control group and the left hand study group showed less number of Whorls as compared to control group. Conclusion: The present study indicates that there are some genetic factors which are involved in the causation of essential hypertension and it is possible to certain extent to predict from dermatoglyphics individual’s chance of acquiring essential hypertension. Like clinical history, examination and investigations, the dermatoglyphics will play an important role revealing the genetic susceptibility to essential hypertension...|$|R

In the heat conduction modelling, one-dimensional steady state heat conduction is assumed. The heat source is a power input coming from internal friction developed during the rolling contact. The power input is expressed by the hysteresis in the rubber represented by a loss angle of the material together with the peripheral speed and some parameters taken from the previously developed contact model.

2500|$|... (2) In the {{etching process}} an {{enlarged}} {{image of the}} design is cast upon a zinc plate {{by means of an}} enlarging camera and prisms or reflectors. On this plate it is then painted in colours roughly approximating to those in the original, and the outlines of each colour are carefully engraved in duplicate by hand. The necessity for this is that in subsequent operations the design has to be again reduced to its original size and, if the outlines on the zinc plate were too small at first, they would be impracticable either to etch or print. The reduction of the design and its transfer to a varnished copper roller are both effected at one and the same operation in the pantograph machine. This machine is capable of reducing a pattern on the zinc plate from one-half to one-tenth of its size, and is so arranged that when its pointer or stylus is moved along the engraved lines of the plate a series of diamond points cut a reduced facsimile of them through the varnish with which the <b>roller</b> is <b>covered.</b> These diamond points vary in number according to the number of times the pattern is required to repeat {{along the length of the}} roller. Each colour of a design is transferred in this way to a separate roller. The roller is then placed in a shallow trough containing nitric acid, which acts only on those parts of it from which the varnish has been scraped. To ensure evenness the roller is revolved during the whole time of its immersion in the acid. When the etching is sufficiently deep the roller is washed, the varnish dissolved off, any parts not quite perfect being retouched by hand.|$|R

Campbell Scientific CR 3000 dataloggers were used to read each of the sensors at 40 Hz and record the averaged value every second, along with the GPS information. In addition to this sensor data, sugarcane yield was also measured to determine the accuracy and resolution of the respective yield monitoring concepts. Yield was determined using two methods and included mill (bin) weight data for individually consigned sub-blocks and weighed 50 m row samples into a weigh truck. The approach used was consistent with the methodology previously developed to assess the accuracy of commercial yield monitoring equipment during 2008 / 09. Preliminary analysis indicates that there are considerable similarities between the yield monitoring concepts in terms of their ability to measure yield, and that how the sensor data is recorded and managed is critical to the accuracy and overall performance of these concepts as yield monitors.
