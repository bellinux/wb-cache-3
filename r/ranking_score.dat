25|$|Based on the feature/aspects and {{the sentiments}} {{extracted}} from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed. There {{are two types of}} motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items, while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other hand, for a shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while give negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user. Based on these two motivations, a combination <b>ranking</b> <b>score</b> of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Rank</b> <b>score</b> {{functions}} {{are known to}} be versatile and powerful techniques in factorial designs. Researchers have established the theoretical properties of these methods based on nonparametric hypotheses, but only scanty empirical results are available in the literature on these procedures. In this paper, four types of <b>rank</b> <b>score</b> functions Wilcoxon-scores, Mood-scores, normal-scores and expected normal- scores are studied in the context of two–way factorial designs using asymptotic � 2 (Wald-Type) and modified Box- approximation (ANOVA-Type) tests. The empirical Type I error rate and power of these test statistics on the <b>rank</b> <b>scores</b> were determined using Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the robustness of the tests. The results show that there are problems of inflation in the Type I error rate using asymptotic � 2 test for all the <b>rank</b> <b>score</b> functions, especially for small sample sizes and distributions studied. The modified Box- approximation test was found to be robust for both validity and efficiency, especially for Wilcoxon, normal and expected normal score functions. It was concluded that the asymptotic � 2 test is non-robust for <b>rank</b> <b>score</b> functions in two-factor designs...|$|R
40|$|R. Koenker a G. Basset (1978) {{proposed}} the regression quantiles as any generalization of usual quantiles to linear regression model. They characterized the regression quantile {{as the solution}} of the linear program. Gutenbrunner and Jurečková (1992) called the componenents of the optimal solution of dual problem as the regression <b>rank</b> <b>scores.</b> They showed that many aspects of the duality of order statistics and ranks in the location model generalize naturally to the linear model. Gutenbrunner and Jurečková (1992) proposed some tests based on regression <b>rank</b> <b>scores</b> generated by truncated score functions. A general class of tests based on regression <b>rank</b> <b>scores,</b> parallel to classical rank tests as the Wilcoxon, normal scores and median, was constructed in Gutenbrunner et al. (1993). The tests of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov type were proposed by Jurečková (1992) and the tests of homoscedasticity in the linear model based regression <b>rank</b> <b>scores</b> were proposed by Gutenbrunner (1994). The concept of regression <b>rank</b> <b>scores</b> was extended in Koul and Saleh (1995), as autoregression <b>rank</b> <b>scores,</b> to the autoregressive (AR) model. The tests of the linear hypothesis on the AR parameter based on the autoregression <b>rank</b> <b>scores</b> were constructed in Hallin and Jurečková (1997) and in Hallin and el. (1997). A nonparametric test of independence of two autoregressive time series was considered Hallin and el. (2001).

40|$|Abstract. The PageRank algorithm, {{used in the}} Google search engine, greatly {{improves}} the results of Web search by applying probabilistic model on the link structure of Webs to evaluate the " of Webs. In PageRank probabilistic model, the links and webs are uniform, so the <b>rank</b> <b>score</b> of webs are quite independent from their content. In practice, the researchers often hope that the web results can be ranked by their proposed topics. Moreover, when computer's techniques solve given problems ineffectively, it's necessary to do better research in theoretical problems. From this judgement, in this paper, we introduce and describe the MPageRank based on a new probabilistic model supporting multi-context for ranking Webs. A Web now has different <b>ranking</b> <b>scores,</b> which depends on the given multi topics. The basic idea in establishing the new MPageRank model is that partition our Web graph into smaller-size sub Web graph. As a consequence of evaluation and rejection about pages influence weakly to other pages, the <b>rank</b> <b>score</b> of pages of the original Web graph can be approximated from the <b>rank</b> <b>score</b> of pages in the new partition Web graph. Similar to the PageRank, the multi <b>ranking</b> <b>scores</b> in the MPageRank are pre-computed and reflect the hyperlink of Web environment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{bibliographical data}} {{available}} with the RePEc (Research Papers in Economics), the Internet Documents in Economics Access Service (IDEAS) publishes every month the up-dated academic rankings of different geographic regions (countries/states in the US). This paper {{raises the question}} whether the method used by the IDEAS/RePEc to obtain academic rankings of different regions {{in terms of the}} academic performance of economists associated with them can be considered optimal. It devises five different types of ranking procedure based on the principles of representation of numerically large and varied types of ranking criteria by a single index of overall <b>ranking</b> <b>scores.</b> Empirically, it uses the data published by the IDEAS for the month of September 2008. It is found that the overall <b>ranking</b> <b>scores</b> obtained by the IDEAS are almost optimal on the four (of the five) principles of representation. However, it is not so when the principle of representation is maximization of the minimal squared correlation of overall <b>ranking</b> <b>scores</b> with the constituent individual <b>ranking</b> <b>scores.</b> The overall <b>ranking</b> <b>scores</b> based on maximization of minimal squared correlation beget larger impact (weight) of a select few scientometric criteria such as h-index, download counts, and certain specific (co-authorship discounted) measures of impact-weighted citation and productivity of authors affiliated to the regions under consideration. As a consequence, it has some bias in favour of economically developed regions, while the overall <b>ranking</b> <b>scores</b> obtained by the IDEAS are slightly biased in favour of the economically less developed regions. The IDEAS rankings, therefore, have a tendency to discount for the disadvantages faced by the economists associated with the less privileged regions. ...|$|R
