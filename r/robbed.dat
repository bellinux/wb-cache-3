40|$|Robertsonian translocations (<b>ROBs)</b> have an {{estimated}} incidence rate of 1 / 1000 births, making {{this type of}} rearrangement the most common structural chromosomal abnormalities seen in the general population. In this study, we reports 872 cases of <b>ROBs</b> from 205, 001 specimens karyotyped postnatally in a single accredited laboratory in China, including 583 balanced <b>ROBs,</b> 264 unbalanced <b>ROBs,</b> 9 mosaic <b>ROBs,</b> and 18 complex <b>ROBs.</b> Ninety-three percent of the balanced <b>ROBs</b> observed were adults with infertility, miscarriage, or offspring(s) with known chromosomal abnormalities. Significant excess of females {{were found to be}} carriers of balanced <b>ROBs</b> with an adjusted male/female ratio of 0. 77. Ninety-eight percent of the unbalanced <b>ROBs</b> observed were children with variable referral reasons. Almost all of the unbalanced <b>ROBs</b> involved chromosome 21 except a single <b>ROB</b> with [46,XX,der(13; 14),+ 13] identified in a newborn girl with multiple congenital anomalies.

50|$|Despite that, <b>Rob</b> {{still wanted}} to be with Lucy and Lucy gave him one last chance. Dermot told <b>Rob</b> that he had money {{problems}} and <b>Rob</b> planned to <b>rob</b> a drug dealer's lock up. <b>Rob</b> had taken Lucy and Carol Groves as alibis and the robbery was going according to plan, but the dealer caught them. <b>Rob,</b> Dermot, Carol, and Lucy all managed to escape, but they were chased by the dealer. Despite Lucy and Carol's protests to stop the car, <b>Rob</b> continued and lost control. The car ended up in the River Dee, but they survived, apart from Dermot. Lucy then confessed all to the police, but the police had little to arrest <b>Rob</b> on. <b>Rob's</b> problems went from bad to worse when Kurt, Jambo Bolton, Lucy, and Carol Groves followed <b>Rob</b> on a night's 'work' in the hope that he might incriminate himself.

5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being <b>robbed,</b> numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions.

The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation's size and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levski's leading role.|$|E
