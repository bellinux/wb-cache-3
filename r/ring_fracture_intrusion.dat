40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} postoperative walking {{status of}} elderly patients with osteoporotic pubic rami fractures {{with or without}} posterior pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures.</b> METHODS: 33 women and 4 men aged 66 to 95 (mean, 85) years presented with osteoporotic pubic rami fractures after a fall. 22 (59 %) of the patients had additional posterior pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures</b> (9 had lateral compression type-II fractures involving the ilium and 13 had lateral compression type-I fractures involving the sacroalar region). Seven of the 9 patients with lateral compression type-II fractures underwent open reduction and internal fixation using plates and/ or screws. The remaining 30 patients were treated conservatively.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of and the incidence of complications for PDT using the rigid tracheotomy endoscope (TED). Methods In a prospective multicenter observational study from 2006 to 2010, 180 adult patients in intensive care and those scheduled for ear, nose and throat surgery underwent PDT using TED.

40|$|Background: Fluoro-navigation {{is a new}} {{surgical}} technique in orthopedic trauma surgery. This study is to investigate clinical results of fluoro-navigation surgery in anterior pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures.</b> Materials and Methods: From January 2006 to October 2011, 23 patients with anterior pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures</b> were treated with percutaneous cannulated screw under fluoro-navigation. Results: A total of 32 screws were inserted, including 19 in the pubic ramis and 13 in the anterior acetabular columns. The average surgical time was 23. 3 min/screw. The average time of X-ray exposure was 19. 1 ± 2. 5 s/screw. The virtual images of fluoro-navigation were compared with real-time X-rays {{during and after the}} surgery. Compared to the final position of the screw, the average deviated distance was 3. 11 mm and the average trajectory difference was 2. 81 °. Blood loss during the operation was minimal (22. 3 ml/screw). One screw (3. 1 %) deviated out of the fracture site during the operation. No superficial or deep infection occurred. No patient sustained recognized neurologic, vascular, or urologic injury {{as a result of the}} percutaneous screw fixation. All fractures united at the last followup.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} three major aspects {{of the use of}} sacroiliac screws in patients with unstable pelvic ring fractures: the optimal technique for sacroiliac screw fixation, the reliability of peroperative fluoroscopy and the late results. We focused on the questions whether sacroiliac screw fixation can be achieved safely by fluoroscopy, whether it is stable (for possible direct postoperative weight bearing) and if it improves the quality of life after pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture</b> (or after nonunion of this injury). Conclusion: pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures</b> remain a complicated injury. Sacroiliac screw fixation is a technique that has several advantages. Compared to plate or external fixation it allows a stable fixation without extensive wounds that in laboratory results seems stable enough to examine postoperative weight bearing clinically. Despite the fact that neurological injury due to penetration of the screw into the intervertebral foramen still is possible, the addition of the lateral view seems to limit this risk and future techniques such as C. T. guided positioning or robot insertion might decrease the incidence of this complication even further. However even with the current technique no permanent neurological impairment was seen.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The sliding {{computed}} tomographic (CT) scanner in our trauma resuscitation room {{can be used}} {{early in}} the assessment of pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture</b> patients. We determined the association between the presence of a pelvic blush on CT scan and the need for pelvic hemorrhage control (PHC). We hypothesized that many pelvic blushes found early in the resuscitation phase can be safely managed without intervention. METHODS: Contrast-enhanced CT scans of pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture</b> (pelvic <b>ring</b> disruption) patients admitted from January 1, 2004, to June 31, 2012, were reviewed for the presence of a pelvic blush. PHC was defined as requiring a surgical or radiologic intervention for pelvic bleeding. A subanalysis was performed in "isolated" pelvic fracture/ blush patients (absence of a major nonpelvic bleeding source). RESULTS: Overall, 68 (42 %) of 162 pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture</b> patients and 53 (40 %) of 134 isolated pelvic fracture patients had a pelvic blush. Of those 32 (47 %) and 27 (51 %) patients, respectively, required PHC. In the absence of a pelvic blush, 87 (93 %) of 94 of all and 77 (95 %) of 81 of isolated pelvic fracture patients did not require PHC. Of all patients with a pelvic blush and of isolated pelvic blush, those with PHC had a higher Injury Severity Score (ISS) (p = 0. 01 and p = 0. 05), base deficit (p = 0. 03 and p = 0. 01), as well as 24 -hour and any packed red blood cells requirement (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 05; p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 02). In isolated pelvic blush patients, there was a trend toward a higher hospital and hemorrhage-related mortality in patients with PHC (p = 0. 06 and p = 0. 06). CONCLUSION: In pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture</b> patients, a pelvic blush on early contrast-enhanced CT is a frequent finding. Many patients with (particularly isolated) pelvic blushes have stable vital signs and can be managed without surgical or radiologic PHC. The need for an intervention for a pelvic blush seems to be determined by the presence of clinical signs of ongoing bleeding. Copyright (C) 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkin...|$|R
40|$|Background Anterior pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture,</b> as high-energy trauma, {{needs to}} be {{effectively}} treated. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to evaluate the clinical applications of modified pedicle screw-rod fixation and anterior pelvic external fixation for the treatment of anterior pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fracture.</b> Methods Either modified pedicle screw-rod fixation (modified PSRF group, N[*]=[*] 21) or anterior pelvic external fixation (APEF group, N[*]=[*] 22) was performed to 43 patients, with or without fixation of posterior ring. Clinical outcomes were evaluated via Majeed scores. Relevant clinical evaluation indicators including operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospitalization duration, and complications were compared between these two groups. Results The operation time in APEF group was significantly less than that in modified PSRF group (P <[*] 0. 0001). No significant difference with respect to intraoperative blood loss and hospitalization duration between the two groups was shown (P[*]=[*] 0. 51 and P[*]=[*] 0. 33, respectively). Six patients developed surgical site infection in APEF group. Three patients experienced loss of fixation, and two patients experienced loosening of fixator in APEF group. Temporary lateral femoral cutaneous nerve irritation occurred in three patients in modified PSRF group while two patients in APEF group. One patient experienced femoral nerve palsy in modified PSRF group. Fractures of all patients healed well eventually. No statistical difference regarding Majeed evaluation scores was found between two groups.

40|$|Background: The {{behavior}} of pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures</b> {{in the long}} run has been very sparsely studied. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the long-term outcome of pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 24 patients with pelvic <b>ring</b> <b>fractures,</b> not involving the acetabulum, were followed up for an average duration of 33 months (range 24 - 49 months). The clinicoradiological assessment was done using the pelvic scoring system adapted from Cole et al. Parameters assessed included sacroiliac (SI) joint involvement and, among SI joint injuries, the presence of a fracture disruption and the degree of displacement. Results: Pain and limp were present in 13 patients (54. 2 &#x 0025;) each and residual working disability in 9 patients (37. 5 &#x 0025;). The overall Cole&#x 2032;s pelvic score was 31. 3 &# 177; 7. 02 of a total score of 40. The average pelvic score in patients with SI disruption was 29. 2 &# 177; 6. 75; much lower than patients without SI disruption with an average score of 34. 9 &# 177; 6. 25 reaching statistical significance.

At the end of the treatment, ten patients (50 %) were classified as having good results, nine patients (45 %) had fair results and one patient (5 %) did not have any improvement. Six patients presented complications, and paresthesia of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was the most frequent of these (two patients). CONCLUSION: Supra-acetabular external fixation in association with iliosacral percutaneous osteosynthesis is a good definitive treatment method for patients with a high risk of postoperative infection...|$|R
