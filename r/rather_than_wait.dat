He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E

Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting {{with a sense of}} urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E

5|$|Nakano {{organised}} {{the withdrawal}} of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of {{the foothills of the}} Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division was to take the coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took the inland one, but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took the inland route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for {{replacement}} equipment, Barnette {{purchased the}} press of a newly arrived editor, William Fentress Thompson, who had intended to set up his own newspaper. As part of the purchasing deal in August 1906, Thompson was allowed to publish an evening paper—the Tanana Daily Miner—while the Fairbanks Daily News {{was published in the}} morning. The deal lasted only through September, as Thompson and Barnette conflicted on a personal level. The Tanana Miner was reduced to a weekly newspaper, then Thompson was deposed as editor of the Fairbanks News in June 1907 and took the Tanana Miner to the settlement of Chena, outside Fairbanks. Barnette, meanwhile, became embroiled in a series of legal troubles. He faced opposition from the owner of the Fairbanks Times, A.L. Anderson, who had fought Barnette about several gold claims near Fairbanks and purchased the Times to compete against Barnette.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men {{trying to use}} the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait,</b> brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to head up and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E

5|$|After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Scotland regained its kirk, {{but also}} the bishops. Under the Rescissory Act 1661, {{legislation}} was revoked back to 1633, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars. But an act passed later the same day renewed the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods, suggesting that a compromise was possible. The restoration of episcopacy was proclaimed by the Privy Council of Scotland on 6 September 1661. James Sharp, minister of Crail, who was in London to represent {{the interests of the}} Resolutioners, changed sides and accepted the position of Archbishop of St. Andrews. He was consecrated along with Robert Leighton as Bishop of Dunblane and two other bishops. Soon an entire bench of bishops had been constructed. During the parliamentary session of 1662 the Church of Scotland was restored as the national church and all office-holders were required to renounce the Covenants. Church ministers were forced to accept the new situation or lose their livings. Up to a third, at least 270, of the ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> to be forced out by the government. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers.|$|E

25|$|Registrar posts lasted {{one or two}} years, and {{sometimes}} much longer outside an academic setting. It was common {{to move from one}} registrar post to another. Fields such as psychiatry and radiology used to be entered at the registrar stage, but the other registrars would usually have passed part one of a higher qualification, such as a Royal College membership or fellowship before entering that grade. Part two (the complete qualification) was necessary before obtaining a senior registrar post, usually linked to a medical school, but many left hospital practice at this stage <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> years to progress to a consultant post.|$|E
25|$|Russia, {{likewise}} {{upset by}} the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked {{in the spring of}} 1757; <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to preemptively invade the neighboring Electorate of Saxony, which he believed (incorrectly) was a secret party to the coalition against him.

25|$|In the interim, {{hostilities}} between Mexican {{soldiers and}} Texas colonists increased, and in early October {{a group of}} Texians attacked a Mexican army contingent which {{had been sent to}} retrieve a cannon that had previously been loaned to Gonzales. This small skirmish marked the official start of the Texas Revolution. Gonzales became a rallying point for Texas settlers who opposed the centralist policies, and men flocked to the town. On October 11, the men formed themselves into a volunteer Texian Army and elected Austin as their commander. Many of the Consultation delegates had also gathered in Gonzales, and <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for the session to begin, they joined the army on a march against the Mexican garrison at Béxar.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Robinson was {{commissioned}} {{chief of the}} Bureau of Engineering (BuEng) with the rank of rear admiral, succeeding Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell. During this first of two nonconsecutive terms as the chief Navy engineer, Robinson helped stimulate the development of submarine electric propulsion. At the time, lightweight, high-speed engines {{were still in the}} experimental phase and no existing engine was suitable for submarine electric drive. Procuring such an engine was a venture requiring a level of risk and capital investment that was considered prohibitive for a private company. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for the private sector to catch up to the Navy's requirements, Robinson launched an innovative bureau-sponsored competition that successfully drew private diesel contractors into the submarine propulsion market.|$|E

The Maharattas lost all of their British officers, leaving the battalion under the command of its Viceroy's Commissioned Officers.

25|$|Spain's final area {{of inquiry}} was the Nelson area, {{including}} the Wairau Valley. The hearings {{had been scheduled}} to begin in June 1843 but were delayed by the violent clash in the Wairau Valley on 17 June in which 26 lives were lost. FitzRoy, who arrived in New Zealand about two months later, conducted his own inquiry into the affray and ruled that the Europeans were at fault for pressing ahead with efforts to survey the land <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> for Spain's investigation and adjudication. Because of those events, Spain's inquiry at Nelson did not begin until 19 August 1844. By then Wakefield had adopted a more conciliatory approach and had decided to pay Maori compensation where Spain decided it was necessary—in Port Nicholson, Wanganui and Manawatu—and also decided to abandon claim to any land in the Wairau Valley.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>wait</b> at Fort Vancouver as instructed, Mullan {{departed}} for the East Coast almost immediately, taking Kolecki with him. He took a steamer from Fort Vancouver to Panama, crossed the isthmus, {{and took a}} second steamer to New York City. He then traveled by train to Annapolis, where he stayed with his parents and pleaded illness {{as a reason for}} delaying his trip to the capital. Mullan escaped punishment, in part, because Isaac Stevens had returned to Washington as well. He needed Mullan to help win passage of additional funds for the road, and so protected him from Congress. Additionally, Jefferson Davis had returned to Congress, too. Davis had long wanted more money for the road, and with Secretary of War John B. Floyd in complete agreement a new appropriation seemed likely. So Davis, too, protected Mullan from Army wrath. Finally, even the Army realized that a military road was now critical, so that troops in the field no longer had to rely on long, vulnerable pack trains. Having Mullan available to support more money for a military road met with Army wishes as well.|$|E
