40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images...|$|R

For this reason, legislation has been put in place at the federal (IDEA PL 1 08 - 446) and state level (Indiana Code - Article 7) to mandate transition services for students with special needs to help them move from secondary school settings to adult life successfully. However, the legislation is vague regarding this mandate, teachers Jack time, and school districts lack resources so transition services may not always be implemented with fidelity or to the full extent.

The main goal {{of this paper is}} to improve network efficiency by exploiting knowledge of QoE information associated with online video streaming services. The investigations considered in the paper are performed using an innovative test-bed, developed to assess network efficiency for the provision of online video services of different qualities. The QoE model used in the proposed QoEaware allocation scheme assumes a MOS-like grading function whose grades depend on both the duration of playtime interruption and the streaming video quality (resolution). The results show that the proposed resource management scheme can deliver more than 40 percent higher QoE to the users of the system as compared to current agnostic (not aware of QoE <b>requirement</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> characteristics) service models.

However, it has been difficult for practitioners to fully embrace this progressive ideology so long as powerful and deep-rooted cultural traditions run counter to modern scientific and democratic ideas (Wang & Mao, 1996). There was a big gap between the rationale advocated by this document and educational practice. For example, the traditional values of obeying authorities and upholding unity are contrary {{to the goal of}} establishing a unique and democratic relationship between a teacher and each individual child. In addition, the lack of practical guidelines left many teachers not knowing how to implement the regulations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a framework for}} decoding video {{in the absence of}} sufficient computational resources. Most current decoding systems require there to always be sufficient resources available. We have implemented a video decoding module for the QStream video streaming system to adapt the decoding process to the available resources. A distinguishing characteristic of our framework is the ability to decode a video in priority order and drop low priority work if there are not enough resources to fully decode the video. In our particular case we adapt by dropping frames. Additionally, we make no use of a feedback loop as part of the data dropping mechanism. This is important because the variability of video content makes it difficult to predict the relationship between CPU <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> video <b>content.</b> We argue that due to the inherent variability in both <b>content</b> <b>and</b> devices that an adaptive approach is necessary. We have found our approach to decoding to require minimal computational overhead. iii Contents Abstract [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2008, the Dutch Health Care Transparency Programme (Zichtbare Zorg) {{was set up}} {{to develop}} and apply quality {{indicators}} (QIs) for health care. These QIs serve a range of purposes and can be categorized into those for internal use [...] for meeting quality standards and to continuously measure improvement (formative) [...] and external use [...] to enable patients and health insurance companies to distinguish between health care providers (summative). In order to assess the validity of QIs, a comprehensive Indicator Assessment Framework (IAF) was developed. This framework specifies the following criteria for validation: content validity, absence of selection bias, absence of measurement bias, and statistical reliability. Because of the intended summative use, the IAF was used for structural assessment of the QIs set for Dutch community pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of the current set of 52 QIs for community pharmacies using the IAF. METHODS: An expert panel applied the IAF criteria to the set of QIs collected in 1, 807 Dutch community pharmacies on their performance in 2011. The QIs were judged as meeting, partly meeting, or not meeting the requirements regarding these criteria. The judgments were evaluated for QI type (structure, process, or outcome) and for predefined domains. RESULTS: Thirteen QIs (25 %) were judged as meeting the requirements for all criteria. Among them were 12 structure indicators and 1 process indicator. For process indicators, the criterion for measurement bias poorly met the <b>requirements,</b> <b>and</b> <b>content</b> validity was unsatisfactory for outcome indicators. The 13 overall valid QIs covered 6 out of 10 predefined domains: continuity of care, clinical risk management, compounding, dispensing of medication, management, and quality management. CONCLUSIONS: When subjecting the QI set for community pharmacies to the requirements of the IAF, only a quarter of the QIs met all requirements. To increase the number of valid process and outcome indicators, meaningful aspects for the outcome of pharmaceutical care have to be defined, and uniform measurement of relevant processes has to be implemented...|$|R
