2500|$|During {{the balloon}} project, winds and {{temperatures}} in the atmosphere were prime subjects for investigation, for they have a critical impact on balloon performance. [...] To map out upper level winds, Professor Homer T. Mantis used [...] "down cameras", which photographed features on the ground. [...] Ney was interested in studying variations of air temperature with altitude. [...] To measure them, he put thermistors and wire thermometers on many flights. [...] With the aid of standard radiosonde equipment, Ney's student, John L. Gergen, carried out 380 <b>radiation</b> <b>temperature</b> soundings in parallel with the balloon project. [...] With Leland Bohl, and Suomi, he invented and patented the [...] "black ball", which is an instrument that responds not to air temperature, but to thermal radiation in the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{infrared}} radiometer {{showed that the}} 8.4 μm and 10.4 μm <b>radiation</b> <b>temperatures</b> were in agreement with <b>radiation</b> <b>temperatures</b> obtained from Earth-based measurements. There was no systematic difference between the temperatures measured on the light side and {{dark side of the}} planet, which was also in agreement with Earth-based measurements. The limb darkening effect that the microwave radiometer detected was also present in the measurements by both channels of the {{infrared radiometer}}. The effect was only slightly present in the 10.4 μm channel but was more pronounced in the 8.4 μm channel. The 8.4 μm channel also showed a slight phase effect. The phase effect indicated that if a greenhouse effect existed, heat was transported in an efficient manner from the light side to {{the dark side of the}} planet. The 8.4 μm and 10.4 μm showed equal <b>radiation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> indicating that the limb darkening effect would appear to come from a cloud structure rather than the atmosphere. Thus, if the measured temperatures were actually cloud temperatures instead of surface temperatures, then these clouds would have to be quite thick.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{detection}} of the 2 -mm emission line due to the 2 (12) - 1 (11) transition of H 2 CO at two positions in the Taurus dark cloud and one position in the dark cloud L 134 N. The profiles of the observed emissions are plotted, and peak <b>radiation</b> <b>temperatures</b> at 2 mm are determined for the three positions. These <b>radiation</b> <b>temperatures</b> are used along with data on the 2 -mm H 2 CO absorption line and computed cross sections for H 2 -H 2 CO collisions to deduce the molecular hydrogen density and the ortho-H 2 CO column density in the two clouds. The results are shown to support previous theoretical estimates of the H 2 CO/H 2 and the H 2 (C- 12) O/H 2 (C- 13) O ratios. It is concluded that if the abundances of CS and HCN in the clouds are {{equal to that of}} H 2 CO, emissions from these molecules should be easily detectable...|$|R

40|$|Five {{years of}} {{meteorological}} and hydrological {{data from a}} typical New England watershed where winter snow cover is significant were used to drive and validate two off-line land surface schemes suitable {{for use in the}} Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM) : a baseline scheme that does not model the physics of a snowpack and therefore, neglects the insulating properties of snow cover; and a modified scheme in which a three-layer snowpack is modeled. Comparing baseline model results with validation data reveals several model deficiencies. Surface <b>radiation</b> <b>temperatures</b> could not adequately be modeled and the ground froze to unreasonable depths. Furthermore, because of ground cooling resulting from large surface heat fluxes to the atmosphere from the uninsulated surface, deeper model layers did not unfreeze until midsummer. As such, the normal hydrologic processes of runoff, ground water infiltration, and movement, etc., are compromised for {{a good part of the}} year.
