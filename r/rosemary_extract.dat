The capability of extracts of olive and rosemary leaves to attenuate the severe physiological disturbances induced by thioacetamide (TAA) intoxication in male rats has been evaluated. Healthy male Wistar rats were {{used in the present study}} and were divided randomly into eight groups. Rats of the first group were served as normal control.

Two human prostate cancer cell lines, 22 Rv 1 and LNCaP, and prostate epithelial cells procured from two different patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were treated with standardized <b>rosemary</b> <b>extract</b> and evaluated by flow cytometry, MTT, BrdU, Western blot and fluorescent microscopy. A significant modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins was observed in cancer cells while normal prostate epithelial cells did not undergo endoplasmic reticulum stress.

The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined olive oil, virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil depleted of phenols, rapeseed oil, virgin olive oil with <b>rosemary</b> <b>extract</b> and refined olive oil with <b>rosemary</b> <b>extract.</b> The content of antioxidative compounds in the virgin olive oil and the <b>rosemary</b> <b>extract</b> was determined.

Methods: The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the decrease in absorbance as the result of DPPH˙ color change from purple to yellow at 517 nm by using a stopped flow spectrometer UV-Vis, AE (Antiradical effeiciency) was a parameter more exactly used to measure the antioxidant power than EC 50 (efficient concentration to reduce 50...|$|R
