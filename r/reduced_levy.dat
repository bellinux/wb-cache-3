40|$|Paper {{production}} is an energy-intensive process. It accounted for roughly 12. 7 % {{of the industrial}} final energy demand in Germany in 2010. With regard to electricity utilization, it accounted for about 9. 5 % of the industrial electricity demand in Germany in 2010. However, significant potentials to increase energy efficiency via new technologies do exist. Yet realization of these potentials is slow, with lack of profitability {{being one of the}} most important barriers to the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in the industry. The profitability of efficiency investments largely depends on electricity prices with lower prices increasing the pay back time of efficiency investments and vice-versa. Electricity prices include politically driven levies that vary within the EU. Typically, certain exemptions from paying the full levies apply to industrial electricity consumption. Our paper deals with the question of how strongly these levies and privileges that <b>reduce</b> <b>levies</b> for industrial electricity consumption influence the profitability of energy efficiency investment in Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK. As different economic and technical boundary conditions underlie different sectors, we analyse a stylized case in the pulp and paper sector. First, we define a sample paper mill. Important characteristics are the annual electricity consumption (determined by annual production and specific electricity consumption) and the capacity and voltage at which the plant is connected to the electricity grid. Second, we derive the electricity price including levies for the paper mill. Third, we calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) of an investment in a high-efficiency paper refiner. Finally, we vary the politically driven components of the electricity price to investigate their influence on profitability and compare results across countries. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted for varying efficiency gains. The results give insight into a) how strong privileges with regard to policy-driven power price components for industrial electricity consumption affect profitability of energy-efficient investment and b) how this influence differs between the compared member states. Further analysis is needed for energy efficiency technologies with other characteristics and in other sectors...|$|R

40|$|Many {{technologies}} that produce electricity from {{renewable energy sources}} are currently not competitive. This {{is due to the}} fact that their generation cost is higher than that of conventional thermal power plants. Nevertheless, since using renewable energies has a number of positive effects, these installations have been supported by German public policy for many years. This support is currently demonstrated very successfully by the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG), which provides for fixed feed-in tariffs (FITs). The costs of this support scheme are distributed to the electricity consumers. Due to the so-called EEG levy, electricity costs of industry are increased and as a result their competitiveness is decreased. Consequently, electricity intensive enterprises have protested against the levy on a regular basis and finally achieved a reduction of the levy. However, the potential effect of the EEG on the wholesale price for ele ctricity has not yet been considered. Against this background, we analyze the effect of the EEG on electricity prices in a perfect market.

30|$|The {{earnings}} variable {{provided in}} the JC data also has several advantages. Earnings are defined as annual ‘reckonable’ income for the calendar year 6; this is gross income from all sources including bonuses and taxable benefits-in-kind after pension contributions, which are not taxable, have been deducted. 7 The fact that irregular earnings are included is important because firms can adjust labour costs through these components as well as basic pay; for evidence on {{the widespread use of}} adjustments to non-core pay, see Babecky et al. (2012), Du Caju et al. (2013) and Dias et al. (2013). In addition, firms can react to labour market shocks by changing hours of work, so we believe that data on earnings are the most appropriate for capturing the flexibility firms have in adjusting costs. The fact that the income measure is net of pension contributions allows us {{to take into account the}} Public Sector Pension Levy, mentioned in Section 3 above. Since this <b>levy</b> <b>reduces</b> earnings and entails no compensating increase in pension entitlements, it has the same effect as a reduction in gross pay, but it does not register as such in household surveys that record gross earnings.|$|R

The association fought licensing duties and tried to lobby a reduced insurance premium for members affected by the Employers’ Liability Act. It ensured that the Shops Act 1911 did not affect hotels; which would have reduced the working hours to no more than twelve a day, five days a week and fourteen hours on Saturdays.

40|$|Approach-motivated {{humans and}} nonhumans alike display a {{behavioral}} asymmetry {{consisting of a}} right-oriented bias. When dogs observe their owners, they wag their tail toward the right (Quaranta, Siniscalchi, & Vallortigara, 2007); when toads attempt to catch prey, {{they are more likely}} to flick their tongue at prey to their right side than to their left side (Vallortigara, Rogers, Bisazza, Lippolis, & Robins, 1998); when humans kiss their romantic partners, they turn their head to the right twice as often as they turn it to the left (Güntürkün, 2003); and when approach-motivated humans quickly divide a line into two equal parts, they show a rightward bias (Friedman & Förster, 2005; Nash, McGregor, & Inzlicht, 2010). This right-oriented bias in approach-motivated individuals is associated with left-hemispheric brain activation (Harmon-Jones, 2003; Nash et al., 2010). Evolutionary theory suggests that brain lateralization evolved because it enhanced cognitive capacity and brain efficiency: Lateralization allows each hemisphere to specialize in specific tasks that can be per-formed with increased precision and <b>reduced</b> cognitive costs (<b>Levy,</b> 1977). Groups of individuals presumably benefited from having the same directionality of brain lateralization because the sharing of directional behavioral tendencies increased intergroup coordination. Higher levels of coordination would increase a group’s likelihood of survival (Vallortigara & Rogers, 2005) until the directional behavioral tendency became evolutionarily stable (Ghirlanda & Vallortigara, 2004). For example, African hunting dogs move together and hunt in coordinated groups to overpower large prey (Courchamp, Rasmussen, & Macdonald, 2002). These dogs exhibit an evo-lutionarily embedded tendency to move in synchronized ways while they close in on their prey, thereby reducing the effort required for coordinating their actions and increasing their likelihood of success.
