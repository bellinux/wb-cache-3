5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> {{north of the}} fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Brigade Headquarters was {{attacked}} by a force of Germans that had infiltrated through the woods. Informed of the attack, Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, the commanding officer of 9th Parachute Battalion, collected 'C' Company, his own headquarters staff and a small group armed with captured German MG 42 machine-guns. They approached the Germans from the <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> trapped them in a crossfire, killing nineteen and capturing one. That afternoon two infantry platoons attacked 'A' Company, but were fought off by a counter-attack from 'C' Company's position.|$|E

There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
40|$|The main {{question}} {{that has to be}} raised when planning to enhance natural fish populations is whether reared fish are fitted for a life in the wild, or more specifically, whether there are differences between <b>reared</b> <b>and</b> indigenous fish. There are many published examples of observed differences between <b>reared</b> <b>and</b> wild individuals. The causes and effects of these differences are discussed.

Using the ESC 6 scale or ESC 4 scale based on the Empathy Scale for Children constructed by Sakurai (1986) the scores of empathy were as follows. Both the empathy scores of male and female elementary school students who experienced <b>rearing</b> <b>and</b> male and female junior high school students and female high school students who experienced <b>rearing</b> <b>and</b> liking animals were higher.

When {{news of the}} revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force.

This gave her improved {{protection in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> allowed a better field of fire.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} udder and teat {{measurements}} on milk yield in Brown Swiss Cows were studied. The {{differences among the}} means for front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat length, front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat diameter, front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> udder height, distance between front teats and mammary type scores in different lactation numbers were statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat length, <b>and</b> front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> udder height after milking were higher than before milking. Front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat diameter, distance between front teats, distance between <b>rear</b> teats <b>and</b> distance between front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teats after milking were lower than before milking. Furthermore, 305 -day milk yield and milk yield per milking were significantly positively correlated with distance between front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teats <b>and</b> mammary type scores before milking (P < 0. 001). The mean values before milking for front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat length, front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat diameter, front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teat udder height, distance between front teats, distance between rear teats, distance between front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> teats <b>and</b> mammary type scores at general lactation were 59. 45 and 49. 72 mm, 22. 14 and 21. 53 mm, 47. 96 and 47. 59 cm, 12. 29 cm, 7. 76 cm, 9. 58 cm and 23. 65, respectively. In conclusion, teat and udder measurements and mammary type scores significantly affected milk yield.

5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the <b>rear</b> <b>and</b> lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E

The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
