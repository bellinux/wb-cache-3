5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had already developed a working prototype of the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle,</b> seating eight riders in two rows of four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless, motion simulator-based <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> to the public.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{leaving the}} outdoor load area, the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> arrive indoors into the Hundred Acre Wood where Pooh is again {{trying to get}} the honey with the balloon. With Eeyore and the other {{characters}} is Gopher who appears out of his hole to greet the guests. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> move into the rain scene, moved from the second to last scene in Florida's to the second scene in California's. Most of the things at this point are identical to Florida's version. The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> move into the shortened Tigger scene, before moving to Pooh's bedroom where a similar part to that in Florida's version concurs.|$|R
25|$|On June 27, 2001, a <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{overturned}} {{along the}} course of the attraction. Multiple riders suffered minor injuries and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E

5|$|The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> are themed to {{look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the {{previous}} Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles,</b> riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|R

25|$|On 21 July 2000, an 11-year-old boy {{died after}} {{falling out of}} a <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> on the Space Invader roller coaster. Reports say {{that he may have}} panicked on the dark ride and unfastened his seatbelt. As a result of the accident, the ride was closed and {{carriages}} were re-fitted with over the head restraints. The ride opened after a short hiatus as Space Invader 2.|$|E
25|$|On July 10, 2003, a 52-year-old {{grandmother}} was strapping her 4-year-old grandson {{in when the}} ride started up. She died from blunt-force internal injuries after being struck by a <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The park added mirrors to the ride for ride operators to view around the blind spot where the accident occurred, and then introduced a safety announcement which notified the guests that the ride was about to start.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2002, 200 feet (60.9 meters) {{of one of}} VertiGo's 265-foot (80.7 meters) steel towers {{collapsed}} due to {{the removal}} of the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> as part of Cedar Point's preventative maintenance program. The vehicle was an important stabilizer of the towers and, {{as a result of the}} vehicle's removal, the towers were able to sway past the 8 foot (2.4m) sway allowance. The park was closed for the winter, so no one was injured. On March 11, 2002, the park announced the removal of VertiGo rides from both Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm, reasoning guests would be less likely to ride them after the collapse.|$|E
5000|$|On July 9, 2014, {{technical}} difficulties caused <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> to stop, stranding several riders sideways before being rescued. No injuries were reported.|$|R
50|$|On 21 July 2013, {{the ride}} was closed again for review. More {{than a year}} passed before Resorts World Sentosa {{announced}}, in November 2014, that Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon would reopen in early 2015 with new trains. On 25 May 2015, Universal Studios Singapore announced that the ride will return with all-new <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> on 27 May 2015. The ride was reopened officially two days later, with the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> being changed from four-abreast seating to two-abreast seating.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} attraction had 10 <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> which were intended to represent not the [...] "one and only" [...] Dumbo, but the alcohol-induced [...] "pink elephants" [...] scene from the film. In fact, the working title of the attraction was [...] "10 Pink Elephants On Parade" [...] and the elephants were painted pink on installation. Walt Disney objected, not wishing Disneyland's guests to <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> themed to a hallucination and thereby ordered them painted grey.|$|R
25|$|Major {{buildings}} backstage {{include the}} Frank Gehry-designed Team Disney Anaheim, {{where most of}} the division's administration currently works, as well as the Old Administration Building, behind Tomorrowland. The Old Administration Building additionally houses the Grand Canyon and Primeval World dioramas visible on the Disneyland Railroad. The northwest corner of the park is home to most of the park's maintenance facilities, including company vehicle services, including parking lot trams and Main Street vehicles, the scrap yard, where the resort's garbage and recyclables are sorted for collection, Circle D Corral, where the resort's horses and other animals are stabled, parade float storage and maintenance, distribution center for all Resort merchandise, <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> service areas, the paint shop, and the sign shop.|$|E
500|$|According to the Universal Orlando Resort Rider's Guide, {{both legs}} must {{protrude}} {{from under the}} restraint and form a lap. In practice, above-knee amputees will {{not be permitted to}} ride unless their residual natural limb reaches the edge of the seat (or at least includes a knee), even if the lock-bar appears to successfully engage the limb. Lower-limb prosthetics will not offset this requirement since they must be removed prior to boarding the ride. These particular restrictions are not clearly posted at the ride or on the website, which lists the height requirement only. The lower limb prosthetic removal requirement {{can be found at the}} [...] "Accessibility Information" [...] page under [...] "Guests with Prosthetic Limbs." [...] The residual limb length requirement is not listed there but will be enforced at the ride prior to boarding. [...] Wheelchair users who are able to transfer directly to the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> may do so at a separate area, which does not contain the introductory theming of the Floo Network. [...] Instead, wheelchair users pass through a series of unthemed elevators and corridors to arrive at the accessible loading area. [...] Only one accessible <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> is available, and each party must wait for the previous group to return before they may enter the loading area.|$|E
500|$|Riders {{enter the}} queue from the Sci-Fi City themed area of Universal Studios Singapore, the Lower Lot at Universal Studios Hollywood or Production Central at Universal Studios Florida. The first {{portion of the}} queue is a large {{collection}} of switchbacks. The later part of the queue is themed as a [...] (NEST) base. A series of signs and video screens are located within this area. The video screens play briefings from General Morshower, Bumblebee, Ironhide, and Ratchet, who explain that the Decepticons have come to Earth {{in search of the}} AllSpark. Optimus Prime concludes the briefing by introducing all of the Autobots that are featured in the ride. Towards the end of the queue, guests are given a pair of 3D glasses. Once guests arrive at the loading station, they are grouped and loaded into a <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> modeled on an Autobot named Evac.|$|E
50|$|For {{the grand}} finale, when both the #1A and #2B <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> were in use, they both entered a dark theatre where they lined up {{side-by-side}} {{and came to}} a stop in front of a large movie screen. There, Osbourne or the tour guide concluded the tour with a three-minute film montage of classic film moments. At the conclusion of the film, both <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> exited the theatre lined up single-file again and returned to the 1930s soundstage where the ride concluded.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{resemble}} the beds of the Seven Dwarfs and feature {{the names of}} each dwarf, much like their beds in the film. When guests board the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles,</b> they enter the Dwarfs' cottage. Here, the music and yodeling from [...] "The Silly Song" [...] can be heard. Guests pass Snow White followed by some of her animal friends climbing {{the stairs to the}} second floor of the cottage. The guests then move past the Dwarfs, who are performing [...] "The Silly Song".|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|R
500|$|After riders enter a Krusty-themed <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle,</b> Homer orders {{everyone}} to sit down, {{telling them that}} all the seats are the same, except {{the ones that are}} better and threatens to make an annoying noise until they sit down. Even when riders do sit down, Homer always makes the annoying noise, regardless. Jeremy Freedman then appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and assures the riders that their comfort and safety {{are in the hands of}} highly qualified teens, like himself and explains the operators' requirements. He then tells the riders to enjoy themselves, but keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test, because if he does not get a C or higher, he will get kicked out of the audio-visual club. He then begins reading his textbook upside down (unknown to him) while quiet elevator music, utilizing part of the instrumental to [...] "The Simpsons Theme" [...] begins playing in the background. If the ride takes longer than usual to begin, a visual reading 'Krustyland, where fun takes a holiday," [...] with Krusty and Mr. Teeny dancing appears, and the music changes tempo, getting more upbeat.|$|E
500|$|Riders {{are then}} ushered into the {{pre-flight}} [...] "Funhouse" [...] room {{by a team}} member. Here, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where Grampa and Maggie are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions (Maggie doesn't meet the 40 inch height requirement, and Grampa has certain heart conditions that could be aggravated, which proves to be true as he suffers a heart attack, a stroke and a massive aneurysm while trying to deny that he has any heart conditions). Grampa suddenly falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, before Sideshow Bob appears, knocks Krusty out, and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Homer enters, followed {{by the rest of}} the family. Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety video from Itchy and Scratchy. The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders (but showing Scratchy's attempts to follow the safety rules getting sabotaged by Itchy constantly), while riders are ushered into the main ride room.|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 2007, {{one woman}} {{was killed and}} five others injured when the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> fell [...] to the ground {{from the top of}} the lift hill. [...] Park {{management}} said that there was a drop in electric power, causing a water pump to fail to control sufficient water level on the ride.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 2000, 23 {{people were}} injured, when two <b>ride</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{collided}} {{due to a}} failure of the ride's braking system. Of those injured, 21 were taken to hospital.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Happiest Homecoming on Earth" [...] was an eighteen-month-long celebration (held through 2005 and 2006) of {{the fiftieth}} {{anniversary of the}} Disneyland Park, also celebrating Disneyland's {{milestone}} throughout Disney parks worldwide. In 2004, the park underwent major renovations in preparation, restoring many classic attractions, notably Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. Attractions {{that had been in}} the park on opening day had one <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> painted gold, and the park was decorated with fifty Golden Mickey Ears. The celebration started on May 5, 2005, and ended on September 30, 2006, and was followed by the [...] "Year of a Million Dreams" [...] celebration, lasting twenty-seven months and ending on December 31, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|This ride {{system was}} invented {{specially}} for the Indiana Jones Adventure, and {{has only been}} implemented in one other attraction: Dinosaur, located at Disney's Animal Kingdom (opened as CTX: Countdown to Extinction). However, the Japanese counterpart uses linear-inductive actuators instead of three hydraulic rams. The 35 gallons of hydraulic fluid used on the Disneyland version takes two hours {{to clean up the}} track when a hose splits, in which if there is hydraulic failure, the vehicle is incapable of driving. Because of Japan's environmental codes regarding oil spills, the design team elected to substitute electromagnetic actuators on the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle.</b> [...] Three of these actuators are used to create a three-dimensional (pitch, roll, and elevation) motion platform chassis on which the car body sits.|$|E
2500|$|Randomized {{patterns}} of drops and lifts have been added, where the <b>ride</b> <b>vehicle</b> will drop or rise various distances at different intervals. Other added effects include projected {{images of the}} breaking window, wind effects, lightning flashes, and ominous blue-lit figures of the five ghostly original riders. These changes were made so that each trip on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is a slightly different experience. The ride was reprogrammed most recently, in its fourth conversion, so that the ride system allows {{for any number of}} randomized drops and lifts. When guests enter the drop shaft, a computer randomly chooses one of four drop profiles, one of which is {{a modified version of the}} ride's third incarnation. Regardless of the number of randomized drops and lifts, each drop sequence always features one [...] " [...] drop" [...] meant to startle the riders, and one complete drop through the entire tower at the top speed of [...]|$|E
