40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the amount of some potential health-promoting phenols in the grape of Vitis vinifera cv. Cesanese d'Affile and in wines made from these grapes. The analyses were performed using HPLC/DAD/MS. The accumulation of anthocyanins in the skin and flavan- 3 -ols in the seed was determined at different stages of ripening of the grape (i. e. green, veraison, middle stage of ripening, and complete ripening). Thirteen anthocyanins were identified in the skin at all stages of ripening, except the green stage. With regard to flavan- 3 -ols, (+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin, and (-) -epicatechin gallate were detected in all of the seed samples. The highest (+) -catechin content was found in the seeds of the green grape (2 mg g(- 1) DW), whereas in the seeds from the completely <b>ripe</b> <b>grape</b> the content was more than ten times lower. The highest catechin content in the seed was correlated with the lowest anthocyanin content in the skin. The wines produced in the years 2004 and 2005 showed, at wavelengths of 520 and 280 nm, almost identical quali-quantitative chromatographic profiles, with high concentrations of anthocyanin 3 -O-glucosides, low concentrations of acylated anthocyanins, and trace amounts of (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin...|$|E

In the present work, the PCR-RFLP technique {{has been applied to}} the ITS 1 - 5. SS-ITS 2 region of the rDNA to carry out the characterization of potential OTA producing species of Aspergillus section Nigri from different grape varieties grown in Spain. The toxin production levels of the different isolates have also been analysed and the ability of natamycin, a fungicide, to control fungal development and OTA production in vitro has been studied, as well as the interaction with environmental factors {water activity, temperature). The results obtained from in vitro cultures of 205 isolates of species in Aspergillus section Nigri showed that 74. 2 o of A. carbonarius isolates and 14. 3 o of A. tubingensis isolates were capable of producing OTA at different levels. No isolate of A. niger showed OTA producing capacity under the experimental conditions. A. carbonarius was the most frequently isolated ochratoxigenic species. The effect of natamycin against isolates of A. carbonarius has been studied according to different level, water activity and temperature. It can be seen that the efficacy of very low concentrations of this fungicide on fungal growth depends on water activity and temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{automatic}} fruit {{detection and}} precision picking in unstructured environments {{was always a}} difficult and frontline problem in the harvesting robots field. To realize the accurate identification of grape clusters in a vineyard, an approach for the automatic detection of <b>ripe</b> <b>grape</b> by combining the AdaBoost framework and multiple color components was developed by using a simple vision sensor. This approach mainly included three steps: (1) the dataset of classifier training samples was obtained by capturing the images from grape planting scenes using a color digital camera, extracting the effective color components for grape clusters, and then constructing the corresponding linear classification models using the threshold method; (2) based on these linear models and the dataset, a strong classifier was constructed by using the AdaBoost framework; and (3) all the pixels of the captured images were classified by the strong classifier, the noise was eliminated by the region threshold method and morphological filtering, and the grape clusters were finally marked using the enclosing rectangle method. Nine hundred testing samples were used to verify the constructed strong classifier, and the classification accuracy reached up to 96. 56 %, higher than other linear classification models. Moreover, 200 images captured under three different illuminations in the vineyard were selected as the testing images on which the proposed approach was applied, and the average detection rate was as high as 93. 74 %. The experimental {{results show that the}} approach can partly restrain the influence of the complex background such as the weather condition, leaves and changing illumination...|$|E
40|$|Among the viticultural {{techniques}} {{developed to}} obtain wine with reduced alcohol content, {{the use of}} unripe grapes with low sugar and high malic acid concentration, harvested at cluster thinning, was recently explored. So far, no studies have evaluated the fermentation performances of Saccharomyces in unripe grape musts, in terms of fermentation ability and reducing malic acid contents, {{to improve the quality}} of this low-alcohol beverage. In this work, we evaluated 24 S. cerevisiae strains isolated from Italian and Croatian vineyards with different fermentation aptitudes. Moreover, four S. paradoxus were considered, as previous works demonstrated that strains belonging to this species were able to degrade high malic acid amounts in standard musts. The industrial strain S. cerevisiae 71 B was added as reference. Sugar and malic acid contents were modified in synthetic musts in order to understand the effect of their concentrations on alcoholic fermentation and malic acid degradation. S. cerevisiae fermentation performances improved when glucose concentration decreased and malic acid level increased. The conditions that simulate unripe grape must, i. e. low glucose and high malic acid content were found to enhance S. cerevisiae ability to degrade malic acid. On the contrary, S. paradoxus strains were able to degrade high amounts of malic acid only in conditions that resemble <b>ripe</b> <b>grape</b> must, i. e. high glucose and low malic acid concentration. In fermentation trials when low glucose concentrations were used, at high malic acid levels S. cerevisiae strains produced higher glycerol than at low malic acid condition.

40|$|In this study, {{grapes and}} {{corresponding}} wines of Merlot /No 022, 025 and 029 / and Cabernet Franc /No 02, 010 and 012 / clones (recently developed) were evaluated regarding the total phenolic content, total anthocyanin content, and radical scavenging activity, aiming {{to better understand}} their quality and market potential. The nineteen individual polyphenols were quantified in studied grape samples using UHPLC coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The mother grapes and wines were used as the relevant standards. In the grape, studied characteristics were monitored at three stages of berry development: green berry, véraison and mature berry. The mature grape of clones presented high values of total phenolics (3. 81 - 10. 89 g gallic acid equivalent kg- 1 frozen weight), anthocyanin content (359. 00 - 1668. 18 mg malvidin- 3 -O-glucoside kg- 1 frozen weight) and the radical scavenging activity (41. 37 - 80. 48 mmol trolox equivalent kg- 1 frozen weight) depending on the clone. Grapes and wines of Merlot No 025 and Cabernet Franc No 010 stood out with the highest values of all three parameters. Generally, the high correlation was observed between TPC and RSA values for green berries and mature grapes, {{as well as for}} wine samples. The most abundant phenolics in both Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes were gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin gallate, catechin gallate, and rutin. Catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and catechin gallate, typical for the <b>ripe</b> <b>grape</b> of Merlot and Cabernet Franc clones, showed significant correlation with RSA values.

40|$|Wine quality can be {{significantly}} impacted by tannin and polysaccharide composition, which can in turn {{be influenced by}} grape maturity and winemaking practices. This study explored the impact of three commercial wine additives, a maceration enzyme, an oenotannin and a mannoprotein, on the composition and sensory properties of red wine; in particular, in mimicking the mouthfeel associated with wines made from <b>riper</b> <b>grapes.</b> Shiraz grapes were harvested at 24 and 28 °Brix and the former vinified with commercial additives introduced either individually or in combination. Compositional analyses of finished wines included tannin and polysaccharide concentration, composition and size distribution by high performance liquid chromatography, while the sensory profiles of wines were assessed by descriptive analysis. As expected, wines made from <b>riper</b> <b>grapes</b> were naturally higher in tannin and mannoprotein than wines made from grapes harvested earlier. Enzyme addition resulted in a significantly higher concentration and average molecular mass of wine tannin, which increased wine astringency. Conversely, mannoprotein addition reduced tannin concentration and astringency. Addition of oenotannin did not meaningfully influence wine composition or sensory properties.
