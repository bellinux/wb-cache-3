5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical <b>reaction</b> it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical <b>reaction</b> are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{mechanistic}} {{possibility for}} catalysis, multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required {{in order to}} effect the <b>reaction.</b> This limits the atom economy of the <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes do {{not truly}} dimerise, but rather form the dimer by <b>reaction</b> via formamidinium salts, a protonated {{precursor}} species. Accordingly, this <b>reaction</b> can be acid catalysed. This <b>reaction</b> occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes, {{there is no}} loss of aromaticity in protonation of the carbene.|$|E

50|$|In heterocyclic chemistry, organic <b>reactions</b> are {{classified}} by {{the type of}} heterocycle formed with respect to ring-size and type of heteroatom.

5|$|In 1958, Leopold Horner {{published}} a modified Wittig <b>reaction</b> using phosphonate-stabilized carbanions. William S. Wadsworth and William D. Emmons further defined the <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Investigation on this <b>reaction</b> was continued; the {{research}} was aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer <b>reaction</b> and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for this <b>reaction</b> was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer <b>reaction.</b> The idea that this synthesis <b>reaction</b> was indeed a (22Ne,xn) <b>reaction</b> was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the <b>reaction</b> producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{microwave}} synthetic {{methods have}} also been reported. Rhodocenium hexafluorophosphate forms after <b>reaction</b> of cyclopentadiene and rhodium(III) chloride hydrate in methanol following work-up with methanolic ammonium hexafluorophosphate; the <b>reaction</b> yield exceeds 60% with only 30 seconds of exposure to microwave radiation.|$|E

50|$|Curran also revitalized atom {{transfer}} radical <b>reactions.</b> These <b>reactions</b> {{are also}} called Kharasch addition <b>reactions</b> (or sometimes Curran-Kharasch <b>reactions).</b> Morris S. Kharasch discovered and pioneered halogen atom transfer addition <b>reactions</b> in an initial flowering {{period in the}} late 1940s and 1950s. About 40 years later, Curran described fast new <b>reactions</b> involving iodine transfer, bromine transfer and functional group transfer, and encompassing radical addition (ATRA), cyclization (ATRC) and annulation. He introduced sunlamps as convenient tools for photo-initiation of ATRA and ATRC <b>reactions.</b> Curran is also a pioneer in stereoselective radical <b>reactions</b> and radical translocation <b>reactions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The light-independent <b>reactions,</b> or dark <b>reactions,</b> of {{photosynthesis}} are chemical <b>reactions</b> that convert {{carbon dioxide}} and other compounds into glucose.

These <b>reactions</b> take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent <b>reactions</b> and perform further chemical processes on them.

5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain <b>reaction</b> that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a <b>reaction</b> using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain <b>reaction</b> with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain <b>reaction</b> the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such <b>reaction</b> could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E

5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky <b>reaction</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Corey–Chaykovsky <b>reaction</b> or CCR) is a chemical <b>reaction</b> used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The <b>reaction</b> involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The <b>reaction</b> is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E
5|$|The Nazarov {{cyclization}} <b>reaction</b> (often {{referred to}} as simply the Nazarov cyclization) is a chemical <b>reaction</b> used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones. The <b>reaction</b> is typically divided into classical and modern variants, depending on the reagents and substrates employed. It was originally discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906–1957) in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} <b>reaction</b> is {{more widely}} used than the acylation <b>reaction,</b> although its practice is more technically demanding because the <b>reaction</b> is more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as}} other materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the <b>reaction</b> to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts <b>reaction</b> is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

5|$|The rate of a <b>reaction</b> is {{dependent}} on the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products.

Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed <b>reaction</b> (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E
