25|$|The {{networks}} of the North and South Islands were independent {{of one another}} until {{the introduction of the}} inter-island <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> rail ferry service in 1962 by the Railways Department, now branded The Interislander.|$|E
25|$|Peninsula Searoad Transport {{operates}} a vehicular ferry service across {{the mouth of}} the bay between Queenscliff and Sorrento using two <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> vessels. Ferries also run from St Kilda to Williamstown, Victoria across Hobsons Bay. These ferries, like the many recreational cruises, mostly operate for tourists and run around the bay in various locations.|$|E
25|$|The class uses five {{different}} standards of overhead: domestic catenary {{in each of}} Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; fixed-height catenary on LGV lines; and taller catenary in the Channel Tunnel, designed to accommodate double-deck car-carrying trains and <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> heavy goods vehicle trains. The driver must lower and then raise the pantograph during the transition between catenary systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roll-on</b> and <b>roll-off</b> skips {{are similar}} to open skips, but instead of being lifted onto a skip loader wagon by chains, they are rolled on to a wagon with a hook. They are more common as {{industrial}} containers and are not suitable for domestic uses.|$|R

25|$|Port of Tubigon, {{the busiest}} among the smaller ports, {{offers more than}} ten daily round trips plying the Cebu-Bohol route. Catagbacan Port in Loon serves the <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> {{services}} between Cebu and Bohol {{for those who have}} vehicles. Port of Jagna offers service between Bohol to Cagayan and Camiguin (with roll-on/roll-off) route. The other ports are Ubay, Talibon, Getafe, Buenavista, and Clarin.|$|E
25|$|The Main North Line, {{sometimes}} referred to as part of the South Island Main Trunk Railway, is a railway line that runs north from Christchurch in New Zealand up the east coast of the South Island through Kaikoura and Blenheim to Picton. It is a major link in New Zealand's national rail network and offers a connection with <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> ferries from Picton to Wellington. It was also the longest railway construction project in New Zealand's history, with the first stages built in the 1870s and not completed until 1945.|$|E
25|$|Major {{agricultural}} {{products of the}} region include palay, corn, coconut, gold, banana, rubber, oil palm, calamansi, prawns, milkfish, crabs, seaweeds and mango. Caraga's proximity to Cebu and Manila makes it a favorable shipping point for products to and from these markets. Nasipit Port {{can serve as a}} secondary shipping hub to Cagayan de Oro when traffic volume from other points in Mindanao increases. With a <b>roll-on,</b> <b>roll-off</b> (RORO) ferry service now in place, Surigao City serves as a vital transportation link for trucks and buses bound for Luzon.|$|E
5000|$|Ocean Terminal: Also {{owned and}} {{operated}} by the GPA, the Ocean Terminal is a secured, dedicated breakbulk facility specializing in the rapid and efficient handling of a vast array of forest and solid wood products, steel, RoRo (<b>Roll-on</b> / <b>Roll-off),</b> project shipments and heavy-lift cargoes. The 208 acre facility features 6,688 feet (2,039 m) of deepwater berthing, approximately 1.5 million square feet (140,000 m2) of covered storage and 96 acres (390,000 m2) of open, versatile storage.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, China's {{merchant}} marine had fewer than thirty ships. By the 1970s and 1980s, maritime shipping capabilities had greatly increased. In 1985 China established eleven shipping offices and jointly operated shipping companies in foreign countries. In 1986 China ranked ninth in world shipping {{with more than}} 600 ships and a total tonnage of 16 million, including modern <b>roll-on</b> and <b>roll-off</b> ships, container ships, large bulk carriers, refrigerator ships, oil tankers, and multipurpose ships. The fleet called at more than 400 ports in more than 100 countries.|$|R
50|$|Hyannis is {{the main}} point of origin for ferry service to Nantucket. The Steamship Authority runs a year-round {{two and a half}} hour auto ferry service to Nantucket. The island can also be reached by a passenger-only, one-hour {{catamaran}} trip run by the Steamship Authority (seasonal) and Hy-Line Cruises (year-round). Hy-Line also runs a catamaran to Martha's Vineyard in season. One of the world's first <b>Roll-On</b> and <b>Roll-Off</b> ferries, the Searoad of Hyannis operated in 1956 from Hyannis to Nantucket, with the capability to transport three loaded semi-trailers in any weather.|$|R

Dunball railway station, which had opened in 1873, was closed to both passengers and goods in 1964. All traces of the station, other than [...] "Station Road", have been removed.

5000|$|In 1957, Wallace {{moved to}} the City of Baltimore, in Maryland and headed a team to prepare {{a plan for the}} city's ailing central {{business}} district, which had not had any major skyscrapers or substantial new construction {{since the end of the}} [...] "Roaring 20's". Responding to the need for immediate action, the team designed the 22 acre Charles Center, a 33-acre mixed-use project that started the revitalization. Approved by the Baltimore City voters in a bond issue request for $25 million in the municipal elections of November 1958, the concept was strongly supported by two different strong mayors of the city from both political parties: Democrat (from Baltimore's long-standing political dominating machine) Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro, Jr. (1947-1959) and Republican (long a city out-voted minority) Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin, (1943-1947 and 1963-1967). Along with business, commercial and other civic leaders in the Greater Baltimore Committee and the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce.

2500|$|Freight {{services}} on both lines operated {{for many years}} as feeder services from rural districts to nearby major centres and harbours, rather than utilising long-distance services between the important cities. The first through freight from Christchurch to Invercargill did not operate until December 1970. During the 1970s and 1980s, patterns of freight haulage changed dramatically, {{with the last of}} the branch lines closing and an emphasis placed upon long-distance haulage. [...] The South Island Main Trunk is now used to carry significant quantities of long-distance freight, and it connects with the North Island via <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> ferries between Picton and Wellington.

2500|$|In September 2008, an {{independent}} {{review of the}} safety and functionality of the ship revealed that some operating limitations {{will have to be}} accepted, as sea-keeping performance is poor in high sea states.

The issues included that the propellers can come out of the water when the ship pitches in rough seas, with concern that this may affect the ship's machinery. The report also recommended relocating the ship's boats (or protecting them from waves if relocation was not possible) and adding more ballast or improving the ballasting system of Canterbury.|$|E
