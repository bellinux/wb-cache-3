This suggests that project aid is fungible: it creates extra resources available to increase nondiscretionary spending. Third, program aid tends to increase <b>routine</b> <b>expenditure</b> but not development expenditure; thus it mainly serves as budget support. Fourth, aid flows make the government fiscally ?lazy?. The availability of aid is a disincentive to mobilise domestic revenue through a more efficient and effective taxation system.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to answer some}} questions about the financial capacity of local governments to implement regional autonomy. {{in the early stages}} of the implementation of autonomy, financial aspects have been crucial for every kabupaten and kota administration 1. according to laws no. 22, 1999 and no. 25, 1999, financial management is an important indicator of local government performance in determining whether they can continue as autonomous entities or should be merged with other neighboring kabupaten or kota. some of the related issues to be discussed include: what is the regional budget allocation that each local government is to receive and what is the formula applied by the central government to determine this allocation? is the allocated budget smaller than the amount received by local governments prior to regional autonomy? is the allocated budget from the central government less than the amount required for local civil servant salaries and routine bureaucratic and administrative expenses? why have local governments been so eager to increase local revenues? what is the likely impact of this on the business climate? based on the results of field studies conducted by smeru in twelve kabupaten and kota across nine provinces, it is apparent that in many cases, local governments at the kabupaten and kota level have received an allocation of funds from the central government that exceeds <b>routine</b> <b>expenditures.</b> however, this level of funding is substantially less than the total transferred into the regions (including funds received by central government offices operating at the kabupaten and kota level) during the period before regional autonomy. it is a different matter, however, at the province level where the allocation of funds from the central government is much smaller than their <b>routine</b> <b>expenditures.</b> the size of the budget allocation is one the key reasons given by local bureaucrats to explain why local governments, both at the kabupaten and kota level as well as at the provincial level, have been working hard to increase local revenues by imposing more local taxes and levies. the negative impact of these levies on the business and investment climate has not been fully captured by recent field studies. local businessmen have pointed out that most levies have not yet been fully imposed and there is some variation between regions in the degree of their commitment to the creation of these new taxes. but it is widely accepted by local businessmen that all these new levies will create distortions in the market and a high-cost economy in the near future. some indications of these potential distortions can be already identified and will be discussed in detail in the paper. if this pattern continues without any amendments by local government or if the central government fails to intervene, another fundamental question arises: will regional autonomy be able to achieve its important goals of improving the quality of public services and increasing the participation of local business in the local economy in the regions throughout Indonesia? 1 kabupaten is the Indonesian term for district under province level while kota is the term applied to municipalities...|$|R

On the revenue side, although the role of revenue receipts in government revenue is improving, but the change is not large., it means the fiscal dependency of local governments to the central government greater. On the expenditure side, until the year 2011 expenditures area still dominated by <b>routine</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{that do not have}} an impact on the local economy's production capacity. In a case study of Papua province, the study showed that during the first ten years of fiscal decentralization, revenue structure Papua province weakened due to the implementation of special autonomy. This is evident from the increasing size of the role of locally generated revenues and a greater role in the transfer of central government revenue. On the other hand, the impact of additional spending to repair the level of prosperity, has declined. As a whole and in particular in Papua province, there are some very large potential issues. The first problem is the low ratio of provincial and local government taxes. At the provincial level there are only two that have a tax rate of more than 5 percent of PDRB. At the district level there are still many areas that the tax rate is much lower than 1 percent of PDRB. This suggests that local governments will continue to become more dependent on the central government. The second problem is still a poor level of efficiency and effectiveness of budget management. In the long term this can lead to loss of local budgets function as an instrument of social welfare improvements. The third problem is the lack of impact of budget growth to the level of welfare improvement. If not corrected, the long-term waste scarce resources will become chronic. Based on these results it can be concluded that the implementation of fiscal decentralization in Indonesia, during the first decade, has not given the expected results.

To quantify the impact of maintenance, maintenance effect models were developed. The third issue involved the development of a life-cycle cost algorithm {{that can be used to}} determine the most cost-effective maintenance scenario. The costs included in the evaluation were annual routine maintenance, annual user costs, seal coating costs and resurfacing costs at the end of a life cycle. ^ The analysis of <b>routine</b> maintenance <b>expenditures</b> illustrated trend of higher roadway and shoulder maintenance costs for Other-State highways (OSH) than for Interstate highways (ISH). In general the average roadway maintenance cost of OSH was about 85 % to 120 % higher than that of ISH. Patching and crack sealing activities contributed to about 70 % of total roadway maintenance cost. Shoulder maintenance on OSH was observed to contribute to about 30 % of the total cost of the maintenance activities considered in this study. ^ The testing of significance of pavement condition means yielded three groups of findings: the first group contained activities that demonstrated a definitely significant impact on either pavement roughness and/or pavement serviceability; the second group, activities that demonstrated marginally significant impact; and the third, activities that could not be confirmed either way. ^ The life cycle cost analysis indicated that periodic maintenance activities such as seal coating are only stop-gap measures allowing flexibility in capital spending and not a cost-effective solution to pavement deterioration problem. ...|$|R

Realization of a more realistic regional autonomy can offer tangible economic, social and political benefits to the region. This paper analyze the influence of central government transfer, Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita, consumer price index to original regional income (PAD), and the influence of central government transfer, PDRB per capita, population to routine and regional development expenditure. Data panels of all districts and cities (29 districts and 6 cities) since 2001 up to 2004 are used and the analyzing instrument used by pooled data with fixed effect model. The result of the study shown that central government transfer and the GRDP per capita positive and significant influence to the PAD, routine and regional development expenditure. Consumer price index has positive and significant influence to the PAD, and the total population only has positive and significant influence to the <b>routine</b> <b>expenditure</b> and has nothing to do with development expenditure...|$|E
40|$|In 1999 - 2002, most of regions have a {{specific}} pattern in efficiency. This de¬pends on characteristics of the regions. The greatest different among of regions is fiscal ca¬pacity. Using Data Envelopment Analysis, performance of fiscal policy can be measured. Some variables that used are General Transfer (DAU), <b>Routine</b> <b>Expenditure,</b> Expenditure for Transportation, Local Tax, and Local User Charge. This study found, there are two regions that achieve best performance. They are DKI Jakarta and East Java. These regions are not only efficient but also consistent. Most of effi¬cient region will be a benchmark to the others. On the other hand, each region that is inefficient has different source of inefficiency. Some of them are inefficient in DAU, expenditure, local tax and user charge. The pattern of fiscal capacity and fiscal policy performance indicate {{that there is a}} regional development gap in Indonesia. Bali and Java have better performance relative to the others. Because of specific characteristic of region, it is important to make {{a specific}} ap¬proach for each region...|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} of this {{research}} was to analyze the local government response to the intergovernmental transfers. The main objective {{of this research}} was to get a deeper analytical results about the contribution of the intergovernmental transfers on the local own revenue, <b>routine</b> and development <b>expenditures</b> in the case of district and municipality gov¬ernments in Indonesia over the period of 1988 - 2002. Using the simultaneous equation system, we concluded that the intergovernmental transfers stimulate the increase of the local government expenditures larger than that of the local own revenue. It seems that the dependency of local government onto the intergovern¬mental transfers will be worse. The local governments in the long run tend to use the exter¬nal borrowing to finance the increase of their expenditures. Those results above suggest that (1) the distribution of intergovernmental transfers among regions should consider the local tax effort, and (2) services minimum standard plays an important role to realize the expen¬ditures efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityRoutine maintenance expenditures make up a significant fraction of the overall life-cycle costs incurred by highway agencies, and thus constitute a key input in cost evaluation. Most life-cycle cost analyses have proceeded only with very rough approximations of average annual maintenance expenditure due to difficulty in acquiring data. In addressing this issue, this thesis uses data from in-house maintenance records and other data sources to develop a cohesive and comprehensive dataset covering state highway pavement sections in Indiana, a state located in the wet-freeze climatic region in the United States. To assist in budgeting and life-cycle cost analysis, this thesis developed annual maintenance expenditure models using an array of statistical and econometric techniques, including ordinary least square, tobit, panel, and two-stage regression. This thesis identifies a number of explanatory variables that significantly influence maintenance expenditures and examines {{the sensitivity of the}} response to each of these variables. Specifically, the geographic region, pavement segment length, and age were found to be significant indicators annual <b>routine</b> pavement maintenance <b>expenditure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Wujiang River is a {{tributary}} of the upper Yangtze River that shows great variations in its flow regime and habitat condition. Dams have been built along the Wujiang River and have altered the habitats profoundly enough that they may give rise to reproductive isolation. To test whether the swimming performance and morphology of the Chinese hook snout carp (Opsariichthys bidens), varied among habitats and whether the possible differences had a genetic basis, we measured the steady and unsteady swimming performance, external body shape and genetic distance among fish collected from both the main and tributary streams of the upper, middle and lower reaches along the river. We also measured the <b>routine</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), cost of transport (COT) and calculated the optimal swimming speed. The steady swimming capacity, RMR, MMR and optimal swimming speed were all higher and the COT was lower in the upper reach or tributary streams compared with the lower reach or main stream. However, unsteady swimming performance showed no variation among collecting sites. Flow regimes as suggested by river slope and water velocity were positively correlated with steady swimming performance but not with unsteady swimming performance. Predation stress were significantly related with body morphology and hence energy cost during swimming but not U(crit) value. The fish from only one population (Hao-Kou) showed relatively high genetic differentiation compared with the other populations. Fish from the upper reach or tributary streams exhibited improved steady swimming performance through improved respiratory capacity and lower energy expenditure during swimming at the cost of higher maintenance metabolism. There was no correlation between the steady and unsteady swimming performance at either the population or the individual levels. These results suggest that a trade-off between steady and unsteady swimming does not occur in O. bidens...|$|R
