50|$|Remembering that in PFM an AC bias of {{a certain}} {{frequency}} causes a deformation of the sample material at that same frequency the system {{can be considered as}} a driven harmonic oscillator. As such there exists a resonance as a function of driving frequency. This effect has been exploited in PFM to provide an enhancement in the PR signal, thus allowing for a higher signal-to-noise or similar signal-to-noise at lower driving bias amplitude. Typically this contact resonance is in the kilo- to mega-hertz range which is several times higher in frequency than the first free harmonic in air of the cantilever used. However a drawback is that the contact resonance is dependent not only on the dynamic response of the cantilever but also on the elastic modulus of the sample material immediately in contact with the probe tip and so therefore can change during scanning over different areas. This leads to a change in the measured PR amplitude and so is undesirable. One method of bypassing the inherent disadvantages of contact resonance PFM is to change the driving frequency in order to shadow or track the changes in the frequency of the contact resonance. This feature as developed by Asylum Research called Dual AC™ <b>Resonance</b> <b>Tracking</b> (DART) uses two limit frequencies {{on either side of the}} contact resonance peak and so can sense changes in the peak position. It is then possible to adapt the AC bias driving frequency correspondingly in order to maintain the signal boost that results from the contact resonance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} analytically and experimentally {{an acoustic}} levitation motor {{which has the}} ability to levitate and rotate an object in the air without mechanical contact. To realize such a device two core methods are applied simultaneously; (i) <b>resonance</b> <b>tracking</b> with an Autoresonance feedback loop, (ii) generation of controlled structural traveling waves. The purpose of the first method is to achieve near-field acoustic levitation, which can levitate an object of a few kilograms. In this research, this is accomplished through high amplitude vibration of an aluminum annulus at ultrasonic frequencies (~ 30 kHz). For high efficiency, the annulus is designed to have a very high Q value, and operating even slightly off resonance ceases levitation. Compounding this {{is the fact that the}} natural frequency constantly drifts as ambient conditions and loading change. To accommodate such a drift, and produce stable levitation automatically, a <b>resonance</b> <b>tracking</b> feedback loop is employed here. Simultaneously, the purpose of the second method is to achieve propulsion forces on the levitated object by propagating and controlling traveling waves in the aluminum annulus to create a thin layer of rotating air beneath the levitated body. Even though a single vibration mode can produce only standing waves, an axisymmetric structure possesses two modes per natural frequency, and excitation of a doublet mode pair can generate effective travelling waves. The present paper develops the theory behind the use of the Autoresonance feedback method for achieving constant levitation and propagating travelling waves in co- and counter rotating directions. It will be shown that all this can be accomplished with only single sensor. The result is a stable, repeatable and a highly controllable contactless acoustic levitation motor.

40|$|A {{digital control}} system based partly on an extremum-seeking control {{algorithm}} tracks the changing resonance frequency of a piezoelectric actuator or an electrically similar electromechanical device that {{is driven by}} a sinusoidal excitation signal and is required to be maintained at or near resonance {{in the presence of}} uncertain, changing external loads and disturbances. Somewhat more specifically, on the basis of measurements of the performance of the actuator, this system repeatedly estimates the resonance frequency and alters the excitation frequency as needed to keep it at or near the resonance frequency. In the original application for which this controller was developed, the piezoelectric actuator is part of an ultrasonic/sonic drill/corer. Going beyond this application, the underlying principles of design and operation are generally applicable to tracking changing resonance frequencies of heavily perturbed harmonic oscillators. Resonance-frequency-tracking analog electronic circuits are commercially available, but are not adequate for the present purpose for several reasons: The input/output characteristics of analog circuits tend to drift, often necessitating recalibration, especially whenever the same controller is used in driving a different resonator. In the case of an actuator in a system that has multiple modes characterized by different resonance frequencies, an analog controller can tune erroneously to one of the higher-frequency modes. The lack of programmability of analog controllers is problematic when faults occur, and is especially problematic for preventing tuning to a higher-frequency mode. In contrast, a digital controller can be programmed to restrict itself to a specified frequency range and to maintain stability even when the affected resonator is driven at high power and subjected to uncertain disturbances and variable loads. The present digital control system (see figure) is implemented by means of an algorithm that comprises three main subalgorithms: a hill-climbing control algorithm, an estimation-based extremum-seeking control (ESC) algorithm, and a supervisory algorithm. The hill-climbing algorithm is useful for coarse tracking to find and remain within the vicinity of the resonance. The ESC algorithm is not capable of coarse <b>resonance</b> <b>tracking,</b> but is capable of fine <b>resonance</b> <b>tracking</b> once the estimates of parameters generated by the hill-climbing algorithm have converged sufficiently.

Piezoresponse force microscopy has also been demonstrated as a useful tool to detect mechanical strain originating from electrical phenomena in non-piezoelectric materials.

Calculation tools were developed for photoacoustic cell design, namely (i) a method estimating the acoustic quality factor of a cavity even for open configurations; and (ii) a technique calculating the effectiveness of light-sound energy conversion. An open, windowless resonant photoacoustic chamber was designed, that has high acoustic quality factor and good noise suppression. In such a chamber neither the window material nor the contamination adsorbed on the window surface can contribute to the generation of unwanted coherent background signal.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for high-ac-curacy tracking of vocal-tract resonances (which coincide with formants for nonnasalized vowels) in natural speech. The tech-nique {{is based on a}} discretized nonlinear prediction function, which is embedded in a temporal constraint on the quantized input values over adjacent time frames as the prior knowledge for their temporal behavior. The nonlinear prediction is constructed, based on its analytical form derived in detail in this paper, as a parameter-free, discrete mapping function that approximates the “forward ” relationship from the resonance frequencies and bandwidths to the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) cepstra of real speech. Discretization of the function permits the “inversion” of the function via a search operation. We further introduce the nonlinear-prediction residual, characterized by a multivariate Gaussian vector with trainable mean vectors and covariance matrices, to account for the errors due to the functional approx-imation.

40|$|Vibration induced High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) {{is a major}} {{consideration}} in designing gas turbines. Indeed, the Gas Turbine manufacturer must demonstrate that the vibration level of the turbomachinery blading is acceptably low, usually by using an engine strain gauge test. If the test shows unacceptable vibration levels then a redesign is required which adds cost and time to the engine development programme. It is highly desirable, therefore to develop a capability which can predict the vibration level of the blade {{to ensure that it}} will be robust. The High-Pressure Turbine is of particular interest because of the harshness of the environment in which it operates (high mechanical speed and high air temperatures and pressures) so friction dampers are routinely introduced to control the vibration level. The friction dampers can introduce a degree of non-linearity into the structure which affects not only the vibration amplitude, but also the resonant frequency. The resonant frequency, amplitude, damper behaviour and aerodynamic forcing are all inter-related such that they must be considered as a single system. This thesis describes the development of two new approaches to predict the vibration behaviour of a High-Pressure Turbine blade including the effect of friction dampers. The first utilises existing prediction tools for modelling of the fluid, the structure and the friction behaviour, but uses a novel method for coupling the various aspects together. This approach is based on modelling an ‘engine acceleration’ across a wide speed range and prescribing the variation of all the relevant parameters with shaft speed. For example, both the excitation force on the blade and the centrifugal load of the damper vary strongly with rotor speed so these effects must be included in the analysis. The second approach extends the first approach by using a new iterative ‘resonance tracking’ methodology in which the aerodynamic boundary conditions are adjusted based on the shaft speed at resonance until convergence is reached. Both methodologies calculate the resonant frequency, amplitude and operating condition of each mode of interest as an output of the analysis. The engine acceleration methodology has been investigated in detail and has been validated against several High-Pressure Turbine cases. It {{has been found to be}} reliable: the amplitude predictions were in broad agreement with the available engine strain gauge results and the frequency shift introduced by the damper was in very good agreement. The methodology captures some important features of the physical system such as (a) the amplitude dependence of the damper, (b) the sudden drop in frequency when approaching the second flap resonance because the damper starts to slide, and (c) the effect of the damper on the ratio between stress and tip displacement. One rather surprising result was that in certain cases, where the forcing level was low, the damper increased the blade response because it moved the resonance to a higher shaft speed where the forcing level was larger. The main advantage of the method is its speed, which allows optimisation of key parameters within design timescales. The <b>resonance</b> <b>tracking</b> methodology has been compared directly with the engine acceleration approach on one of the test cases and it produced very similar results. Convergence was achieved quickly, in two or three iterations for the chosen test case, mainly because the blade surface pressure distribution was consistent across a broad speed range. The method showed that the first torsion resonance was more sensitive to aerodynamic conditions than the second flap mode, and may offer an explanation for the scatter seen in engine test results. The approach offers the advantage that it is more generally applicable, because it can deal with cases where the pressure distribution is sensitive to shaft speed, but it can only converge to a single mode and requires significantly more computational effort. The methodologies have been used to explore vibration reduction strategies such as wake shaping, damper optimisation and defining acceptance limits for the orientation of the single crystal material used in turbine manufacture. Overall these provided almost an order of magnitude reduction in blade response. QC 2010082...|$|E
