40|$|I {{describe}} the general mathematical construction and physical picture of topological black holes, which are black holes whose event horizons are surfaces of non-trivial topology. The construction {{is carried out}} in an arbitrary number of dimensions, and includes all known special cases which have appeared before in the literature. I {{describe the}} basic features of massive charged topological black holes in $(3 + 1) $ dimensions, from both an exterior and interior point of view. To investigate their interiors, {{it is necessary to}} understand the <b>radiative</b> falloff <b>behaviour</b> of a given massless field at late times in the background of a topological black hole. I describe the results of a numerical investigation of such behaviour for a conformally coupled scalar field. Significant differences emerge between spherical and higher genus topologies.

40|$|In {{the fight}} to reduce carbon emissions, {{it is easy to}} see the {{necessity}} of reducing energy consumption. Buildings consume a large amount of energy, and have significant potential for energy savings. One tool for realising these potential savings is building simulation. To be able to use building simulation, accurate models for windows are needed. The models include individual layer models, to determine the solar and longwave <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviours,</b> as well as whole-system models to determine heat flows through the various layers of fenestration systems. This thesis looks at both kinds of models for incorporating windows into building simulations. A new network whole-system model is implemented, and integrated into the California Simulation Engine building simulation software. This model is also used as the calculation engine for a stand-alone rating tool. Additionally, a measurement technique used to measure off-normal solar properties of drapery materials, as part of developing shading layer models, is investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The network model uses a very general resistance network, allowing heat transfer between any two layers in a complex fenestration system (CFS), whether they are adjacent or not, between any layer and the indoor or outdoor side, or between the indoor and outdoor sides, although this last case is unlikely. Convective and radiative heat transfer are treated using the same format, resulting in increased stability. This general resistance network is used to calculate indices of merit for the CFS using numerical experiments. This approach requires fewer iterations to solve than previous solution methods, and is more flexible. The off-normal measurement technique which was investigated used a sample holder inserted into an integrating sphere. This is a non-standard way of using an integrating sphere, and early analyses did not provide conclusive information as to the effect of the sample holder. A Monte Carlo analysis confirmed the amount of beam attenuation as being 20 % for the sample holder used in the experiments. Also con firmed was the effectiveness of dual-beam integrating spheres in correcting for the presence of a sample holder. The stand-alone rating tool which uses the general network framework, incorporates an easy-to-use visual interface. This tool models multiple types of shading layers with no restrictions on how they are combined. Users can easily change any one layer to see the effects of different arrangements. Users may specify any combination of indoor and outdoor ambient and mean radiant temperatures, insolation, and beam/diffuse split...|$|R
40|$|We present {{generalised}} Monte-Carlo {{calculations of}} bipolar charge carrier transport in polydiacetylene to assess effects of some key factors on {{the properties of}} polymer-based light emitting diodes. Our mesoscopic model includes specific realisations of the polymer network and examines the effect of polymer structural order on current flow and charge recombination within the polymer layer. Specifically addressed are the issues concerning the fractions of polymer strands contributing to the charge injection processes at electrode interfaces and to electroluminescence. Our results suggest that radiative recombination increases as short chain concentration increases, whereas current efficiency shows an opposite <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Radiative</b> recombination decreases as charge injection efficiency decreases and its internal efficiency seems to saturate for a luminescent chain concentration greater than 30 %. Our results also suggest that both current efficiency and space charge increases as charge injection efficiency decreases. Polymer disorder due to inclusions in the network does seem to contribute to reduce both current and recombination efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{sensitivity}} of the surface temperature on an increase of cloudiness due to airtraffic within a case study. A radiative convective model is used which originally was created by Liou, 1983. This model calculates the vertical temperature profile. It was modified to include surface properties, radiative conditions, and advection appropriate to the case study. The description of ice clouds was modified using latest scientific findings. Input parameters belonging to the radiative properties of ice clouds in the solar spectrum are the broadband transmittance and reflectance, in the terrestrial spectrum the broadband transmittance, emittance, and reflectance. The size distribution was modelled by using a parameterization for particles greater than 20 #mu#m. Smaller ice particles distributions are based on in-situ measurements. Such a determination of an ice particle size distribution within this small size regime is a novelty. A great amount of 'small' ice particles was found by this method and therefore one has to expect a significant role of the particles in governing the <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> of ice clouds. Using these findings, the input parameters for the radiative convective model were calculated. Within these calculations, it is shown that the effect of the small ice particles on the <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the cloud is significant. For the ice clouds an optical thickness of 0. 11, a solar transmittance of 0. 858 and a reflectance of 0. 139 will be found. Within the terrestrial region, the emittance is found to be 0. 315, the transmittance 0. 733, and the reflectance 0. 024. The result is an increase of the surface temperature by 0. 5 K due to an increase of high cloud cover of as much as 10 % of the sky. (orig.)

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{characterize the}} collective <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> of N classical emitters near an interface between different dielectrics {{that supports the}} transfer of surface plasmon modes into the far-field of electromagnetic radiation. The phenomena of superradiance and surface plasmons can be combined to amplify the emitted radiation intensity S as S= A N^ 2 S_ 0 compared to a single emitter's intensity S_ 0 in free space. For a practical case study within the paper A= 240, compared to A= 1 in free space. We furthermore demonstrate that there are collective modes for which {{the intensity of the}} emitted radiation is suppressed by two orders of magnitude despite their supperadiant emission characteristics. A method to control the emission characteristics of the system and to switch from super- to sub-radiant behaviour with a suitably detuned external driving field is devised.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} performing measurements of turbulent quantities and spectra in hypersonic wind tunnel flows, using a miniature pitot probe, is presented. The {{results of an}} extensive investigation of velocity fluctuation spectra, performed in the weakly compressible, decaying turbulent field established in the test section of a small scale hypersonic (Mach 6) wind-tunnel, at low enthalpy conditions, are also presented. A discussion of the fundamental assumptions is provided, together with experimental and theoretical considerations of applicability and limits of the proposed method. The measured one-dimensional spectra exhibits a non-Kolmogorov power-law behaviour over a significant wavenumber range, with a – 11 / 3 exponent which is not predicted by available scaling relations for compressible turbulence. On the other hand, such power-law exponent is in agreement with EDQNM and LES results for the irrotational component of velocity fluctuations in weakly compressible flows [1, 2]. Based on these results, a new dimensionally-based scaling relation is obtained for the compressible energy spectrum, which is {{in agreement with the}} numerically observed <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> for weakly compressible turbulence...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{approach}} to asymptotic electromagnetic fields introduced by Goldberg and Kerr (J. Math. Phys. 5 (1964)) is used to study various aspects of Lorentz Covariant Gravity. Retarded multipole moments of the source, the central objects of this study, are defined, and a sequence of conservation equations for these are derived from the conservation of the energystress-momentum tensor of the source. The solution of the linearized Einstein field equation is obtained {{in terms of the}} retarded moments for a general bound source field, correct to O(r − 4). This is used to obtain the peeling–off of the linearized field, and to study the geometric optics approximation for the field and for the energy-momentum of the field, given by the Landau– Lifschitz pseudotensor. It is shown that the energy-momentum 4 -vector splits into the ‘total radiated 4 -momentum ’ and the ‘bound 4 -momentum of the source’, similar to the case of the electromagnetic field. The role played by the conservation equations in studying the <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the field is stressed throughout. In addition, {{in the case of a}} source which has only retarded pole, dipole and quadrupole moments, it is shown how to derive the arbitrary dependence of the field on a null coordinate. This allows comparison with the solutions for linearized gravity obtained by other authors. I...|$|E
40|$|Retrievals of aerosol {{optical depth}} (AOD) and related {{parameters}} from satellite measurements typically involve prescribed models of aerosol size and composition, {{and are therefore}} dependent on how well these models are able to represent the <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> of real aerosols, This study uses aerosol volume size distributions retrieved from Sun-photometer measurements at 11 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) island sites, spread throughout the world's oceans, as a basis to define such a model for unpolluted maritime aerosols. Size distributions are observed to be bimodal and approximately lognormal, although the coarse mode is skewed with a long tail on the low-radius end, The relationship of AOD and size distribution parameters to meteorological conditions is also examined, As wind speed increases, so do coarse-mode volume and radius, The AOD and Angstrom exponent (alpha) show linear relationships with wind speed, although there is considerable scatter in all these relationships, limiting their predictive power. Links between aerosol properties and near-surface relative humidity, columnar water vapor, and sea surface temperature are also explored. A recommended bimodal maritime model, which is able to reconstruct the AERONET AOD with accuracy of order 0. 01 - 0. 02, is presented for use in aerosol remote sensing applications. This accuracy holds at most sites and for wavelengths between 340 nm and 1020 nm. Calculated lidar ratios are also provided, and differ significantly from those currently used in Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) processing...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} new {{developments}} for the analytic calculation of tree- and multi-loop level amplitudes. Similarly, we study and extend their analytic properties. We propose a Four-dimensional formulation (FDF) {{equivalent to the}} four-dimensional helicity scheme (FDH). In our formulation, particles propagating inside the loop are represented by four dimensional massive internal states regulating the divergences. We provide explicit four-dimensional representations of the polarisation and helicity states of the particles propagating in the loop. Within FDF, we use integrand reduction and four dimensional unitarity to perform analytic computations of one-loop scattering amplitudes. The calculation of tree level scattering amplitude, in this framework, allows for a simultaneous computation of cut-constructible and rational parts of one-loop scattering amplitudes. We present a set of non-trivial examples, showing that FDF scheme is suitable for computing important 2 → 2, 3, 4 partonic amplitudes at one-loop level. We start by considering two gluons production by quark anti-quark annihilation. Then, the (up to four) gluon production, gg→ ng with n= 2, 3, 4. And finally, the Higgs and (up to three) gluons production via gluon fusion, gg→ ng H with n= 1, 2, 3, in the heavy top mass limit. We also investigate, by following a diagrammatic approach, the role of colour-kinematics (C/K) duality of off-shell diagrams in gauge theories coupled to matter. We study the behaviour of C/K-duality for theories in four- and in d-dimensions. The latter follows the prescriptions given by FDF. We show that the Jacobi relations for the kinematic numerators of off-shell diagrams, built with Feynman rules in axial gauge, reduce to a C/K-violating term due to the contributions of sub-graphs only. We discuss {{the role of the}} off-shell decomposition in the direct construction of higher-multiplicity numerators satisfying C/K-duality. We present the QCD process gg→ qq̅g. An analogous study, within FDF, is carried out for d-dimensionally regulated amplitudes. The computation of dual numerators generates, as byproduct, relations between tree-level amplitudes with different orderings. These relations turn to be the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) identities for four- and d-dimensionally regulated amplitudes. We combine BCJ identities and integrand reduction methods to establish relations between one-loop integral coefficients for dimensionally regulated QCD amplitudes. We also elaborate on the <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> of tree-level scattering amplitudes in the soft regime. We show that the subleading soft term in single-gluon emission of quark-gluon amplitudes in QCD is controlled by differential operators, whose universal form can be derived from both Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten recursive relations and gauge invariance, as it was shown to hold for graviton and gluon scattering. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, we describe the main features of the multi-loop calculations. We briefly describe the adaptive integrand decomposition (AID), a variant of the standard integrand reduction algorithm. AID exploits the decomposition of the space-time dimension in parallel and orthogonal subspaces. We focus, in particular, on the calculation of 2 → 2, 3 partonic amplitudes at two loop-level...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{continuous}} global increase in energy demand, a possible source {{of renewable energy}} is certainly represented by solar energy. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) represents an excellent alternative, or add-on to existing systems {{for the production of}} energy on a large scale, like steam turbine power plants. In CSP systems, specular surfaces (heliostats) reflect the incoming sunlight, focusing it on a single or multiple focal points. In some of these systems, the Solar Power Tower plants (SPT), the conversion of solar radiation into heat occurs in certain components defined as solar receivers, placed in correspondence of the focus of the reflected sunlight. In a particular type of solar receivers, defined as volumetric, the use of porous materials is foreseen. These receivers are characterized by a porous structure called absorber. The latter, hit by the reflected solar radiation, transfers heat to the evolving fluid; generally air subject to natural convection. The proper design of these elements is essential in order to achieve high efficiencies, making such structures extremely beneficial for the overall performances of the energy production process. In order to obtain higher efficiencies, a proper combination of the structure parameters such as porosity, heat exchange surface and optical properties is needed. Thus, a deep preliminary study for the characterization and the optimization of the shape of the absorber has been performed. Furthermore, the conclusions and results obtained by the preliminary study reported above have been used in order to design a porous structure that is able to improve the performance of the current in-house technology of open volumetric air receivers. A parametric study and an optimized characterization of the structure have been performed, taking into account current technology limitations {{with the use of a}} self-developed continuum-based numerical model. Here, the porous volume is represented by a homogeneous zone described by means of effective weighted parameters and properties, depending on the type of material and the structure considered, such as the porosity, the heat exchange surface and the extinction coefficient. With this initial numerical work, it was possible to evaluate the consequences of the variation of the effective parameters and properties on the performances of the heat and mass transfer in porous media. As a result of this study, hypothetical structures presenting high porosity in combination with a high exchange surface show the best performances. Furthermore, a proper adaptation to the radiative needs, that means the use of low absorptive zones for the front and high absorptive zones for the inner, is needed in order to achieve even higher efficiency. The knowledge and results gained through this study have been used to define an optimization path in order to improve the absorber microstructure, starting from current in-house state-of-the art technology till obtaining a brand new advanced geometry characterized by extremely thin walls and, since presenting a graded porosity, a <b>radiative</b> <b>behaviour</b> that is well adapted to the different needs during the heat transfer process. This structure has been numerically tested through detailed CFD simulation, showing performance improvements and it will be object of study during an upcoming experimental campaign. The numerical tool used in this other working package, differs from the continuum-based one introduced above since a detailed representation of the porous geometry is herein considered. Thus, with the use of a commercial CFD code, it has been possible to simulate the conjugate heat and mass transfer phenomena. The presented advanced geometry will be manufactured in the following months and a cylindrical sample prototype will be tested with the use of the Xenon-high-flux solar simulator test facility...|$|E
