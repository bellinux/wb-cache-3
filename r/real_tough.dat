However, CBS News reported that speed and weather were not attributed as factors for the accident's occurrence.

5000|$|Berra was {{excellent}} at hitting pitches {{outside of the}} strike zone, covering {{all areas of the}} strike zone (as well as beyond) with great extension. In addition to this wide plate coverage, he also had great bat control. He was able both to swing the bat like a golf club to hit low pitches for deep home runs and to chop at high pitches for line drives. Whether changing speeds or location, pitcher Early Wynn soon discovered that [...] "Berra moves right with you." [...] Five times, Berra had more home runs than strikeouts in a season, striking out just twelve times in 597 at-bats in 1950. The combination of bat control and plate coverage made Berra a feared [...] "clutch hitter", proclaimed by rival manager Paul Richards [...] "the toughest man in the league in the last three innings".

He decided {{to take a chance on}} a complete unknown, and she was cast in over twenty westerns in a two-year period. Only receiving $25 a picture, Arthur suffered from difficult working conditions: [...] "The films were generally shot on location, often in the desert near Los Angeles, under a scorching sun that caused throats to parch and make-up to run.

[...] The films were moderately successful in second-rate Midwestern theaters, though Arthur received no official attention. Aside from appearing in films for Action Pictures between 1924 and 1926, she appeared in some independent westerns including The Drug Store Cowboy (1925), and westerns for Poverty Row, as well as having an uncredited bit part in Buster Keaton's Seven Chances (1925).|$|R
50|$|Hill {{says the}} film was not {{intentionally}} political.It is an adventure story that harkens back to a Jack London tradition.

When I was a kid, they were all about very <b>real</b> people in <b>tough</b> circumstances, now the action movie is half science fiction movie. This movie is very much a throwback in that sense—with the permanently strained relations between blacks and whites and browns and orientals in our ghettos, our inner cities... But... just because the films intentions are not political, doesn’t mean it’s not political. Movies take on their own life.

While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years we have {{experienced}} great advances in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), much thanks to deep learning. By introducing deep neural networks in RL it is possible to have agents learn complex behaviors by just observing a game screen, just like humans learn to play games. Even though this is great, there is one limitation that makes the transition to <b>real</b> world problems <b>tough,</b> and that is data efficiency. One way to go about improving the data efficiency of RL is to approximate a model of the environment, called model-based RL. Even though model-based agents can be more data efficient, they are usually computationally heavy and often end up being too inaccurate. In this thesis, we explore the use of deep dynamics models (DDM) trained dynamically in environments with high-dimensional state representations. Furthermore, we study four different ways of calculating curiosity-based intrinsic motivation extracted from the DDM to achieve more efficient exploration. Having the DDM made up of an autoencoder (AE) and a transition prediction model that operate in the latent space generated by the AE, we introduce the first intrinsic bonus as the AE reconstruction error. The second one is based on the prediction error from the DDM. The third bonus introduce a novel idea of using MC dropout, presented in (Gal & Ghahramani 2015), to extract the uncertainty of the DDM. The last type of intrinsic bonus extract the uncertainty by MC dropout from a bootstrapped DDM. Interestingly, the proposed bonus based on MC dropout outperforms the more commonly used bonus based on dynamics prediction errors in both data efficiency and final performance in the Atari 2600 domain. Additionally, we manage to have agents learn by only receiving intrinsic reward and no any extrinsic rewards from the environment...|$|R
