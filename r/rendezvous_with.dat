5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|Lothringen {{was present}} during the fleet cruise to Norway in July 1914, which {{was cut short}} by the {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and subsequent rise in international tensions. On 25 July the ship's crew was made aware of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia; Lothringen left Norway to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} fleet the following day.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, the {{evacuees}} {{were flown}} to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand on HMH-462 helicopters and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha proceeded to the South China Sea to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> Task Force 76 as it stood by to implement Operation Frequent Wind, {{the evacuation of}} Saigon.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1945, Saratoga {{departed}} Pearl Harbor for Ulithi Atoll to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> the Enterprise {{and form}} a night fighter task group (TG 58.5/Night Carrier Division 7) along with Enterprise, to provide air cover for the amphibious landings on Iwo Jima. She arrived on 8 February with the 53 Hellcats and 17 Avengers of Carrier Air Group (Night) 53 aboard and sailed two days later.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} obtain {{information}} for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the PT boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{commissioning}} {{into the}} fleet, Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron. In 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Karl von Müller became the ship's commander. At the outbreak of war, Emden was the only major German warship in Tsingtao, the main German naval base in Asia. Müller immediately began to operate as a commerce raider, and captured one ship, the Russian steamer Ryazan. Emden was thereafter ordered to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> the rest of Spee's cruisers. She remained with the East Asia Squadron for only a few days, as Müller convinced Spee to detach Emden as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, this would be the main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina to refocus its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to Sardinia to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> their American contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for target practice. Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
50|$|Twiggs next <b>rendezvoused</b> <b>with</b> Haraden (DD-585) and Halligan (DD-584) for escort duty {{among the}} Palau Islands. Stationed east of Mindanao, she {{protected}} convoys on the approaches to Leyte.|$|R

When he returns home, Lane falls into a melancholic depression and loses hope for the future.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 1942, Armidale {{set out for}} an {{operation}} to Betano, Timor, along with HMAS Castlemaine. The two ships were attacked by Japanese aircraft along the way, and were subsequently late in arriving at their destination, missing a planned <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> HMAS Kuru. While returning to Darwin, the pair encountered Kuru south of Betano and it was decided by Castlemaines commanding officer—as the senior officer—that Armidale and Kuru should make for Betano. The two ships took different routes to Betano, during which both vessels came under aerial assault.|$|E
5|$|On stardate 6334.1, the Federation {{starship}} Enterprise {{is on its}} way to planet Deneb 5 {{when the}} Vulcan First Officer, Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), contracts the disease choriocytosis and is diagnosed by Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy (voiced by DeForest Kelley) with having only days to live.

Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch (Matt Damon), rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause.|$|E
5|$|The French Atlantic fleet {{was even}} more {{dispersed}} than the British {{in the spring of}} 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to <b>rendezvous</b> <b>with</b> the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet the threat posed by the British fleet under Lord Howe.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} the player's group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend Targos. They {{report to the}} town {{palisade}} and fend off an assault by the goblin army.

50|$|At 10:30, two {{helicopters}} from America <b>rendezvoused</b> <b>with</b> Liberty {{and began}} transferring the more seriously wounded to the carrier. An hour later, about 350 mi east of Souda Bay Crete, America <b>rendezvoused</b> <b>with</b> Liberty. The carrier's crew lined every topside vantage point, silent, watching the helicopters bring 50 wounded and nine dead from Liberty to America. As Liberty drew alongside, listing, her sides perforated with rockets and cannon shell, nearly 2,000 of the carrier's crew {{were on the}} flight deck and, spontaneously moved by the sight, gave the battered Liberty and her brave crew a tremendous cheer.|$|R

Though Georgette {{caught up with the}} whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E
5|$|U-40 {{was ordered}} for {{construction}} on 29 July 1936 and her keel was laid down on 1 July 1937.
