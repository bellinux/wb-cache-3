5000|$|The Oregon spotted frog’s <b>reproduction</b> <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> aquatic {{and their}} late winter {{breeding}} season is brief, {{less than four}} weeks in duration. Males call quietly during {{the day or night}} from the vicinity of traditional oviposition sites, places where females lay their eggs in communal piles. Ovipostition at selected sites is initiated when water temperatures reach 8 °C, but the timing of oviposition varies from late February-early March at lowland sites to late May-late June at montane sites in Oregon.They breed in warm shallow water, often 2 - 12 in deep in areas where grasses, sedges, and rushes are usually present. Adult females reportedly breed every year and probably produce a single egg mass each year. Though egg masses are occasionally laid singly, communal oviposition sites usually comprise the majority of the annual reproductive output. These communal clusters of egg masses are often composed of between 10 and 75 individual egg masses and in British Columbia it has been recorded that each egg mass contained an average of 643 eggs. They lay their eggs in fully exposed, shallow waters that are readily warmed by the sun so that development to hatching is hastened by warm conditions. However this also increases the vulnerability of the eggs to desiccation and/or freezing.|$|E

Here, we report 4 yr of data on reproductive and life-history traits for wild female Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, northeastern Thailand. During 2 consecutive reproductive seasons, we investigated reproductive behavior and sexual swelling size in 16 females and collected 1832 fecal samples.

Hard-coat {{dormancy}} of seeds is broken through naturally occurring temperature fluctuations, and seedlings can emerge and establish throughout the year. In the study site, winter storms (called Nortes) are responsible for moving large quantities of sand that bury young seedlings. The objectives {{of the study were}} (i) to elucidate the timing of seedling emergence, (ii) to investigate the effect of date of emergence on seedling survival, and (iii) to evaluate different factors of mortality. Seedling survival was monitored under natural conditions, from January 1988 to April 1991. Survivorship curves were compared using the log-rank Peto and Peto test.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic plant {{pathogen}} that exhibits prominent light responses including {{the formation of}} the reproduction structures (photomorphogenesis), secondary metabolites/ pigments, and antioxidant enzymes. A complex regulatory network of photoreceptors, transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin modulates is supposed to initiate, transmit, and fine-tune the responses to different wavelengths of light on the transcriptional level that finally leads to the observable phenotypes. As {{the formation of the}} <b>reproduction</b> structures <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> regulated by light in this fungus - conidia are formed in the light, sclerotia in the dark - the output can be easily monitored. The GATA-type TFs BcLTF 1 and BcWCL 1 are important regulators as their deletions resulted in conidiation in light and dark («always conidia») (Schumacher et al. 2014; PLoS Genet 10 :e 1004040, Canessa et al. 2013; PLoS One 8 :e 84223). Study of gene expression in both deletion mutants by microarray analyses highlighted the role of the TFs in mediating the transcriptional responses of the majority of lightresponsive genes including a number of other transcriptional regulators. As the group of lightresponsive genes also contained genes that are induced by oxidative and osmotic stress in a BcSAK 1 -dependent manner (Heller et al. 2012; MPMI 25 : 802 - 816), their expression levels were studied in the delta-Bcsak 1 mutant. Indeed, light induction does not occur in the mutant background indicating that the MAP kinase cascade is another functional unit of the light regulatory network. More detailed expression analyses of chosen LTF-encoding genes showed that three major transcriptional profiles exist: genes that exhibit maximal expression after 15 min (early), 60 min (moderate) or 120 min (late) of light treatment. Expression levels of the majority of genes decrease after prolonged light exposure (photoadaptation); however, this is not observed for bcltf 1. Eight LTFs have been functionally characterized by deletion and overexpression analyses so far: While BcLTF 1 has various functions (growth in light, ROS homoeostasis, virulence, differentiation), other LTFs specifically regulate certain developmental stages such as the initiation of conidiophore development or conidiogenesis...|$|R

As {{the formation of the}} <b>reproduction</b> structures <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> regulated by light in this fungus - conidia are formed in the light, sclerotia in the dark - the output can be easily monitored. The GATA-type TFs BcWCL 1 (as part of the White Collar complex (WCC)) and BcLTF 1 are important regulators as their deletions result in light-independent conidiation (“always conidia”) due to the deregulation of BcLTF 2 (Schumacher et al. 2014; Canessa et al. 2013; Cohrs et al. 2016). Study of light-induced gene (LIG) expression in both deletion mutants highlighted the role of the TFs in activating EARLY and in repressing LATE LIG expression, including bcltf 2 encoding the master regulator of conidiation and further LTFs that may function downstream or in parallel with BcLTF 2 in regulating the conidiation process. As the group of LIGs also contained genes that are induced by various stresses in a BcSAK 1 -dependent manner, the phosphorylation status of the stress-activated MAPK BcSAK 1 was studied and shown to increase after exposure to light. Deletion of bcsak 1 impairs LIG expression suggesting that BcSAK 1 functions as a co-activator of the WCC in inducing EARLY genes, and as a component releasing the LATE promoters (e. g. bcltf 2) from repression by BcLTF 1 and the WCC resulting in the expression of the conidiation genes. This preliminary model is in agreement with the observations that the deletion of BcSAK 1 results in a “never conidia” phenotype (Segmüller et al. 2007), and that the exposure of the wild type to heat and osmotic stress bypasses the requirement of light for conidiation...|$|R
