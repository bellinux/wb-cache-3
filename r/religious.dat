5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} <b>religious</b> {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of <b>religious</b> symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, <b>religious</b> symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that <b>religious</b> symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that <b>religious</b> symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E
5|$|According to Chard, in the 48 {{years of}} his career, Johnson {{published}} around 2,700 imprints, averaging 56 per year. About half of these were pamphlets (e.g. sermons, <b>religious</b> tracts, political leaflets) and many were reprints; therefore he averaged around 20 to 30 new books per year. About 25% of his publications were of anonymous authors; these were usually political or <b>religious</b> works. He published more <b>religious</b> works than any other genre (1,067 titles). Johnson made roughly 750 copies for each print run, although many of his political and <b>religious</b> works would have been printed in editions of 250, as their topics were often ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{buildings}} {{located on}} campus support specific <b>religious</b> groups, including the Alibrandi Catholic Center and the Winnick Hillel Center for Jewish Life. Off campus, the Chabad House and Islamic Center of CNY also support student <b>religious</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>religious</b> {{information}} is not collected by the U.S. census, according to a 2000 survey by Dale E. Jones of the Association of Statisticians of American <b>Religious</b> Bodies, 50.2% {{of the population in}} Norman is affiliated with a <b>religious</b> institution. Of those 43.6% were Southern Baptist, 15.0% Catholic Church, 13.0% United Methodist, 3.3% Assembly of God, 2.8% Churches of Christ, 2.1% Latter-day Saint (Mormon), 2.1% Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, 1.9% Disciples of Christ, 1.7% Presbyterian Church, and 14.6% other Christian denominations or religions.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} program to {{suppress}} Polish culture, the German Nazis attempted to destroy Christianity in Poland, with a particular emphasis on the Roman Catholic Church. In some parts of occupied Poland, Poles were restricted, or even forbidden, from attending <b>religious</b> services. At the same time, church property was confiscated, prohibitions were placed on using the Polish language in <b>religious</b> services, organizations affiliated with the Catholic Church were abolished, and it was forbidden to perform certain <b>religious</b> songs—or to read passages of the Bible—in public. The worst conditions {{were found in the}} Reichsgau Wartheland, which the Nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti-religious policies. Polish clergy and <b>religious</b> leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for extermination.|$|E

5|$|Because of its Ottoman past, Skopje {{has more}} mosques than churches. <b>Religious</b> {{communities}} often {{complain about the}} lack of infrastructure and new places of worship are often built. Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian <b>religious</b> organisations, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic <b>Religious</b> Union of Macedonia. It has an Orthodox cathedral and seminary, several madrasahs, a Roman Catholic cathedral and a synagogue.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its <b>religious</b> school. Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's <b>religious</b> practices. One was to have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the <b>religious</b> school.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's <b>religious</b> policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a <b>religious</b> bigot. They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not <b>religious</b> reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E
5|$|Costly <b>religious</b> rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake {{handling}} look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout <b>religious</b> beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the <b>religious</b> group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these <b>religious</b> rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, <b>religious,</b> and special. The civil courts deal with civil and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of <b>religious</b> and personal freedom. <b>Religious</b> law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in <b>religious</b> courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was made}} the Minister of <b>Religious</b> Affairs in the Wilopo Cabinet and sworn in on 3 April 1952, {{which led to}} him and his family moving to the capital at Jakarta. He began to work on {{reforming}} the ministry, including formalising its mission statement: to provide <b>religious</b> teachers, promote interfaith relations, and to establish the dates of <b>religious</b> holidays. He worked on internal structure, including formalising the ministry's leadership hierarchy and the opening of the provincial and regional branches. The ministry also continued its promotion of <b>religious</b> education and was tasked with handling the numerous Indonesian pilgrims who went on the hajj. The Wilopo Cabinet collapsed on 30 July 1953, following an immigration and land dispute in Medan. Fakih was replaced by Masjkur.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{founding}} the congregation grew very slowly; by 1908 {{there were still}} only 37 members, and 16 children in the <b>religious</b> school. By 1918, membership had fallen to 24, {{and children in the}} <b>religious</b> school to 10. That year the synagogue's total income was $800 (today $).|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{grew up in}} a Hindu and Jain <b>religious</b> {{atmosphere}} in his native Gujarat which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. He, at age 57, declared himself to be Advaitist Hindu in his <b>religious</b> persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and <b>religious</b> pluralism.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights issues}} and failings {{in the rule}} of law in Saudi Arabia have {{attracted}} strong criticism. These include criminal law punishments that are considered as cruel, as well as the position of women, <b>religious</b> discrimination, the lack of <b>religious</b> freedom and the activities of the Saudi Mutaween.|$|E
5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for <b>religious</b> peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half of a <b>religious</b> settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger <b>religious</b> issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and <b>religious</b> sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic <b>religious</b> and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a <b>religious</b> context is a reference to God as the source of all <b>religious</b> law.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} trends across the broader Australian population, the {{proportion}} of ADF personnel who are not <b>religious</b> has increased considerably over recent years. The proportion of ADF personnel who reported that their religion was Christianity in service censuses and human relations databases decreased from around 66% in 2003 to just over 52% in 2015. Over this period, the proportion who stated {{that they do not}} have a <b>religious</b> affiliation increased from 31% to 47%. Only 1% of ADF members reported having a non-Christian <b>religious</b> affiliation in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Armstrong applied {{at a local}} Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop. When asked for his <b>religious</b> affiliation, he labeled himself as a deist. His mother later said that Armstrong's <b>religious</b> views caused her grief and {{distress}} in later life as she was more <b>religious.</b> , his official biography, also describes him as a deist.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} families, {{any food}} is first {{offered to the}} preferred deity as naivedya, before being consumed by family members and guests. Meals or snacks are not taken before this <b>religious</b> offering. In contemporary Deshasthas families, the naivedya is offered only on days of special <b>religious</b> significance.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by mediaeval <b>religious</b> block {{books and}} working in an Art Deco style, American {{illustrator}} James Reid (1907–1989) produced one wordless novel, The Life of Christ (1930); due to the book's <b>religious</b> content, the Soviet Union barred its importation under its policies on religion.|$|E
5|$|Largely as {{a result}} of {{lobbying}} by Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, the government eliminated the HEW regulation in 1983, but 39 states, Guam and the District of Columbia still had <b>religious</b> exemptions in their civil codes on child abuse and neglect as of February 2015. Forty-eight US states allowed <b>religious</b> exemptions for compulsory vaccination as of June 2015. In Australia the church was the only group with a <b>religious</b> exemption for vaccination as of April 2015; the government said that it planned to remove it.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan is religiously diverse. In 2000, {{the largest}} <b>religious</b> {{affiliation}} was the Catholic Church, whose adherents constituted 564,505 persons (more than 36% of the population) and maintained 110 congregations. Jews comprised {{the second largest}} <b>religious</b> group, with 314,500 persons (20.5%) in 102 congregations. They were followed by Protestants, with 139,732 adherents (9.1%) and Muslims, with 37,078 (2.4%). Other <b>religious</b> affiliations including Hinduism, as well as Atheism and irreligion, composed {{the majority of the}} remainder.|$|E
5|$|Official <b>religious</b> practices, which {{maintained}} maat for {{the benefit}} of all Egypt, were related to, but distinct from, the <b>religious</b> practices of ordinary people, who sought the gods' help for their personal problems.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow <b>religious</b> education, in {{cooperation}} with <b>religious</b> communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the <b>religious</b> education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the <b>religious</b> festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The <b>religious</b> festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different <b>religious</b> holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the <b>religious</b> communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E
5|$|<b>Religious</b> dissenters (Catholics as well {{as other}} Protestant {{denominations}} such as Anabaptists) were sentenced to death in this area during the Crown's changing course of <b>religious</b> orientation started by King Henry VIII. About fifty Protestants and <b>religious</b> reformers, known as the Marian martyrs, were executed at Smithfield during the reign of Mary I.|$|E
5|$|Since then, most criticisms and denials of {{evolution}} {{have come from}} <b>religious</b> groups, {{rather than from the}} scientific community. Although many <b>religious</b> groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through theistic evolution, other <b>religious</b> groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of creationism, the belief that the universe and life were created by supernatural forces. The U.S.-centered creation–evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E
