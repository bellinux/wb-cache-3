Due to the periodic grip of the buckets with the excavated soil, the torque on the <b>bucket</b> <b>wheel</b> coming from excavation resistance varies considerably. This torque that represents the external periodic excitation is determined and as a periodic function described by Fourier series. The torque has been calculated for variable main working parameters which are height of the cutting layer, <b>bucket</b> <b>wheel</b> speed and the specific digging resistance of the soil.
