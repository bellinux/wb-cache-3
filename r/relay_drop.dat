40|$|In Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) {{disruptions}} {{may happen}} frequently as {{end to end}} path is not available all the time. Thus, delays can also be extended due to its environment nature like deep space, underwater, ocean sensor networks. In manage to achieve message delivery probability in such demanding networking situations, researchers have proposed the design of store-carry-and-forward routing protocols, here a node might accumulate a message in its buffer and carry it next to for unlimited time, awaiting till a suitable forwarding opportunity acquire. Moreover, multiple message duplication into the network to increase delivery probability. This arrangement of long-standing storage and replication force a high storage overhead on network. Therefore, efficient buffer drop policies are required to resolve on buffer, which decides messages must be dropped, while node buffers are overflow. In this paper, we propose effective buffer management drop policy E-DROP for delay tolerant networks. We illustrate that conventional buffer management policy like MOFO be unsuccessful to consider all relevant information in this framework. E-DROP policy can be adjust to minimize the metrics of <b>relayed,</b> <b>dropped,</b> average latency,overhead ratio,hop count and to maximize the average delivery probability and buffer time.

In the past, the deployment is often accomplished by large special vessel, which {{needs a lot of}} manpower and material resources. Here we introduce a novel deploying method for moored data buoy based on small vessel. This method employs a small vessel with two pulleys(one is served as movable pulley, the other is stable pulley.) and a winch. By way of the <b>relay,</b> it <b>drops</b> all the mooring chain into the water step by step. At last, the anchor is made into ocean water.

50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay. In this type, the sensor circuit (called the loop in industrial terminology) holds the relay energized. Since the path for the loop goes {{through a set of}} contacts which are normally open (when the relay is restored they are open, when the relay is energized they are closed), when the loop opens, even momentarily, the <b>relay</b> will <b>drop</b> out and stay that way. A second set of contacts on the relay, normally closed (when the relay is restored they are closed, when the relay is energized they are open) is used to operate the annunciator, usually a bell. The system is disarmed by a key-operated shunt which forces the relay to energize, and is armed by closing all traps and then by opening the shunt. While burglar alarm controls are now very elaborate, the single-relay control incorporates all the functionality of any control. These controls and a closely related dual-relay design are still widely used in stand-alone applications, powered by lead-acid batteries.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{intelligent}} multi-hop communications architecture for quality video delivery over networks. The {{key to this}} architecture is the insertion of relays with different levels of intelligence along the end-to-end path that coordinate {{with each other and}} the end-systems. The main objective is to achieve a synergy among these strategically deployed relays and endsystems to optimize the end-to-end performance. Toward that end, we study traffic management and content adaptation within this architecture. Compared with the end-to-end model, the multi-hop model can achieve higher throughput without increasing the risk of overloading the network and the end-to-end delay. Preliminary experimental results show a throughput gain of 19. 3 % on a concatenation of two best-effort networks, and 37. 8 % for a concatenation of a best-effort network and a guaranteed service network. The content adaptation translates this throughput gain into 0. 9 dB gain in PSNR on average. With the error withdrawal feature at the <b>relay,</b> abrupt quality <b>drops</b> are avoided. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the event}} of a disaster, there is a severe damage/destruction to {{physical}} infrastructures such as telecommunication and power lines which result in the disruption of communication in this areas. For such scenarios, Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) provides an alternative means of communication.

However DTNs are susceptible to security threats such as DoS attacks targeted at disrupting <b>relayed</b> packets or <b>dropping</b> critical packets during a disaster rescue operation.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{instrumentation}} and observational results of eight Automatic Weather Station (AWS) units in East Queen Maud Land, Antarctica 1995. The AWS units were installed at six {{sites on the}} ice sheet from coast to inland : the site nearest to the coast (H 21) was located at 60 km at 1076 m altitude and a site farthest from the coast (Dome Fuji Station) was located about 920 km inland at 3810 m altitude. Two types of AWS units (CMOS and ARGOS) were employed. Air temperatures at H 21 and Dome Fuji Station change from + 2. 3 to - 44. 4 ℃ and - 23. 3 to - 80. 1 ℃, respectively. Monthly mean July temperatures in eight AWS data are systematically higher than June and August temperatures, respectively. During the period of temperature increase in July, atmospheric pressure also increased. Wind speed during the whole period could only be obtained at MD 180 at which glazed surface was observed. Prevailing wind (south-east : SE) at Relay Point covers 40 % of the total wind direction, and wind from the east north-east slightly prevails (11 %) at Dome Fuji Station. Atmospheric pressure at <b>Relay</b> Point <b>drops</b> in May and September, and increases in July and December. Monthly mean lapse rates on snow surface were calculated using AWS data.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{cooperative}} border surveillance solution, composed of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployed terrestrially to detect and track trespassers, and a set of lightweight unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) in the form of quadcopters that interact with the deployed WSN to improve the border surveillance, the detection and investigation of network failures, the maintenance of the sensor network, the tracking of trespasser, the capture and transmission of realtime video of the intrusion scene, and the response to hostage situations. A heuristic-based scheduling algorithm is described to optimize the tracking mission by increasing the rate of detected trespassers spotted by the quadcopters. Together with the design of the electrical, mechanical and software architecture of the proposed VTail quadcopter, we develop in this paper powerless techniques to accurately localize terrestrial sensors using RFID technology, compute the optimal positions of the new sensors to <b>drop,</b> <b>relay</b> data between isolated islands of nodes, and wake up sensors to track intruders.

40|$|Peer-to-peer overlay {{networks}} are attractive solutions for building Internet-scale publish/subscribe systems. However, scalability {{comes with a}} cost: a message published on a certain topic often needs to traverse {{a large number of}} uninterested (unsubscribed) nodes before reaching all its subscribers. This might sharply increase resource consumption for such relay nodes (in terms of bandwidth transmission cost, CPU, etc) and could ultimately lead to rapid deterioration of the system’s performance once the <b>relay</b> nodes start <b>dropping</b> the messages or choose to permanently abandon the system. In this paper, we introduce Vitis, a gossip-based publish/subscribe system that significantly decreases the number of relay messages, and scales to an unbounded number of nodes and topics. This is achieved by the novel approach of enabling rendezvous routing on unstructured overlays. We construct a hybrid system by injecting structure into an otherwise unstructured network. The resulting structure resembles a navigable small-world network, which spans along clusters of nodes that have similar subscriptions. The properties of such an overlay make it an ideal platform for efficient data dissemination in large-scale systems. We perform extensive simulations and evaluate Vitis by comparing its performance against two base-line publish/subscribe systems: one that is oblivious to node subscriptions, and another that exploits the subscription similarities. Our measurements show that Vitis significantly outperforms the base-line solutions on various subscription and churn scenarios, from both synthetic models and real-world traces. Viti...|$|R
500|$|By coincidence, Olympic team {{training}} {{took place}} in Tarwater's hometown of Knoxville. At the Olympics, Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men's 4×200-meter relay. His time of 1:46.33 was a personal best, and the second-fastest leg for Team USA, which turned in the fastest preliminary swim, and third-fastest among all 64 swimmers. He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games. Of his Olympic experience, Tarwater said, [...] "Even at 28, {{with a lot of}} international experience, nothing matches the Olympics. [...] My heart was pumping so intensely that I was just trying to calm myself down. [...] Standing on the blocks, waiting to take the exchange, I was just saying, 'Breathe. [...] Breathe. [...] Breathe.'... It's such a rush." [...] Typically, the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries. In 2012, however, the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve, as Phelps would swim the <b>relay</b> final despite <b>dropping</b> the individual 200-meter freestyle from his program. [...] After Tarwater's fast preliminary swim, the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals, before electing to go with Berens due to Berens' greater experience. In the finals, the U.S. relay team beat the second-place French team by three seconds, winning Tarwater a gold medal.|$|R
40|$|In {{public safety}} and {{homeland}} security, reliable communication among the command center (CC), first responders (FRs) and surveillance sensors is critical to real-time monitoring and control applications. Com- manders want to check measurements from all surveillance sensors {{in the field and}} respond to critical incidents in real-time. In addition, commanders desire to monitor every FR???s location, health and device status to safeguard their lives. Frequently, they need to exchange dispatch commands and incident status with FRs in the field via voice. Occasionally, commanders inform FRs by transferring various data, such as building maps and fire hydrant locations, or pull back video feeds and text reports. We refer to the multi-functional mobile devices being monitored and controlled by CC as terminals. In order to support all these life-critical and mission-critical applications, a communication infrastructure offering reliable communication paths between CC and terminals is needed. However, such an infrastructure meeting various performance requirements from emergency response op- erations often does not exist. It is either impaired or nonfunctional due to incompatibility of radio frequency and communication protocols. Hence, we are interested in establishing a communication infrastructure on demand and cost-effectively, so that FRs can be continuously monitored, informed, managed and protected, while mobilized around a large incident area. In order to provision such a communication infrastructure, two means are taken simultaneously: (a) installing multiple base stations (BSs) to increase the coverage of the command center; (b) <b>dropping</b> <b>relays</b> to further extend the connectivity to BSs, especially when terminals are far away from BSs. In this thesis, we study various algorithms to determine the optimal locations of relays and the installation sequence so that the total number of relays is minimized, hence the infrastructure cost. We call such problems relay management problems. There are typically two categories for relay management problems: relay placement problems for static networks and relay deployment problems for mobile networks. Many papers have studied the relay placement and deployment problems. However, FR systems do exhibit special properties of disconnected evolving networks, which are either overlooked or treated primitively by the prior work. To the best of our knowledge, (a) none of the relay placement algorithms consider polymorphous networks with multiple topologies, due to terminal movement, unsynchronized wakeup schedule and packet forwarding policy; (b) all the prior work on <b>relay</b> deployment problems <b>drop</b> more <b>relays</b> than what is necessary, because they follow the ???breadcrumb??? approach, by which a FR will <b>drop</b> a <b>relay</b> whenever the connectivity to BSs is about to break. Despite having evolving network topologies, FR systems are not completely unpredictable. A large amount of operation planning and scheduling knowledge can be exploited in relay management. For poly- morphous networks, we have rudimentary knowledge about potential network configurations, e. g., where terminals will be placed or moved occasionally. For mobile networks, we know the coarse-level mobility patterns of FRs, e. g., the set of locations FRs will visit, from FRs dispatch and task assignment. In this thesis, we broadly exploit the predictability to deal with evolving topologies for FR systems, while meeting unique performance requirements, such as cost-effectiveness, reliability, load balance, etc. Weigh-and-place algorithm (WPA) is proposed to optimize relay placement across topologies with balanced load, reliably if required. Energy-aware relay placement is studied so that the communication infrastructure lasts for a desired network lifetime under different transmission control schemes. M-Breadcrumb, a mission-aware constrained relay deployment algorithm, is invented to minimize the total number of relays and navigate FRs to relay deploying locations with reduced traversal distance...|$|R
40|$|As {{the amount}} of data in todays Internet is growing larger, users are exposed to too much information, which becomes {{increasingly}} more difficult to comprehend. Publish/subscribe systems leverage this problem by providing loosely-coupled communications between producers and consumers of data in a network. Data consumers, i. e., subscribers, are provided with a subscription mechanism, to express their interests in a subset of data, {{in order to be}} notified only when some data that matches their subscription is generated by the producers, i. e., publishers. Most publish/subscribe systems today, are based on the client/server architectural model. However, to provide the publish/subscribe service in large scale, companies either have to invest huge amount of money for over-provisioning the resources, or are prone to frequent service failures. Peer-to-peer overlay networks are attractive alternative solutions for building Internet-scale publish/subscribe systems. However, scalability comes with a cost: a published message often needs to traverse a large number of uninterested (unsubscribed) nodes before reaching all its subscribers. We refer to this undesirable traffic, as relay overhead. Without careful considerations, the relay overhead might sharply increase resource consumption for the relay nodes (in terms of bandwidth transmission cost, CPU, etc) and could ultimately lead to rapid deterioration of the system’s performance once the <b>relay</b> nodes start <b>dropping</b> the messages or choose to permanently abandon the system. To mitigate this problem, some solutions use unbounded number of connections per node, while some other limit the expressiveness of the subscription scheme. In this thesis work, we introduce two systems called Vitis and Vinifera, for topic-based and content-based publish/subscribe models, respectively. Both these systems are gossip-based and significantly decrease the relay overhead. We utilize novel techniques to cluster together nodes that exhibit similar subscriptions. In the topic-based model, distinct clusters for each topic are constructed, while clusters in the content-based model are fuzzy and do not have explicit boundaries. We augment these clustered overlays by links that facilitate routing in the network. We construct a hybrid system by injecting structure into an otherwise unstructured network. The resulting structures resemble navigable small-world networks, which spans along clusters of nodes that have similar subscriptions. The properties of such overlays make them an ideal platform for efficient data dissemination in large-scale systems. The systems requires only a bounded node degree and as we show, through simulations, they scale well with the number of nodes and subscriptions and remain efficient under highly complex subscription patterns, high publication rates, and even in the presence of failures in the network. We also compare both systems against some state-of-the-art publish/subscribe systems. Our measurements show that both Vitis and Vinifera significantly outperform their counterparts on various subscription and churn scenarios, under both synthetic workloads and real-world traces.
