Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15â€“49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of <b>reported</b> <b>cases</b> artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called denatonium benzoate, known by the trade name Bitrex, is added to {{ethylene}} glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion. The bittering agent is thought to stop ingestion {{as part of the}} human defense against ingestion of harmful substances is rejection of bitter tasting substances. In the United States, eight states (Oregon, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Arizona, Maine, Tennessee, Washington) have made the addition of bittering agents to antifreeze compulsory. Three follow up studies targeting limited populations or suicidal persons to assess the efficacy of bittering agents in preventing toxicity or death have, however, shown limited benefit of bittering ethylene glycol preparations in these two populations. Specifically, Mullins finds that bittering of antifreeze does not reduce <b>reported</b> <b>cases</b> of poisoning of preschoolers in the US state of Oregon. Similarly, White found that adding bittering agents did not decrease the frequency or severity of antifreeze poisonings in {{children under the age of}} 5. Additionally, another study by White found that suicidal persons are not deterred by the bittered taste of antifreeze in their attempts to kill themselves. These studies did not focus on poisoning of domestic pets or livestock, for example, or inadvertent exposure to bittered antifreeze among a large population (of non-preschool age children).|$|E

5|$|Lions tend to {{dominate}} smaller felids such as African cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah {{in particular has}} a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, accounting for up to 78.2% of predator-killed juveniles in one study. Cheetahs avoid their competitors using different temporal (time) and spatial (habitat) niches. Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills. Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs, not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, {{there are a few}} <b>reported</b> <b>cases</b> of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs. African lions may also conflict with Nile crocodiles. Depending {{on the size of the}} crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were <b>reported</b> <b>cases</b> of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descentâ€”the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteedâ€”the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of <b>reported</b> <b>cases</b> of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E
