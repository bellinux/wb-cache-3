Cultivars are available with some level of resistance <b>to</b> <b>races</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 14, {{but in some cases}} the resistance level is moderate.

5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and {{he did not want to}} risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state <b>races</b> <b>to</b> avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E
5|$|By the , {{the ninth}} {{race of the}} season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the {{following}} three <b>races</b> <b>to</b> reduce his disadvantage to 11. After his victories in Italy (in which Alonso had an engine failure) and China, in which Alonso had tyre problems, Schumacher led in the championship standings {{for the first time}} during the season. Although he and Alonso had the same point total, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} weekend, Mercedes had already secured the Constructors' Championship, having done {{so at the}} {{previous}} race in Russia. Ferrari was in second place on 359 points, 139 points ahead of Williams. In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton led with 302 points, 66 ahead of Sebastian Vettel and 73 ahead of his teammate, Nico Rosberg. This meant that Hamilton {{would be able to}} win the title with three <b>races</b> <b>to</b> spare, as long as he gathered nine points more than Vettel and two more than Rosberg at the Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton's victory {{made him}} the fifth {{different}} driver in seven <b>races</b> <b>to</b> win a Grand Prix in 2010. The result meant Webber's advantage over {{second place in the}} Drivers' Championship, now occupied by Button, was extended by five points. Hamilton's victory meant he moved into third place, while Alonso went from third to fourth. Vettel's retirement resulted in him dropping from second to fifth. McLaren's 1–2 finish resulted in them reducing Red Bull's lead in the Constructors' Championship to one point. Ferrari's poor result meant they moved from second to third, with 12 races left of the season.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the <b>Races,</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then <b>races</b> <b>to</b> the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process.

5|$|The American Derby {{was also}} reborn {{at the new}} track, and was run at Washington through 1957, when it was moved to Arlington Park, in {{northwest}} suburban Arlington Heights.

For example, in 1943, Arlington Park shifted its major <b>races</b> <b>to</b> Washington Park {{as a result of}} curtailed racing due to World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate <b>races</b> <b>to</b> women.|$|E

5|$|The new {{grandstand}} {{was completed}} for $3.6 million in 1993. Since Rosecroft had expanded its simulcasting rights, the new grandstand incorporated large-screen televisions and betting windows. For the 1993 season, Rosecroft's officials {{decided to stop}} hosting the five stake races—The Potomac, the Lady Baltimore, The Terrapan, The Turtle Dove, and The North American—inherited when Freestate Raceway closed. The handle was decreasing, and the officials could not afford the purses for the <b>races.</b> <b>To</b> help increase the handle, Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.|$|E
