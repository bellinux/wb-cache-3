Melt Progression (MP) experiments were designed to provide information to develop and verify computer models for analysis of LWR core damage in severe accidents. Experiments examine the formation and motion of ceramic molten pools in disrupted reactor core regions. The MP- 2 experiment assembly consisted of: (1) a <b>rubble</b> <b>bed</b> of enriched UO{sub 2 } and ZrO{sub 2 } simulating severely disrupted reactor core regions, (2) a ceramic/metallic crust representing blockage formed by early phase melting, relocation, and refreezing of core components, and (3) an intact rod stub region that remained in place below the blockage region. The test assembly was fission heated in the central cavity of the ACRR at an average rate of about 0. 2 KA, reaching a peak molten pool temperature around 3400 K. Melting of the debris bed ceramic components was initiated {{near the center of}} the bed. The molten material relocated downward, refreezing to form a ceramic crust near the bottom of the <b>rubble</b> <b>bed.</b> As power levels were increased, the crust gradually remelted and reformed at progressively lower positions in the bed until late in the experiment when it penetrated into and attacked the ceramic/metallic blockage. The metallic components of the blockage region melted and relocated to the bottom of the intact rod stub region before the ceramic melt penetrated the blockage region from above. The ceramic pool penetrated halfway into the blockage region by the end of the experiment. Measurements of thermal response and material relocation are compared to the results of the computer simulations. Postexperiment examination of the assembly with the associated material interactions and metallurgy are also discussed in detail with the analyses and interpretation of results. 16 refs., 206 figs., 24 tabs...|$|E

However, if the annulus becomes filled with rock and rubble, there can exist pathways for diffusive release of radionuclides through pore liquid, even if the repository remains unsaturated. The effective diffusion coefficient for radionuclide release through pore liquid in a <b>rubble</b> <b>bed</b> depends on the porosity and moisture content of rubble material and on the geometry and contact area of individual pieces of rubble.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of laser based (LIDAR, LADS) and multibeam sonar bathymetry, acoustic and optical remote-sensing, together with in situ observations, the Southeast Florida (Broward County, USA) subtidal was investigated to over 200 m depth. Five well developed and sequentially deeper coast parallel ridges were mapped. An inshore ridge at approximately 5 m depth may be a lithified shoreface or tidal bar. The next two at average depth of 10 m and 20 m respectively have their genesis as Holocene reef lines with Acropora palmata frameworks which terminated at roughly 5 ky and 7 ky uncorrected for radiocarbon age. Two deeper ridges were mapped for the first time, one at 45 m depth the other at 85 m depth. These may be drowned reefs formed during the Holocene transgression. The upper three reefs are separated by sandy area and, in some regions, wide <b>rubble</b> <b>beds.</b> Both laser and multibeam bathymetry were used to delineate the hardground and sandy areas. Single beam acoustic seafloor classification using QTCView 5 based on a 50 kHz signal was used to differentiate further between sand, solid rock, and rubble areas. Ground-truthing of remote-sensed interfaces of sand/rubble/rock (2 ̆ 2 reef edges 2 ̆ 2) employed divers on scooters that towed a WAAS DGPS in a surface buoy allowing the divers to mark waypoints. Results indicated that: (1) aerial imagery was not suitable for bottom classification due to depth, shading effects, and turbidity; (2) {{a combination}} of laser bathymetry and acoustic bottom classification differentiated sand from reef from rubble; (3) continuous, Holocene barrier reef systems exists along {{the entire length of}} Broward County; (4) <b>rubble</b> <b>beds</b> are discontinous and likely represent a leeward halo of reef-derived debris formed while the reef grew at or near sea-level; (5) inshore hardgrounds are often repeatedly buried and uncovered by sand; (6) the sand/high-relief-reef interfaces are relatively stable; (7) two deeper unknown hardground ridges, likely drowned Holocene reefs, were mapped for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Benthic assemblages of {{variable}} density cover three ridges that parallel the Broward County, Florida coast at about 5 - 10 m, 10 - 20 m, and 20 - 30 m depth. Two of these ridges are drowned early Holocene reefs of 5 ky and 7 ky uncorrected radiocarbon age respectively. In response {{to changes in}} environmental factors (hydrodynamic exposure, ambient light, etc.) the characteristics of benthic assemblages change. An acoustic bottom classification survey using QTCView 5 based on a 50 kHz transducer showed different acoustic classes on the shallow, nearshore hardground and the two deeper reeflines, which showed the same acoustic signature. <b>Rubble</b> <b>beds</b> inshore of the the third, deepest reef-line showed a mixed acoustic signature. Ground-truthing by divers utilizing traditional transect surveys showed that the differences in acoustic signature corresponded to different benthic assemblages: nearshore hardgrounds had low live cover (10 %) and were dominated by algae and hydrozoa, the two deeper reef lines had the same acoustic signature and similar benthic assemblages (25 - 50 % cover by tall sponges and gorgonians). Subtle differences in species composition existed, however since growth-form characteristics and thus acoustic surface roughness characteristics, were the same in both areas, no acoustic split was achieved. The QTCView 5 was also able to differentiate between stable sands covered by a thin red algae turf and more mobile sand without turf cover. It is therefore concluded that acoustic remote-sensing methods {{can be used to}} differentiate different benthic assemblages, as long as enough differences exist in the growth-form characteristics of the dominant species to provide for a unique acoustic roughness...|$|R
40|$|The Jackfork (~roup in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas is an Upper Mississippian flysch {{succession}} that displays readily distinguishable lithofacies. The frontal Ouachitas {{contain a}} preponderance of disturbed beds which are interbedded with turbidite sandstones. These disturbed and disrupted beds developed {{at the foot of}} a northern unstable slope, the resultant bedding dependent upon the type of material involved, its state of consolidation, and the distance moved. Information gathered concerning the progressive changes from one type of sedimentary structure to another gives a qualitative measure of downslope distance. Muds which undergo submarine deformation upon a sloping sea floor first become flowage shales which change to blocky mudstones with continued failure. Failure of plastic muds and cohesive sandstone progressively form con-torted, chaotic, and. <b>rubble</b> <b>bedding.</b> Deformation of muds and sands form slurried bedding and breecias. Movement of flowing, creeping, or sliding clean sand may have occurred but is not considered to be a type of disruptive bedding.

The Ouaehita trough possibly consisted of an offsetting series of unstable shale slopes deepening southward to a gentle, west-dipping abyssal plain. The muds and channel sands upon the slope frequently slumped south-wards, sometimes flowing out over the abyssal floor at right angles to basinal turbidites flowing westward down the trough axis.

It is situated almost in {{the centre of the}} island and was originally provided with cottages for the keepers. The first light was a revolving white one which flashed every ten seconds, with a fixed red light below the main light, which could be seen over a 45-degree arc of danger from the reef. The main light's rotation was powered by a clockwork motor, driven by a large weight that descended down a cavity in the wall of the tower. The lights had a range of seventeen and fifteen miles respectively. A fog bell was also provided. The fixed red light was later replaced by a red sector on the main light itself. Originally, the light was manned by two men at a time, working two months on and one month off, but in 1939 the lighthouse was automated, a new second-order fixed catadioptric lens was installed and the keepers were withdrawn. Their cottages were subsequently demolished. In 2012 Trinity House discontinued use of the light within the tower, replacing it with an LED light mounted on a steel platform nearby on the rocks. Godrevy is still listed by Trinity House as a lighthouse, and the tower is maintained by them as a daymark. The new light maintains the same pattern as its predecessor, flashing white/red every ten seconds, with the red sector only being visible in the arc of danger from the reef.

40|$|Along the {{northern}} coast of Morocco order {{has been given}} {{for the construction of}} a large transshipment port in the Mediterranean Sea, at a designated project location around the city of Nador. On this green-field coastal stretch a new transhipment port will have to be developed for various types of cargo. Throughputs of the terminals will have to be maximized, a plan for in-phased port development and expansion will have to be provided, cargo transport to the hinterland has to be taken into account and sufficient surface space should be included in the design for additional services. Relevant data regarding the project (location) has been identified and analyzed: hydrodynamic data (wind, waves, currents, water levels) and environmental site data (topography, bathymetry, geology, hydrology and morphology). Besides this, a forecast has been formulated with the expected design ships that will visit the new port. From this, cargo-vessel distributions and vessel-arrival distributions have been defined, resulting in the total amount of shipping traffic for every terminal. Subsequently, the design of the port master plan can commence in which first of all the approach channel, harbor basins and manoeuvring and berth areas have been designed. As a next step the characteristics of the various terminals have been determined, under which the number of berths, quay length and surface areas. After using all port elements listed above jointly, several port masterplan layouts have been drawn up. From these port masterplan layouts, the most promising alternative has been selected after comparison by means of a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) on various criteria under which nautical ease, safety, expansion possibilities and costs. Concluding to this, the selected port masterplan layout has been optimized. The resulting harbour layout has been assessed regarding the topic of in-port wave penetration and propagation. Limiting operational wave criteria have been defined and relevant wave processes have been evaluated with the wave simulation model DIFFRAC- 2 DH. In order to decrease wave reflection due to monolithic breakwaters (and thus the port’s downtime), new simulation runs were carried out with an improved breakwater configuration using low-reflectivity caissons. With these wave-dampening improvements included, the simulation model runs yielded very positive results. The wave study was concluded with an assessment on port oscillations as a result of earthquakes, tsunamis and meteorological forces. After the performed wave study, the port breakwaters have been designed. For this, two typical cross-sections were selected. After including construction constraints and wave damping measures, a rubble mound breakwater was designed with a specific armour layer, and a vertical composite breakwater as a perforated wall caisson on a <b>rubble</b> mound foundation <b>bed.</b> The application of wave energy absorbing measures is a necessity in order to minimize the port’s downtime, and will have to be included in a final design. The designed port masterplan layout meets all specifications and requirements and its breakwaters are adequate in creating calm in-port berthing conditions resulting in high uptimes of the berths.

40|$|As the {{industrialization}} of {{the world}} is growing, both energy consumption anddemand are steadily increasing. Hydrocarbons have been an important energyprovider for several decades, but the production from mature oil and gas producersis now declining. In order to meet this rise in energy demand, new hydrocarbondeposits must be found and produced. Because large oil and gas reservoirs areassociated with salt formations, this may be an important energy source for thefuture. Salt s low permeability and ability to deform under stress and temperature,makes it an ideal hydrocarbon-trap. The initial objective of this thesis was to establish which challenges are related todrilling for pre-salt hydrocarbons, and propose solutions for how to overcome thesechallenges. When drilling towards these oil and gas reservoirs, the first problemsmay occur already in the formations above the salt structures. The density of saltdoes not increase with burial depth. When its density becomes lower than of thesurrounding formations, salt will start to migrate and push through the overlyingrocks. Due to the combined effect of compaction disequilibrium and salt tectonics,complex stress patterns can be created in the formations surrounding the saltstructures. This may lead to many hazardous scenarios, created by <b>rubble</b> zonesand recumbent <b>beds.</b> When drilling inside salt formations, it is salt s ability tocreep and flow that may cause problems. Salt flow may cause borehole deformation that impedes with the drilling and casing operations. When a wellbore has beendrilled, salt can creep into the removed rock volume. This may cause situationssuch as stuck-pipe, hole instability, and high levels of shock and vibration whendrilling. Salt flow is a positive function of time, so minimizing the time factorwill decrease the possibility of salt flow related problems. One of the measures tominimize exposure time is to perform drilling operations quickly. Hence, a highrate of penetration (ROP) is beneficial when drilling in salt. As part of proposing solutions to the drilling challenges in salt, two new drillbittechnologies have been evaluated. These bits may be beneficial in order to overcomemany of the problems related to salt drilling. Based on the results obtainedin previous studies, these bits are capable of reducing the shock and vibrationlevels while drilling. This is because these bits are able to drill smoother thanconventional PDC bits. Further, the reduced shock and vibration levels will allowan increase in WOB and rotary speed. Based on previous studies, these arethe two of the most important parameters to ROP. Thus, these two new drillbittechnologies might be able to increase ROP when drilling in salt. Another goal for this thesis was to establish which parameters have the most effecton ROP when drilling in salt formations. Knowing this could help minimize thechallenges faced due to salt creep and flow. Therefore, a modelling attempt wasperformed using Bourgoyne and Young s ROP model. This model uses multiplelinear regressions to calculate a straight line that best fits the data used in themodel. In this attempt, data acquired from a well drilled in salt formation wasused. Due to lack of variation in the drilling data, several parameters had tobe discarded from the model in order to obtain physically meaningful results. This led to only three variables being used in the model. This was weight on bit(WOB), rotary speed of the drillstring, and jet impact force. It was found thatthe parameter that had most effect on ROP in salt was WOB, followed by rotaryspeed, and last, jet impact force...|$|R
