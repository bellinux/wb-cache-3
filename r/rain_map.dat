40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{to remove}} rain or snow streaks from a video sequence using temporal correlation and low-rank matrix completion is proposed in this paper. Based on {{the observation that}} rain streaks are too small and move too fast to affect the optical flow estimation between consecutive frames, we obtain an initial <b>rain</b> <b>map</b> by subtracting temporally warped frames from a current frame. Then, we decompose the initial <b>rain</b> <b>map</b> into basis vectors based on the sparse representation, and classify those basis vectors into rain streak ones and outliers with a support vector machine. We then refine the <b>rain</b> <b>map</b> by excluding the outliers. Finally, we remove the detected rain streaks by employing a low-rank matrix completion technique. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithm to stereo video deraining. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm detects and removes rain or snow streaks efficiently, outperforming conventional algorithms. close 0...|$|E

The analysis uses Laws-Parsons values for the a and b parameters of A(dB/Km) =a Rb (mm/hr), and considers the two cases of (i) limited rain-cell and (ii) "entire hop in rain". The result is a family of fade margin vs. hop length curves for various reliability objectives, obtained {{for each of the}} 14 -rain zones at a frequency of 50 GHz. A simple frequency scaling rule is also devised to enable similar analysis at frequencies in the range 30 - 70 GHz. It is particularly concluded that an extended hop length of 10 - 20 Km is possible with reasonable reliability if the reduced cell-size concept is applied. If the entire hop is in rain, a limited hop length of one to five kms can't be exceeded even with modest reliability.

40|$|The {{increasing}} frequency of extreme and very localized precipitation events have been causing landslides, floods and casualties, especially in Sicily, {{due to its}} complex orography, and {{to the presence of}} densely inhabited areas just at the mouth of small basins. In order to monitor such phenomena with the needed high resolution in time and space, an experimental network of X-band mini-radars, exclusively devoted to monitor rain, has been installed in some parts of Sicily since November 2010. The network is made up by 4 mini weather radars able to acquire a <b>rain</b> <b>map</b> every minute (or even at shorter intervals) with a radial space resolution better than 100 m within a range of up to 30 km.

40|$|The Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) ground {{validation}} radar {{has provided}} a multiyear three-dimensional radar dataset at an oceanic site. Extensive rain gauge networks are not feasible over the ocean and, hence, are not available to aid in calibrating the radar or determining a conversion from reflectivity to rain rate. This paper describes methods used to ensure the calibration and allow the com-putation of quantitative <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> from the radar data {{without the aid of}} rain gauges. Calibration adjustments are made by comparison with the TRMM satelliteborne precipitation radar. The additional steps required to convert the calibrated reflectivity to <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> are the following: correction for the vertical profile of reflectivity below the lowest elevation angle using climatological convective and stratiform reflectivity profiles; conversion of reflectivity (Z) to rain rate (R) with a relationship based on disdrometer data collected at Kwajalein, and a gap-filling estimate. The time series of <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> computed by these procedures include low, best, and high estimates to frame the estimated overall uncertainty in the radar rain estimation. The greatest uncertainty of the <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> lies in the calibration of the radar (630 %). The estimation of the low-altitude vertical profile of reflectivity is also a major uncertainty (615 %). The ZâR and data-gap uncertainties are relatively minor (65 % or less).

40|$|The Griffith-Woodley Technique (GWT) is an {{approach}} to estimating precipitation using infrared observations of clouds from geosynchronous satellites. It is examined in three ways: {{an analysis of the}} terms in the GWT equations; a case study of infrared imagery portraying convective development over Florida; and the comparison of a simplified equation set and resultant <b>rain</b> <b>map</b> to results using the GWT. The objective is to determine the dominant factors in the calculation of GWT rain estimates. Analysis of a single day's convection over Florida produced a number of significant insights into various terms in the GWT rainfall equations. Due to the definition of clouds by a threshold isotherm the majority of clouds on this day did not go through an idealized life cycle before losing their identity through merger, splitting, etc. As a result, 85 % of the clouds had a defined life of 0. 5 or 1 h. For these clouds the terms in the GWT which are dependent on cloud life history become essentially constant. The empirically derived ratio of radar echo area to cloud area is given a singular value (0. 02) for 43 % of the sample, while the rainrate term is 20. 7 mmh- 1 for 61 % of the sample. For 55 % of the sampled clouds the temperature weighting term is identically 1. 0. Cloud area itself is highly correlated (r= 0. 88) with GWT computed rain volume. An important, discriminating parameter in the GWT is the temperature defining the coldest 10 % cloud area. The analysis further shows that the two dominant parameters in rainfall estimation are the existence of cold cloud and the duration of cloud over a point...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) monthly Ground Validation (GV) <b>rain</b> <b>map,</b> 42 quality controlled {{tipping bucket rain gauge}} data (1 minute interpolated rain rates) were utilized. We have compared the gauge {{data to the}} surface volumetric rainfall accumulation of NEXRAD reflectivity field, (converting to rain rates using a 0. 5 dB resolution smooth Z-R table). The comparison was carried out from data collected at Melbourne, Florida during the month of July 98. GV operational level 3 (L 3 monthly) accumulation algorithm was used to obtain surface volumetric accumulations for the radar. The gauge records were accumulated using the 1 minute interpolated rain rates while the radar Volume Scan (VOS) intervals remain {{less than or equal to}} 75 minutes. The correlation coefficient for the radar and gauge totals for the monthly time-scale remain at 0. 93, however, a large difference was noted between the gauge and radar derived rain accumulation when the radar data interval is either 9 minute, or 10 minute. This difference in radar and gauge accumulation is being explained in terms of the radar scan strategy information. The discrepancy in terms of the Volume Coverage Pattern (VCP) of the NEXRAD is being reported where VCP mode is ascertained using the radar tilt angle information. Hourly radar and gauge accumulations have been computed using the present operational L 3 method supplemented with a threshold period of +/- 5 minutes (based on a sensitivity analysis). These radar and gauge accumulations are subsequently improved using a radar hourly scan weighting factor (taking ratio of the radar scan frequency within a time bin to the 7436 total radar scans for the month). This GV procedure is further being improved by introducing a spatial smoothing method to yield reasonable bulk radar to gauge ratio for the hourly and daily scales...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMeasurement of {{rainfall}} in urban area {{is an important}} issue in several domains such as urban hydrology, flash-flood early warning systems. The two main ways of measuring the rainfall rates are rain gauges networks and weather radars. The radars are limited by the reliefs, quite expensive and thus not available everywhere in the world. The traditional rain gauge networks are scarce or poorly maintained. This calls for alternative source {{of rainfall}} information. Various studies have recently shown that commercial microwave links from operational cellular communication networks may be used for rainfall monitoring. Despite their potential in rainfall observation the low availability of data or the inadequate frequencies used in some areas (< 8 GHz) does not allow their use in all regions. Previous studies have proved the possibility to rebuild rainfall in time and space at high resolution (a few hundred meters) in using a set of Satellite to Earth commercial microwave links. These links in Ku Band (10512 GHz) exist {{all over the world and}} allow estimating integrated rain attenuation along 55 7 km long links with a very high temporal resolution (10 seconds case). A single Ku receiver deployed during Hymex experiment have produced local rainfall fields at resolution 10 s and 0. 5 * 0. 5 km 2 with features similar to radar maps ones at time resolution inferior to 5 minutes and spatial resolution around 1 km 2. Given the density of TV receivers in urban area operating in Ku-band, our goal is to study the quality of the rainfall fields that could be retrieved using this kind of receiver network. As in the case of a single Ku receiver, the proposed method uses a variational assimilation method (4 DVAR) with a dynamic advection model for rain cells evolution. This method integrates the observations from Ku 5 receivers in a numerical model and minimizes a cost function evaluating the gap between the initial rain field propagated through time by the model and the available observations. This feasibility study of an opportunistic measurement system is made from simulations in using the following methodology: 1) A <b>rain</b> <b>map</b> simulator based on a rain support simulator associated with calibrated mutifractal simulations is used to generate numerous rain maps observations with actual statistical and spectral properties. 2) A set of rain attenuation times series corresponding to observations that could be made by a Ku-receivers network for corresponding rain maps are obtained. 3) A set of rain times series corresponding to observations that could be made by a realistic rain gauge network for corresponding rain maps are obtained. 4) A variational 4 DVAR assimilation setting using an advection model is used to rebuild the rain fields from the attenuation timeâs series. Finally, the rain fields obtained with the Ku-band receiver network and with the one obtained from the rain gauge network are compared with the initial rain maps in terms of variability, temporal and spatial resolution...|$|E

Power spectral density comparisons between GPROF and KR <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> at 0. 18 resolution show that GPROF-retrieved <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> are less spatially variable at wavelengths less than 50 km in the mean, suggesting that GPROF rainy areas are smoother and more spatially extensive than those observed by the KR.

This study introduced Klaassenâs melting-layer parameterization into the GPROF algorithm that reduced the GPROF-retrieved rainfall amount by 7. 5 %. Considering the poor correlation between upper-level ice amounts and surface rainfall, this study only estimated the convective area fraction from 85 -GHz brightness temperature and neglected 85 -GHz brightness temperature in the rainfall retrieval. This modification reduced GPROF-retrieved surface rainfall amount by 3. 5 % and made the GPROF-retrieved rainfall retrievals more consistent with the KR observations where the GPROF algorithm overestimated surface rainfall {{with respect to the}} KR because of strong ice scattering.

Rain fade is the mechanism that limits {{the performance of}} terrestrial microwave telecommunication systems. To predict the Quality of Service (QoS) at a node in heterogeneous networks of line-of-sight, terrestrial, microwave links; requires knowledge of the spatial and temporal statistics of rain over scales of a few meters to tens or hundreds of kilometres, and over temporal periods as short as one-second. Current internationally recognised models {{are not able to}} predict QoS, even for an individual link. This project aims to produce a radio network simulator that will predict the correct first and second order joint, rain fade statistics on heterogeneousnetworks of arbitrary geometry.

In addition to field campaign archival of raw and processed satellite data (including precipitation products), key ground-based platforms such as the NASA NPOL S-band and D 3 R Ka/Ku-band dual-polarimetric radars, University of Iowa X-band dual-polarimetric radars, a large network of paired rain gauge platforms, and a large network of 2 D Video and Parsivel disdrometers were deployed. In something of a canonical approach, the radar (NPOL in particular), gauge and disdrometer observational assets were deployed to create a consistent high-quality distributed (time and space sampling) radar-based ground "reference" rainfall dataset, with known uncertainties, {{that could be used for}} assessing the satellite-based precipitation products at a range of space/time scales. Subsequently, the impact of uncertainties in the satellite products could be evaluated relative to the ground-benchmark in coupled weather, land-surface and distributed hydrologic modeling frameworks as related to flood prediction. Relative to establishing the ground-based "benchmark", numerous avenues were pursued in the making and verification of IFloodS "reference" dual-polarimetric radar-based <b>rain</b> <b>maps,</b> and this study documents the process and results as they pertain specifically to efforts using the NPOL radar dataset.

Calculation of a scale-adaptive KDP was accomplished using the method of Wang and Chandrasekar (2009; J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.). A dual-polarimetric blockage algorithm based on Lang et al. (2009; J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.) was then implemented to correct radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity at low elevation angles. Next, hydrometeor identification algorithms were run to identify liquid and ice hydrometeors. After the quality control and data preparation steps were completed several different dual-polarimetric rain estimation algorithms were employed to estimate rainfall rates using rainfall scans collected approximately every two to three minutes throughout the campaign. These algorithms included a polarimetrically-tuned Z-R algorithm that adjusts for drop oscillations (via Bringi et al., 2004, J. Atmos. Oceanic Tech.), and several different hybrid polarimetric variable approaches, including one that made use of parameters tuned to IFloodS 2 D Video Disdrometer measurements. Finally, a hybrid scan algorithm was designed to merge the rain rate estimates from multiple low level elevation angle scans (where blockages could not be appropriately corrected) in order to create individual low-level <b>rain</b> <b>maps.</b> Individual <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> at each time step were subsequently accumulated over multiple time scales for comparison to gauge network data. The comparison results and overall error character depended strongly on rain event type, polarimetric estimator applied, and range from the radar. We will present the outcome of these comparisons and their impact on constructing composited "reference" rainfall maps at select time and space scales...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{variability}} of rain rate {{in space and time}} and the difficulties with remote sensing methods of measuring rain rates, accurate determination of rainfall over large areas and time periods has long been a problem for hydrologists, meteorogists, and climatologists. A number of statistical models of rain have been developed in order to investigate the impact of rain variability on satellite remote sensing methods, validation of satellite rain products, and generation of <b>rain</b> <b>maps</b> with accompanying error estimates. These models may be useful in examining 'sub-grid scale' issues in representing precipitation in numerical mdoels. A stochastic model will first be described which can generate time-dependent high-resolution spatial rain fields with space and time correlations similar to those seen in rain data, as well as representing the presence of areas with zero rain rate and log-normally distributed rain rates where there is rain. A simpler model derived from this, formulated in the spectral domain, seems to imply fractal-like rain statistics at small scales when fit to rain data...|$|R
