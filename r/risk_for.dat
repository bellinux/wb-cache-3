Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{of weight}} and {{mortality}} sometimes {{state that the}} mortality relative <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> obesity from nonsmokers are valid estimates of the relative <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> obesity in both smokers and nonsmokers. Extending this idea, several influential articles have used relative <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> obesity from nonsmokers and attributable fraction methods <b>for</b> unadjusted <b>risks</b> to estimate attributable fractions of deaths in the entire population (smokers and nonsmokers combined). However, stratification by smoking {{is a form of}} adjustment for confounding. Simplified examples show that the use of relative risks from only 1 stratum to estimate attributable fractions, without incorporating data on the stratification variable, gives incorrect results for the entire population. Even if the mortality relative <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> obesity from nonsmokers are indeed valid in both smokers and nonsmokers, these relative risks nonetheless need to be treated as adjusted relative <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of calculating attributable fractions for the whole sample.

Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children.

5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.|$|E
