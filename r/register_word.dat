First, a statistical noise model to predict the Quantization error after the multiplication of two quantized signals, of different precision, is presented. This model is then applied to FFT algorithms. Simulation results, that corroborate the theoretical analysis, are then presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} referred to as watched subgraphs which improves the performance of BBMC, a leading {{state of the art}} exact maximum clique solver (MCP). It is based on watched literals employed by modern SAT solvers for boolean constraint propagation. In efficient SAT algorithms, a list of clauses is kept for each literal (it is said that the clauses watch the literal) so that only those in the list are checked for constraint propagation when a (watched) literal is assigned during search. BBMC encodes vertex sets as bit strings, a bit block representing a subset of vertices (and the corresponding induced subgraph) the size of the CPU <b>register</b> <b>word.</b> The paper proposes to watch two subgraphs of critical sets during MCP search to efficiently compute a number of basic operations. Reported results validate the approach as the size and density of problem instances rise, while achieving comparable performance in the general case...|$|E
40|$|All {{proficient}} language {{users have}} implicit knowledge about <b>register,</b> <b>word</b> meaning and grammatical and lexical patterns. If this {{were not the}} case {{we would not be}} able to speak and write with any fluency. We often find it hard to explicate all that we intuitively know about language, however, and in any case we cannot always rely upon what we think we know. “Human intuition about language is highly specific, and not at all a good guide to what actually happens when the same people actually use language”, as Sinclair (1991 : 4) points out. This is a strong argument for the use of corpora to inform language teaching generally. An additional case can be made for the use of corpora in ESP, in that ESP practitioners are not always conversant with the professions and disciplines of their students, and may not have much intuitive understanding of the way language is used in certain specified domains. A distinction is often made between ‘corpus based’ investigations, which are undertaken to check the researcher’s intuition about language use, and ‘corpus driven’ investigations, where the researcher approaches the corpus data with an open mind, to see what patterns emerge (Tognini-Bonelli 2001). The corpus based and corpus driven distinction can be equated with approaches used in data-driven learning (see, for example, Mishan 2004), where learners may be required to test a previously developed hypothesis, or to develop and explore their own research questions. In the classroom teachers may find it less risky to use corpus data as evidence to confirm what they already know, but in this case corpus investigations can still be corpus driven from the learners’ perspective if teachers allow learners to reach their own conclusions. Amongst researchers the corpus driven approach is favoured, as Gilquin and Gries (2009) found in their survey of 81 recent corpus linguistics studies. Exploratory corpus research may lead the ESP practitioner to new discoveries about the language used in the students’ target situations, and hence to changes in the content of syllabi and materials...|$|E

Many registers used in online shop can be found especially in English. In this case, this research analyzes the linguistics form and the meaning of register used in online shop. The type of this research is descriptive qualitative research. The object of this research is the register used in online shop. The data are <b>register</b> <b>words</b> and phrases included in printed material used in online shop. The data source is dialogue between the buyer and seller in online shop. In collecting the data, the writer looks for the dialogue in online shop, reads the dialogue repeatedly, gives a sign to the <b>register</b> <b>words,</b> and writes down the dialogue, <b>register</b> <b>words,</b> and phrases. In analyzing the data, the writer classifies the data, analyzes the linguistics form and meaning, analyzes the context of situation, identifies the differences between lexical and contextual meaning and draws conclusion. Based on the analysis, the researcher finds the data based on the linguistics form (7 data of verb, 3 data of noun, 1 datum of adjective, 8 data of compound word, 5 data of abbreviation, and 2 data of noun phrase).

Nevertheless, a general test for whether a word is a slang word or not is whether it would be acceptable in an academic or legal setting, as both are arenas in which standard language is considered necessary and/or whether the term has been entered in the Oxford English Dictionary, which some scholars claim changes its status as slang.|$|R
