Fen peat formed in an area colonised by reeds and rushes. Sphagnum mosses then colonised the area causing a change from fen to bog peat which became {{elevated}} forming a dome, the <b>raised</b> bog. Sphagnum <b>mosses</b> increase the acidity of the water resulting in highly specialised plant species, many of them found nowhere else.|$|R
50|$|Carlos Vierra {{was born}} and <b>raised</b> in <b>Moss</b> Landing, California near Monterey by his father, Portuguese sailor, Cato Vierra and his mother, Maria de Fratas. Vierra went to school in Monterey, California and {{had a hard time}} {{deciding}} between a life at sea and art. He studied art at the Mark Hopkins Institute (now the San Francisco Art Institute) under Gottardo Piazzoni in the 1890s, until he was twenty-five. Wanting to further his studies, Vierra took a six-month trip around Cape Horn to New York City. Once there, he worked hard to become an illustrator, a growing artistic field. In time, his art began to comfortably sustain him, though only for a short time. In 1904, at age twenty-eight, Vierra contracted tuberculosis and, at the advice of his doctor, relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Vierra decided to live in a remote, small cabin along the Pecos River. When his health was not improved, he was forced to get help from the Sanitarium.|$|R

We consider atoms as first class citizens. First of all, we give a sharpening, in the way of cardinality, of Aczel's Special Final Coalgebra Theorem, which allows for good estimates of the cardinality of the final coalgebra. To these end, we introduce the notion of k-Y -uniform functor, which subsumes Aczel's original notion. We give also an n-ary version of it, and we show that the resulting class of functors is closed under many interesting operations used in Final Semantics. We define also canonical wellfounded versions of the final coalgebras of functors uniform on maps. This leads to a reduction of coiteration to ordinal induction, giving a possible answer to a question <b>raised</b> by <b>Moss</b> and Danner. Finally, we introduce a generalization of the notion of F-bisimulation inspired by Aczel's notion of precongruence, and we show that it allows to extend the theory of categorical bisimulations also to functors non-weakly preserving pullbacks. Examples, non-examples, and open questions are frequent in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A lectin {{different}} from the previously described mannose-binding agglutinins has been isolated from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Biochemical characterization of the purified lectin combined with the data from earlier transcriptome analyses demonstrated that the novel M. polymorpha agglutinin {{is not related to}} any of the known plant lectin families, but closely resembles the Agaricus bisporus-type lectins, which hitherto have been found exclusively in fungi. Immunolocalization studies confirmed that lectin is exclusively associated with plant cells, ruling out the possibility of a fungal origin. Extensive screening of publicly accessible databases confirmed that, apart from fungi, the occurrence of A. bisporus-type lectins is confined to M. polymorpha and the moss Tortula ruralis. Expression of a typical fungal protein in a liverwort and a <b>moss</b> <b>raises</b> the question of the origin of the corresponding genes. Regardless of the evolutionary origin, the presence of a functional A. bisporus lectin ortholog in M. polymorpha provides evidence for the expression of an additional carbohydrate-binding domain in Viridiplantae...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of raised bogs {{is dependent on}} the climate, that is to say the amount of precipitation and rate of evaporation, which in turn are decisively determined by the temperature. In addition, the relief of the terrain has an influence on the water discharge behaviour and thus the shape of a raised bog. This results in geographical limitations to the {{formation of}} raised bogs. Favourable conditions for the development of raised bogs are found mainly in North America (Canada and Alaska), Northern Europe and Western Siberia, South America, Southeast Asia and in the Amazon Basin. In these regions, bogs of all kinds and peat deposits of four million square kilometres have been formed, covering three percent of the earth's surface. In the southern hemisphere low-mineral-rich bogs are rarely formed from peat mosses. Only in the Tierra del Fuego do peat <b>moss</b> <b>raised</b> bogs exist. The most peaty countries in the tropics are found in Southeast Asia. In many cases it is not yet clear how these bogs have emerged as mosses are entirely absent here.|$|R
60|$|Early in the morning, {{while all}} things are crisp with frost, men come with fishing-reels and slender lunch, and let down their fine lines through the snowy field to take {{pickerel}} and perch; wild men, who instinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than their townsmen, and by their goings and comings stitch towns together in parts where else they would be ripped. They sit and eat their luncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore, as wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial. They never consulted with books, and know and can tell much less than they have done. The things which they practice are said not yet to be known. Here is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into his pail with wonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked up at home, or knew where she had retreated. How, pray, did he get these in midwinter? Oh, he got worms out of rotten logs since the ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject for the naturalist. The latter <b>raises</b> the <b>moss</b> and bark gently with his knife in search of insects; the former lays open logs to their core with his axe, and moss and bark fly far and wide. He gets his living by barking trees. Such a man has some right to fish, and I love to see nature carried out in him. The perch swallows the grub-worm, the pickerel swallows the perch, and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel; and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled.|$|R

40|$|Mosses {{display a}} number of {{hallmark}} life history traits that influence their ecology at the population and community level. The long lived separation of sexes observed in the haploid gametophyte (dioicy) is one such feature of particular importance, as it is observed {{in the majority of}} bryophytes and creates intraspecific specialization of male and female individuals. The prevalence of sexually dimorphic <b>mosses</b> <b>raises</b> the possibility of sex-specific interactions with fungi as observed in some vascular plants. Here I investigated how moss sex shapes fungal communities associated with gametophytic tissues of the ubiquitous moss, Ceratodon purpureus. Using greenhouse populations of C. purpureus grown in a common garden, I examined fungal community structure and overall abundance of fungal biomass associated with male and female individuals from multiple populations. I hypothesized that individual mosses would harbor unique fungal communities based on their sex, and that overall fungal biomass associated with host tissues would differ significantly due to differences in morphological and physiological characteristics between the sexes. I found that fungal community composition and overall abundance (i. e. biomass) differ between male and female individuals of C. purpureus, and that sex-specific patterns are retained across individuals from three different populations. This work provides a first glance at how genetically based sexual systems in early land plants influence affiliated fungal community composition...|$|R
30|$|Coal facies is a {{function}} of the type of peat forming flora. The flora in a given geological milieu are controlled by climate, ground water table, nutrient supply and chemistry of water (marine influence). The ground water is the most important factor which determines not only the type of vegetation but also controls the redox potential (oxic to anoxic) and thereby the mode of preservation of plant litter or intensity of humification process. A peat accumulating system can be distinguished in coastal lowland and freshwater peat land (Diessel 1992). The coastal low land is protected by sand bars or barrier beaches, close to tidal influences and grade into marine-influenced to freshwater mires. The fresh water peatlands are inland mire, having no connection to sea, including upper delta and alluvial plain swamps, marshes and bogs. Peat may form in forest swamps from various plant associations, or in marshes with herbaceous vegetation (sedges and grasses) or in open swamps with predominantly submerged and floating plants or in <b>raised</b> bog with <b>mosses</b> or shrubs or trees. Several coal geologists made significant contributions towards the depositional system, mention may be the name of Amijaya and Littke (2005), Marques (2002), Sebag et al. (2006), and Silva et al. (2008). For retrieving the type of Karharbari coal facies, petrography based model proposed by Hacquebard and Donaldson (1969), Diessel (1986), Calder et al. (1991), Mukhopadhyay (1986), Singh and Singh (1996) and Singh et al. (2013) have been used.|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{relative}} sea level (RSL) and {{their effect on}} the distribution of human activity in the Forth lowland, Scotland, UK between ca 11, 700 and ca 2000 calibrated years before present (BP) are examined. Block uplift of shorelines occurred over a longer period than previously thought, continuing to at least around 4700 BP. New graphs of RSL change, based upon an analysis of previous work and evidence from new sites using standard morphological and stratigraphical analyses, support a fall in RSL in the early Holocene during which buried estuarine surfaces were formed, followed by a marked reversal on a centennial, perhaps even decadal, scale sometime around 9900 – 9500 BP from a falling sequence to a rising one. There may have been a short-lived fluctuation in the rising RSL ca 8300 BP, and the Holocene Storegga Slide tsunami of ca 8100 BP was widespread in the lowland. The rising RSL culminated at the Main Postglacial Shoreline, reached ca 7800 BP, when Mean High Water Spring Tides (MHWS) lay within the range 14. 6 – 16. 5 m British Ordnance Datum (OD) in the western lowland. This is the highest published Holocene RSL in Britain and Ireland. The subsequent fall in RSL stabilised at a second shoreline, the Blairdrummond Shoreline, from which regression was occurring at ca 4700 BP. RSL later fell to a lower shoreline at ca 3900 BP before reaching present levels within the last three millennia. Comparison between the empirical evidence for RSL change in this area and glacial isostatic adjustment models indicates both similarities and differences. Records of archaeological sites and artefacts in the lowland and surrounding areas are discussed. Maps showing the evolution of the estuary are compared with the distribution of Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age activity. Evidence for Mesolithic people indicates the opportunistic use of available resources as RSL rose and the estuary expanded to its maximum extent. Neolithic people were also attracted to the estuary, building at least one platform from which to exploit resources and accumulating middens along the shoreline for over 2000 years. Bronze Age people were present across the emerging saltmarshes and mudflats before <b>raised</b> peat <b>mosses,</b> already extensive {{at the head of the}} lowland, developed more widely. In the Iron Age, the area could be accessed both between the peat mosses of the western lowland and across newly emergent land in the east as RSL continued to fall...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of species traits along a phylogeny can be examined through {{an increasing number}} of possible, but not necessarily complementary, approaches. In this paper, we assess whether deriving ancestral states of discrete morphological characters from a model whose parameters are (i) optimized by ML on a most likely tree; (ii) optimized by ML onto each of a Bayesian sample of trees; and (iii) sampled by a MCMC visiting the space of a Bayesian sample of trees affects the reconstruction of ancestral states in the moss genus Brachytheciastrum. In the first two methods, the choice of a single- or two-rate model and of a genetic distance (wherein branch lengths are used to determine the probabilities of change) or speciational (wherein changes are only driven by speciation events) model based upon a likelihood-ratio test strongly depended on the sampled trees. Despite these differences in model selection, reconstructions of ancestral character states were strongly correlated to each others across nodes, often at r > 0. 9, for all the characters. The Bayesian approach of ancestral character state reconstruction offers, however, a series of advantages over the single-tree approach or the ML model optimization on a Bayesian sample of trees because it does not involve restricting model parameters prior to reconstructing ancestral states, but rather allows a range of model parameters and ancestral character states to be sampled according to their posterior probabilities. From the distribution of the latter, conclusions on trait evolution can be made in a more satisfactorily way than when a substantial part of the uncertainty of the results is obscured by the focus on a single set of model parameters and associated ancestral states. The reconstructions of ancestral character states in Brachytheciastrum reveal rampant parallel morphological evolution. Most species previously described based on phenetic grounds are thus resolved of polyphyletic origin. Species polyphylly has been increasingly reported among <b>mosses,</b> <b>raising</b> severe reservations regarding current species definition. Peer reviewe...|$|R
