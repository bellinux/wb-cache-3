For most people, buying a property is the biggest private purchase of their lives. This puts a big pressure on the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> agent to make the process run smooth.

We have researched what effect the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>managers</b> clothing has on the customers’ first impression and how clothing affects customers’ choice of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> agents.

The respondents were told to express the feelings and impressions they got from looking at the pictures, and then answer some questions about their experience of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>managers.</b>  We´ve discovered that the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>managers</b> clothing affects the customers’ first impression, but in the final choice of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>managers</b> clothing is {{not as important as}} personality for example. The most popular style of the four was number two, business casual. This was because the respondents saw a man they could thrust that is down to earth. The <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>managers</b> their self also favored number two, because it´s a universal style that´s easy to adjust to the customer you´re working with...|$|R
