40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the crosslinking of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene in the melt and in the oriented crystalline state. Apart from the synthesis of the networks, this work deals with the influence of vulcanization on network properties such as strength, crystallinity, <b>rubberlike</b> <b>elasticity</b> and oriented crystallization.

40|$|Observed {{deviations}} from the kinetic theory of <b>rubberlike</b> <b>elasticity</b> have been reviewed, and particular attention focussed upon the Mooney parameter C 2. Stress measurements have been made upon thin rubber sheets {{in a state of}} pure homogeneous biaxial strain, and the stress relaxation behaviours of a natural rubber and a butyl rubber are reported … [cont. ]...|$|E
40|$|Stress-strain isotherms at {{a number}} of {{temperatures}} in the range 45 - 85 [deg]C have been determined for a compressed, amorphous polyoxyethylene network swollen with a constant amount of non-volatile diluent. The observed isotherms showed much smaller departures from the form indicated by the molecular theories of <b>rubberlike</b> <b>elasticity</b> than is generally the case for polymer networks in elongation. The thermoelastic behaviour of the network was characterized by the dependence of the stress on temperature at constant deformation. The value of the temperature coefficient of the unperturbed dimensions of polyoxyethylene calculated from these data is in good agreement with values obtained both from thermoelastic measurements on polyoxyethylene networks in elongation, and from viscosity-temperature studies on isolated polyoxyethylene chains in a thermodynamically good solvent...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis review {{illustrates}} how elastomer reinforcement can be modeled using Monte Carlo simulations on rotational isomeric state chains to characterize their spatial configurations {{in the vicinity}} of filler particles. The results are distributions of the chain end-to-end distances as perturbed by this excluded-volume effect, and the results obtained are in agreement with experimental results gotten by neutron scattering. The use of these distributions in standard molecular theories of <b>rubberlike</b> <b>elasticity</b> then produces stress–strain isotherms suitable for comparison with those in elongation experiments. Such simulations have now been carried out for elastomeric matrices reinforced by spherical filler particles (either on a cubic lattice or randomly dispersed), or by prolate or oblate particles on cubic lattices (either with their axes oriented or randomized). The simulated mechanical properties are consistent with experimental results available at the present time, and should provide encouragement and guidance for additional simulations and experiments...|$|E
40|$|Some recent {{theory in}} the area of <b>rubberlike</b> <b>elasticity</b> is {{illustrated}} by the analysis of strain-induced crystallization, chain entanglements in networks through constraint models, junction fluctuations and neutron scattering, and phase separations in oriented gels. Experimental techniques for characterizing elastomers involve the usual mechanical property measurements but also include chain orientation by birefringence measurements and infrared spectroscopy, small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering studies, pulse-propagation measurements, and Brillouin scattering. Some unusual types of elastomers described include (i) networks having known structures (“model ” elastomers), (ii) networks having bimodal distributions of network chain lengths, (iii) reversibly cross-linked materials (“thermoplastic elastomers”), and (iv) elastomers cross linked in solution. Some novel approaches to reinforcement include (i) sol-gel-generated ceramic phases, (ii) rubbery particles for toughening ceramics, (iii) zeolites and other porous fillers that can be penetrated by network chains, and (iv) exfoliated clays. Examples of simulations involve the gelation process leading to network structures, non-Gaussian distributions, crystallization of elastomers that are chemically or stereochemically copolymeric, and reinforcement from particulate fillers...|$|E
40|$|Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS), or biorubber, is a tough, {{biodegradable}} elastomer {{made from}} biocompatible monomers. The material was designed, synthesized and characterized in the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT. Its main features are good mechanical properties, <b>rubberlike</b> <b>elasticity</b> and surface erosion biodegradation. PGS was proved to have similar in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility to PLGA, poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid), a widely used biodegradable polymer. PGS {{has been tested}} for use as nerve guide material and to fabricate artificial capillary networks for tissue engineering applications, both yielding promising results. Currently, the PGS research group continues to develop the material and to seek applications to maximize market potential and impact in the medical field, i. e. stenting (cardiovascular and non-vascular) and tissue engineering (cardiovascular and musculoskeletal). These markets were estimated at $ 5 billion dollars [1] and potentially over $ 10 billion dollars [2], respectively in the U. S. for 2004. Another promising field involves drug delivery, particularly in combination devices like drug-eluting stents. The potential non-medical applications are biodegradable rubbish bags, the absorbent material used in sanitary napkins or diapers, and even fishing lure or chewing gum. (cont.) MIT submitted a patent application for PGS titled "Biodegradable Polymer": US 2003 / 0118692 Al. The patent strongly presents {{the quality of the}} technology, protects methods for synthesizing the material and supports several products made from or with it; thus rendering large market potential for PGS. A patent search compares the PGS patent to intellectual property for other competing biodegradable elastomers; mainly to polymers developed by Ameer et al. in Northwestern University, using citric acid (PDC and POC) and similar to PGS in mechanical properties, elasticity and degradation mechanism. The recommended business model is to pursue development through NIH grants within MIT collaborating with Northwestern University. A joint venture for both materials can lead to founding a medical device start-up funded by SBIR grants or the Deshpande Center at MIT. After pre-clinical trials, the company may be offered for sale to larger players, i. e. Johnson & Johnson or Boston Scientific for stenting; and Genzyme, Advanced Tissue Science, or other upcoming companies focused on tissue engineering. by Diana Manzanedo. Thesis (M. Eng.)
