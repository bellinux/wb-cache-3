50|$|As mill engines {{became more}} powerful, from around 1870 {{there was a}} shift from single belt drives to {{multiple}} <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b> The barring engine needed to turn these <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> over as well (although they were disconnected from the machinery at the remote end) and a simple manual gear was no longer sufficient.

5000|$|In general, as {{with flat}} belts, <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> {{were used for}} {{connections}} from stationary engines to the jack shafts and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery. Unlike leather belts, however, <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances. Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the [...] "flying rope", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.|$|E

5000|$|In its {{original}} plan, {{the plant was}} meant as an independent competitor to the local electric companies, and supplied power to the surrounding towns of Illchester, Ellicott City and Catonsville {{many of which were}} outside of the utilities' service area. It replaced an earlier 300hp plant purchased for $12,000 in 1900 two miles away at Gray's mills that employed a millrace with a bevel gear and <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> The $175,000 electric generation equipment was engaged on 28 November 1908 at 3:30pm by Victor Bloede's daughter, Miss Vida Bloede.

5000|$|Mules and {{man power}} {{had long been}} used {{exclusively}} as the motive power in moving coal from the mines, but this method was expensive and unsatisfactory. Because of the insistent demand for a more economical method, experiments were being conducted using for power - [...] electricity, compressed air and <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> Gasoline engines were definitely a novelty in those early days, nevertheless William Whitcomb, together with Eckert, decided the principle could be successfully applied to a small mine locomotive. In April, 1906 the first successful gasoline locomotive was built and installed in a large Central Illinois coal mine.|$|R
50|$|The {{power was}} {{provided}} by a Manhattan type steam engine by George Saxon & Co. Transmission was by <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b> The mill had 137,312 mule spindles which remained until the 1950s when they were replaced by 33,636 ring spindles, the mill being electrified at the same time. It ceased operation as a textile mill in March 1978.|$|E
50|$|Late in the century, Henry Bannermann of Stalybridge {{took over}} the mill. Its beam engine was {{replaced}} by a horizontal engine, and <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> were fitted.

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} {{changes the}} topology of magnetic field lines to a lower-energy state. This process can liberate stored magnetic field energy and accelerate particles during unsteady, explosive events. This {{is one of}} the most important processes in astrophysical, space and laboratory plasmas. The abrupt onset and cessation has been a long-standing puzzle. We show the first three-dimensional (3 D) laboratory example of the onset and stagnation of magnetic reconnection between magnetized and parallel current channels (flux <b>ropes)</b> <b>driven</b> by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) attraction and a 3 D plasma-current-driven instability. Antiparallel magnetic field lines carried by these colliding flux <b>ropes</b> annihilate and <b>drive</b> an electric field.

40|$|Drives are {{basically}} used to transmit power and speed from the prime mover to the machine. The power transmission and speed reduction between the prime-mover and the driven machine {{can be achieved}} by using conventional drives like Belt <b>drive,</b> <b>Rope</b> <b>drive,</b> Chain drive, Gears, etc. with their numerous advantages and disadvantages. There are many machines and mechanical units that under varying circumstances make it desirable to be able to drive at a barely perceptible speed, an intermediate speed or a high speed. Thus an infinitely variable (step less) speed variation in which it is possible to get any desirable speed. Some mechanical, hydraulic, drives serve as such step less drives. However the torque versus speed characteristics of these drives do not match torque at low speeds. Hence the need of a step less or infinitely variable speed drive came into existence. The drive presented {{by the end of this}} research work is single ball traction drive for continuously variable transmission systems.

50|$|These were 'standard' mill engines {{preferred}} by the Oldham Limiteds. An early example was the 1,000-ihp engine {{delivered to the}} North Moor spinning company in 1876. The design was conservative, using slide valves and spur wheel gear drive transmission. They did start to fit Corliss valves and <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> in 1883, but these didn't become standard until the 1890s. An example of such an engine was the 2,000-ihp, horizontal twin tandem triple expansion delivered to Pearl Mill in 1892.|$|E
50|$|The {{increasingly}} powerful engines {{required more}} boilers with economisers and superheaters. Mills needed reservoirs {{to supply the}} boilers and condense the steam. The chimneys were round and taller. Three types of engines were used: triple expansion horizontal cross compound engines, Inverted marine type compounds which were more compact, and Manhattans with vertical and horizontal cylinders such as the 3500 hp engine at New Pear Mill. <b>Rope</b> <b>drives</b> were used exclusively. Electricity was gradually introduced firstly on group drives driving a shaft (Little Mill, 1908), {{and then later on}} individual machines.|$|E
50|$|Power Plant and Dam No. 4 is a {{historic}} hydroelectric power generation station on the Potomac River, located near Shepherdstown on the county line between Berkeley and Jefferson County, West Virginia. The power plant is a tall one-story, limestone building on a high stone foundation. It is five bays long and has a gable roof. Dam 4 uses horizontal shaft turbines connected by <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> to horizontal shaft generators. This plant is probably the last commercially operated rope-driven hydroelectric plant in the United States. The building is built into a hillside, so the main floor is the top floor.

The transmission method was a <b>rope</b> <b>drive</b> using 40 <b>ropes.</b> The engine was {{reputed to be}} the only twin-tandem that Urmson & Thompson built. It had two 30" [...] diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinders at the rear, and two 60" [...] LP (low-pressure) cylinders in front. There were Corliss valves on all cylinders.

40|$|This topic {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and analysis of a stair case lift, which can be use as Material Handling System. A stair case lift is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs {{up and down on}} the stairs, who may find difficulty in doing so themselves. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting platform is attached to the rail. A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure. This lift runs on electric power and consists of a motor, reduction gear box, <b>rope</b> <b>drive,</b> two rails a sliding chair. In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will make the motor run in reverse direction connected with the earlier, while the later will form the entire assembly run to in downward direction, with the help of Toggle switches and push buttons. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations. Can be of industrial use too. Moreover, considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the capacity of motor.

50|$|The 1865 mill {{consists}} of two five storeyed blocks of 18 bays, with a narrower 9 bay central block for warehousing and offices. The central block has two italianate stair towers and carries a central clock. The floors have become wider to accommodate the larger mules of the period. All floors are fireproof, with transverse vaults. The detached engine house used horizontal shafts that connected to vertical shafts in each spinning block. The chimney was octagonal, on a plinth with a highly embellished oversailer. In the early 20th century this was replaced with separate inverted compound engines for each block with external rope races for <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|E

It {{is probably the}} largest locally made wrought iron composition in Queensland.To {{the east of the}} dock is the brick pump house which has an arched roof, supported by timber beams, and a large brick chimney. The two centrifugal pumps for emptying the dock and steam boilers were imported from London. Three new Cornish boilers replaced the originals in 1907 and in 1924 the steam engines were replaced by electric motors constructed by Evans Deakin. During the busy war years the boiler house was enclosed by a concrete blockhouse. The Cornish boilers and their coal chutes, the pump, the electric engine with its sub-station and <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> are extant but inoperative.|$|E
50|$|These fans {{moved at}} {{relatively}} low speeds, usually {{being driven by}} <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> from a horizontal steam engine {{on the ground floor}} below the fan. They always had one single impeller and so to achieve the large air volumes required, they were of large diameter. Although made in a range of sizes, a common large-size fan was 40 ft in diameter. Using a single impeller was common for large ventilation fans, although some makers used a double sided impeller to give twice the airflow for a similar rotating mass. Waddle though always used a single-sided impeller with an overhung bearing at the rear face of the fan. This avoided having the bearings placed in the often damp airstream, simplifying maintenance.|$|E

50|$|The company {{introduced}} the highly efficient Corliss valve gear into the United Kingdom from the United States in about 1864 and was closely identified with it thereafter; William Inglis {{being responsible for}} promoting the high speed Corliss engine. About 1881 Hick, Hargreaves received orders for two Corliss engines of 3000 hp, the largest cotton mill engines in the world. Hargreaves and Inglis trip gear was first applied to a large single cylinder 1800 hp Corliss engine at Eagley Mills near Bolton and the company received a Gold Medal for its products at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition. Mill gearing was a speciality including large flywheels for <b>rope</b> <b>drives,</b> one example of 128 tons being 32 ft in diameter and groved for 56 ropes. Turbines and hydraulic machinery were also manufactured. Many of the tools were to suit the specialist work, with travelling cranes to take 15 to 40 tons in weight, a large lathe, side planer, slotting machine, pit planer and a tool for turning four 32 ft rope flywheels simultaneously. The workshops also featured an 80ton hydraulic riveting machine. For the ease of shipping and transportation, Soho Iron Works had its own railway system, traversed by sidings of the London North Western Railway (LNWR). Inglis, who lived in Bolton was a neighbour of LNWR's chief mechanical engineer, Francis Webb.|$|E
40|$|The abrupt onset and {{cessation}} of magnetic reconnection {{has been a}} long standing puzzle, and is likely an important factor in turbulent plasma systems. We discuss three-dimensional (3 D) magnetic reconnection with a guide magnetic field. We show the first 3 D laboratory example of onset and stagnation of magnetic reconnection between magnetized and parallel current channels (flux <b>ropes)</b> <b>driven</b> by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) attraction and a kink mode, which is a 3 D plasma current driven instability. Antiparallel magnetic field lines carried by these colliding flux <b>ropes</b> annihilate and <b>drive</b> a reconnection electric field. We also show examples where the compression and line bending of a guide magnetic field results in bouncing flux ropes. For this case no reconnection occurs, but we measure an out of plane quadrupole magnetic field signature with no Hall effect. We outline a simple MHD theory to account for the existence of a threshold between flux merging-reconnection and flux rope bouncing. This threshold and the accessible dynamics may be important for 3 D dynamics, turbulence, and magnetic structures that become filamented on ion gyro scales.

25|$|Around 1873 {{the firm}} {{supplied}} two blowing engines {{to the huge}} Krupp steelworks at Essen, Germany. It was in this decade that the company began to install flat belt drive systems for the transfer of power from its stationary steam engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. This technique was common in the US but rare in Britain until this time: the advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, {{and it was a}} more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill.

At the same time, a reciprocating Corliss steam engine was installed in the plant to provide supplemental capacity during low water flow; this drove the No.7 hydraulic generator through a <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> This was only kept for 5 years. One turbine failed in 1932 and has not been replaced. Each of the turbines has three water-lubricated lignum vitae wood bearings in the turbine chamber and an oil-bath bearing in the generator hall.

The jetty is wide enough for coaches to travel down to collect and deliver passengers to the town and on local tours. The plant relied for its electricity supply on the island's nuclear power station at Wylfa, near Cemaes Bay. However, Wylfa is reaching the end of its life and has permission to generate only into 2012, and the ending of a low-cost electricity supply contract in 2009 impacted on the financial viability of the smelting plant.
