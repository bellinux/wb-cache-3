It is not only that for English history, as it lives in the portraiture of kings and queens, and their courtiers and courtesans and heroes and statesmen, it is the past made personal to the beholder and forever related to himself, as if he had seen those people in the flesh. It is, above everything else, for those rooms upon rooms crowded with the pictures and statues and busts of the Englishmen who have made England England in every field of achievement that is oppressively, almost crushingly wonderful. Before that swarming population of poets, novelists, historians, essayists, dramatists; of painters, sculptors, architects; of astronomers, mathematicians, geologists, physicians; of philosophers, theologians, divines; of statesmen, politicians, inventors, actors; of philanthropists, reformers, economists, the great of our own history need not, indeed, shrink in form, but must dwindle in number till our past seems as thinly peopled as our continent. It is in these rooms that the grandeur of England, historically, resides. You may, if you are so envious, consider it in that point and this, and at some point find her less great than the greatest of her overgrown or overgrowing daughters, but from the presence of that tremendous collectivity, that populous commonwealth of famous citizens whose census can hardly be taken, you must come away and own, in the welcome obscurity to which you plunge among the millions of her capital, that in all-round greatness we have hardly even the imagination of her transcendence.|$|E

50|$|Probably most {{important}} {{point to be}} discussed is the <b>representativity</b> of the sampling regarding the quality of data.Based on the total population, those people who don’t own a mobile phone, cannot {{become part of the}} sampling. Mobile phone users {{have to be able to}} be reached as well as to be willing to take part in the survey. But it is by far not enough to just look at the users of mobile phones. Equally important is to also know the amount of those people who use the SMS service and how many of these people own a web-enabled phone. Only if all these aspects are being noticed, a final conclusion regarding the sampling can be drawn. For these reasons a mobile survey does not meet the standards of the statistical representativity.As mentioned in the beginning, the restricted possibilities to access WAP-Surveys are another problem. The amount of those who use the internet via their mobile phone is rather small: According to IFCom only 19% of all mobile phone users do so. But the data acquisition through mobile phones holds more difficulties. On one hand there are high costs for Incentives and an intensive recruitment by the institutes. On the other hand the participants of the survey have to pay the costs for the internet usage via mobile phone. However, more and more respondents do not pay the internet access based on the time spent on Internet and more and more places proposes free Wi-Fi, making this issue less and less relevant for respondents. Additionally, there are also technical difficulties that may occur. The high number of different and not-compatible software or the low transmission rate of data are just a few to name. In order to improve the respondents' experience in answering the web surveys on mobile devices, optimizing the layout of the survey for smaller screen is crucial: non-optimized layouts lead to lower data quality.Restrictions concerning the reveal and passing on of mobile phone numbers (because of data protection and the lack of Anonymity) are setting limits to the research in this field of study, too.|$|E
50|$|Statistical {{methods in}} the mobile market {{research}} {{profit from the}} fact that they do not depend on place or time. This means that surveys via mobile phone can be done anywhere and at any time and are therefore much more advantageous compared to surveys via land line phones. Considering that a high amount of participants of the main target groups can not be reached at home at most hours of the day, the chance to get hold of them by mobile phone is much higher.Especially with regard to people under the age of 25 as well as business people, who are often on the way and cannot get hold of easily, the chances of the mobile market research are promising. As most people always carry their mobile phone with them, an immediate transmission of personal impressions of current events, is possible at any time. Thus, the so-called ‘magic moment’ can be captured, which is often very helpful. Surveys concerning product placement and efficiency of sales promotion measures at the point of sale turned out to be perfectly realizable this way. Looking at the topic “Access possibilities to WAP-Surveys” by mobile phone, {{as well as at the}} topic “Getting hold of potential participants”, there are some developments that should be named. The trend towards the increasing distribution of web-enabled mobile phones, and the improved <b>representativity</b> that comes along with it, does still continue: from 2007 to 2008, Nielsen Mobile noticed an increase of the mobile internet usage.With decreasing costs and an improving technology, a further upward tendency can be expected. In addition, the mobile internet usage increases with the rapidly developing distribution of smart phones. According to IM (Mediawork Initiative), already in 2013 more people will log in with their smart phone, than with a PC. Mobile statistics show a high and very fast response rate. As a result of the independency from time and place, answers can be submitted immediately. This also means that results can almost be transmitted in real time. A study from Globalpark shows that approximately 35% of the participants answered a mobile survey within 2 hours. Through the novelty of the form of survey and its playful design, mobile research has a motivating effect on the participants. This applies especially to young, technologically interested male persons. But also iPhone users are considered to be very communicative. As the devices are easy to handle, the users are more likely and more motivated to take part in surveys. A study examining how to best reach mobile respondents published in the Journal Social Science Computer Review underlines the importance of social factors. Especially their subjective belief of how they are seen by significant others, or their intention of how they would like to be seen by significant others seem to play a major role in their mobile phone behavior.|$|E

Dans une seconde partie, il est question de représentativité syndicale selon la législation de la province de Québec. *(*) Communication présentée partiellement devant les membres de la Société Royale du Canada en 1966. REPRESENTATION AND REPRESENTATIVITYThis study aims at exploring {{the notion of}} <b>representativity.</b> Once its nature and its limitations are analysed, an attempt {{will be made to}} determine the criteria which could be used in practice for discovering the credit due to those who pretend being representative. A second section is concerned with union <b>representativity</b> according to the Quebec labour legislation. REPRESENTATION AND REPRESENTATIVITYThe idea of representation is anterior to that of democracy and even participation. Any time there is a group more or less important where the affairs cannot be managed through the direct and immediate action of the members it is necessary to rely upon representation: an individual or few people should have the possibility of speaking or taking action on behalf of the group. The idea of representation involves two aspects: a) {{to take the place of}} somebody; b) to make this person or group present to another. Representation is concerned with three inter-related elements: a) a plurality or a multitude; b) an individual (or an identified small group of persons) which takes the place of the multitude; c) a third party which is distinct from the represented multitude and the representative. <b>Representativity</b> could be defined as follows: it is the conformity or the accord, between the opinions and the attitudes expressed by the representative and those held by those represented. The notion of <b>representativity</b> is essentially limited to the relation « representative-representees », whereas the notion of representation refers to the relation « representees-representative-third party ». It is a new notion and implies between the representative and the representees a communication, a participation. Representation is taking a new dimension when founded on <b>representativity.</b> Representation and <b>representativity</b> may be said in the case of an individual (or a small number of individuals) towards the members of an organized group, and also in the case of an organized group towards a social category. For example, the leaders of a labour union towards the members of this union; and a labour union central body towards all the working class. <b>Representativity</b> may be considered under two aspects: juridical and sociological. This juridical aspect is the easiest to establish. Juridical <b>representativity</b> exists when in an organized group some individuals have been formally authorized to represent the group. It is evident this kind of <b>representativity</b> cannot be found when an organized group claims to be representative of all those belonging to the same social category. Sociological <b>representativity</b> is either static or dynamic. Static <b>representativity</b> is the actual conformity between what the representees are explicitly thinking and wanting and what is expressed by the representatives on a specific question at a given moment. It is relatively quite easy to discover because quantitative criteria can generally be used. Actually there exists control instruments to check the conformity or the non-conformity between the positions of the representatives and those of the representees. And this is also true in the case of an organized group towards the whole social category. They are: the membership, the vote, opinion pools, etc. The static <b>representativity,</b> however, does not offer a true and complete image of the reality. There is the problem of knowing if, in a group, general opinion equalizes the opinion of the majority. Because many types of opinions have been distinguished: internal and external; actual and hidden, momentaneous and lasting. Static <b>representativity</b> deals only with external, actual and momentaneous opinion. Dynamic <b>representativity</b> is in no way less real than static <b>representativity,</b> but it is much harder to discover, because, here, one has to deal with a qualitative and not a quantitative evaluation. It refers not only to the actual conformity which has been described but it refers also to the future attitudes of the representees in function of historical forces influencing them and of general tendencies which might take place. Thus, a minority might at a time be representative. In the case of dynamic <b>representativity,</b> factors related to the leaders, to the nature of the group and to the representees them selves have to be taken into account. This is very difficult to appreciate, because it requires value judgments and these are easily influenced by emotions, prejudices, doctrinal options. How to define a line of force, a trend? The course of events might change many things. There is no safe criteria to which to refer. Although being real and complementary to static <b>representativity,</b> dynamic <b>representativity</b> cannot be ever used as a basis for institutionalized representation. UNION <b>REPRESENTATIVITY</b> IN QUÉBEC LEGISLATIONSome legislative measures deal directly or indirectly with representation and <b>representativity</b> for labour organizations. The Superior Council of Labour is formed by representatives of employers and labour unions. But the law does not fix any criteria to which the Minister of Labour should refer to when appointing them. In the Quebec Labour Code, there is question of <b>representativity</b> for the composition of the Labour Relations Board and for the certification of unions. There is no criteria fixed for the appointment of representatives at the Quebec Labour Relations Board. It is different in the case of the certification of a union. The QLRB is bound to certificate unions along three criteria: a) the union should group the majority of the workers belonging to the bargaining unit (art. 24; 28); b) the union should not be dominated by the employer (art. 11); c) the members of the union should have freely joined the union without any intimidation or threats coming either from the employer or from the union) (art. 12). The Quebec Labour Code aims at organizing a stable representation which will be the closest possible to the <b>representativity</b> of the bargaining unit. It is a legal, a juridical representation. Hence, this legal representation is not acquired once and for all. It can be revoked. The stability of representation sometimes has priority over <b>representativity.</b> This is the case when the members of a union cannot change their affiliation except during a period of time fixed by the law. There is also another legislative measure which deals indirectly with union representativity: The Collective Agreement Act. <b>REPRESENTATIVITY</b> AND COMMON SENSEAnytime the government is obliged to take into account the « most representative associations » the law does not give a definition of what this means. As regards this matter, the question is best left to common sense and to jurisprudence. Without being exhaustive it seems the following should be considered: 1 —The organization which claims the representation of a whole social category should, at least, be representative of its own members. 2 —An association is representative of its members when it is democratic in its structure and functionning. Members should have the possibility to elect the leaders, to participate in the decision-making process and to control the affairs of the association. Concretely, it should be presumed as representative when the formal structure is democratic and the members do not complain about its functionning. 3 —In accounting for the <b>representativity</b> of an association with regards to a whole social category, if the membership is an important criteria, it should be weighed against other non-qualitative factors, such as the age of the group, its stability, its experience and the degree of its expansion as well as the seriousness, competency and prestige of the leaders. 4 —Objective <b>representativity</b> has nothing to do with the consideration and acceptance of the leaders by the third-party. The weight of representation may be affected, but it is external to the relation representees-representatives. 5 —The <b>representativity</b> of a group with regards to a whole social category cannot be juridically established. 6 —Juridical <b>representativity</b> should aim at corresponding with sociological <b>representativity.</b> 7 —Attempts to define with too many details the rules of <b>representativity</b> through legislation may at times be a screen hiding reality. Nevertheless, law must avoid any encouragement towards the arbitrary...|$|E
30|$|Of the {{scholarly}} implications of our results, one {{is about the}} feasibility to develop new methods that ensure <b>representativity.</b> Those few transport studies to have developed new methods of adapting transport systems to users’ wishes have contributed to developing explicit methods, for example user segmentation [10]. Our study demonstrates that the explicit methods are in all likelihood also influenced by experience-based knowledge. This qualifies the ability to ensure <b>representativity</b> and objectivity by using explicit methods. This in turn leads to a second scholarly implication of our results, namely how to view the relationship between implicit and explicit methods in analytical terms. The transformation of the transport planners’ experience-based knowledge into explicit knowledge {{is a prerequisite for}} knowledge dissemination and organizational learning, regardless of problems of <b>representativity.</b> Practical methods for the formalization of individual planners’ experience-based knowledge using explicit methods are a prerequisite for knowledge dissemination.

Finally, the third method allows us to develop an argument which leads to the conjecture that, for any g and n sufficiently large, a surface of genus g can be triangulated with <b>representativity</b> at least [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We show a {{construction}} of high <b>representativity</b> triangulations of compact surfaces, equivalently, triangulations without short non-contractible cycles, {{and give a}} polynomial time algorithm {{to carry out the}} construction. We improve substantially the previously known lower bound for the <b>representativity</b> of such a triangulation. More precisely, we present an O(max(g 2; n)) -time algorithm that, for given g and n (g ? 1 and n ? c 0 g log g) constructs an n-vertex triangulation of a genus g oriented surface without boundary such that the <b>representativity</b> of the triangulation is at least c p n=g p log g, where c; c 0 are constants. We extend our result to nonorientable surfaces and surfaces with boundary. In the later case we replace the genus, g, of the surface with parameter g 0 = g + d= 2, where d is the number of boundary components...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{whether it}} is the case that <b>representativity</b> is {{undermined}} if personal computer, tablet and smartphone respondents differ in socio-demographic characteristics and display different survey completion rates. Online market research is struggling with sample <b>representativity.</b> The analysis of more than ten million survey invitations, as well as stated device preference information, suggests that web survey respondents who are members of online panels still mostly use their personal computers, but do express increasing interest in using smartphones and tablets. Survey completion rates do vary across devices, and device use is significantly associated with socio-demographic characteristics and length of membership on a panel. Therefore, researchers must not limit respondents to use a specific device for completing a survey as this may compromise the quality of the survey completion experience, increase non-response error and negatively affect <b>representativity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Terminology {{extraction}} commonly {{includes two}} steps: identification of term-like {{units in the}} texts, mostly multi-word phrases, and the ranking of the extracted term-like units according to their domain <b>representativity.</b> In this paper, we design a multi-word term extraction program for Arabic language. The linguistic filtering performs a morphosyntactic analysis and takes into account several types of variations. The domain <b>representativity</b> is measure thanks to statistical scores. We evalutate several association measures and show that the results we otained are consitent with those obtained for Romance languages. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{evaluation}} of a new method for audio source separation using only one sensor. The method {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of Wiener filtering to locally stationary signals, where the sources are modelled using power spectral density dictionaries which are estimated during a training step. The experiments were designed to measure how separation performance varied with amount of training data, model complexity and the <b>representativity</b> of the training data. The results show that model complexity and training data <b>representativity</b> are more important than the amount of training data. ...|$|E
