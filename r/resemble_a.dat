5|$|Luring {{is not a}} {{necessary}} condition however, as the predator still has a significant advantage simply by not being identified as such. They may <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.|$|E
5|$|Swifts {{are small}} birds which spend the {{majority}} of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> crescent or boomerang.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{uses the}} {{technique}} of pixilation and shows a man's hands (the hands are PES's) making guacamole out of familiar objects, which become different items whenever they are cut, often depending on (unspoken) puns. For example, a baseball is cut in half and then becomes a pile of dice while it is being diced. Each of the objects also <b>resembles</b> <b>an</b> ingredient actually used in an authentic guacamole recipe - a grenade with a billiard ball pit <b>resembles</b> <b>an</b> avocado, <b>a</b> baseball <b>resembles</b> <b>an</b> onion, <b>a</b> pincushion <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> tomato, a green miniature golf ball (with an interior of Trivial Pursuit game pieces/wedges) <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> lime, a green Christmas light bulb <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> jalapeño pepper, and king and queen chess pieces resemble salt & pepper shakers. The end result is [...] "fresh guacamole" [...] served with a side of poker [...] "chips".|$|R

The village is located 15 km west of Richmond Gulf (French: Lac Guillaume-Delisle; Inuttitut: Tasiujaq (which <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> lake)), an immense inland bay which is joined with Hudson Bay by a rocky gulch.|$|R
5|$|The Old Man stands {{close to}} Rackwick Bay {{on the west}} coast of the island of Hoy, in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, and {{can be seen from the}} Scrabster to Stromness ferry. From certain angles it is said to <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> human figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequences}} {{involving the}} armoured train were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway, near Peterborough in the UK. The train {{was composed of}} a British Rail Class 20 diesel-electric locomotive {{and a pair of}} BR Mk 1 coaches, all three heavily disguised to <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> Soviet armoured train.|$|E

5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also {{supposed to have}} a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was lost at sea when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma also noted that the bottom part of the church was designed to <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
50|$|The {{spin-off}} {{involves a}} {{distribution of property}} to shareholders without the surrender of any stock, which thus <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> dividend.

6000|$|... "Eachin resembles Conachar," [...] {{said the}} glover, [...] "no more than <b>a</b> salmon <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> gar, though men {{say they are}} the same fish in a {{different}} state, or than <b>a</b> butterfly <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> grub." ...|$|R

5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon {{considered}} the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Loughor Castle is {{controlled}} by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction. The ruined tower and fragments of the curtain wall still survive on top of the ringwork's earthwork defences, which now <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> motte, or mound, and are part of the Loughor Castle Park.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
50|$|In the late-1940s and early-1950s, Nylint {{remained}} {{committed to}} wind-up toys and soon produced a front-end loader wind-up, which <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> forklift. They {{then made a}} couple of motorcycle tin wind-ups, a street sweeper wind-up (<b>resembling</b> <b>an</b> Elgin machine) and <b>a</b> wind-up that <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> popular TV icon -- Howdy Doody -- although Nylint never used the name to advertise the toy. The Elgin Street Sweeper demonstrated the success of toys patterned after real-life vehicles.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> jerkbait <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> small {{bait fish}} (example: shad); usually hard-bodied, {{sometimes}} soft plastic, usually with two (or sometimes three) treble hooks.

5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems {{very likely that}} the gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo's original scheme, since they are painted to <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> certain type of parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E

These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces.

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{external}} work was complete {{by the end of}} 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and portcullis, against surviving designs at other British castles.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} heredity {{of a group}} of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.|$|E
5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not to be identified as a threat. Wicklerian-Eisnerian mimics may <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> mutualistic ally, or a species of little significance to the prey such as a commensal. For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, a spider commensal of ants.|$|E
