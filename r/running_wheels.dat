25|$|The ride's {{superstructure}} {{is entirely}} timber in construction, the timber being fir and pine; and is completely clad in painted sheets of steel. It measures around 460ft {{in length and}} 100ft in width. The highest point of the track is 70ft above ground level. It has a long track length of 3,223.10 feet (982.40 meters) - the second longest scenic in the world. The actual track is wooden and the running rails are in a trough with walkways either side. The ride is often called a side-friction coaster, which is misleading as the train makes no contact with the side walls of the track; the <b>running</b> <b>wheels</b> are simply flanged like those of railway vehicles (hence the name scenic railway). The ride features two large drops, the first {{one of which is}} a 'headchopper' where the train dives under some of the support structure of the ride. There are also other large drops and a bunnyhop sequence which gives very good air-time both at the front and back of the train. In total there are nine drops. A typical ride time is 3:05, but can vary depending on the styles of the particular brakemen.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} a stress response, two groups of twenty male golden hamsters were either exposed to a ferret or handled by a human. The hamsters' body temperature and <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> activity were measured as stress correlates. Half of the hamsters' cages were equipped with a functional <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to determine whether the}} presence of a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> might reduce stress. Exposure to the ferret was followed by a significant increase in body temperature and <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> revolutions: however, <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> activity did not change after handling. Body temperature increased less after handling in hamsters living in a cage with a functional <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> than in those with a non-revolving <b>running</b> <b>wheel.</b> This suggests that hamsters with a functional <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> reacted less strongly to acute stress caused by handling. On the other hand, temperature increase after the exposure to a ferret was not affected by the presence of a <b>running</b> <b>wheel.</b> Both exposure to a ferret and handling caused stress in golden hamsters, as demonstrated by an increase in body temperature (emotional fever). Stress caused by handling was much milder than stress caused by the ferret. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Administration of METH (0. 5 mg/kg, i. p.) every other day during three conditioning sessions, with saline conditioning sessions in the other compartment on alternate days (ie, saline/METH conditioning), induced a significant CPP, compared to saline/saline conditioning, in mice of groups A and C, but not B. The increased CPP for METH was significantly attenuated by additional 5 -day (drug-free) -exposure to a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> in mice of group A (but not group C). In the second experiment, pre-exposure of another set of mice to a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> for three days did not affect a subsequent METH (1. 0 mg/kg) - or saline-induced horizontal locomotion or rearing, compared with the locomotor activities observed in mice without an experience of a <b>running</b> <b>wheel.</b> These observations suggest that experience of a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> may selectively facilitate an attenuation of drug-seeking behavior...|$|R

40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a {{psychiatric}} illness characterized by excessively restricted caloric intake and abnormally {{high levels of}} physical activity. A challenging illness to treat, {{due to the lack}} of understanding of the underlying neurobiology, AN has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric illnesses. To address this need, neuroscientists are using an animal model to study how neural circuits may contribute toward vulnerability to AN and may be affected by AN. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is a bio-behavioral phenomenon described in rodents that models the key symptoms of anorexia nervosa. When rodents with free access to voluntary exercise on a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> experience food restriction, they become hyperactive – running more than animals with free access to food. Here, we describe the procedures by which ABA is induced in adolescent female C 57 BL/ 6 mice. On postnatal day 36 (P 36), the animal is housed with access to voluntary exercise on a <b>running</b> <b>wheel.</b> After 4 days of acclimation to the <b>running</b> <b>wheel,</b> on P 40, all food is removed from the cage.

40|$|The primary {{visual cortex}} is widely used to study brain plasticity, which is not only crucial for normal brain function, such as {{learning}} and memory, but also for recovery after brain injuries such as stroke. In standard cage raised mice, experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in the {{primary visual cortex}} declines with age and is compromised by a lesion in adjacent and distant cortical regions. In contrast, mice raised in an enriched environment exhibit lifelong ocular dominance plasticity and are protected from losing ocular dominance plasticity after a stroke-lesion in the somatosensory cortex. Since standard cage mice with an access to a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> displayed preserved ocular dominance plasticity during ageing, we investigated whether physical exercise might also provide a plasticity promoting effect after a cortical stroke. To this end, we tested if adult running wheel-raised mice preserved ocular dominance plasticity after stroke and also if short-term running after stroke restored ocular dominance plasticity to standard cage mice. Indeed, unlike mice without a <b>running</b> <b>wheel,</b> adult <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> mice continued to show ocular dominance plasticity even after stroke, and a two weeks <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> experience after stroke already restored lost ocular dominance plasticity. Additionally, the experience-enabled increase of the spatial frequency and contrast threshold of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, normally lost after stroke, was restored in both groups of <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> mice. Our data suggest that physical exercise alone can, not only preserve visual plasticity into old age but also restore it after a cortical stroke...|$|R

40|$|The {{endogenous}} cannabinoid {{system is}} involved in the regulation of the central reward pathway. <b>Running</b> <b>wheel</b> and sucrose consumption have rewarding and reinforcing properties in rodents, and share many neurochemical and behavioral characteristics with drug addiction. In this study, we investigated whether <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> or sucrose consumption altered the sensitivity of striatal synapses to the activation of cannabinoid CB 1 receptors. We found that cannabinoid CB 1 receptor-mediated presynaptic control of striatal inhibitory postsynaptic currents was remarkably potentiated after these environmental manipulations. In contrast, the sensitivity of glutamate synapses to CB 1 receptor stimulation was unaltered, {{as well as that of}} GABA synapses to the stimulation of presynaptic GABAB receptors. The sensitization of cannabinoid CB 1 receptor-mediated responses was slowly reversible after the discontinuation of <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> or sucrose consumption, and was also detectable following the mobilization of endocannabinoids by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 stimulation.

We studied the effects of age and exercise on baseline circadian rhythms and on the circadian system's {{ability to respond to}} the perturbation induced by an 8 h advance of the light:dark (LD) cycle as a test of the system's robustness. Mice (male, mPer 2 (luc) /C 57 BL/ 6) were studied at one of two ages: 3. 5 months (n = 39) and > 18 months (n = 72). We examined activity records of these mice under entrained and shifted conditions as well as mPER 2 ::LUC measures ex vivo to assess circadian function in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and important target organs. Age was associated with reduced <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> use, fragmentation of activity, and slowed resetting in both behavioral and molecular measures. Furthermore, we observed that for aged mice, the presence of a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> altered the amplitude of the spontaneous firing rate rhythm in the SCN in vitro. Following a shift of the LD cycle, both young and aged mice showed a change in rhythmicity properties of the mPER 2 ::LUC oscillation of the SCN in vitro, and aged mice exhibited longer lasting internal desynchrony. Access to a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> alleviated some age-related changes in the circadian system.

The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis thatdepression of home cage <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> is a reliable and clinically relevant method to assess migraine painin rats. Methods Adult female rats were implanted with a cannula to inject allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) onto the dura to induce migraine pain, as has been shown before. Rats recovered from implantation surgery for 8 days in cages containing a <b>running</b> <b>wheel.</b> Home cage <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> was recorded 23 h a day.

Completion of a fixed number of lever presses released a brake on a <b>running</b> <b>wheel</b> for 60 s, and the response requirement was systematically increased until the rat stopped pressing or until 8 hr had elapsed. The ratio value reached (and the total number of lever presses) was an inverted-U function of food deprivation (percentage body weight). In Experiment 2, when <b>wheel</b> <b>running</b> preceded test sessions, fewer food-reinforced lever presses were maintained by the progressive-ratio schedule, and responding occurred at a lower rate on a variable-interval schedule.
