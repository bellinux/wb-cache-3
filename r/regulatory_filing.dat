30|$|Companies need to {{understand}} the regulatory structure as well as their requirements to initiate product development in a new country. For the past five years, ANVISA has updated their regulations and developed numerous guidances. The primary challenge to successfully submitting an ANVISA <b>regulatory</b> <b>file</b> is directly associated with bio/pharmaceutical companies’ lack of knowledge of the process. Currently, ANVISA’s website is presented in two languages: Portuguese (the native language in Brazil) and English. However, the English version is limited in contents and does not contain all the relevant information that is presented in the Portuguese version. Companies that do not have a regulatory presence in Brazil may be dependent on regulatory professionals with specific expertise in that market.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the pivotal}} {{requirements}} for regulators nowadays, {{in order to}} interpret a significant difference as biologically relevant, is to observe a linear dose-response. This allows them to deduce a causality. However, this dose-response cannot be studied with only two points, which is nonetheless the case for all major commercial GMOs today, which are given in the diet in 11 % and 33 % concentrations only, in subchronic tests. This is true overall if no preliminary data has been obtained to choose the given doses, which {{is the case in}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>files.</b> As we have already emphasized, most of pathological and endocrine effects in environmental health are not directly proportional to the dose, and they have a differential threshold of sensitivity in both sexes [34].

2500|$|Following the {{emergence}} in September 2016 of the scandals involving unauthorized cross-selling {{and the creation}} of fake accounts, Wells Fargo in October 2016 became the largest bank ever to lose its accreditation with the Better Business Bureau and was also placed under investigation by the California attorney general for alleged criminal identity theft during the creation of millions of accounts without customer consent. Separately in October 2016, Wells Fargo settled upon a payout for a racketeering lawsuit alleging the overcharging {{of hundreds of thousands of}} homeowners by the bank for appraisals ordered after defaults on the customers' mortgage loans. In December 2016, following the scandal, the company amended its by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. A <b>regulatory</b> <b>filing</b> by Wells Fargo revealed in November 2016 that it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to its accounts sales practices. Also in November 2016, three U.S. senators alleged that Wells Fargo's sales scandal had extended from retail bankers to its brokerage employees, and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency placed new monitoring restrictions upon Wells Fargo's hiring of new executives, payments of [...] "golden parachutes" [...] to exiting managers, and branch openings and closures.

40|$|Abstract Background Randomized, {{prospective}} trials involving multi-institutional collaboration {{have become}} {{a central part of}} clinical and translational research. However, data management and coordination of multi-center studies is a complex process that involves developing systems for data collection and quality control, tracking data queries and resolutions, as well as developing communication procedures. We describe DADOS-Prospective, an open-source Web-based application for collecting and managing prospective data on human subjects for clinical and translational trials. DADOS-Prospective not only permits users to create new clinical research forms (CRF) and supports electronic signatures, but also offers the advantage of containing, in a single environment, raw research data in downloadable spreadsheet format, source documentation and <b>regulatory</b> <b>files</b> stored in PDF format, and audit trails. Results Feedback from formal and field usability tests was used to guide the design and development of DADOS-Prospective. To date, DADOS-Prospective has been implemented in five prospective clinical studies at our institution. Four of these studies are still in the CRF creation phase and one study has been entirely launched. Conclusion DADOS-Prospective has significant advantages over existing Web-based data collecting programs.

40|$|We hypothesize that, {{in their}} annual {{accounting}} reports, insurers allocate premiums and losses from multistate policies to reduce total state taxes. To test this prediction, we examine firm-level data, {{collected from the}} publicly-available statutory reports used to compute tax bases and filed with each state government. If insurers manage allocations to avoid taxes, we anticipate an inverse relation between the tax rate and the premium-to-loss ratio, which is the industry's standard measure {{of the price of}} a unit of coverage. Firm-specific prices are computed using premium and loss information from the annual <b>regulatory</b> reports <b>filed</b> with each state in which an insurer underwrites. Primary analysis is conducted on 12, 573 insurer-state observations from 1993.

40|$|As the {{judicial}} and legislative branches {{have taken a}} more passive approach to civil rights enforcement, the President’s exercise of independent, extrajudicial constitutional judgment has become increasingly important. Modern U.

Commentators have criticized the President’s refusal to defend DOMA from numerous perspectives but have not considered how the President’s DOMA policy fits within a principled commitment to LGBT equality that includes supporting and signing legislation, pursuing <b>regulatory</b> initiatives, <b>filing</b> complaints and other court papers, making formal and informal choices in law enforcement, and using the bully pulpit to sway public opinion. The President’s nondefense of DOMA not only derives normative force from his larger vision regarding substantive equality and individual rights, but it also demonstrates how certain features of the presidency — including accountability and expertise — can be instrumental in promoting equality-based claims. In this way, presidential constitutionalism can engage coordinate institutions — including the Supreme Court — {{in the development of}} constitutional law...|$|R

ObjectiveTo provide a summary of CV effects of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists in clinical studies. Evidence acquisitionA systematic literature search from inception until November 2014 was performed on studies in PubMed and Medline.
