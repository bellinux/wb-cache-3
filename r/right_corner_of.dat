5|$|On 25 August 2011, Challinor {{signed for}} Kettering's Conference Premier rivals York City on a {{contract}} until January 2012, having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier. He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th-minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right back at York, a position in which he displayed composure {{and an ability to}} start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away to Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the goal {{from the edge of the}} penalty area.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing {{the sum of the}} vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E
5|$|On the top <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> {{the model}} for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit {{or two of the}} pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{two of the}} lithographic copies made in Egypt {{had reached}} the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, {{librarian}} and antiquarian Gabriel de La Porte du Theil set {{to work on a}} translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was more reliable than Ameilhon's, which was first published in 1803. It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal Archaeologia in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner's narrative, and other documents.|$|E

25|$|Known as cholecystitis, {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder is commonly caused by obstruction of the duct with gallstones, which is known as cholelithiasis.

An inflamed gallbladder is likely to cause pain and fever, and tenderness in the upper, <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the abdomen, and may have a positive Murphy's sign. Cholecystitis is often managed with rest and antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins and, in severe cases, metronidazole.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth quarter, the score was tied 28–28. UCF managed a field goal, and took a 31–28 lead, their first lead of the night. The Knights scored 24 {{unanswered}} points, {{and it was the first}} time Louisville had trailed in a game all season. With less than seven minutes left in regulation, Teddy Bridgewater led the Cardinals on a 9-play, 88-yard drive, capped off by a 15-yard touchdown run. With the score, Louisville took the lead 35–31 with 3:00 remaining. UCF's final drive went 75 yards in 11 plays, including two third-down conversions. Blake Bortles completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Godfrey in the <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the endzone with 23 seconds left. With the win, the Knights entered the Top–25 for the first time since 2010.|$|E
25|$|Notification Center {{was added}} in the {{operating}} system. It {{provides an overview of}} alerts from applications and displays notifications until the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant resolution.

25|$|On June 13, 1989, five park {{guests were}} injured on the Loch Ness Monster roller coaster when a train {{collided}} with a tree at an estimated 15mph. The tree had been blown onto the coaster's tracks by a sudden storm. The collision happened on a slightly banked right turn that follows a minor descent from the coaster's second lift hill. There were supposedly twenty-five riders in the train {{at the time of}} the incident. A 16-year-old boy suffered a broken leg, but he was later released in stable condition. Four other people were treated for minor injuries. While the riders were stranded, another train began its usual course. The train plummeted down the ride's 114-foot major descent just before passing through the upper loop of the coaster's two interlocking loops. The stranded riders feared for the worst as the train passed through the first loop. The trapped riders were relieved when the ride's safety features functioned properly and stopped the other train. The train involved in the collision was severely damaged when the front <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the first car was totally torn away from the rest of the train.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo {{started their}} first drive on their 46-yard line, but it ended with an {{interception}} by Bengals cornerback Lewis Billups. On the next play, Esiason's 29-yard run moved the team into scoring range. However, they also came up empty when Esiason's pass was intercepted by Bills linebacker Ray Bentley. Later on, Cincinnati took a 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter after defensive back Eric Thomas' 26-yard interception return to the Bills 4-yard line set up Woods' 1-yard touchdown run. However, a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty against Bengals running back Stanley Wilson (one of six personal foul penalties in the game, two by the Bengals and four by the Bills) after the touchdown was assessed on the ensuing kickoff, and Buffalo ended up getting the ball with good field position with Ronnie Harmon's 22-yard return to the 43-yard line. Kelly subsequently led the Bills back with four consecutive completions, starting out with a pair of throws to receiver Andre Reed for gains of nine and 19 yards and then hooking up with Trumaine Johnson for a 22-yard gain to the Bengals 9-yard line. On the next play, Kelly found Reed in the <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the end zone for a touchdown pass to tie the game.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the <b>right</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
