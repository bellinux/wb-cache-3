25|$|The Paris {{police force}} was {{completely}} re-organized {{after the fall}} of Napoleon III and the Commune; the sergents de ville were replaced by the gardiens de la paix publique (Guardians of the Public Peace), which by June 1871 had 7,756 men under the authority of the Prefect of Police named by the national government. Following a series of anarchist bombings in 1892, the number was increased to 7,000 guardians, 80 brigadiers and 950 sous-brigadiers. In 1901, under the prefect Louis Lépine, in order {{to keep up with the}} technology of the time, a unit of policemen on bicycles (called the hirondelles after the brand of the bicycles) was formed. They numbered 18 per arrondissement and reached 600 by 1906 for the whole city. A unit of <b>river</b> <b>police,</b> the brigade fluviale, was organized in 1900 for the Universal Exposition, as well as a unit of traffic police who wore a symbol of a Roman chariot embroidered on the sleeve of their uniform. The first six motorcycle policemen appeared on the streets in 1906.|$|E
25|$|When two workmen noticed {{blood on}} the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot {{was found on the}} ice below, <b>river</b> <b>police</b> began searching the area for Rasputin's body. His body was found under the river ice on January 1st , {{approximately}} 200 meters downstream from the bridge. An autopsy was conducted by Dr. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon. The report that Kosorotov wrote was later lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds - one of which had been sustained at close range, and to the forehead - a slice wound to his left side, and many other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem. Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body, but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned. According to both Douglas Smith and Joseph Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs, and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect. Contrary to some later accounts that claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, Kosorotov found his genitals intact.|$|E

2500|$|Oscar Leroy (Eric Peterson) is Brent's grouchy, stubborn, {{occasionally}} senile elderly-stereotype father, {{the retired}} former owner of Corner Gas.

He often demands that the Dog <b>River</b> <b>police</b> arrest everyone who annoys him. He frequently, belligerently, points out to government workers: [...] "My taxes pay your salary!" [...] He tends to exclaim [...] "Holy hell!" [...] on encountering new or surprising things. He rivals Hank in his brain capacity and ability to make mistakes and the two are often shown scheming together. Oscar likes to show his handiwork around the house, but usually makes things worse when he tries to fix things. When Brent suggested selling Corner Gas to a huge company, Oscar replied [...] "How dare you - how dare you keep the Pump and Go people waiting, sell it, sell it now!", showing he didn't love his old job.|$|E

2500|$|In Shanghai, the [...] "Great Way Government" [...] set {{up its own}} {{police force}} to keep public order in the city {{following}} the retreat of the Nationalist Army after the Battle of Shanghai. The first police were established {{under the leadership of}} Zhang Songlin, the former Jiangsu provincial police commander. Taxes were levied on imports and exports to provide the funding for this new force. This new Shanghai police force accepted anyone, including former criminals that had been released by the retreating Nationalists, and thus it was considered totally unreliable by the Japanese. It was recorded of having committed many crimes and was encouraged to rob citizens of their money because they were paid almost nothing. The police often looked the other way when crimes were being committed by others in return for bribes. Efforts to improve its performance included the setting up of a cadet training course which took in 300 cadets. It grew from an initial strength of 64 men upon its creation in 1938 to 6,125 personnel by February 1939, and had 11 branch bureaus, 5 police stations, and 8 special units, including a training center, <b>river</b> <b>police</b> corps, and a hospital. The Shanghai police continued to function after the creation of Wang Jingwei's government and the dissolution of the Great Way municipal authority, and further increased to 7,501 as of January 1941.|$|E
