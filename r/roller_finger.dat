50|$|These engines {{like their}} DOHC {{predecessors}} feature bucket tappets {{in contrast to}} the <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers found on GM's other 4-cylinder engines.|$|E
5000|$|RFF - The Taurus/Sable/Escape version used <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> {{followers}} (RFF) {{instead and}} produced [...] at 5900 rpm with 207 lbft Nm of torque at 4400 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1997, the SOHC 2-valve 5.4 L has a {{cast iron}} engine block and {{aluminum}} cylinder heads. The 5.4 L features multi-port fuel injection, <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers, fracture-split powder metal connecting rods, {{and in some}} applications a forged steel crankshaft.|$|E
60|$|The Benzole {{is kept in}} a pint bottle. Sometimes {{paraffin}} or turpentine {{has been}} used instead; washing soda does not smell, but it dissolves the ink more slowly. They are otherwise nearly equally effective in cleansing the <b>rollers</b> and <b>fingers.</b> When dirty, the benzole can be rudely filtered and used again.|$|R
60|$|Rougher arrangements.--A small ball made {{by tying}} chamois leather round soft rags, {{may be used}} {{in the absence of a}} <b>roller.</b> The <b>fingers</b> are inked from the ball, over which the ink has been evenly distributed, by dabbing it many times against a slab or plate. This method gives good results, but is slow; it would be intolerably tedious to employ it on a large scale, on all ten digits of many persons.|$|R
40|$|An innovating {{solution}} for throttle-free load control for spark-ignition engines is Variable Valve Timing system (VVT System, or VVA - Variable Valve Actuation System). In {{this paper is}} presented an analytic method for kinematic analysis of the valve timing mechanism with three elements, which mainly includes the camshaft, the <b>roller</b> rocker <b>finger</b> and an intermediate rocker arm. This type of mechanism ensures a continuous valve lift (VVL System) between two extreme valve heights. It is also presented the numerical example for the variable valve lift mechanism’s motion...|$|R
50|$|These engines {{feature a}} {{light-weight}} cast-iron semi-closed deck engine block with an aluminum cylinder head. The valvetrain consists of chain-driven hollowcast dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) that actuate 4-valves per cylinder via <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers with hydraulic tappets. These engines also feature a 78 mm bore spacing and fracture-split connecting rods.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Ford of Brazil {{developed}} a cheaper {{version of the}} Zetec-S engine with single cam and 8 valves driven by a chain. As a result, this engine exhibits rougher behaviour, producing more vibration and noise. On the other hand, it has a superb torque output thanks to {{the addition of the}} Rocam (<b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> camshaft) feature.|$|E
50|$|The F154 V8 engines have a 90° angle {{between the}} {{cylinder}} banks, aluminium block and heads. The forced induction system uses two parallel twin-scroll water-cooled turbochargers supplied by IHI and two air-to-air intercoolers. The valvetrain consists of 32 valves actuated through <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers by two overhead camshafts per bank; the timing chain {{is located on}} the flywheel side. All versions feature gasoline direct injection and continuously variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust side.|$|E
50|$|On March 28, 1876 Baldwin {{lost his}} right arm in an {{industrial}} accident at the Paliuli mill. Trying to adjust the <b>rollers,</b> his <b>fingers</b> got stuck in the cane grinder, pulling in {{his right arm}}, and he almost died {{before it could be}} turned off and reversed to free him. A worker was sent to get the nearest doctor ten miles (16 km) away to do the amputation. Within weeks he learned to write with his left hand, and continued to play organ in his church with one hand. In a month he was riding horseback in his fields.|$|R

50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the <b>roller</b> member and <b>finger</b> followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the <b>roller</b> member and <b>finger</b> followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R
5000|$|The Coyote {{features}} all new 4V DOHC {{cylinder heads}} that have shifted the camshafts outboard, which {{allowed for a}} compact <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> follower setup with remote hydraulic valve lash adjusters and improved (raised) intake port geometry. The result is an intake port that outflows the Ford GT intake port by 4 percent and the Yates D3 (NASCAR) intake port up to 0.472" [...] (12 mm) lift, which is the maximum lift of the Coyote's intake cams. Engine redline is 7000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Clarke and his {{engineers}} studied engine designs {{from major}} European and Japanese automakers {{and sought to}} develop a V8 that was technologically advanced and power-dense, yet also dependable with no major service required before 100,000 miles of use. The initial engine design would implement a 90° vee-angle with a bore of 90.2 mm (3.552 in) and a stroke of 90 mm (3.543 in), resulting in a 4.6-liter (4601 cc, 281 CID) displacement and creating a nearly 1:1 bore-to-stroke ratio. This square configuration was chosen primarily for its positive noise, vibration and harshness characteristics. The engine would utilize features such as a chain-driven, single-overhead camshaft valvetrain with <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers, a deep-skirt cast-iron block construction and cross-bolted main bearings, all benefitting long-term durability. In the interest of reducing overall engine weight, aluminum-alloy heads and pistons would be standard and all major engine accessories would be mounted directly to the block, resulting in more complex block casting but {{eliminating the need for}} heavy mounting brackets. Tight construction tolerances were used in shaping the engine’s cylinder bores with narrow piston rings fitted to the engine’s pistons. This would serve to improve engine efficiency through reduced friction and reduce the engine’s oil consumption, while also promoting cleaner emissions.|$|E
5000|$|The F160 is a 60° V6 {{gasoline}} engine that displaces [...] It utilizes a turbocharger for each cylinder bank, twin intercoolers and direct injection. The engine is designed by Ferrari (loosely based on Pentastar engine block) and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, the engine blocks are cast and machined to Ferrari's approved specifications respectively in Chrysler's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari. This engine shares bore and combustion chamber design, the same valves control technology (i.e. <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers and four cam phasers), the same twin turbocharging approach and direct injection-ignition system with Ferrari F154 engine. The engine auxiliaries are identical (alternator, starter motor and power steering pump) or very similar (variable displacement oil pump). The difference of F160 from F154: F160 engine block {{is made by}} high pressure die cast (HPDC) process which is extremely suitable for high volume production. However, it is open deck type and can't endure to high specific power in HP/liter. F160 doesn't have an overboost function and is not used in Ferrari cars either (both F136 and F154 engines are used in Ferrari cars as well). Ferrari was responsible for design and bench testing of this engine.|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} of macadamia is {{the removal of the}} husk. Husk removal is normally accomplished on farm by mechanical dehuskers. Physical damage to macadamia kernel may result from postharvest handling of nuts, for example, from dehusking machines. There is currently limited information available on the effects of different dehuskers on the quality of macadamia kernel, particularly percentage of whole kernel recovered, âshoulder damageâ and production of pieces. Shoulder damage is tearing of the kernel around the apex region. There are two main types of dehusker in use in the industry. One is the âShawâ type, which employs a scrolled <b>roller</b> and spring-loaded <b>fingers.</b> Another is the âAdmacâ machine, which uses an auger working against rubber padding. We compared the effects of the two types of dehusker on nuts at high and intermediate moisture content (MC) using hand dehusking as a control. The aim was to compare the effect of dehuskers operating at a lower moisture content such as may be the case in very dry seasons and when there is a long time between harvest rounds...|$|R
40|$|Purpose For the {{application}} of less invasive robotic neurosurgery to the resection of deep-seated tumors, a prototype system of a force-detecting gripper with a flexible micromanipulator and force feedback to the operating unit will be developed. Methods Gripping force applied on the gripper is detected by strain gauges attached to the gripper clip. The signal is transmitted to the amplifier by wires running through the inner tube of the manipulator. Proportional force is applied on the finger lever of the operating unit by the surgeon using a bilateral control program. A pulling force experienced by the gripper is also detected at the gripper clip. The signal for the pulling force is transmitted in a manner identical to that mentioned previously, and the proportional torque is applied on the touching <b>roller</b> of the <b>finger</b> lever of the operating unit. The surgeon can feel the gripping force as {{the resistance of the}} operating force of the finger and can feel the pulling force as the friction at the finger surface. Results A basic operation test showed that both the gripping force and pulling force were clearly detected in the gripping of soft material and that the operator could feel the gripping force and pulling force at the finger lever of the operating unit. Conclusions A prototype of the force feedback in the microgripping manipulator system has been developed. The system will be useful for removing deep-seated brain tumors in future master-slave-type robotic neurosurgery. © 2013 CARS...|$|R
50|$|The engine's {{displacement}} is 1,598 cc {{and it has}} a bore/stroke {{ratio of}} 79.7/80.1 mm, attaining cylinder pressures of 180 bar and a compression ratio of 16:1. It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum bedplate, and am aluminum cylinder head. A chain-driven dual overhead camshaft with dual continuous variable cam phasing, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers. The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are cooled by under-skirt oil spraying. The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines.|$|E
