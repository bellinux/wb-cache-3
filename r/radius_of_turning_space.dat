50|$|This formula {{also shows}} that the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> {{decreases}} with the angle of bank. With a higher angle <b>of</b> bank the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> is smaller, and with a lower angle <b>of</b> bank the <b>radius</b> is greater.|$|R
50|$|For a wheel {{gauge of}} 1.5 m, no canting, a {{centre of gravity}} height of 3 m and speed of 30 m/s (108 km/h), the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> is 360 m. For a modern high speed train at 80 m/s, the {{toppling}} limit would be about 2.5 km. In practice, the minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> {{is much greater than}} this, as contact between the wheel flanges and rail at high speed could cause significant damage to both. For very high speed, the minimum adhesion limit again appears appropriate, implying a <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> about 13 km. In practice, curved lines used for high speed travel are superelevated or canted so that the turn limit is closer to 7 km.|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum speed}} a train can proceed around a turn {{is limited by}} the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn,</b> the {{position}} <b>of</b> the centre of mass of the units, the wheel gauge and whether the track is superelevated or canted.|$|R
50|$|Provided the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> is {{sufficiently}} great (as {{should be expected}} for express passenger services), two or three linked wheelsets should not present a problem.

50|$|Pilots {{should be}} aware that there are {{significant}} differences in obstacle clearance criteria between procedures designed in accordance with ICAO PANS-OPS and US TERPS.

50|$|The clutch-and-brake system, {{typical for}} lighter vehicles, was {{retained}} only for emergencies. Normally, steering depended on a double differential, Henschel's {{development of the}} British Merritt-Brown system first encountered in the Churchill tank. The vehicle had an eight-speed gearbox, and the steering offered two fixed <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>turns</b> on each gear, thus the Tiger had sixteen different <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn.</b> In first gear, at a speed of a few km/h, the minimal turning radius was 3.44 m. In neutral gear, the tracks could be turned in opposite directions, so the Tiger I pivoted in place. There was a steering wheel instead of either a tiller — or, as most tanks had at that time, twin braking levers — making the Tiger I's steering system easy to use, and ahead of its time.|$|R
50|$|The close {{association}} of the vehicle with its single rail, its inherent ability to bank on bends, and the reduced reliance on adhesion forces are all factors which are pertinent {{to the development of}} surface travel. In principle, steeper gradients and sharper corners may be negotiated compared with a conventional adhesion railway. Typical high speed train designs have <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> 7 km, with consequently few options for new routes within developed countries, where almost all of the land is under individual or corporate ownership.|$|R

The aircraft's other 272 passengers and 20 crew members survived.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} the monorail cited by Shilovsky is the suppression of hunting oscillation, a speed limitation encountered by conventional railways at the time. Also, sharper turns are possible compared to the 7 km <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> typical <b>of</b> modern high-speed trains such as the TGV, because the vehicle will bank automatically on bends, like an aircraft, so that no lateral centrifugal acceleration is experienced on board.|$|R

Since the wavelength increases with reducing taper, increasing the critical speed requires the taper to be reduced, which implies a large minimum <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the paper}} – {{is to create a}} {{measuring}} complex, develop a methodology and carry out experimental investigations of curvilinear movement of the Belarus 1802 crawler tractor. The measuring complex and methodology for determination of kinematics and forced parameters <b>of</b> crawler tractor <b>turning</b> ability have been developed. Experimental investigations of curvilinear tractor movement have been carried out and they have shown that an increase in its movement speed leads to a decrease in its actual angular speed. It is explained by an increase in a <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> tractor’s <b>turning.</b> While increasing a speed difference of crawler a torque of a running track is increasing and a torque of a lagging track is decreasing and it even takes a negative value. Having a towed load of 20 kH a lagging track thrust force is also decreasing but it does not pass in the are of negative values, in other words, both tracks move in a traction mode. A minimal <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> tractor <b>turning</b> is 1. 42 m. Relative minimal kinematics <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> is 0. 89 m. The created measuring complex and developed methodology for investigations are transferred to Separate Design Bureau of the Republic Unitary Enterprise «Minsk Tractor Plant» and they are used for experimental investigations of crawler tractors.  </p...|$|R

50|$|Steering was {{accomplished}} through a seven-speed AK 7-200 synchromesh gearbox, designed by Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen (ZF), and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by steering levers. Each gear had a fixed <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning,</b> ranging from 5 m for 1st gear up to 80 m for 7th gear. The driver {{was expected to}} judge the sharpness <b>of</b> a <b>turn</b> ahead <b>of</b> time and shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. The driver could also engage the brakes on one side to force a sharper turn. This manual steering was a much simplified design, compared to the sophisticated dual-radius hydraulically controlled steering system of the Tiger tanks.|$|R

50|$|Understeer and {{oversteer}} {{are defined}} by an understeer gradient K that {{is a measure of}} how the steering needed for a steady turn changes as a function of lateral acceleration. Steering at a steady speed is compared to the steering that would be needed to follow the same circular path at low speed. The low-speed steering for a given <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> is called Ackermann steer. The vehicle has a positive understeer gradient if the difference between required steer and the Ackermann steer increases with respect to incremental increases in lateral acceleration. The vehicle has a negative gradient if the difference in steer decreases with respect to incremental increases in lateral acceleration.|$|R
