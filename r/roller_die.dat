When roller dies are adopted, the drawing stages are composed by 2-4 idle rolls and the wire is pulled within the rolls clearance.

5000|$|Macuquinas, {{also known}} as [...] "cobs", were used heavily in local {{transactions}} in America, although their poor quality produced many complaints. Water-powered <b>roller</b> <b>die</b> and punch technology, capable of making high quality, round coinage was imported to Segovia, Spain from Germany in the 1580s, yet the old Royal mint at Segovia continued to make cobs. The Potosi Mint {{was the last to}} establish this advanced technology, making cobs until 1772. The macuquina's irregular shape invited clipping, leading to ever greater numbers of coins below legal weight. Clipped coin tended to migrate at a small profit in commerce to cities in need of coin (often those preparing a fleet for sail) where hard money was accepted at, or near, face value. In 1784 (by which time all macuquinas were over a decade old), King Charles III ordered macuquina in the Indies withdrawn and reminted. The order had to be reissued in 1789, but it remained unfulfilled {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E

Pole figures, inverse pole figures and orientation distribution functions were determined for final and intermediate wire diameters. The average fibre texture [110] is the most homogeneous in hydrodynamically drawn wires when compared to conventionally drawn wires and to wires drawn through roller dies. At an increase of the total reduction from 54. 3 % to 71. 5 %, the increase of the [110] fibre texture was observed for wires which were drawn hydrodynamically and conventionally.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the influence of the process parameters on non-conventional technology for drawing in cassette <b>roller</b> <b>die.</b> This technology combines two conventional methods of plastic deformation. The rolling, in this method the wire is passed through the two pairs of roller and, the drawing, using the drawing force that exist at the exit of the wire between the rolls. In conclusion there are two forces involved in the process of plastic deformation: drawing force and rolling force. It has been shown that these forces are strongly influenced by variation of certain process parameters such as: the initial diameter of the sample, the elongation coefficient, the contact surface roll/sample, the average pressure of rolling, the friction coefficient and the rollers working radius. The results depicts a helpful insight into the effects of the process parameters in the wire drawing with cassette <b>roller</b> <b>die,</b> thus furnishing the basic guidelines for process design and optimization...|$|E

5000|$|Karl (Charles) Moor, {{his older}} son, is a self-confident idealist. He is good-looking and well liked by all. He holds {{feelings}} of deep love for Amalia. After his father, misled by brother Franz, curses Karl and banishes {{him from his}} home, Karl becomes a disgraceful criminal and murderous arsonist. While he exudes a general spirit of melancholy about the promising life he has left behind, Karl, together with his gang of robbers, fights against the unfairness and corruption of the feudal authorities. His despair leads him to express and discover new goals and directions, and to realize his ideals and dreams of heroism. He does not shrink from breaking the law, for, as he says, [...] "the end justifies the means". He develops a close connection with his robbers, especially Roller and Schweizer, but he recognizes the unscrupulousness and dishonor of Spiegelberg and his other associates. Amalia creates a deep internal twist in the plot and in Karl's persona.

5000|$|This {{issue was}} printed from plates {{engraved}} in line engraving or taille-douce in sheets {{of one hundred}} each, in ten rows of ten. The imprint of the manufacturers is shown three times {{on each of the}} four margins. In the center of each margin is [...] "American Bank Note Co., New York", while {{in the center of the}} space on each side of this is [...] "COMPANIA AMERICANA DE BILLETES DE BANCO NUEVA YORK." [...] The imprints in Spanish are all in capital letters and those in English are in ordinary type. Each imprint extends for a space equal to the width of two stamps so that only the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th stamps of the outside rows on each sheet have no lettering adjoining. The plates all seem to have been [...] "laid" [...] down in the same manner the top rows, or at any rate the top stamp of each vertical row, being applied first. In all four cases a guide dot was engraved below the design on the transfer roll. Thus as each impression was applied to the plate it marked a dot below which served as a guide for the correct placing of the stamp in the succeeding horizontal row. When the last row was applied the dots appeared on the margin and these were not removed. On the <b>roller</b> <b>dies</b> for the 1/2rl. and 1 rl. this dot was placed 3.75 mm. distant from the center of the lower frame line of the design. Its position was such that the succeeding impressions failed to hide it and it always shows in the left side of the second O of CORREOS. In the 1/2rl. the dot is very conspicuous but in the 1rl. it is very small. In the 2rls. and 4rls. denominations the guide dot was 4.5mm. distant from the lower part of the design so that it is not often visible on the stamps.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{techniques}} for large space structures are discussed.

A space fabrication machine containing reels of flat sheet material and sets of <b>rollers</b> or <b>dies</b> is described, as is a machine for fabricating composite material (which must be heated for forming and then cooled to achieve structural strength). The use of fabrication machines to build such structures as space platforms, microwave radiometers, and satellite power systems is discussed. The versatility of the machine when operated in conjunction with the Space Shuttle and a set of jigs is illustrated by showing how large square solar panels and large hexagonal structures could be constructed.

25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary swaging machine, the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt swaging machine. A butt swaging machine works by having sets of wedges that close the dies onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular <b>rollers</b> and the <b>dies,</b> normally {{by the use of}} a foot pedal. A butt swaging machine can allow a workpiece to be inserted without the dies closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then the dies closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and the dies are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|R
25|$|A {{swaging machine}} works by using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of <b>rollers</b> cause all <b>dies</b> to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|R
