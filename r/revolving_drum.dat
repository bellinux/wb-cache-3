25|$|The {{original}} {{illuminating apparatus}} was an 1885, lenticular 3rd order lens, manufactured by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company of France. The central drum measured 1 meter in diameter. It had six panels of which three were flashing panels. In each {{panel of the}} central drum there were seven elements; each panel above central drum had eleven prisms and four prisms below. The flashes were produced by the central <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> mounted on a chariot activated by a clock work system. The clock cord descended through the central column in the stairway. The mechanism was protected by a circular iron and glass case. The original light characteristic showed a white flash every 3 seconds and had an 18-mile range. In 1923 the light characteristics were changed. In 1945 the light was electrified. It was also changed into an automatic, unwatched light that exhibited the original characteristics. The structure was abandoned and boarded up. The lens {{was replaced by a}} 500mm lens. No record has been found which indicates that major structural changes or alterations were introduced in the dwelling. The decorative elements are purely neo-classic especially its cornices and pediment.|$|E
2500|$|After taking {{notice of}} Joseph Plateau's {{invention}} of the phénakisticope (published in London as [...] "phantasmascope") British mathematician William George Horner thought up a cylindrical variation and published details about its mathematical principles in January 1834. He called his device the [...] "dædaleum", as {{a reference to the}} Greek myth of Daedalus. Horner's <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> had viewing slits between the pictures instead of above as most later zoetrope variations would have. Horner planned to publish the dædaleum with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it [...] "met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures".|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s, moving {{images were}} {{produced}} on <b>revolving</b> <b>drums</b> and disks, with independent invention by Simon von Stampfer (stroboscope) in Austria, Joseph Plateau (phenakistoscope) in Belgium, and William Horner (zoetrope) in Britain.|$|R

The Zoetrope, a.k.a., the Daedalum was a revolving cylinder {{which gave the}} illusion of motion to the pictures inside. Charles-Émile Reynaud developed an early animation device in 1877, which he called the Praxinoscope.|$|R
50|$|Flux Information Sciences were a three-piece noise {{rock band}} based in Brooklyn, New York City. The band {{was formed in}} 1996 by vocalist/guitarist Tristan Bechet (born in Portugal in 1973, raised in Brazil) and keyboardist Sebastian Brault (born in Madagascar, raised in France) who met in art school in Marseilles. A <b>revolving</b> <b>drummer</b> policy saw Derek Ethridge replace Phil Hernandez in 1999, who was in turn {{replaced}} by Siobhan Duffy. Eventually the band settled on the line-up of Bechet and Brault, with Christopher Pravdica on electronics.|$|R
2500|$|In 1901, Charvet {{opened a}} laundry at 3, , {{next to his}} store, {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the first established in Paris, a fact which later led some others to assume Charvet's laundry business had predated shirtmaking. It was advertised as applying Pasteur's and Grancher's principles. In 1903, Charvet moved his [...] "model laundry", to the , on premises belonging to the city of Paris, which specially authorized him in view of an innovative ozone-based process, then licensed to the Parisian hospitals. The soiled clothes, picked up at the customer's house by “special cars”, were disinfected and bleached with ozone, then placed in a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> worked by electricity and soaked in a [...] solution, in order to remove the starch and make the linen whiter, subsequently washed in soap and water, afterwards in a solution of ammonia to remove the soap, then whitened, starched, [...] and hand ironed. The process was considered a model both for the quality of the output and for the care taken of the health of the workers. A [...] "surprising" [...] amount of laundry was sent over by British customers. Like many other foreign customers, William Stewart Halsted and William H. Welch regularly sent their shirts to be laundered to Charvet in Paris. Promotional stamps were produced for this laundry business and became collectible. In 1906, a branch of the laundry was opened at 1, rue du Colisée, near the Champs-Élysées. During World War I, Charvet significantly reduced the price of its laundry services to keep sufficient work for all his employees. Towards the end of the war, the shortage of coal severely hit Charvet's laundry activity. The [...] "model laundry" [...] of place du marché Saint Honoré was discontinued in 1933 when the place was restructured.|$|E
2500|$|Single block {{wire drawing}} {{machines}} include means for holding the dies accurately in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the coil of wire being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the coil of wire may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum,</b> so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small screw clamp or vice. When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it is very important that the block rotates evenly and that it runs true and pulls the wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|E
6000|$|The {{rick was}} unhaled by full daylight; the men then took their places, the women mounted, {{and the work}} began. Farmer Groby--or, as they called him, [...] "he"--had arrived ere this, and by his orders Tess {{was placed on the}} {{platform}} of the machine, close to the man who fed it, her business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by Izz Huett, who stood next, but on the rick; so that the feeder could seize it and spread it over the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum,</b> which whisked out every grain in one moment.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} Gestetner further {{developed}} his invention, with the stencil eventually {{being placed on}} a screen wrapped around a pair of <b>revolving</b> <b>drums,</b> onto which ink was placed. The <b>drums</b> were <b>revolved</b> and ink, spread evenly {{across the surface of}} the screen by a pair of cloth-covered rollers, was forced through the cuts made in the stencil and transferred onto a sheet of paper which was fed through the duplicator and pressed by pressure rollers against the lower drum. Each complete rotation of the screen fed and printed one sheet.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{impregnation}} of spruce, {{the most}} important structural timber in large areas in Europe, has shown that unsatisfactory treatment depths have been achieved with impregnation. The maximum penetration of 2 mm {{is not sufficient to}} protect wood in weathered positions. The present-day incising machines consist essentially of four <b>revolving</b> <b>drums</b> fitted with teeth or needles or with lasers that burn the incisions into the wood. Preservatives can be spread along the grain up to 20 mm in radial and up to 2 mm in tangential and radial direction.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{operation}} of machines {{of this type}} was accomplished by means of pulling levers or knobs {{to set up the}} desired number. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division were accomplished by means of <b>revolving</b> <b>drums.</b> For addition they revolved in one direction, and for subtraction the direction was reversed. For multiplication the revolutions were repeated {{in the same direction as}} for addition, and for division they were repeated in the same direction as for subtraction. Two sets of dials provided a means of reading totals. In one the accumulation of totals appeared; in the other, there appeared the figure which was added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided."

6000|$|... "It {{works very}} nicely," [...] said Raffles Haw. [...] "It {{is quite a}} new thing--never before done, as far as I know. You see {{the names of the}} various wines and so on printed on the notes. By {{pressing}} the note down I complete an electric circuit which causes the tap in the cellars beneath to remain open long enough to fill the glass which always stands beneath it. The glasses, you understand, stand upon a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum,</b> so that there must always be one there. The glasses are then brought up through a pneumatic tube, which is set working by the increased weight of the glass when the wine is added to it. It is a pretty little idea. But I am afraid that I bore you rather with all these petty contrivances. It is a whim of mine to push mechanism as far as it will go." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{temple was}} a large, oblong hall, {{with a great}} figure of Buddha, cross-legged, imperturbable, enthroned in a niche at its further end, like the apse or recess in a church in Italy. Before it stood an altar. The Buddha sat and smiled on us with his eternal smile. A complacent deity, carved out of white stone, and gaudily painted; a yellow robe, like the Lamas', dangled across his shoulders. The air seemed close with incense and also with bad ventilation. The centre of the nave, if I may so call it, was {{occupied}} by a huge wooden cylinder, a sort of overgrown drum, painted in bright colours, with ornamental designs and Tibetan letters. It was much taller than a man, some nine feet high, I should say, and it revolved above and below on an iron spindle. Looking closer, I saw it had a crank attached to it, with a string tied to the crank. A solitary monk, absorbed in his devotions, was pulling this string as we entered, and making the cylinder revolve with a jerk as he pulled it. At each revolution, a bell above rang once. The monk seemed as if his whole soul was bound up in the huge <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> and the bell worked by it.|$|E
5000|$|The Series 1 {{vehicles}} (1974-85) were characterised by {{stainless steel}} {{front and rear}} bumpers, hydropneumatic suspension as compliant and soft as the DS, a [...] "spaceship" [...] style dashboard featuring a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> speedometer and similar tachometer. A similar version of the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> speedometer was used earlier in the 1958 Edsel for only one year.|$|E
50|$|In June 1954 IBM patent {{attorney}} A.J. Etienne sought Atanasoff's help in breaking an Eckert-Mauchly patent on a <b>revolving</b> magnetic memory <b>drum,</b> having been alerted by Clifford Berry that the ABC's <b>revolving</b> capacitor memory <b>drum</b> may have constituted prior art. Atanasoff agreed {{to assist the}} attorney, but IBM ultimately entered a patent-sharing agreement with Sperry Rand, {{the owners of the}} Eckert-Mauchly memory patent, and the case was dropped.|$|R

After the first typewriter was invented, a stencil was created which could be typed on, thus creating copies similar to printed newspapers and books, instead of handwritten material.|$|R
50|$|Baron Gruda informs Consuelo {{that she}} will now marry Herman (Eliot Makeham), the {{governor}} of Cobra, or he will execute the island's population. Consuelo is compelled to accept, and Gruda announces the wedding date and mandatory attendance by everyone. In the meantime Vallo, Ojo, and the clever professor escape their dilemma by capsizing their skiff, trapping a large air pocket for them to breath; walking along the sea bottom toward Cobra, they come ashore, where they quickly {{find out about the}} wedding. Vallo intends to rescue Consuelo, but the professor convinces him to first enlist the island's cooperation. Vallo agrees, and along with the professor's advanced knowledge, the people of Cobra build his advanced weapons for their coming revolt. Nitroglycerin grenades, multiple cannon tanks, flamethrowers, rapid-fire rifles on <b>revolving</b> <b>drums,</b> and a large inflatable balloon with gondola are constructed in secret.|$|R

50|$|In older printers, a corona wire {{positioned}} {{parallel to}} the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, projects an electrostatic charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photo conductor unit), a <b>revolving</b> photosensitive <b>drum</b> or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while {{it is in the}} dark.|$|R
50|$|The only {{stipulation}} of {{the draw}} was that no group could feature two South American teams. As a result, Pot B - which contained two South American teams - was initially drawn containing only the four Europeans, which were then to be immediately allocated to Groups 3 and 6 which contained the two South American seeds Argentina and Brazil. Once these two groups had been filled with the entrants from Pot B, then Chile and Peru would {{be added to the}} pot and the draw continue as normal. In the event, FIFA executives Sepp Blatter and Hermann Neuberger conducting the draw initially forgot this stipulation and immediately placed the first team drawn from this pot (Belgium) into Group 1, rather than Group 3 before then placing the second team drawn out (Scotland) into Group 3; they then had to correct this by moving Belgium to Group 3 and Scotland into Group 6. The ceremony suffered further embarrassment when one of the <b>revolving</b> <b>drums</b> containing the teams broke down.|$|R
25|$|Band {{members of}} {{regional}} rock band Chameleon included Adams on drums, vocals, and percussion; Yanni on keyboards and synthesizers; Dugan McNeill on lead vocals and bass guitars; Johnny Donaldson on all guitars; and Mark Anthony on lead vocals and keyboards. Their albums included Chameleon, Techno-color, Hologram Sky, and Balance. The group was noted for Adams' <b>revolving</b> gyroscope <b>drum</b> kit, who played his rapidly spinning drums before Mötley Crüe's Tommy Lee's similar arrangement.|$|R

30|$|Synthetic macro fibers will float {{towards the}} top, i.e. opening, of the inclined, <b>revolving,</b> mixing—truck <b>drum.</b> Accordingly, the {{concrete}} discharge batch will contain a higher amount of synthetic fibers per unit volume {{in the beginning}} of discharge than the average unit volume fiber content of the mix, and the content will gradually decrease further down the batch. Steel fibers, on the contrary, will tend to sink towards the bottom parts of the drum, thus causing the initial discharge samples to contain fewer steel fibers per unit volume than later samples (Nikolaisen 2010).|$|R
50|$|Chameleon is a late 1970s/early 1980s American {{rock band}} founded by Charlie Adams. Chameleon made Billboard charts and was renowned for Adams’ two-axis <b>revolving,</b> {{upside-down}} <b>drum</b> set, {{which he played}} in live concerts and on MTV. The band toured extensively (sponsored by the Miller Brewing Co.) performing up to 260 shows a year. Band members have included Adams, drums, vocals, and percussion; Yanni, keyboards and synthesizers; Dugan McNeill, lead vocals and bass guitars; Johnny Donaldson, all guitars; Mark Anthony, lead vocals and keyboards; Peter Diggins, lead vocals and main guitars; Donny Paulson, guitars, vocals.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, comedian Jan Murray {{created and}} hosted a {{variation}} for television, {{also known as}} Treasure Hunt. This US game show featured a pair of contestants answering questions to qualify {{to go on a}} treasure hunt that involved choosing from among thirty treasure chests that included anything from gag prizes to valuable merchandise and/or cash. The show also offered home viewers a chance of a treasure hunt, when a postcard was chosen from a large drum by a young guest who <b>revolved</b> the <b>drum</b> several times to randomise the entries. The show aired daily in the morning and once a week in the evening until 1959, when the networks began canceling game shows {{in the wake of the}} quiz show scandal.|$|R
5000|$|A {{kymograph}} (a Greek-derived name {{which means}} 'wave writer') is {{a device that}} draws a graphical representation of spatial position over time in which a spatial axis represents time. It basically consists of a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> wrapped with {{a sheet of paper}} on which a stylus moves back and forth recording perceived changes of phenomena such as motion or pressure.The kymograph was initially a mechanical and hydraulic device, invented by German physiologist Carl Ludwig in the 1840s, and found its first use as a means to intrusively monitor blood pressure. The blood pressure was conveyed by hydraulics and levers to move a stylus that scratched a white trace into soot-covered paper on the <b>revolving</b> <b>drum.</b> Time is represented by the drum's rotation rate, and was recorded by a further stylus driven by a clock or tuning fork. The kymograph almost immediately became the central instrument in physiology and physiology education. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, researchers and technicians devised many improvements to the device, plus numerous new sensory components, to measure a wide range of physiological phenomena such as breathing, muscle movement, speech. New detection and registration systems included electrical and electronic methods, and plotted in ink.|$|E
50|$|Developed by Carl Ludwig in the 19th century, the {{kymograph}} is a <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> {{on which}} a moving stylus tracks the size of some measurement {{as a function of}} time. The kymograph is similar to the polygraph, which has a strip of paper moving under one or more pens. The kymograph was originally used to measure blood pressure and it later was used to measure muscle contractions and speech sounds. In psychology, it was often used to record response times.|$|E
5000|$|William Dickson left Edison's {{company and}} formed his own company, that {{produced}} the mutoscope, a form of hand cranked peep show movie machine. These machines produced moving images, {{by means of a}} <b>revolving</b> <b>drum</b> of card illustrations, similar in concept to flip-books, taken from an actual piece of film. They were often featured, at seaside locations, showing (usually) sequences of women undressing or acting as an artist's model. In Britain, they became known as [...] "What the butler saw" [...] machines, taking the name from one of the first and most famous softcore reels.|$|E
50|$|The coal was to {{take the}} form of small {{granules}} instead of irregular lumps, to produce a controlled and even burn, and the basket was altered to a mesh <b>drum</b> <b>revolving</b> on a vertical axis at 60 rpm. A jet of flame from tanks of bottled gas would fire into the basket once the P.13a had reached operating speed (above 320 km/h), whether by using a rocket to assist takeoff or by being towed.|$|R
50|$|K-X-P {{was first}} called K-N-P, from Kaukolampi, Nykänen, Puranen.
