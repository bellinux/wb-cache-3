Crude marula oil was also found to have an ester content of 93. 7 %, acid value of 1. 4 mgKOH/g, and free fatty acid content of 0. 7 %. These results are marginally out of specifications for biodiesel by international standards, implying that crude marula oil is a potential substrate for biodiesel production...|$|E
30|$|To the {{stirring}} solutions of 41 (2  g, 2.17  mmol) in THF:MeOH- 1 : 1 (30  mL) {{was added}} Pd (10 %) on charcoal, and kept for stirring under hydrogen for 6  h at room temperature. After {{completion of the}} reaction (monitored by TLC), the reaction mixture is passed through celite pad and the celite pad is washed with THF-MeOH mixture (200  mL). The organic solvents were removed under vacuum, and the obtained white residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using DCM:MeOH:H 2 O- 17 : 7 : 1. The organic solvents were removed in the <b>rotavapor</b> and the aqueous solvent was removed by lyophilization to obtain the desired product 42 as white solid (0.94  g, 71 %). 1 H NMR (500  MHz, D 2 O, ppm): δ 7.84 (br m, 1 H), 6.32 (br m, 1 H), 4.60 (br m, 2 H), 4.16 (m, 3 H), 2.61 (m, 2 H), 2.39 (m, 2 H), 1.94 (s, 3 H), 1.72 (m, 2 H), 1.21 (m, 26 H, CH 2), 0.83 (s, 3 H, CH 3). 13 C NMR (500  MHz, D 2 O, ppm): δ 174.93, 165.58, 151.16, 136.86, 111.04, 85.69, 85.20, 84.89, 73.60, 71.08, 70.80, 65.06, 64.67, 40.54, 39.33, 35.21, 31.78, 29.70, 29.60, 29.28, 24.80, 22.46, 13.74, 11.86. 31 P NMR(500  MHz, CDCl 3): δ - 1.13, - 1.15.

30|$|The E. golondrina earlier {{identified}} (Ndam et al. 2014, 2015 a) {{was obtained}} in 2015 from the mount Bambouto caldera, SouthWestern Cameroon. The fresh {{leaves of the}} plant were cut, surface sterilised with 70  % alcohol and rinsed with sterile distilled water. The leaves were air-dried {{at room temperature for}} one month, mechanically ground to a fine powder by an electrical blender and further air-dried for 3  days. One hundred grams (100  g) of the powder was macerated in 1000  mL of acetone for 48  h three times under room temperature (22 – 25  °C). After filtering the resultant solution through a Whatman No. 1 grade filter paper, the filtrate was then concentrated to dryness under pressure at a maximum of 40  °C using a rotary evaporator (BUCHI <b>Rotavapor</b> R- 200, Switzerland). The concentrate was recovered with a minimum volume of dichloromethane and kept open at room temperature until all the residual solvent had evaporated. The dried crude extract was weighed, and kept in a bottle sealed with parafilm and stored at 4  °C until used. An aliquot of the extract was resuspended in acetone to yield a 100  mg/mL stock solution (Koduru et al. 2006). The yield (%, w/w) of the dried extract was calculated as: Yield (%) = (W 1  ×  100)/W 2, where W 1 is the weight of the extract after lyophilization of solvent, and W 2 is the weight of the plant powder.|$|E
30|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} under UV irradiation {{was measured}} using PC liposomes suspension. Unilamellar PC lipid vesicles were prepared by the extrusion method [31]. Briefly, appropriate amount of PC (25  mg/ml) in chloroform {{was placed in a}} flask and dried until complete chloroform evaporation using a rotary evaporator (<b>Rotavapor</b> R- 3, Buchi). The thin lipid-dyes film was then hydrated with 10.8  ml of double distilled water. The obtained lipid suspension was finally extruded through 100  nm pore size polycarbonate filter using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., USA). The concentration of PC was 1.2  mmol/L. For conjugated dienes formation test, 1  mL of the PC liposome suspension was mixed with 1  mL of VNPs water solution (MB water solution or VNPs–MB water solution). The final MB concentration was 10  μmol/L and VNPs, 1  g/L. PC concentration in the solutions was 0.6  mmol/L. The obtained aqueous solutions were placed in quartz cuvettes (10 [*]×[*] 10  mm) and irradiated with 250  W mercury lamp (band pass l[*]=[*] 310 – 400  nm, light flux was 43  W/cm 2) for 30  min. Then, the absorbance of the suspensions was recorded at 234  nm (conjugated dienes maximum) using a Specord 200 spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena, Germany). The concentration of conjugated dienes formed in water without any additives (NPs, MB, or VNPs–MB complexes) was taken as a control. Each experimental point was the mean value of at least three independent tests. Statistical processing was carried out using the software package Statistika v. 5.0 (StatSoft, USA).|$|E
