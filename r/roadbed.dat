5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less <b>roadbed</b> on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the <b>roadbed.</b> Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new <b>roadbed,</b> Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same <b>roadbed</b> as was tested on Track 1.|$|E
5|$|East of {{this station}} on the BMT side, the planned track {{connections}} to the Second Avenue Subway curved slightly north. After the tracks ended, the <b>roadbed</b> {{went on for a}} few hundred feet before ending. With the Second Avenue Subway connection, these tunnels now merge into the tunnels of Phase 1 of the IND Second Avenue Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{closed on}} September 23, 2005, for a two-year, $82.7 million renovation to accommodate light rail vehicles. The renovation included {{the installation of}} new rails, a lowered <b>roadbed</b> at stations for level boarding, new signalling systems and emergency ventilation. The tunnel reopened on September 24, 2007, and Link light rail service began on July 18, 2009, from Westlake station to Tukwila International Boulevard station.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} <b>roadbed</b> featured blind switchbacks and an 11% grade on {{the descent}} into Seven Mile canyon. The access road to Canyonlands National Park was rebuilt 1988, {{and the construction}} crews severely damaged SR-313 in the process. The highway was completely rebuilt, starting in 1989, to its modern form. The reconstruction reduced the maximum grade from 11% to 8% and re-graded the switchbacks to be on level ground to eliminate the blind corners.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the freeway from Morgantown to Hancock, several different routes carried traffic across the region. West Virginia Route73 (WV73) extended from Bridgeport to Bruceton Mills, serving regions now served by I-79 (Bridgeport to Morgantown) and I-68 (Morgantown to Bruceton Mills). After the I-68 freeway, then known as US48, was completed in West Virginia, the WV73 designation was removed. Portions of the road still exist as County Route73 (CR73, CR73/73, and CR857. Between I-68's exit10 at Cheat Lake and exit15 at Coopers Rock, I-68 was largely built directly over old WV73's <b>roadbed.</b>|$|E

As part of the renovation, the outdoor plaza at International District/Chinatown station was repainted with red accents, replacing the original pink, to better reflect the traditional colors of the neighborhood.

5|$|In 1989, an {{overpass}} {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete {{to shore up the}} <b>roadbed</b> and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was {{appointed}} {{to carry out the}} rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the <b>roadbed</b> at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad was {{completed}} between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854. During the 1880s, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was proposed {{to compete with}} the Pennsylvania. It received the backing of William Henry Vanderbilt, head of the New York Central Railroad (the Pennsylvania's chief rival). Andrew Carnegie also provided financial support, since he was unhappy with rates charged by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Construction began on the rival line in 1883, but stopped when the railroads reached an agreement in 1885. After construction halted, the only vestiges of the South Pennsylvania were nine tunnels, some <b>roadbed</b> and piers for a bridge over the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The <b>roadbed</b> was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E

25|$|The first {{track was}} {{completed}} in 1835, and freight service began immediately. The solid granite <b>roadbed</b> proved to be much too rigid, jolting the engine and cars nearly to pieces. Repairs on the locomotives (there were two at the time) would sometimes take most of the night, {{trying to get them}} ready for the next day's service. The much poorer Boston and Worcester Railroad could not afford a granite bed and so was built with modern wooden ties. This turned out to be far superior, so the owners of the Boston and Lowell decided they would upgrade their entire <b>roadbed</b> to wood when they added a second track.|$|E
