5000|$|A {{spoolbase}} is a shore-based facility used {{to facilitate}} continuous pipe laying for offshore {{oil and gas}} production. The facility allows the welding of single or double joints (40' or 80') of steel pipe of 4" [...] to 18" [...] diameter, into predetermined lengths for spooling onto a <b>reel</b> <b>lay</b> vessel.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{requirement}} {{of oil and gas}} resource becomes more and more severe, the offshore industry is moving into very deep waters. Different methods are adopted to install marine pipelines, such as S-lay and J-lay methods in deepwater and ultra-deepwater, and <b>Reel</b> <b>lay</b> is also considered but only for installation of small diameter pipe In view of deep water challenges, we need to solve demanding line pipe technology aspects, to develop a new and reliable installation technology for ultra deep waters and difficult sea bottoms, to find the suitable technological measures to tackle environmental hazards, typical of ultra deep waters. S-lay is useful and efficient pipe laying method, which has been proved in actual engineering, its pipe-lay capability is mostly depended on the stinger the pipe lays on when laying, and it still has many problems. In our laboratory, we have received one of the National Hi-Tech Research and Development Program (863) of China, and now studying the deepwater S-lay method and the stinger. To work on this project, the student is encouraged to focus on the following topics...|$|E

40|$|The reeling {{process is}} one of the most {{important}} methods for offshore installations of linepipes. Pipe segments are welded onshore and subsequently bent over a cylindrical rigid surface (<b>reel)</b> in a <b>laying</b> vessel. The pipe is significantly cyclically strained. Due to the severe loading cycles suffered by the pipes, it is necessary an adequate methodology to assess the integrity of these components. Current recommended methodologies were not specifically developed for reeling situations, If are straightforward applied unreliable results can be obtained. In the current work, the points that need to be resolved before extending the methods for assessing reeling situations are clearly identified. Theoretical models to describe the crack driving force evolution and the material fracture resistance behavior through strain cycles are proposed. As a result a methodology to assess the integrity of pipes subjected to a single reeling cycle is developed. The case where several reeling cycles are applied is considered. In addition to the fracture mechanics methodology, a fatigue crack growth formulation controlled by ∆J parameter is proposed. This formulation accounts for the crack growth produced during subsequent reeling cycles. In addition, a probabilistic fracture mechanics approach is included. This procedure takes into account the statistical distributions of the material properties and pipe geometry, using the Monte Carlo method. Two-parameter Weibull distributions were used to model the variability of the input parameters. Fatigue and fracture experimental programs were developed. Monotonic and cyclic fracture mechanic tests were performed on single edge notch in tension (SENT) specimens. As result, a general methodology for assessing the integrity of pipes under reeling condition was proposed...|$|R
