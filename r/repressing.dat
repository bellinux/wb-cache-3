5|$|Terminate {{aid to the}} ARVN Special Forces of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, {{who took}} his orders {{directly}} from the palace and not the army command. Tung had led the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 in which hundreds were killed and widespread physical destruction occurred. The Special Forces were used mainly for <b>repressing</b> dissidents rather than fighting communists.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Tung was a {{high-ranking}} official in Nhu's Cần Lao, a secret political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen. In 1960, Tung was promoted {{directly to the}} rank of colonel and became the commander of the special forces. His period at the helm of South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in <b>repressing</b> dissidents, rather than fighting the Viet Cong insurgents. His best-known attack was the raid on Xá Lợi pagoda on 21 August 1963, in which hundreds died or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|It was {{followed}} by almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major conflict occurred until the Crimean War. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included {{the formation of the}} Holy Alliance of reactionary governments intent on <b>repressing</b> revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former Holy Roman Empire into a German Confederation increasingly marked by the political dominance of Prussia. The bicentenary of Waterloo has prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for <b>repressing</b> dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch were ill-prepared {{to resist}} such an invasion. When Hitler came to power, the Dutch {{had begun to}} re-arm, but more slowly than France or Belgium; only in 1936 did the defence budget start to be {{gradually}} increased. Successive Dutch governments tended to avoid openly identifying Germany as an acute military threat. Partly this {{was caused by a}} wish not to antagonise a vital trade partner, {{even to the point of}} <b>repressing</b> criticism of Nazi policies; partly it was made inevitable by a policy of strict budgetary limits with which the conservative Dutch governments tried in vain to fight the Great Depression, which hit Dutch society particularly hard. Hendrikus Colijn, prime minister between 1933 and 1939, was personally convinced Germany would not violate Dutch neutrality; senior officers made no effort to mobilise public opinion in favour of improving military defence.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his autocracy and iron rule, Cẩn earned praise from Huế-based US {{officials}} for his relatively high levels of success against the Việt Cộng insurgency. Cẩn's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Cẩn created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam. The Popular Force was {{an alternative to the}} Strategic Hamlet Program which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu, who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vietcong cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support. Cẩn assumed a third or so of the rural peasantry were Việt Cộng sympathisers, significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within. Cẩn's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day. At night, they did defense patrols, using hit-and-run tactics against the Việt Cộng. According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam, the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force's personnel into the daily life of the village and the sense of security that the force provided. The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six-month deployments, allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot. Officials in Washington disagreed with the assessment of their subordinates in central Vietnam, alleging that Cẩn was mainly using the Popular Force for <b>repressing</b> dissidents.|$|E

The plasmid-borne promoters of both genes were <b>repressed</b> by chromosomal metJ. In addition, S 1 nuclease mapping of chromosomally derived mRNA from a derepressed strain revealed the start sites of transcription for metBL, metF, and metJ. The metBL and metF genes {{each had a}} single transcript which was <b>repressed</b> by metJ, while the metJ gene had three transcripts, of which the first was strongly <b>repressed</b> by metJ, the second was less strongly <b>repressed,</b> and the third was not <b>repressed...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Tup 1 and Ssn 6 {{proteins}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae form {{a general}} transcriptional repression complex that regulates {{the expression of}} a diverse set of genes including aerobically <b>repressed</b> hypoxic genes, a-mating type genes, glucose <b>repressed</b> genes, and genes controlling cell flocculence. To identify amino acid residues in the Tup 1 protein that are required for repression function, we selected for mutations that derepressed the hypoxic genes. Three missense mutations that accumulated stable protein were isolated, and an additional three were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant protein L 62 R was unable to complex with Ssn 6 or <b>repress</b> expression of reporter genes for the hypoxic and glucose <b>repressed</b> regulons or the flocculence phenotype, however, expression of the a-mating type reporter gene was still <b>repressed.</b> The remaining mutations fell within the WD repeat region of Tup 1.

The molecular weight of the DNA of the <b>repressed</b> fraction is approximately twice that of the active fraction. Moreover, the configuration of <b>repressed</b> chromatin is much more compact, consistent with a much larger sedimentation constant. The transcriptionally active fraction displays a 6 degrees lower melting profile and is highly susceptible to DNase I relative to the <b>repressed</b> fraction. The active fraction contains twice as much non-histone protein and 15 % less histone than the <b>repressed</b> fraction and is lacking the lysine-rich {{and much of the}} arginine-rich histones...|$|R

25|$|The lac operon of {{the model}} {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from <b>repressing</b> gene transcription. This {{is an example of}} the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model.|$|E
25|$|When men {{experience}} vulnerable {{feelings and}} other feelings {{that are associated}} with women, men can become frightened. According to Kierski (2007), the fear of the feminine then acts in two ways: a) Like an internal monitor to ensure that men stay within the boundaries of what is regarded as masculine, i.e. being action orientated, self-reliant, guarded, and seemingly independent; b) if a man fails to experience this and feels out of control, vulnerable or dependent, the fear of the feminine can act like a defence, leading to splitting off, <b>repressing,</b> or projecting those feelings.|$|E
40|$|Addition of 0. 1 % casein {{hydrolysate}} to a minimal growth medium decreased membrane-bound transhydrogenase activity in Escherichia coli by about 80 %. Of the amino acids added individually {{to the growth}} medium, only leucine and, to a lesser extent, methionine and alanine were effective, alpha-Ketoisocaproate- and leucine-containing peptides <b>repressed</b> the activity, and leucine also <b>repressed</b> activity in adenyl cyclase-deficient and relaxed strains. Derepression of transhydrogenase followed the removal of leucine from the growth medium and was sensitive to rifampin and chloramphenicol. A phosphoglucoisomerase-deficient strain that was forced to use the hexose monophosphate shunt exclusively had normal levels of transhydrogenase, which was <b>repressed</b> by leucine. Transhydrogenase activity doubled in mutants lacking either of the shunt dehydrogenases but was still <b>repressed</b> by leucine. In strains constitutive for the leucine biosynthetic operon, transhydrogenase was <b>repressed</b> by leucine but in strains livR and lst R, with leucine transport resistant to leucine repression, transhydrogenase was not <b>repressed</b> by leucine. These data suggest that transhydrogenase may have a function in the transport of branched-chain amino acids. In a hisT strain (which has altered leucyl-tRNA), transhydrogeanse was at a <b>repressed</b> level without the addition of leucine, suggesting that leucyl-tRNA {{may be involved in}} the regulation...|$|R
