40|$|Pulsed tandem gas metal {{arc welding}} (PT-GMAW) has the {{potential}} to increase productivity and minimize distortion in the fabrication of naval surface ship panels. In this study, the PT-GMAW process was used in pulse-pulse mode to butt joint weld 5 -mm DH 36, 8 -mm HSLA 65, 9. 5 -mm 350 WT, and 11 -mm HSLA 65 steel plate with ER 70 S- 6 wire in order to assess its suitability as a replacement for submerged arc welding (SAW) and {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW) in panel lines of Australian naval shipyards. In the pulse-pulse mode, the wire feed rates for the leading and trailing welding wires are set independently and they alternately transfer metal into a single molten weld pool at deposition rates almost comparable with single-wire SAW. Radiographic inspection and subsequent analyses of the 8 -, 9. 5 -, and 11 -mm single-bead butt joint welds unexpectedly showed varying degrees of weld-end solidification cracking, which occurred within ∼ 30 mm from the <b>run-off</b> <b>tab</b> and was different than weld crater cracking. The percentage of plates with solidification cracking was greater at larger plate thicknesses due mainly to increases in both the weld bead depth:width ratio and joint restraint as plate thickness is increased. Also, relatively low levels of nickel in the weld metal resulted in less severe solidification cracks compared with weld metal with higher levels of nickel. There was no evidence of solidification cracks in the 5 -mm welded plates. Potential strategies to overcome weld metal solidification cracking near the <b>run-off</b> <b>tab</b> in the PT-GMAW of steel are presented...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. Friction stir welding {{has been}} shown by {{previous}} investigators to have many advantages over traditional metal joining practices. Friction stir lap welds and friction stir spot welds {{have been shown to}} be stronger than rivets when joining materials of the same thickness. Substructures containing continuous lap welded joints have demonstrated increased load carrying capabilities over their riveted counterparts. In full-scale structures, however, continuous welds are not always an option. Welds may be interrupted by fixturing limitations, tooling restrictions, or stiffening members that cross the weld path. In these situations, a discontinuous lap weld would be necessary. The principal problem with a discontinuous weld is that the tool plunge and exit locations cannot be eliminated with a <b>run-off</b> <b>tab,</b> as in continuous welded structures. These plunge and exit locations are then subjected to operational loads. In fatigue applications, it has been demonstrated that cracks will initiate in the exit hole of a discontinuous weld. The purpose of this study was to investigate techniques to terminate a lap weld without compromising the structure by leaving an unprotected exit hole...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} project the feasibility was studied of finding {{an appropriate way}} of welding rings for a continuous variable transmission push-belt made out of strip material (- 10 mm wide, 0. 4 mm thick). The focus was on having the desired dimensions after welding {{in combination with the}} desired metallurgical and mechanica! properties. The wider aim of this project was twofold; firstly to obtain a higher quality in terms of a smoother surface of the rings, and secondly to reduce the casts of the production of the rings. The way of achieving these aims was by finding an appropriate welding process that could satisfy the geometrical and metallurgical demands set to the rings for the transmission push-belt. After a literature research different welding processes were tested including laser beam welding, electron beam welding, plasma are welding, upset welding, flash welding and 'mash resistance' welding. Same of these were tested with different experimental arrangements. These experiments were evaluated using optical microscopy, white light interferometry and hardness tests. The experiments were done on three different maraging steels the trade names which are Ultrafort, Durimphy and Phytime. The Ultrafort did not show similar behaviour to Durimphy and Phytime. This material proved to be less appropriate for this study, whereas Durimphy and Phytime are applicable for the transmission pushbelt. The latter two materials did not show metallurgical difficulties during welding. From these tests four welding processes were found to be applicable for the ring welding of a transmission push-belt. The first two processes are continuous wave laser beam welding and plasma are welding using two different experimental welding arrangements; a run-on and <b>run-off</b> <b>tab</b> at the start and end of the seam and the second arrangement involved welding different rings adjacent to each other (so called multiple ring welding). The last two processes applicable are upset welding and flash butt welding. Material Science and EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
