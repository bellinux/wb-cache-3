5|$|Interfamilial hybrids, such {{as between}} {{chickens}} and guineafowl or pheasants, are <b>reliably</b> described but extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{metatarsal}} of the Callao Man, <b>reliably</b> dated by uranium-series {{dating to}} 67,000 {{years ago is}} the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date. This distinction previously belonged to the Tabon Man of Palawan, carbon-dated to around 26,500 years ago. Negritos were also among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, but their first settlement in the Philippines has not been <b>reliably</b> dated.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} fourth {{race from}} the northwestern Caucasus, Anthus spinoletta caucasicus cannot be <b>reliably</b> separated from A.s. coutellii. The latter form {{is itself a}} potential new species, based on genetic data, appearance and a characteristic flight call.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2015) {{application}} of europium is in quantum memory chips which can <b>reliably</b> store information {{for days at}} a time; these could allow sensitive quantum data to be stored to a hard disk-like device and shipped around the country.|$|E
5|$|Two other Chroogomphus {{species with}} a {{morphology}} and coloration similar to C.vinicolor include C.rutilus and C.ochraceous. C.vinicolor is most <b>reliably</b> distinguished from these {{on the basis}} of having thick-walled cystidia (up to 5–7.5μm at the widest part). The other two species have been separated {{on the basis of}} color, with C.ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C.rutilus. Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C.rutilus is restricted to Europe, C.ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be <b>reliably</b> used for species determination.|$|E
5|$|A. p. kleinschmidti is {{sometimes}} {{merged with the}} nominate form, A. p. petrosus. The suggested subspecies A. p. meinertzhageni on South Uist, A. p. hesperianus on the Isle of Arran, and A. p. ponens in northwestern France cannot be <b>reliably</b> separated from the nominate form. There is a geographical trend in appearance, with longer-billed, darker birds at {{the western end of}} the range, and shorter-billed, paler individuals in the east.|$|E
5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished <b>reliably</b> using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have clamp connections {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila, {{commonly}} known as the tumbling puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. A temperate species, it is widely distributed in North America, where it grows on the ground on road sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila closely resembles the European B.nigrescens, from which it can be <b>reliably</b> distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It {{may be difficult to}} distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be <b>reliably</b> differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), as well as the elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rafflesiana {{is one of}} the {{few other}} Nepenthes species <b>reliably</b> {{documented}} as having caught mammalian prey in its natural habitat. In Brunei, frogs, geckos and skinks have been found in the pitchers of this species. The remains of mice have also been reported. On September 29, 2006, at the Jardin botanique de Lyon in France, a cultivated N. truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse.|$|E
5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, and the two can only be <b>reliably</b> distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|Research {{from the}} late 1990s {{indicated}} there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed <b>reliably</b> without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of AS {{is complicated by}} the use of several different screening instruments, including the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (previously called the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test), Gilliam Asperger's disorder scale (GADS), Krug Asperger's Disorder Index (KADI), and the Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ; with versions for children, adolescents and adults). None have been shown to <b>reliably</b> differentiate between AS and other ASDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced no means of <b>reliably</b> dating {{the construction of the}} site. Wainwright suggested that the ring was Early Bronze Age on the basis of other, dated circles in Britain. Based on his analysis of the site's stratigraphy, he argued that the stones had likely been removed from their original position amid agricultural development {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|The ornatus {{morphotype}} is most <b>reliably</b> {{distinguished by}} its longer fur, averaging 26.8mm compared to 22.4mm in javanicus. Other distinguishing characteristics include overall color (generally light brown in ornatus compared with brown to reddish in javanicus), {{and amount of}} brown coloring in the fur (ornatus has less brown than javanicus, resulting in a lighter-colored ventral region).|$|E
5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} tame {{frigatebirds}} being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific. A bird {{that had come}} from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be <b>reliably</b> trusted to return to its original home, hence would {{be used as a}} speedy way to relay a message there. There is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be <b>reliably</b> identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be <b>reliably</b> identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|There {{were about}} 100 <b>reliably</b> {{reported}} deaths from spider bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses, {{which would make}} it more difficult to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E
5|$|To {{have reached}} its {{enormous}} size within its relatively short (geologically speaking) 600,000 to 1,000,000 years of life, Mauna Loa would logically {{have had to}} have grown extremely rapidly through its developmental history, and extensive charcoal-based radiocarbon dating (perhaps the most extensive such prehistorical eruptive dating on Earth) has amassed a record of almost two hundred <b>reliably</b> dated extant flows confirming this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|To <b>reliably</b> {{enable a}} charge-only feature, modern USB {{accessory}} peripherals now include charging cables that provide power {{connections to the}} host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that supply power from a converter device and do not include a host device and data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable.|$|E
5|$|Wyn died in 1967, and {{the company}} grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors <b>reliably.</b> Without {{money to pay the}} signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed {{contracts}} to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been <b>reliably</b> confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can <b>reliably</b> be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been <b>reliably</b> reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be <b>reliably</b> {{distinguished}} from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting <b>reliably</b> supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August is {{the annual}} American celebration of Labor Day, the only holiday weekend during this period. Of all the year's holiday {{weekends}} it is <b>reliably</b> the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 Rob Zombie-directed reimagining of Halloween, at $30.5 million. The Sixth Sense, then in its fourth week, is a close second after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's The Possession with $21.1 million.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing <b>reliably</b> in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period. The term was {{initially}} coined {{to refer to}} anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that {{were responsible for the}} island's Mesolithic 'Balangoda Culture'. The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest <b>reliably</b> dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so <b>reliably</b> susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species for the presence of the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Boletus caucasicus, {{found in}} {{southern}} Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, {{in contrast to}} the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S.luridus. Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most <b>reliably</b> distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which have been reported to be as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed Boletus barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been <b>reliably</b> identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the high-speed Gardermoen Line from Oslo, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, to Eidsvoll, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional high-speed lines west and southeast of Oslo. The Asker and Follo Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel faster and more <b>reliably</b> to Drammen and Ski, leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains, and commuter trains making frequent stops. Construction of the Follo Line will, at the earliest, be completed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not <b>reliably</b> stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to <b>reliably</b> describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{the longest}} {{reported}} were three 22.9m (75ft) males, two caught off California between 1919 and 1926 {{and the other}} caught off Alaska in 1925, and a 24.7m (81ft) female also caught off California, while the longest <b>reliably</b> measured were a 21m (69ft) male caught off British Columbia in 1959 and a 22.9m (75ft) female caught off central California between 1959 and 1970. Whales historically seen in Yellow Sea could have been distinct from outer Pacific populations due to their smaller size of around 20m or more at near maximum, and breeding season in these regions was mainly in winter.|$|E
