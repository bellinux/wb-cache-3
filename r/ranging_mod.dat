Uranium phases in soils from two sites at a UK firing <b>range,</b> <b>MOD</b> Eskmeals, were characterised by electron microscopy and sequential extraction. Uranium rich particles with characteristic spherical morphologies were observed in soils, consistent with other instances of DU munitions contamination. Batch extraction efficiencies for aqueous ammonium bicarbonate (42 – 50 % total DU extracted), citric acid (30 – 42 % total DU) and sulphuric acid (13 – 19 % total DU) were evaluated. Characterisation of residues from bicarbonate-treated soils by synchrotron microfocus X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed partially leached U(IV) -oxide particles and some secondary uranyl-carbonate phases. Based on these data, a multi-stage extraction scheme was developed utilising leaching in ammonium bicarbonate followed by citric acid to dissolve secondary carbonate species. Site specific U extraction was improved to 68 – 87 % total U by the application of this methodology, potentially providing a route to efficient DU decontamination using low cost, environmentally compatible reagents...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring of {{wetlands}} and water bodies in semi-arid African regions is of high {{importance for the}} local population and for wetland ecology. The study area is situated in Burkina Faso, West Africa, and extends over an area of 500 km north-southwards, ranging from Sahelien to Savannah climates, and showing a gradient of different rainfall and land use characteristics. Surface water is an important resource for different livelihoods such as farmers or herders, {{as well as for}} water extraction by the local population, and can be scarce particularly in seasons of drought. This study demonstrates the applicability of time series of optical remote sensing data for dynamic water body mapping on a high temporal and medium resolution spatial scale. The main dataset is a 15 -year time series (2000 - 2014) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) with temporal intervals of eight days and 250 m spatial resolution bands in the red and near infrared <b>range</b> (<b>MOD</b> 09 Q 1 product), supported by further information from the 500 m resolution MOD 09 A 1 product, and the digital elevation model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). RapidEye and Landsat high resolution optical images are available for different seasons in different years, and serve for exploring trends on a higher resolution scale, as well as for validation of the results derived from MODIS. Spatio-temporal dynamics of water covered areas have been obtained, showing intra-annual variations as well as dynamics throughout the 15 -year time series. Trends reveal changing flooding regimes in terms of larger water coverage while the flooding duration decreased. These findings correspond to information gained during field work, and is connected to siltation {{on the bottom of the}} water bodies. Caused by dam constructions 21 newly created water bodies larger than 0. 5 km², and a number of smaller water bodies were discovered, as well as a few water bodies that have vanished. Secondary applications such as detecting irrigation trends around wetlands from MODIS vegetation indices could be verified using high resolution RapidEye and Landsat data, and vegetation indices can aid for wetland delineation of vegetation covered wetlands. The negative anomalies of both, surface water dynamics {{of wetlands}} and vegetation of the environment, were found to coincide with the occurrence of drought seasons (2000 - 01, 2004 - 05 and 2011 - 12). Possibilities and limitations for extending this approach over larger areas are discussed, and challenges such as mapping sediment rich waters, vegetation covered waters, or misclassifications due to cloud shadows or burnt areas are addressed. This study demonstrates the potential to detect and monitor water bodies and wetlands in semi-arid African regions, and contributes to the understanding of inter- and intra-yearly dynamics, based on a time series of medium resolution MODIS data. Additionally, the role of wetland monitoring for both, estimating water availability and indicating drought in semi-arid areas is discussed. An outlook on an adapted concept using Sentinel- 3 data is presented. The study shows that the use of remote sensing time series is a suitable tool to monitor wetlands in semi-arid regions...|$|R

Sample ages ranged from 1 to 13 years in the female data. Parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function were estimated using nonlinear regression from back-calculation, mean length of samples at age relationships, and otolith weight-at-age relationships. Best-fitting value of the three methods was the otolith weight-at-age relationship (r 2 =. 87). Parameters of otolith weight-at-age were estimated as L∞ = 143. 76 cm, K = 0. 081, and t 0 = − 1. 285.

A corollary of the Metastability Theorem and the Localization Theorem of the second author is that the map / „ induces an isomorphism on homology after inverting o |. In this paper we carry over to odd primes p certain ideas of Mark Mahowald [7], Our goal {{is to establish a}} metastable <b>range</b> for the <b>mod</b> p unstable Adams 7 s 2 -term for an odd-dimensional sphere. To be more specific, visualize the £ 2 -term displayed in the (a, s) -plane, where a = stem degree and s = homological degree. Then we show that above a line of slope l/ 2 (p 2 — 1) and a-intercept 2 p(p — l) n minus a constant independent of n, the obstructions to double suspension being an isomorphism lie in the stable £ 2 -term for the mod p Moore space S ° Upex. As in [7], we {{work with the}} Ex-term for spheres and for the stable Moore space given by the " lambda algebra " ([2], as corrected in [3]). This material is reviewed in § 1. Thus, we have complexes A(2 « + 1) and inclusions A(2 « — 1) C A(2 n + 1), such that H(I 2 n + 1)) is the E 2 -term for 52 "+ 1 and the inclusion induces the £ 2 -level of a map of spectral sequences compatible at Ex with the double suspension homomorphism. Also, if H^. (S ° Up e 1) = M(0), there is a differential bigraded algebra M(0) ® A serving as a stable Adams £,-term for the Moore space.

40|$|The {{influx of}} new digital media {{technologies}} and platforms {{have made it}} possible for consumers of media products to more easily create and distribute their own works, which breaks away from the traditional production of culture of media by established, professional creators. Consequently, there has been a rise in the immaterial labor of digital media creators, as well as a formation of online communities of disparately connected users through commonly held interests. Within the medium of video games, this convergence between user and producer of content, the tension between control and innovation of media content and form, online communities and immaterial labor is most clearly seen in the practice of modding, here defined as using legally authorized software to modify video game content. Modding for computer games has been occurring since the early 1990 s, and has grown considerably due to the expansion of the internet 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities for connecting people and distributing large bands of data. In 2012, Skyrim developers Bethesda Softworks released a free software development tool called the Creation Kit. The Creation Kit allowed computer users to modify the game content, at which point the user could publically release their mods through the authorized Steam Workshop Channel. The Creation Kit was distributed via Steam, an electronic digital games store operated by Valve Corporation, Inc. Because Bethesda required users to play Skyrim through Steam, the Steam Workshop Channel was intended to be the primary distribution and gathering location of the modding community for Skyrim. However, most existing modders already had many previously established third-party modding databases and websites for distribution, which meant that the Steam Workshop Channel was a new and forced entry into the modding community. Using a combination of ethnographic methods (participant observation and interviews) and textual analysis of message board data, and in research gathered between September 2013 and January 2014, this dissertation explores the community dynamics of the modders on the Steam Workshop Channel for Skyrim to help locate the identity politics of the community, as well as navigating the tension between innovation and control within the community. It also explores how a digital media producer attempts to control a space of fan-made production, and what that means for the existing community. I participated and observed conversations on modding community dynamics in specific forums on the Steam Community Workshop for Skyrim. There, I gathered textual data from a diverse sample of conversations located on discussion boards and a diverse set of <b>mods</b> <b>ranging</b> in user-defined ratings (high-rated to low-rated) to highlight the conversational dynamics and implicit and explicit structuring of the community. I gathered materials from over 403 relevant conversation threads on the Steam Community Workshop for Skyrim. I also conducted telephone, web and email interviews with a purposive sample group of 15 modders based on their ranking in the community in order to gather their personal motivations for participating in the group and perceptions of norms, rituals and values in the group. Results indicate that modding communities are hierarchized by historically locating the user within the practice, as well as through extensive technical knowledge and frequency of communication. Heavy users and mod creators separate themselves from 2 ̆ 2 non-modders 2 ̆ 2 or mod users through these practices, defining their identities through discourse and the values of creation. The Steam Workshop Channel was a collision between mod creators and non-modder users, sometimes with clashing ideologies that dissuaded heavier users from fully embracing the Steam Workshop. This study illustrates how Bethesda and Valve were perceived by existing modders, and suggests that companies need to pay attention to how historically located communities of users respond to the actions, policies, membership, and moderation of professional media consumers...|$|R
