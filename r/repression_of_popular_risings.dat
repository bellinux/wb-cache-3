In many ways it resembles our Government of India. Like that Government, it stands for civilization, for education, sanitation, and Western ideas of progress; it is composed in the main of honest and hard-working men, who despise those whom they govern, but believe themselves possessed of something valuable which they must communicate to the population, however little it may be desired. Like our Government in India, they live in terror <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>risings,</b> and are compelled to resort to cruel repressions {{in order to preserve}} their power. Like it, they represent an alien philosophy of life, which cannot be forced upon the people without a change of instinct, habit, and tradition so profound as to dry up the vital springs of action, producing listlessness and despair among the ignorant victims of militant enlightenment. It may be that Russia needs sternness and discipline more than anything else; it may be that a revival of Peter the Great's methods is essential to progress. From this point of view, much of what it is natural to criticize in the Bolsheviks becomes defensible; but this point of view has little affinity to Communism. Bolshevism may be defended, possibly, as a dire discipline through which a backward nation is to be rapidly industrialized; but as an experiment in Communism it has failed.|$|R

Eventually, as we know, perfectly respectable citizens and earnest philanthropists connived at the September massacres because hard experience had convinced them that if they contented themselves with appeals to humanity and patriotism, the aristocracy, though it would read their appeals with the greatest enjoyment and appreciation, flattering and admiring the writers, would none the less continue to conspire with foreign monarchists to undo the revolution and restore the old system with every circumstance of savage vengeance and ruthless <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> liberties.|$|R

In his letter, Hu avers that since the founding of New China in 1949 China has made steady progress in the protection of human rights according to China’s “national situation” culminating in the solemn enshrinement of the principle of respect and protection of human rights in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China and the state constitution of the PRC. The letter was read out by the Vice-Director of Party’s “Publicity Department” a. k. a. Propaganda Department concurrently the head of the Central Committee’s office for foreign propaganda and the State Council Information Office Wang Chen. This symposium and Hu’s letter took place against the background of “Charter 2008. ” This document, (modeled on the Charter 77 movement of led by the dissident Czech playwright and later president Vaclav Havel in 1977) was signed by 303 well-known intellectuals, legal practitioners and human rights activists, from the length and breadth of China.

This study investigates the development of political conflict in the city of Narbonne between 1848 and 1871. These two dates were not chosen arbitrarily: 1848 marked the introduction of republicanism among the city's masses while the Narbonne Commune of 1871 represented the most dramatic and bold episode <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> militancy in the city during the nineteenth century. The link between these dates was the Second Empire, a period of massive social and economic change in France. Many historians have argued that the socio-economic transformations of the Second Empire also modernized the nature of political conflict in France. This study of Narbonne demonstrates that the relationship was not as straight-forward as the above argument suggests. Narbonne experienced profound economic and social change during the Second Empire. Yet this change reinforced the traditional artisan work structure of the city and, when combined with government <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> political activity throughout most of the Second Empire, preserved the ideological goal of militants during 1848 - 51, the establishment of the republique democratique et sociale. In this sense, the Narbonne Commune did not represent a radical new step in the development of working class consciousness. It was rather a continuation of a struggle that had started with the proclamation of the Second Republic. However, this struggle had changed in one important respect during these twenty years. In 1848 the popular movement had been guided by a small group of bourgeois republicans. They also led the resurgence of open republic agitation in Narbonne in the late 1860 s when the government of Napoleon III began to loosen its repressive grip on all independent political activity. But after the fall of his regime in September 1870, the alliance between republican notables and the city's popular class fell apart. The Commune of the following spring thus marked the first manifestation of independent republican militancy by Narbonne's popular class. Herein lies the insurrection's importance, but also its weakness...|$|R

After the second (Bolshevik) revolution of 1917, the Bolshevik government instituted War Communism (1918-21), sending officials through the peasant lands of central Russia to collect supplies that the state {{needed in order to}} sustain the military and to begin building a socialist economy. Common targets for official requisitioning included recruits for the Red Army, horses, and grain. (From 1929 [...] collectivization - which required relocation and novel farming techniques - angered peasants who were hardly predisposed to leave their home and adopt a new way of life when they were already struggling to survive.)

The official policies inflamed passions, and their harsh implementation engendered widespread resentment to the Bolshevik regime.

Two intermediary issues were published during the actual revolutionary events, on December 23 and 24 respectively, under the title Scînteia Poporului ("The People's Spark"), which, while still displaying the old communist symbolism, published appeals issued by the provisional post-communist leadership forum, the National Salvation Front (FSN). As one of its first measures, the new editorial board dismissed members of the staff who were discredited for having openly supported the last communist ruler, Nicolae Ceauşescu, replacing them with journalists sympathetic to the FSN. Soon after Ceauşescu's execution, the gazette began serializing Red Horizons, a volume of recollections exposing the defunct regime, authored by Ion Mihai Pacepa, a defector and former spy chief.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the Cornish language and officialdom over the past thousand years. The social status of Cornish is examined along with attitudes towards the language held by monarchy, government and their agencies. During the middle-ages, Cornish was relatively stable and indeed enjoyed some prestige amongst the gentry who used Cornish as their preferred language for family mottoes. However, following the Tudor accession, the number of Cornish speakers was greatly reduced following the brutal <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> several <b>popular</b> uprisings when a significant proportion of the Cornish speaking population were exterminated. During the 17 th and 18 th centuries, Cornish continued to be used amongst the poor in Cornwall's fishing communities. The revival of Cornish began around 1900 and the number of speakers grew throughout the 20 th century. Nevertheless, the government and state education system provided no support for Cornish language learners until 2002 when the European Union granted Cornish official “minority language” status under Part II of the 1992 Council of Europe Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. In 2005, the government confirmed modest funding support for the Cornish language. Local government in Cornwall are currently implementing a Cornish language strategy to determine a standard written form for Cornish {{that can be used for}} official purposes, such as signage, and for education in schools. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Durban-Westville, 1996. Statistics {{suggest that}} there are {{approximately}} 15 million educationally deficient adults in South Africa (Population Census, 1991). Given the widespread extent of educational deficiency among black adults, and the weak adult education base that exists currently, the study is formulated on the notion that alternative adult education provision can serve as a vehicle to transform the educational status of this sector. Methodologically the study is a theoretically based one, with a component of empirical analysis which utilizes census data and secondary analysis. The study applies radical theory to develop a historical perspective of the socio-political conditions of black schooling which were characterized by inadequate access, high drop-out rates, widespread failure, and a low quality of provision. Despite periodic expansionist and reformist strategies black educational provision remained inadequate and inferior. Four changing reformist strategies which reflect contradictory aspects are identified during the period 1953 - 1990, namely self-help (1953 - 1963), black education and the bantustan strategy (1963 - 1973), educational reform for economic expansion and political stability (1973 - 1983), and the <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> mobilization (1983 - 1990). It is in this context that the widespread extent of educational deficiency among black adults is interpreted as a consequence of poor educational provision within specific socio-political circumstances. In advancing a critical theory of schooling, the study utilizes a marxist paradigm reflecting deterministic, voluntaristic, and autonomous functions of the black education system in South African society. These changing roles of the educational system have reflected dominant theoretical positions in particular sequence, namely reproduction (1800 s- 1975), resistance (1976 - 1990), and transformation (1990 onwards). This critical theory of schooling is further contextualized to serve as a basis to transform adult education provision, so that it may effectively address the needs of the educationally deficient adult population. To achieve this, the study proposes that adult education provision must be reformulated along the lines of critical literacy and cultural power. An indepth analysis of adult education as a field of study is provided, focusing on definitions, issues relating to content, purpose, and practice, ideological debates, strategies, purposes, providers, target groups, and factors affecting participation and recruitment. The main conclusions of the study relate to the conditions of the black schooling system as a contributory factor in black adult educational deficiency, the extent of adult educational deficiency, sociological implications, and current educational provision in South Africa. The recommendations of the study focus on transforming initial basic educational provision, developing a culture of learning, and the implementation of a policy of adult education...|$|R

40|$|The Cornish miracle plays {{were written}} in the Cornish {{language}} in the late 15 th and early sixteenth centuries. On the surface, these plays might appear to merely relate stories from the Bible {{and the lives of}} certain Saints. Underneath, however, lies a smouldering resentment of the tyranny and genocide following brutal <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> two <b>popular</b> uprisings: the 1497 rebellion against Henry VII’s poll tax and the rebellion 4 months later in support of Perkin Warbeck’s claim to the throne. As a result of these insurrections, a significant proportion of the Cornish speaking population were exterminated. In the miracle play, Passio Domini, written in the Cornish language shortly after 1497, Jesus {{is referred to as the}} Son of Joseph the Smith. This reference to ‘the Smith’, alludes to Michael Joseph a smith of St. Keverne who was one of the leaders of the first 1497 rebellion. Code-switching further reinforces the allusion; when Christ’s torturers speak phrases of English. Two other Cornish plays, Bewnans Ke, the Life of St Kea, and Beunans Meriasek, the Life of St Meriasek, depict a pagan tyrant King Teudar, persecutor of Christians, and namesake of Henry Tudor. In Beunans Meriasek, St Meriasek is driven out of Cornwall by King Teudar, a self-styled “reigning lord in Cornwall”, “prince”, “emperor”, “governor” and “conqueror”. As a result, Teudar is pursued by the Duke of Cornwall who calls Teudar a “tyrant of unbelief”and an “alien”, and challenges Teudar’s right to be in Cornwall at all. In Bewnans Ke also we find Teudar referred to as a pagan tyrant. In these plays, much use is made of code-switching, with sentences of English being spoken by torturers and by Teudar. Lexical choices between synonyms of differing etymologies subtly convey nuances of attitudinal meaning and power relations...|$|R

Thus, two pharmacologically distinct mechanisms <b>of</b> glucocorticoid-dependent <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> prostaglandin E- 2 release are revealed. First, glucocorticoid-dependent <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid is mimicked by RU 486 and, second, <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> COX/PGES is antagonized by RU 486. Finally, whilst all compounds induced glucocorticoid receptor translocation, no role for glucocorticoid response element-dependent transcription is supported in these inhibitory processes and only a limited role for glucocorticoid-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB in the <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> COX- 2 is indicated...|$|R
