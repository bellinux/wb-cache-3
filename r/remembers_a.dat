25|$|One of {{the primary}} sources for the scare was Michelle <b>Remembers,</b> <b>a</b> 1980 book by the Canadian {{psychiatrist}} Lawrence Pazder in which he detailed what he claimed were the repressed memories of his patient (and wife) Michelle Smith. Smith had claimed that as a child she had been abused by her family in Satanic rituals in which babies were sacrificed and Satan himself appeared. In 1983, allegations were made that the McMartin family—owners of a preschool in California—were guilty of sexually abusing the children in their care during Satanic rituals. The allegations resulted in a lengthy and expensive trial, in which all of the accused would eventually be cleared. The publicity generated by the case resulted in similar allegations being made in various {{other parts of the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|He {{was often}} left {{to fend for}} himself, getting into many fights without the {{supervision}} or guidance of his parents. Shamrock's father abandoned his family and when Shamrock was five years old, his mother, Diane Kilpatrick, now divorced from his father, remarried an Army aviator named Bob Nance. The newly formed family moved to Napa, California, Nance's hometown. Shamrock and his brothers were outsiders in this community, coming from a poor background and speaking in a Southern accent, they continued to cause trouble and get into fights and also began using drugs. Nance, who had fought in the Vietnam War, {{became a member of}} the local fire department and also found work in roofing and upholstery. Shamrock became involved and excelled in sports at a young age, playing in Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. Nance <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> veteran coach telling him that he had never seen a player with as much heart and tenacity as the young Shamrock. Shamrock was not as involved with drugs as his brothers, such as his brother Richie, who enjoyed smoking marijuana and eventually using heroin intravenously, but who also played football.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{tells the}} party that Sauron will now turn his eye to Minas Tirith. Gandalf rides on ahead, and sends the party to the ruined city of Osgiliath, to stand {{alongside}} Boromir's brother, Faramir. As they await {{the arrival of the}} army, Berethor muses that Osgiliath seems familiar to him. Éoaden <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> Gondorian warrior who fought under Boromir during the defense of the city some time ago, but who fled the battle in fear. The party realize that Berethor is that man. He vows he will never flee again, and the party join Faramir in a fight against Gothmog. They defeat him, but he flees before they can kill him. Gandalf then summons the party back to Minas Tirith. Before they leave, however, Berethor learns the reason he fled Osgiliath was because he was stabbed by a Morgul blade, the tip of which is still within him. He and Idrial face the Witch-king, but Idrial explains he cannot harm the Witch-king whilst the blade is still inside him. He cuts it out and they attack the Witch-king, driving him off. The party then head to Minas Tirith.|$|E

500|$|Officially, the {{recorded}} death toll {{of the first}} week of January 1923 was eight people (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number.

Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. [...] Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies.

Sue Anne asks whether Mac <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby.

500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview.

500|$|Part IV {{consists}} {{of only one}} chapter, which, like the book's opening chapter, is mostly composed {{of a series of}} seemingly unrelated vignettes.

500|$|Seventh song [...] "Que Vuelvas" [...] {{is another}} song {{inspired}} by {{her relationship with}} Ríos. It was musically compared to Shakira's past single [...] "Estoy Aquí" [...] (1996). The following track, [...] "Tú", lyrically expresses the sweetness of love, with Shakira singing: [...] "Porque eres tú mi sol, la fe con que vivo" [...] and [...] "nunca podré vivir sin ti". The ninth song is [...] "Dónde Están los Ladrones?", a guitar-driven song which criticizes the politic and social reality in South American nations {{at the time of}} the album's release. She sings, [...] "Los han visto por ahí, los han visto en los tejados, dando vueltas en París, condenando en los juzgados.

500|$|Although the rioting {{was widely}} {{reported}} around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event.

Sixty {{years after the}} rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived in major media when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. Survivors and their descendants organized to sue the state for having failed to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned {{a report on the}} massacre. As a result of the findings, Florida became the first U.S. state to compensate survivors and their descendants for damages incurred because of racial violence.

500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{referred}} to as a bildungsroman or [...] "coming-of-age" [...] story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the value of militarism, thus inviting the reader to learn it as well. This is especially true of the parts of his training that involve indoctrination, such as the claim by one of his instructors that rule by military veterans is the ideal form of government, because only they understand how to put collective well-being above the individual. The story traces Rico's transformation from a boy into a soldier, while exploring issues of identity and motivation, and traces his overall moral and social development, in a manner identified by commentators as similar to many stories about German soldiers in World War I. Rico's transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar Howard Franklin. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is [...] "calculated sadism" [...] but is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side. The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico [...] "crossing the hump" [...] with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development. The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico's adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that [...] "moral sense" [...] derives entirely from the will to survive. The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein's novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile [...] "wilderness" [...] in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein's earlier works as well. Rico's coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey [...] "outward" [...] through the novel also contains a search for Rico's childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.|$|E
