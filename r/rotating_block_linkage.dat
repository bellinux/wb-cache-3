Therefore the only computation complexity increase in our proposed method is the additional number of block matching between the <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks</b> {{and the current}} block. Another overhead will be the number of bits required to code the best matched rotation angle. However, if we control the number of rotation angles to be used, we can use a few bits to represent the angles {{and at the same}} time reduce the computation complexity required. Experiments show that up to 37 % of the blocks can be better predicted with rotational MCP. The angle of rotation is usually small, especially for static video sequences like Akiyo. This is reasonable as objects between frames usually will not rotate a lot. We define search angle interval and search angle range so that the number of block matching between the <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks</b> and the current block is fixed.

The impact of angular resolution on residual energy reduction is also evaluated.

50|$|They are {{powered by}} a unique piston engine called a V-engine mounted as a backpack. This is {{different}} from most science fiction settings, which use some form of nuclear power or a more obscure or invented power source. Confusingly, this V-engine {{is not the same}} design as a modern V-engine, but an alternative working design invented by students at the University of Colorado. The engine works by having two <b>rotating</b> cylindrical engine <b>blocks</b> with multiple chambers in each block. The blocks somewhat resemble large scale cylinders from a revolver handgun. The two rotating cylinders are set approximately 90 degrees from each other, and shared between each <b>rotating</b> <b>block</b> are several solid V-shaped rods that serve as pistons. As the <b>blocks</b> <b>rotate</b> inside their static housings openings in the sides of the rotating and static portions of the engine will line up and act as intake and exhaust ports, and also electrical contact connections trigger the spark plugs. The rotation of the cylinder blocks can then be tapped for electrical power generation or directly for hydraulic pressure.|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic tree {{reconstruction}} {{for a set}} {{of species}} is an important problem for understanding the evolutionary history of the species. Existing algorithms usually represent each species as a binary string with each bit indicating whether a particular gene/protein exists in the species. Given the topology of a phylogenetic tree with each leaf representing a species (a binary string of equal length) and each internal node representing the hypothetical ancestor, the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm and the Sankoff algorithm are two polynomial-time algorithms which assign binary strings to internal nodes such that the total Hamming distance between adjacent nodes in the tree is minimized. However, these algorithms oversimplify the evolutionary process by considering only the number of protein insertions/deletions (Hamming distance) between two species and by assuming the evolutionary history of each protein is independent. Since the function of a protein may depend on the existence of other proteins, the evolutionary history of these functionally dependent proteins should be similar, i. e. functionally dependent proteins should usually be present (or absent) in a species at the same time. Thus, in addition to the Hamming distance, the protein linkage distance for some pairs/sets of proteins: whole <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance, partial <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance, pairwise linkage distance is introduced. It is proved that the phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem to find the binary strings for the internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree that minimizes the sum of the Hamming distance and the linkage distance is NP-hard. In this thesis, a general algorithm to solve the phylogenetic tree reconstruction with protein linkage problem which runs in O(4 ^m⋅n) time for whole/partial <b>block</b> <b>linkage</b> distance and O(4 ^m⋅⋅ (m+n)) time for pairwise linkage distance (compared to the straight-forward O(4 ^m⋅ m⋅ n) or O(4 ^m⋅ m^ 2 ⋅⋅ n) time algorithm) is introduced where n is the number of species and m is the length of the binary string (number of proteins). It is further shown, by experiments, that our algorithm using linkage information can construct more accurate trees (better matches with the trees constructed by biologists) than the algorithms using only Hamming distance. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Continental rifting is a {{fundamental}} component of the plate tectonic cycle. The West Iberia passive margin {{is a classic example}} of a nonvolcanic rifted margin. The West Iberia margin contains an enigmatic north-south ridge of serpentinized peridotite located within the ocean-continent transition. Interpretation of multichannel seismic data and tectonic subsidence analyses suggests that the ridge is located within a broad zone of exhumed mantle that has been serpentinized. This implies that seafloor spreading does not immediately follow continental breakup. Where the peridotite ridge is well-developed, it parallels a deeply-penetrating, west-dipping normal fault. Hydrodynamic circulation drove seawater down this fault close to the beginning of seafloor spreading and caused a concentration of serpentinization at its base. This water-driven process of formation accounts for the variability of the ridge along strike. Prestack depth migration of a 340 km long seismic reflection profile across the margin served as the basis for stratigraphic interpretation. The proximal margin displays horsts and grabens, with 1 [...] 2 km thick synrift deposits from Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) rifting. The deep water margin displays <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks</b> with distinct internal seismic patterns. These blocks formed during the final Cretaceous rifting event that led to continental breakup, and contain earlier Valanginian synrift deposits as part of the <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks,</b> thus providing evidence of two separate rifting stages along this profile. A large mantle-penetrating fault located seaward of the last <b>rotated</b> <b>block</b> of continental crust provides evidence for a third and final Cretaceous rifting event that may have been coeval with early seafloor spreading. Two independent estimates of crustal thickness along this line indicate stretching factors of 50 % on the proximal margin (corresponding to a continental crustal thickness of ∼ 16 km), increasing to 100 % in the deep water. Plate tectonics is one of the most important concepts that Earth Scientists can convey to the public. While this concept is often presented at the middle school level in Texas, the appropriateness of teaching plate tectonics to middle school students has been questioned. We present data that suggest that middle school students grasp the abstract concepts of plate tectonics as well as college students...|$|R
