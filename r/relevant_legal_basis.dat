50|$|The core {{principles}} {{guiding the}} development of eGovernment are listed in a policy document applicable for the period 2008-2012, the Strategy for {{the development of}} Information Society services ("Strategie rozvoje služeb pro 'informační společnost in Czech). The eGovernment concept it contains can be summed up as follows: eGovernment is the means to satisfy the citizens' expectations as to public services while modernising the public administration, in a way to cut both red tape and costs. Citizen satisfaction stands as the ultimate indicator of success. To reach success, the <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> must be established and the supporting infrastructure must be made interoperable.|$|E
40|$|The {{rights to}} enter and exit the United Kingdom are limited {{in a number of}} ways which have in common a desire to protect the {{national}} security of the country. One of the <b>relevant</b> mechanisms, the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> of which has recently been overhauled, is that of ‘authority to carry’ schemes, which require transport companies to request permission to bring persons in and out of the UK and punish them if they do so without permission. This article outlines the relevant law and considers it from two points of view: first, the rule of law issues raised by the past and present operation of the relevant schemes and, second, the lessons of authority to carry schemes for the privatised enforcement of national security norms and the possible attenuation of the scope for legal accountability for their operation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With {{the further}} {{development}} of e-government construction and application, it {{becomes more and more}} urgent to strengthen the information security of e-government legislation. Information security is the guarantee of e-government construction and operation. In our country the information security problem needs the guarantee of laws and regulations urgently. It is important to legislate as soon as possible. Establishing and improving <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> system can promote the e-government construction and application effectively and quickly in our country. In order to ensure the information security of e-government in the construction and improvement of relevant legislation process, we should pay attention to the following: join the international information security law system positively, build the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for e-government information security actively and promote the execution efficiency of e-government information security laws and regulations. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{rigorous}} thesis {{is the development}} of regulatory social security of "helpless persons" - individuals suffering from long-term health problems that are severe and functionally debilitating enough to necessitate the care and assistance of another. I attempt to track the development of social security of the helpless from its beginnings shortly after the emergence of Czechoslovakia as an independent state in 1918 to the present day - a period of nearly one hundred years. My aim is to create an in-depth, exhaustive description of the development of the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for the "helplessness allowance" (currently defined as carer's allowance), as well as to evaluate the consequences of the various changes to the law and their impact on {{the current state of the}} <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> framework. I believe that my readers will be interested in the opportunity to track how the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> of helplessness- or care dependence- related social security transfers has evolved from a brief, rather sparse chapter of the Social Security Code, one which was seen for many decades as little more than a necessary addendum to the code, into a self-contained, highly sophisticated area of social security law. This work should make clear the impulses and reasons for the emergence of important new and modified [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Jurisdiction and {{applicable}} law constitute two parameters of international service contracts {{with a high}} potential impact on business risk. The legally compliant determination of jurisdiction and {{applicable law}}, however, is highly complex and costly as it must consider the case-specific connecting factor setting applicable to a given international contract relation. With the aim to support contract parties in concluding an international service contract, hence, a decision support tool to produce a list of recommended jurisdiction(s) and/or applicable law(s) in an automated and compliant manner is developed in this paper. This implies to address the following three challenges. First, {{in the light of}} a method lacking to identify, select, and formally model the <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> such a method has to be developed. Second, a common information model basis has to be built in order to reflect and integrate different notions originating from different jurisdictions and their laws. Third, and in consideration of both, modeling method and information model, an implementation of those laws modeled becomes necessary. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges and it shows for the example of the main European jurisdiction-oriented regulation modeled and implemented that an automated determination is feasible and fully operational...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} a <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> between huge {{commercial}} partners such as the EU as a single entity and the Russian Federation promoted {{the emergence of a}} legal vacuum. The long term cooperation between Russia and the EU has only one bilateral agreement - the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation signed in 1994, which is however obsolete, and does not meet the contemporary needs. The adequate legal basis for Russia-EU cooperation in the gas sector is still missing. The protection of investments in the gas sector is being realized by bilateral agreements between Russia and EU member states, soft law and general international agreements, without any specifications for those two partners. The only international instrument covering the energy relations of these two partners - Energy Charter Treaty cannot be considered as a reliable mechanism, as Russia withdrew from it more than 8 years ago. The reasons of the withdrawal and the Yukos case as an illustrative example are discussed in this paper. In order to avoid uncertainty in such strategic area as gas investment relations and unpredictable decisions between the states represented by the commercial entities, {{there is a need to}} design a substantive legal basis, and a need to consider on the adequate dispute resolution body. In this thesis, key [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Applying <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> {{information}} to settle complaints and disputes {{is a common}} challenge for all legal practitioners and laymen. However, {{the analysis of the}} concept of relevance itself has thus far attracted only sporadic attention. This thesis bridges this gap by understanding the components of complaints, and by defining <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> information, and makes use of computational ontologies and design patterns to represent this relevant knowledge in an explicit and structured way. This work uses as a case-study a real situation of consumer disputes in the Air Transport Passenger domain. Two artifacts were built: the <b>Relevant</b> <b>Legal</b> Information in Consumer Disputes Ontology, and its specialization, the Air Transport Passenger Incidents Ontology, aimed at modelling <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> information; and the Complaint Design Pattern proposed to conceptualize complaints. In order to demonstrate the ability of the ontologies to serve as a knowledge base for a computer program providing <b>relevant</b> <b>legal</b> information, a demonstrative application was developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R
