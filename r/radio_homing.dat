5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond {{snooping}} through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret <b>radio</b> <b>homing</b> station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E

50|$|The SCR-277 {{was used}} as a {{navigation}} aid. It included the BC-467 transmitter with an RF output power of 800 watts, the BC-468 Goniometer, and BC-342 receiver. Frequencies utilized were 200-400 KHz for transmission and 1.5-18 MHz for reception. <b>Radio</b> range <b>homing</b> equipment transmitted tone identification signals to aircraft that lacked a radio compass but were equipped with command sets. Range was approximately 300 miles. It was powered by a single PE-90 generator.|$|R
50|$|The Queensland Cruising Yacht Club was {{established}} in 1948 to organise the Brisbane to Gladstone Yacht Race. The first race was held during Easter 1949. The first race saw seven vessels start, two of which carried <b>radios</b> while Brisbane’s <b>Homing</b> Pigeon Club supplied pigeons to the others for position reporting. Each yacht issued with birds was to release two each day.|$|R

It {{also includes a}} dedicated management unit for data fusion and reaction decision.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1940, American war {{correspondent}} [...] "Mitch" [...] Mitchell is {{stationed in}} London, working for Consolidated Press of America, which represents 1000 newspapers. Mitch is anxiously waiting for {{news of the}} expected German invasion of Britain from a reporter on the Continent (the United States being neutral at the time), determined to scoop his competition. He manages to rent Sir Titus Scott's wire from Penzance in Cornwall for a week to save forty minutes (for an exorbitant amount, much {{to the dismay of}} his boss, H. Cyrus Stuyvesant). The information is to come by coded <b>radio</b> and <b>homing</b> pigeon messages. Twelve-year-old Albert Perkins and the elderly Mr. Bindle watch for the pigeons.|$|R
2500|$|The 509th's Scout Company was {{the first}} {{specialized}} Pathfinder group. In the U.S. Army, it started the training and experimentation necessary to develop the concept at Oujda. With fragments of practical knowledge from the British Airborne, company commander Captain Howland and his XO 1st Lt. Fred E. Perry worked hard to develop usable techniques. Perry recalls: [...] "Everyone knew through hard experience that the Air Corps needed help to drop us on the correct drop zone. We organized the Scout Company for this purpose. This was later made into a Scout Platoon under my command, consisting of 10 enlisted and myself. We were equipped with a British <b>homing</b> <b>radio</b> and U.S. Navy Aldis lamps, which radiated a beam to guide planes. We trained on this procedure until the invasion at Salerno.|$|R
5000|$|James Gavin {{likes to}} claim credit for [...] "inventing" [...] Pathfinders, {{pointing}} to bad drops in Sicily as the cause. Let us {{set the record}} straight: The 509th, the world's most experienced bad drop specialists, first saw the need for them. Pathfinders were separate teams of [...] "advance men" [...] who jumped in ahead of main forces to set up beacons and other guides to incoming aircraft.The 509th's Scout Company was the first specialized Pathfinder group.

The 82d would not buy our Scout Platoon idea, but they sure found out in a hurry after Sicily that we really had something that was needed.At the time, Major General Matthew Ridgway and his [...] "All-American" [...] staff thought they knew it all. Impressed with themselves, although they were not jumpers or experienced glider troopers, they airily dismissed the 509th and its fresh combat experiences, {{as well as any}} nonstandard/Limey concept. They would learn the hard way.|$|R
