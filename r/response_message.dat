All the neighbouring routers which receive the Request message respond back with the <b>Response</b> <b>Message</b> containing their Routing table.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to design an agent which provides efficient response to the caller when a call goes unanswered in smartphones. The agent provides <b>responses</b> through text <b>messages,</b> email etc stating the most likely reason {{as to why the}} callee is unable to answer a call. Responses are composed taking into consideration the importance of the present call and the situation the callee is in at the moment like driving, sleeping, at work etc. The agent makes decisons in the compostion of <b>response</b> <b>messages</b> based on the patterns it has come across in the learning environment. Initially the user helps the agent to compose <b>response</b> <b>messages.</b> The agent associates this message to the percept it recieves with respect to the environment the callee is in. The user may thereafter either choose to make to response system automatic or choose to recieve suggestions from the agent for <b>responses</b> <b>messages</b> and confirm what is to be sent to the caller.

50|$|In {{this case}} the BBOA1REG API is used to {{register}} into the WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Daemon group (the cell short name), and multiple invocations of BBOA1INV are used to invoke the target EJB. BBOA1INV is synchronous so program control is held until the EJB returns a response. This API is useful when the calling program knows {{the size of the}} <b>response</b> <b>message</b> in advance. If the <b>response</b> <b>message</b> size is unknown {{at the time of the}} call then the more primitive APIs (BBOA1SRQ (send request), BBOA1RCL (get response length), BBOA1GET (get message data)) would be more appropriate.|$|E

40|$|Efficient web {{browsing}} on mobile computers {{presents a}} unique challenge. These machines {{are different from}} other classes of client computers since they have relatively lowbandwidth connections and they are battery-powered and therefore limited by their energy consumption. However, they tend {{to interact with the}} same servers for the delivery of web content. This project investigates optimizing the final critical link between a mobile client and a stationary base station by compressing HTTP request and <b>response</b> <b>messages.</b> Using a split proxy design, compression of individual request messages reduces bandwidth by 26 % to 34 % across a variety of benchmark traces, and applying compression to <b>response</b> <b>messages</b> yields savings of 59 % to 82 % of the compressible data. Higher compression rates are achieved by using streaming compression algorithms to compress the streams of request and <b>response</b> <b>messages.</b> In this case, the bandwidth for requests sees an order of magnitude improvement, and the respons [...] ...|$|R

Traditional DNS does not provide guarantees about authenticity and origin integrity.

As a consequence, resolvers behind such firewalls will no longer receive complete responses from name servers, leading to certain Internet zones becoming unreachable because no translation into IP addresses can be performed.
