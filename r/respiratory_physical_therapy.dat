Martina Havlová Opponent: Title of bachelor's thesis: Techniques of Respiratory Physiotherapy in {{inhalation}} Therapy of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Abstract: This {{paper is}} focused on the techniques of <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> in inhalation therapy of chronic pulmonary diseases. The paper is divided into two parts - theoretical and practical. The aim of the theoretical part is to briefly describe anatomy and physiology of respiration. Next, the theoretical part deals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and possibilities of its treatment. The emphasis is put on the inhalation therapy and the description of particular techniques of <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> which are used in the therapy of chronic pulmonary diseases. The practical part includes two case histories of patients who are being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To evaluate the state of the patient, spirometry testing and the MMRC dyspnea scale are used. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the influence of <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> on efficacy of inhaled medicine concerning the patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. Key words: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhalation therapy, <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> instrumental technique...|$|E

The ICU has 10 beds, 6 general and 4 neurological. The daytime staffing of the unit consists of 1 medical coordinator, 1 attending physician, 2 residents (fourth- and fifth-year residents of the School of Specialty in Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine) and 6 critical care nurses. The nightshift team consists of 1 attending physician, 1 resident and 4 nurses. Physical therapists are not dedicated exclusively to the ICU and provide general and <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> for 5  days a week based on a physiatrist-activated written protocol.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} preoperative physical therapy in myocardial revascularization surgeries. Methods: Twelve patients {{were divided into two}} groups: control and treated. The treated group was subjected to a daily care of respiratory therapy, for five consecutive days, one week before surgery. Metabolic and breathing exercises, as well as respiratory muscle training, were used. Both groups underwent preoperative physical therapy evaluations and were followed up from the immediate postoperative period until discharge. The pre- and postoperativevariables were respiratory muscle strength and spirometric values. The pre- and postoperative results were analyzed with a paired "t" test, and between groups with a non paired "t" test (p< 0. 05). Results: No difference was observed between the groups. Conclusions: Five preoperative <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> interventions prior to myocardial revascularization were insufficient to observe significant differences in the measures of respiratory muscle strength and spirometric values...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of {{respiratory}} therapy with the expiratory flow increase technique on cerebral hemodynamics of premature newborns. Methods: This is an intervention study, which included 40 preterm infants (&# 8804; 34 weeks) aged 8 - 15 days of life, clinically stable in ambient air or oxygen catheter use. Children with heart defects, diagnosis of brain lesion and/or those using vasoactive drugs were excluded. Ultrasonographic assessments with transcranial Doppler flowmetry were performed before, during and after the increase in expiratory flow session, which lasted 5 min. Cerebral blood flow velocity and resistance and pulsatility indices in the pericallosal artery were assessed. Results: <b>Respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> did not significantly alter flow velocity at the systolic peak (p= 0. 50), the end diastolic flow velocity (p= 0. 17), the mean flow velocity (p= 0. 07), the resistance index (p= 0. 41) and the pulsatility index (p= 0. 67) over time.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 74 - 78) Mandatory {{continuing education}} {{has become a}} topic of concern to health professionals with the recent advent of legislature in California and other states. This legislation requires {{a certain number of}} hours of continuing education for renewal of professional licenses. Many health professionals have voiced dissatisfaction with these new laws, and many controversies have arisen regarding the requirements set forth under these mandates. Thus far, little research regarding the reasons for this ambivalence and dissatisfaction has taken place. This study was undertaken in an attempt to identify the problem areas inherent in the issue of mandatory continuing education, with the assumption that identifying the problems involved with the mandates {{is the first step toward}} seeking alternative solutions. A major hypothesis and seven sub-hypotheses were formulated regarding relationships between certain independent variables and attitudes toward mandatory continuing education. A survey instrument was designed to collect both demographic and attitudinal data on a random sampling of health professionals in the fields of <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Therapy,</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Therapy,</b> and Registered Nursing. This data was then analyzed, and pertinent results transcribed into tables. The excellent rate of return of the survey instruments demonstrates the concern of health professionals, as those surveyed were highly motivated to comment on this topic. The comments and concerns voiced by those surveyed gives impetus to further exploration into the subject of mandatory continuing education, in the hopes of finding alternative solutions that will be acceptable to the majority, if not all, health professionals. There are, as this study has documented, many implications to be considered prior to the implementation and successful establishment of a mandate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: The {{interaction}} among various health disciplines in {{a health care}} team using the IPE approach has received recognition {{as one of the}} most effective methods of improving the delivery of healthcare services. The perception and attitude of students toward IPE is considered one of the barriers and challenges to implement interprofessional education. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate students’ perceptions toward interprofessional education. METHOD: Data were collected through a descriptive survey using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). The survey consisted of 19 items, 5 -point Likert scale and grouped into four sub-scales; teamwork and collaboration, negative professional identity, positive professional identity, and roles and responsibilities. The survey was administered to a convenience sample of undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled in nursing, <b>respiratory</b> <b>therapy,</b> nutrition, <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> and occupational therapy programs at an urban university.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Healthcare {{institutions}} use patient simulation as {{a standard}} aspect of training healthcare students with practical skills before they graduate and encounter with real patients. Simulation can foster the learning process of clinicians as it mimics clinical scenarios. To enhance the healthcare learning environment, {{it is essential to}} examine students’ perceptions toward the use of simulation in healthcare programs and to which degree the simulation courses influence their learning process and will assist educators initiate an effective simulation course. PURPOSE: The study’s purpose was to evaluate the perceptions of students’ use of simulation in nursing, <b>respiratory</b> <b>therapy,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> nutrition, and occupational therapy programs. Method: Data were collected through a descriptive survey using a convenience sample. The survey presented in 4 -point Likert-type scale and consisted of 10 questions. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty students (N= 250) were surveyed from five different programs; <b>Physical</b> <b>therapy</b> students accounted for 29. 2 %; followed by Nursing students 28 %; Respiratory Therapy students 27. 6 %; Occupational Therapy students 7. 6 %; and nutrition students 7. 2 %. The majority of participants were female (70. 4 %) while male students represented 29. 6 % of the population. Almost 58 % of participants reported {{that they did not have}} any experience working in a healthcare setting. The majority of students (95. 2 %) reported that they engaged in a clinical simulation experience in their healthcare program. The study findings indicate students’ overall perceptions have a high agreement with the statement that simulation experience was a valuable learning experience with mean = 3. 52 (SD ±. 577). Students demonstrate a high agreement that simulation should be an integral part of clinical experience with a mean of 3. 48 (SD ±. 599). Moreover, Students reported that simulation debriefing experience support their understanding and reasoning (mean= 3. 47, SD ±. 598). The study findings revealed that clinical experience have no significant effect on students’ perception toward simulation. However, female students reported that they experienced more nervousness during simulation than male students (P value = 0. 005). Moreover, students who had previous simulation experience reported more agreement that simulation was realistic than students who did not have any simulation experience (P= 0. 049). CONCLUSION: Healthcare professional students have a good perception toward simulation education and feel that simulation should be integral part of education. Further studies with higher number of participants and different institutions is recommended...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Advances in {{information}} technology {{have been widely used}} in teaching health care professionals. The use of multimedia resources may be important for clinical learning and we are not aware of previous reports using such technology in <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> education. Objectives: Our approach was to evaluate a conventional bronchial hygiene techniques (BHTs) course with an interactive online environment, including multimedia resources. METHODS: Previous developed audiovisual support material comprised: physiology, physiopathology and BHTs, accessible to students through the Internet in conjunction with BHTs classes. Two groups of students were compared and both attended regular classes: the on-line group (n= 8) received access to online resources, while the control group (n= 8) received conventional written material. Student's performance was evaluated before and after the course. RESULTS: A preliminary test (score 0 to 10) was applied before the beginning of the course, showing that the initial knowledge of both groups was comparable [online, 6. 75 (SD= 0. 88) vs. control, 6. 125 (SD= 1. 35); p> 0. 05]. Two weeks {{after the end of the}} course, a second test showed that the online group performed significantly better than the control group [respectively, 7. 75 (SD= 1. 28) vs. 5. 93 (SD= 0. 72); p> 0. 05].

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo explore students' {{attitudes toward}} interprofessional {{education}} (IPE); to explore {{whether there are}} {{significant differences in the}} readiness of students in various healthcare professions; and to investigate whether demographic characteristics have any significant influence on their attitude and readiness. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study. The Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) was administered to all 2 nd-, 3 rd-, and 4 th-year undergraduate students of the <b>respiratory</b> care, <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> cardiac technology, clinical nutrition, and clinical science laboratory professional programs at the University of Dammam. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. ResultsThe overall mean score of students' readiness (mean =  66, SD =  8. 7) was higher than the average score on the RIPLS (mean =  47. 5). A comparison revealed statistically significant differences between health profession groups in terms of readiness (P = . 000). The overall mean readiness score of clinical nutrition students was higher than that of other groups. There were significant positive relationships between year of study and the overall RIPLS score, the teamwork and collaboration subscale score, and the negative professional identity subscale score (r ranged from. 117 to. 189, P ≤ . 023). ConclusionOverall, the study revealed a satisfactory degree of readiness and a generally positive attitude among students regarding shared learning and the value of teamwork and collaboration. The results suggested that clinical nutrition students appreciated interprofessional collaboration more than students of other health professions.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundNeuromuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (NMES) improves muscle performance and exercise tolerance in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) patients. In contrast, no study has assessed {{the effect of}} NMES on dynamic hyperinflation (DH) in COPD. This study investigated the effect of short-term, high-frequency NMES on DH in patients with COPD. MethodsTwenty patients were randomly allocated to either a NMES applied bilaterally to the quadriceps muscles (n =  11 : 8 weeks, 5  days/week, twice/day, 45  min/session) or a control group (n =  09). All patients received <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> and stretching exercises. Free fat mass, pulmonary function, time to exercise tolerance (Tlim), 6 -min walk test distance (6 -MWTD), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and β-endorphin levels, Borg dyspnea and leg score (BDS and BLS) and quality of life by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score (SGRQ) were examined before and after the intervention. ResultsCompared with the control group, NMES increased FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC, 6 -MWD and Tlim (P <  0. 01) and reduced BDS and SGRQ (P <  0. 01). Additionally, changes in the Tlim were positively correlated with respiratory improvements in FEV 1 (rho =  0. 48, P <  0. 01). Also, NMES reduced TNF-α and increased β-endorphin levels, compared with the control group (P <  0. 001). ConclusionIn summary, 8 weeks of NMES promotes reduction of the perceived sensation of dyspnea during exercise in patients with COPD. This finding is accompanied by improvements in FEV 1, exercise tolerance and quality of life, and DH. Interestingly, these findings may be associated with enhanced vasodilatory function and a reduction in inflammatory responses. Clinical trial registrationNCT 01695421...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} chronic conditions and/or disability in intensive care units admitting children (PICU) or both neonates and children (NPICU), and to describe available rehabilitation resources. Design: A cross-sectional study on two separate days, using a web questionnaire. Setting: NPICU/PICUs affiliated to the Groupe Francophone de Réanimation et Urgences Pédiatriques and the Réseau Mère-Enfant de la Francophonie Patients: Children > 1 month of gestationally corrected age. Measurements and Main Results: Disability {{was defined as a}} Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC)  3 before admission and chronic conditions as hospitalization since birth or the presence before admission of any condition requiring on-going pediatric subspecialty care that was expected to last > 12 months. Intensivists indicated what rehabilitation services he would have ideally prescribed (“perceived needs”) and those provided. Of 45 affiliated units 8 PICUs and 15 NPICUs participated. Staff included or had access to a psychologist (11 and 5, respectively), a social worker (10 and 3), a physiotherapist (11 and 12), a «psychomotrician» (2 and 8), a child educator (1 and 6), and a speech-language pathologist (0 and 6). Among 289 recorded ICU-days, 236 were analyzed (excluding those for children admitted after surgery) : 57 concerned children hospitalized since birth and 179 children admitted from home. Among these 179 recorded ICU-days, 107 concerned children with chronic conditions (including 50 concerning disabled children) and 72 previously healthy children. Thus, prevalence of chronic conditions, including children hospitalized since birth, was 67 %. Rehabilitation services included: <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> (552 visits), musculoskeletal physical therapy (71), neurological physical therapy (37), rehabilitation for swallowing (11), and for speech-language disorders (1), representing 79 % of perceived needs.

However, {{the changes in}} breath sounds in children with atelectasis have not been previously reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the characteristics of breath sounds in children with atelectasis using acoustic measurements. The subjects of this study were 13 children with right middle lobe atelectasis (3 - 7 years) and 14 healthy children (3 - 7 years). Lung sounds at the bilateral fifth intercostal spaces on the midclavicular line were recorded. The right-to-left ratio (R/L ratio) and the expiration to inspiration ratio (E/I ratio) of the breath sound sound pressure were calculated separately for three octave bands (100 - 200 Hz, 200 - 400 Hz, and 400 - 800 Hz). These data were then compared between the atelectasis and control groups. In addition, the same measurements were repeated after treatment, including RPT, in the atelectasis group. Before treatment, the inspiratory R/L ratios for all the frequency bands were significantly lower in the atelectasis group than in the control group, and the E/I ratios for all the frequency bands were significantly higher in the atelectasis group than in the control group. After treatment, the inspiratory R/L ratios of the atelectasis group did not increase significantly, but the E/I ratios decreased for all the frequency bands and became similar to those of the control group. Breath sound attenuation in the atelectatic area remained unchanged even after radiographical resolution, suggesting a continued decrease in local ventilation. On the other hand, the elevated E/I ratio for the atelectatic area was normalized after treatment. Therefore, the differences between inspiratory and expiration sound intensities may be an important marker of atelectatic improvement in children...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the clinical {{impact of the}} first year treatment with dornase alfa, according to age groups, in a cohort of Brazilian Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. METHODS: The data on 152 eligible patients, from 16 CF reference centers, that answered the medical questionnaires and performed laboratory tests at baseline (T 0), and at six (T 2) and 12 (T 4) months after dornase alfa initiation, were analyzed. Three age groups were assessed: six to 11, 12 to 13, and > 14 years. Pulmonary tests, airway microbiology, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, emergency and routine treatments were evaluated. Student's t-test, chi-square test and analysis of variance were used when appropriated. RESULTS: Routine treatments were based on <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> regular exercises, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. In the six months prior the study (T 0 phase), hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations occurred in 38. 0, 10. 0 and 61. 4 % in the three age groups, respectively. After one year of intervention, there was a significant {{reduction in the number of}} emergency room visits in the six to 11 years group. There were no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (VEF 1), in forced vital capacity (FVC), in oxygen saturation (SpO 2), and in Tiffenau index for all age groups. A significant improvement in Shwachman-Kulczychi score was observed in the older group. In the last six months of therapy, chronic or intermittent colonization by P. aeruginosa was detected in 75. 0, 71. 4 and 62. 5 % of the studied groups, respectively, while S. aureus colonization was identified in 68. 6, 66. 6 and 41. 9 % of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with dornase alfa promoted the maintenance of pulmonary function parameters and was associated with a significant reduction of emergency room visits due to pulmonary exacerbations in the six to 11 years age group, with better clinical scores in the > 14 age group, one year after the intervention...|$|E

Na comparação por ANOVA, as médias da FR, FC e SpO 2 nos grupos AFE e vibração/DP não apresentaram diferenças significantes em relação ao grupo controle (p > 0, 05). Considerando somente os quatro tempos, houve queda significante dos valores médios de FR nos grupos AFE e vibração/DP em relação ao controle (p OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} expiratory flow increase technique (EFIT) and vibration accompanied by postural drainage (PD) {{in terms of}} their effects on the heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and SpO 2 of infants with acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB). METHODS: Infants with clinical and radiological diagnosis of AVB were analyzed. The HR, RR and SpO 2 were registered at four time points: prior to the procedure; and at 10, 30 and 60 min after the procedure. The patients were divided into three groups: submitted to the EFIT; submitted to vibration/PD; and control. RESULTS: We included 81 infants, 27 per group, {{with a mean age of}} 4. 52 years and a mean weight of 6. 56 kg. Using ANOVA, we found that the EFIT and vibration/PD groups presented no significant differences in relation to the control group in terms of the mean values for HR, RR or SpO 2 (p > 0. 05). Considering only the four time points evaluated, the mean RR was significantly lower in the EFIT and vibration/PD groups than in the control group (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of overall improvement of cardiorespiratory parameters, neither the EFIT nor vibration/PD provided any benefit to infants with BVA.

40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: O decúbito lateral apresenta as maiores mudanças em relação à ventilação pulmonar {{regional}} e é utilizado na rotina da fisioterapia respiratória. OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a influência do decúbito lateral na deposição pulmonar de radioaerossol durante a inalação em indivíduos jovens e relacionar os efeitos desse decúbito na rotina terapêutica. MÉTODOS: Em estudo randomizado em duas fases, foram incluídos oito homens voluntários saudáveis, com média de idade de 23, 6 ± 2, 5 anos. Na primeira fase, inalou-se aerossol durante nove minutos no decúbito lateral sorteado e, após intervalo de cinco a sete dias, realizou-se a segunda fase. Para a cintilografia, inalou-se uma dose média de ácido dietilnotriaminopentacético marcado com tecnécio (DTPA - TC 99 m), com uma atividade radioativa em média de 25 milicuries (mCi). Ao final da inalação, as imagens foram adquiridas em câmaras de cintilação e analisadas por meio da divisão longitudinal e transversal dos pulmões em regiões de interesse (ROI).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate {{the influence of the}} lateral decubitus position on the pulmonary deposition of inhaled radioaerosol particles in young people and report the effects of the decubitus position on routine therapy. METHODS: Eight healthy male volunteers, mean age 23. 6 ± 2. 5 years, were included in a randomized study in two phases. In the first phase, aerosol was inhaled for nine minutes in a randomly-selected lateral decubitus position and after an interval of 5 to 7 days, the second phase was conducted. Pulmonary scintigraphy was carried out by inhalation of 25 mCi of 99 mTc-DTPA. Following inhalation, images were acquired with scintillation cameras and regions of interest (ROI) were investigated in the longitudinal and cross-sectional divisions of the lungs. Statistical analysis included a paired Student's t-test with a significance level of p< 0. 05. RESULTS: Inhalation in the right lateral decubitus position presented higher counts (p< 0. 04) in posterior ROI of the right lung than in the posterior ROI of the left lung. In the left lateral decubitus position, the count was higher in the left lung (p< 0. 02) than in the posterior ROI of the right lung. CONCLUSIONS: The deposition of aerosol particles during inhalation was position-dependent in the two phases of the study, which confirms the validity of technical and therapeutic resources based on the physiology of position-dependent ventilation and suggests that body positioning can be used to advantage in routine therapy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{perform an}} {{assessment}} of the available literature on manual hyperinflation as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy</b> technique used in pediatric patients, with the main outcome of achieving airway clearance. METHODS:We reviewed articles included in the Lilacs (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences/Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde), Cochrane Library, Medline (via Virtual Health Library and PubMed), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library), and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) databases from 2002 to 2013 using the following search terms: physiotherapy (techniques), respiratory therapy, intensive care, and airway clearance. The selected studies were classified according to the level of evidence and grades of recommendation (method of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine) by two examiners, while a third examiner repeated the search and analysis and checked the classification of the articles. RESULTS:Three articles were included for analysis, comprising 250 children (aged 0 to 16 years). The main diagnoses were acute respiratory failure, recovery following heart congenital disease and upper abdominal surgery, bone marrow transplantation, asthma, tracheal reconstruction, brain injury, airway injury, and heterogeneous lung diseases. The studies were classified as having a level of evidence 2 C and grade of recommendation C. CONCLUSIONS:Manual hyperinflation appeared useful for airway clearance in the investigated population, although the evidence available in the literature remains insufficient. Therefore, controlled randomized studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of manual hyperinflation in pediatric patients. However, manual hyperinflation must be performed by trained physical therapists only. OBJETIVO:Avaliar, na literatura, a aplicação da hiperinsuflação manual como técnica de fisioterapia respiratória em pediatria, considerando a desobstrução das vias aéreas como desfecho principal. MÉTODOS:Revisão realizada nas bases eletrônicas Lilacs, Biblioteca Cochrane, Medline (via Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde e Pubmed), SciELO e PEDro (período de 2002 a 2013), utilizando os descritores: physiotherapy (techniques) respiratory therapy intensive care e airway clearance. Os estudos foram selecionados e classificados por nível de evidência e recomendação (método Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine) por dois avaliadores, e um terceiro avaliador refez a pesquisa e conferiu a classificação dos artigos. RESULTADOS:Foram inclusos 3 estudos, que somaram 250 crianças (de zero a 16 anos). Os principais diagnósticos encontrados foram: insuficiência respiratória aguda, pós-operatório de cardiopatias congênitas e abdominais alta, transplante de medula óssea, asma, reconstrução traqueal, lesão cerebral, lesão de vias aéreas e doenças pulmonares heterogêneas. Os estudos foram classificados em nível de evidência 2 C e grau de recomendação C. CONCLUSÕES:A hiperinsuflação manual parece ser útil para a desobstrução das vias aéreas nessa população, embora as evidências da literatura sejam ainda insuficientes. Assim, são necessários estudos controlados e randomizados para determinar a segurança e a eficácia da hiperinsuflação manual em pediatria. A mesma deve ser realizada somente por fisioterapeutas treinados...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Comparar os efeitos da fisioterapia respiratória convencional (FRC) e FRC associada à estimulação diafragmática elétrica transcutânea (EDET) nos volumes pulmonares e mobilidade toracoabdominal em pacientes submetidas à cirurgia bariátrica. MÉTODOS: Este estudo prospectivo randomizado avaliou 44 mulheres candidatas a cirurgia bariátrica com 37, 4 ± 8, 1 anos, índice de massa corpórea de 47, 4 ± 6, 1 Kg/m², no pré-operatório, 15 º e 30 º dias pós-operatório em relação às medidas do volume de reserva inspiratório (VRI), volume de reserva expiratório (VRE), e capacidade inspiratória (CI) e da mobilidade toracoabdominal por meio da espirometria e da cirtometria, respectivamente. A FRC consistiu de exercícios respiratórios diafragmáticos, inspirações profundas, fracionadas e exercícios respiratórios associados à movimentação dos membros superiores. Foi realizada uma série de 10 repetições cada exercício, duas vezes ao dia, durante a internação. Para a EDET, foram posicionados 2 eletrodos na região paraesternal ao lado do processo xifoide e outros 2, entre o 6 º e 7 º espaços intercostais, nas linhas axilares anteriores bilateralmente.

METHODS: This randomized prospective study evaluated 44 female candidates for bariatric surgery (age 37. 4 ± 8. 1 years; body mass index 47. 4 ± 6. 1 kg/m²), before surgery and 15 and 30 days after surgery. The candidates were evaluated with regard to measurements of inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), inspiratory capacity (IC) and thoracoabdominal mobility, by means of spirometry and cirtometry, respectively. CRP consisted of diaphragmatic respiratory exercises, deep fractionated inspiration and respiratory exercises associated with upper limb movement. One set of 10 repetitions of each exercise was carried out twice daily while hospitalized. For TEDS, two electrodes {{were placed on the}} parasternal region, next to the xiphoid process, and another two between the sixth and seventh intercostal spaces, bilaterally on the anterior axillary lines. Friedman's test was used to compare repeated measures within groups, and the Mann-Whitney test for comparisons between groups. P values < 0. 05 were taken to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The IRV, ERV and thoracoabdominal mobility measurements increased significantly in the CRP+TEDS group. In contrast, the IC measurements decreased significantly both in the CRP and in the CRP+TEDS groups. CONCLUSION: The obese women who underwent bariatric surgery and received postoperative CRP+TEDS presented greater gains in some of the pulmonary volumes and improvements in the amplitude of respiratory movements...|$|E
5000|$|The Aviation Academy at Andrews High School is an Early College {{program which}} {{provides}} free college classes and free college textbooks for students interested in aviation or engineering careers. Students can earn an associate's degree from Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) {{while still in}} high school. Credits transfer to other colleges and universities, such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University or NC State. The program also provides paid internships at aviation businesses, job shadowing opportunities, and FAA licenses and industry certifications, such as SolidWorks and AutoCAD. The five main tracks of the program are engineering, pilot, airframe & powerplant mechanic (A&P), avionics technician, and aviation business. The Andrews Early College of Health Science offers an opportunity for motivated students {{to prepare for a}} future career in the field of health sciences to include nursing, biotechnology, <b>respiratory</b> <b>therapy,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapy,</b> pharmacy or medicine to name a few. Students have the opportunity to participate in internships through their courses to gain practical experience in their field of interest. Students in the program complete a rigorous high school curriculum during their freshman, sophomore, and junior years, which prepares them to take first-year college courses, earning dual credit, as a high school senior and a college student. Guilford County Schools (GCS) pays for tuition and non-consumable text books. Students who complete this program earn an Early College diploma in addition to the GCS high school diploma. From 2012 to 2016, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) was another key program at Andrews. According to the school website, [...] "Our first cohort of students began in the fall of 2012 in the 9th grade. AVID is a yearlong elective course taken during the school day. Students are enrolled in the course after completing an application and interview process. During the AVID elective, students learn organizational and study skills, work on critical thinking and asking probing questions, get academic help from peers and college tutors, and participate in enrichment and motivational activities that make college seem attainable. As students progress in AVID, their self-images improve, and they become academically successful students, leaders, and role models for other students. AVID targets students in the academic middle who have the desire {{to go to college and}} the willingness to work hard. These are students who are capable of completing rigorous curriculum, but are falling short of reaching their potential. Typically, they will be the first in their families to attend college, and many are from low-income or minority families. AVID pulls these students out of their unchallenging courses and puts them on the college track: acceleration instead of remediation." [...] The AVID program was discontinued in the 2016-2017 school year due to budgeting constraints.|$|R
