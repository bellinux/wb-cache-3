2500|$|American-Israeli {{journalist}} Caroline B. Glick, {{editor of}} the English-language Jerusalem Post said in March 2007 that [...] "there is no chance whatsoever that the Saudi initiative will bring peace" [...] and labeled it [...] "a recipe for Israel's destruction". Kadima Chairperson Tzipi Livni has distanced herself from it given her uncompromising opposition to {{the return of the}} Palestinian refugees. In October 2008, Likud Knesset Member Yuval Steinitz, who served on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, referred to the 2007 initiative re-launch as a nonstarter and called then Defense Minister Ehud Barak's supportive remarks [...] "an empty political gesture." [...] In a recent study by Joshua Teitelbaum, for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, he calls on Israel to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> based on its [...] "all or nothing" [...] attitude, emphasizing that true peace will come with negotiations.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{the city}} of Helsinki, Finland, {{commissioned}} the foundation to study the feasibility of constructing a museum there. The feasibility study recommended building the museum in Helsinki’s South Harbor.

[...] In 2013, the foundation made a revised proposal that provideed that the project's architect would be chosen through an international competition. The proposal anticipated that the Guggenheim's licensing fee would be funded by private sources, with decreased operating costs and increased revenues; one journalist called the Foundation's estimates [...] "speculative at best". In 2014, the city council approved an international architecture competition to solicit designs for the museum, and the following year, a design was chosen. In 2016 the Helsinki city council voted to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

Both parties strongly <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender. President Nasser instead opts to plead for more sophisticated weaponry from the Soviet Union to withstand the Israeli bombings. The Soviets initially refuse to deliver the requested weapons.|$|E

If the OEB does not approve the IPSP based on these evaluation criteria, then the IPSP is sent back to the OPA for revision. If the OEB approves the plan, then the OPA will put the IPSP into effect.|$|E
60|$|Many a tear was shed {{over the}} tokens {{of the little}} {{services}} she was wont to render, her half-done works, and pleasant studies so suddenly broken off, {{and all the time}} Hausfrau Johanna was running on with a lecture on the diligent preservation of her maiden discretion, with plentiful warnings against swaggering men-at-arms, drunken lanzknechts, and, above all, against young barons, who most assuredly could mean no good by any burgher maiden. The good aunt blessed the saints that her Stina was likely only to be lovely in affectionate home eyes; but, for that matter, idle men, shut up in a castle, with nothing but mischief to think of, would be dangerous to Little Three Eyes herself, and Christina had best never stir a yard from her lady's chair, when forced to meet them. All this was interspersed with motherly advice how to treat the sick lady, and receipts for cordials and possets; for Johanna began to regard the case as a sort of second-hand one of her own. Nay, she even turned it over in her mind whether she should not offer herself as the Lady Ermentrude's sick-nurse, as being a less dangerous commodity than her little niece: but fears for the well-being of the master-carver, and his Wirthschaft, and still more the notion of gossip Gertrude Grundt hearing that she had ridden off with a wild lanzknecht, made her at once <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> without even mentioning it to her husband or his niece.|$|E
5000|$|Arab {{recognition}} of Israel's {{right to exist}} was part of Folke Bernadotte's 1948 peace plan. The Arab states gave this as their reason to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> In the 1950s UK MP Herbert Morrison cited then Egyptian leader Abdel Nasser as saying [...] "Israel is an artificial State which must disappear." [...] The issue was described as the central one between Israel and the Arabs.|$|E

50|$|The {{birthday}} cake interview {{was a famous}} interview in Australia between reporter Mike Willesee and Liberal Party Opposition Leader John Hewson shortly before the 1993 federal election. Hewson was unable to easily answer whether a {{birthday cake}} would cost more or less under his proposed tax reforms, causing voters to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> as overly complex. It is remembered as the interview which contributed to Hewson's failure {{to win the election}} because he was unable to explain one of his key tax policies on live television.|$|E

50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the plan, the Annan plan would only come into force if {{accepted}} by the two communities in simultaneous referendums. These were set for 24 April 2004. In the weeks that followed there was intense campaigning in both communities. However, and in spite of opposition from Rauf Denktaş, who had boycotted the talks in Switzerland, {{it soon became clear that}} the Turkish Cypriots would vote in favour of the agreement. Among Greek Cypriots opinion was heavily weighted against the plan. Tassos Papadopoulos, the president of Cyprus, in a speech delivered on 7 April called on Greek Cypriots to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> His position was supported by the centrist Diko party and the socialists of EDEK as well as other smaller parties. His major coalition partner AKEL, one of the largest parties on the island, chose to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> bowing to the wishes of the majority of the party base. Support for the plan was voiced by Democratic Rally (DISY) leadership, the main right-wing party, despite opposition to the plan from the majority of party followers, and the United Democrats, a small centre-left party led by George Vasiliou, a former president. Glafcos Clerides, now retired from politics, also supported the plan. Prominent members of DISY who did not support the Annan plan split from the party and openly campaigned against it. The Greek Cypriot Church also opposed the plan in line with the views of the majority of public opinion.|$|E
50|$|The {{referendum}} {{was held}} on June 21, 2005, and residents voted 94% to 6% in favor of incorporation. Many residents expressed displeasure with county services, claiming, based upon financial {{information provided by the}} county, that the county was redistributing revenues to fund services in less financially stable areas of the county, ignoring local opposition to rezoning, and allowing excessive development. Many residents of unincorporated and less-developed south Fulton County strongly opposed incorporation, fearing the loss of tax revenues which fund county services. County residents outside Sandy Springs were not allowed to vote on the matter. Efforts such as requesting the U.S. Justice Department to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> were unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{population}} and the expanding agricultural and industrial sectors, in 1983 the National Water Resources Council (NWRC) was founded and the newly created Master Plan Organization (MPO) started {{to draw up a}} comprehensive National Water Plan (NWP). The first phase of the NWP was completed in 1986 and included an assessment of available water resources and future demand. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a lack of attention to intersectoral and environmental issues led the national government to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> Consequently, {{the second phase of the}} NWP was drawn up from 1987 to 1991, including an estimate of the available groundwater and surface water as well as a draft water law. The draft also took into account environmental needs. In 1991, the MPO was restructured and renamed the Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO).|$|E

50|$|In 1958, the {{decision}} was taken to close the Jiskra and Slavoj clubs and merge the two into a single team that would {{have the potential to}} win a spot in the premier league. Although this plan stirred up very negative reactions among footballers and fans alike {{and despite the fact that}} members of Slavoj originally declared that they <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> in the end they changed their minds. As a result, TJ Slovan Liberec was formed on 12 July 1958. With this name, the football club affirmed the Czech character of the club as well as the region where it played. The very first competitor the newly created team faced was Spartak Praha Sokolovo, as the famous team Sparta Prague was called at the time. Slovan lost 0-3. Despite of all its efforts, for a long time Slovan Liberec was unsuccessful in its fight for a place in the premier league.

5000|$|The Old Testament Student Manual, {{published}} by the Church Educational System, contains several quotes by general authorities as well as academics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds (both members of the church and non-members). The 1980 edition of the manual contains quotes from a Seventh-Day Adventist professor Harold G. Coffin which refutes evolution and states that the fossil record tells us that [...] "complicated living things suddenly (without warning, so to speak) began to exist on the earth". The 2003 edition states that there is no official stance on the age of the Earth but that evidence for a longer process is substantial and very few people believe the earth was actually created in the space of one week. However, it gives an anti-evolution quote from Joseph Fielding Smith as a statement to help the reader understand the church's stance on man's origins. The quote states that the theory of organic evolution is incompatible and inconsistent with revelations from God and that to accept it is to <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> of salvation. [...] It should be noted however that this quote from President Smith, stemming from his book, [...] "Man, His Origin, and Destiny" [...] represents his personal opinion and not official Church doctrine.|$|E
