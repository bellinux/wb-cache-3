In the following weeks <b>ram</b> A produces semen the usual way, but is using the stem cells of <b>ram</b> B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of <b>ram</b> B rather than those of his own. <b>Ram</b> A therefore has effectively become a surrogate <b>ram.</b>|$|E

25|$|Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (<b>rams).</b> Homosexual <b>rams</b> (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual <b>rams.</b> In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual <b>rams</b> and 9 homosexual <b>rams</b> were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 <b>rams,</b> with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual <b>rams</b> displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus <b>rams,</b> whereas homosexual <b>rams</b> showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual <b>rams</b> is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual <b>rams.</b> The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual <b>rams</b> than in heterosexual <b>rams,</b> so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of <b>rams.</b> In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual <b>rams</b> than in homosexual <b>rams.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers.

40|$|Prolactin (PRL) {{concentrations}} were measured in serum of intact <b>rams,</b> castrate <b>rams,</b> and steroid-treated castrate <b>rams</b> {{to determine whether}} testicular steroids influence PRL secretion in this species. Testosterone was administered to castrate <b>rams</b> by subdermal Silastic implants providing serum testosterone concentrations {{similar to those found}} in intact rams; estradiol was administered similarly to castrate <b>rams,</b> providing a ten-fold elevation of serum estradiol. Testosterone and estradiol implants decreased serum LH to concentrations found in intact <b>rams,</b> whereas estradiol, but not testosterone, effectively increased basal concentrations of PRL. This effect was most apparent when animals were exposed to short photoperiods (8 hours light: 16 hours darkness). When 5 g of thyrotropin releasing hormone were injected into these animals, peak PRL {{concentrations were}} lowest in castrate <b>rams</b> and highest in estradiol-treated castrate <b>rams.</b> PRL responses in testosterone- treated castrate <b>rams</b> and intact <b>rams</b> to the releasing hormone were intermediate. Results for peak PRL concentrations and area under the PRL response curves were similar. In conclusion, testicular steroids are suggested {{to play an important role}} in the regulation of PRL secretion in mature <b>rams...</b>|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping <b>rams</b> accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower <b>rams</b> so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the <b>rams</b> can then be bled off allowing the upper <b>rams</b> to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper <b>rams.</b> Once the collar is in between the <b>rams,</b> the upper <b>rams</b> are closed and pressure is equalised either side of the lower <b>rams.</b> The lower <b>rams</b> are then safely opened and the collar is lowered through the <b>rams.</b>|$|R
