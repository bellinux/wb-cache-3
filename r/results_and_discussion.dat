30|$|Based on the {{simulation}} <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussions,</b> several final remarks and {{conclusions can be}} drawn as follows.|$|R
40|$|<b>Result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> {{sections}} play {{an important}} role in theses as one of the research reports. Writing <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section is often bothersome for some writers, it also holds true for the undergraduate students as novice writers. This study aimed to investigate the rhetorical moves of <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section of theses together with the lexical expressions that are written by the undergradu ate students. An understanding of rhetorical moves used by the undergraduate students in writing their <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section is hoped can give input for academic writing’s instructor to improve students’ writing ability in the future, particularly in writing the <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> sections of theses. The research method is descriptive qualitative study with discourse analysis method to identify the moves. Seven undergraduate theses of experimental studies were selected as subject of the research. The <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section then were analyzed based on the result model proposed by Paltridge & Starfield (2007) for <b>result</b> section <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> model proposed by Dudley - Evans (1994) for discussion section. Some samples of proposition of result a nd discussion section were also used to identify the lexical expressions in the <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section. Then, the rhetorical moves were rated by the writer and two other raters for triangulation. The results showed that there are no linear rhetorica l moves emerging in the result section. At the same time, it was found that there is cyclical structure that mostly arises from the part or stages of investigation of experimental research. Whereas in the discussion sections there are also no linear rhetor ical moves found. Moreover, one unanticipated finding showed that not all discussion sections under study have cyclical structure. Only three discussion sections have cyclical structure and only one of them employed key cycle as mentioned by Dudley - Evans (1994). For the lexical expression, it was found that in the result sections the lexical expressions are more obvious in showing the function of the moves. Therefore the moves in result section are easily identified by its lexical expressions. While in the discussion section the lexical expressions are less obvious therefore in order to identify the moves the researcher used comprehension of the text. In conclusion, the rhetorical moves of <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section of theses written by the English depar tment undergraduate students of UNESA, did not follow the model proposed by Paltdrige & Starfiled (2007) for <b>result</b> section <b>and</b> Dudley - Evans (1994) for discussion section, since the rhetorical moves were not ordered like the order of each model. Accordingl y, based on the present result, it is necessary for the academic writing instructors or teachers to provide clear instructional strategies and exercises to improve the undergraduate students ability in writing their <b>result</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section...|$|R
50|$|The formats of journal {{articles}} vary, but many follow the general IMRAD scheme {{recommended by the}} International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Such articles begin with an abstract, which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The introduction describes the background for the research including a discussion of similar research. The materials and methods or experimental section provides specific details of how the research was conducted. The <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> section describes the outcome and implications of the research, and the conclusion section places the research in context and describes avenues for further exploration.|$|E
50|$|The IMRAD format {{has been}} adopted by a {{steadily}} increasing number of academic journals since {{the first half of}} the 20th century. The IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in the sciences, most notably in empirical biomedicine. The structure of most public health journal articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD structure originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide range of disciplines. Many scientific journals now not only prefer this structure but also use the IMRAD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the “Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals” issued by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (previously called the Vancouver guidelines): The text of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, <b>Results,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Discussion.</b> This so-called “IMRAD” structure is not an arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery. Long articles may need subheadings within some sections (especially <b>Results</b> <b>and</b> <b>Discussion)</b> to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.The IMRAD structure is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the American Psychological Association (APA style). The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the social, educational and behavioral sciences.|$|E

5000|$|Following its {{move into}} NRA control, Arms and the Man, which had {{primarily}} focused on shooting competition <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> of rifles, began {{to expand into}} hunting stories, ballistics, handgunning, shotgunning and new shooting products In June 1923, the publication changed its name for the fourth and final time to the current title, The American Rifleman. In {{the aftermath of the}} name change, the scale of the magazine widened and four influential writers that would help shape the future of both The American Rifleman and shooting sports in general joined: Julian S. Hatcher, Charles Askins, Townsend Whelen and C.B. Lister. Also during this time, Hatcher began his column [...] "The Dope Bag," [...] a write-in question and answer column, which still continues today. By 1928, [...] "The Dope Bag" [...] had grown to 3 staff members, answering over 5000 letters that year. The prominence of rifle shooting, as well as the decision to include all NRA members with free copies of the magazine, helped boost the circulation to over 30,000, making the publication self-sustainable {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|E
5000|$|Data from {{intensive}} mist netting mark-recapture {{programs on}} understory birds from isolated forest reserves {{were compared to}} pre-isolation data from the same reserves to investigate changes related to isolation from continuous forest (Bierregard and Lovejoy 1989). Birds surveyed were {{from a variety of}} ecological guilds, including nectivores, insectivores, frugivores, obligatory army ant followers, forest edge specialists and flocking species. The periodic sampling by mist netting capture program provided the quantitative basis for this project. Reserves of varied sizes (1 and 10 hectare) within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project site were sampled with transects of tethered mist nets once every three or four weeks. Capture rates from isolated reserves were compared to pre-isolation rates to measure changes in population size and/or avian activity due to isolation (Bierregard and Lovejoy 1989). Data was analyzed in the following ways: capture rates per net hour as a function off time since isolation, percent recapture as a function of time since isolation, abundance distribution of species against the species rank by abundance, percent individuals banded according to species and feeding strategy, and finally, capture rates per net hour in isolated reserves against capture rates per net hour in continuous forests.
