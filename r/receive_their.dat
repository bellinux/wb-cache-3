In March 1943, the USCG decided {{that there was a}} need to establish its own training center for the indoctrination of recruits and to provide specialized training programs. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida; it was leased, and then commissioned as a training station, on 23 May 1943.

It was the only U.S. military service that trained women officer candidates at its own academy.|$|E

If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E
5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role. The deputy of a Clan is {{generally}} in charge of less urgent, but still important duties, such as deciding which cats will go on a hunting patrol and which will check the borders. Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> nine lives from StarClan.|$|E

In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E

After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 2004-05, Tubas had twelve schools; {{four for}} males, three for females and five co-educational. There were 4,924 {{students}} and 191 teachers. In addition, six kindergartens {{are located in}} the city, and have a total of 620 pupils. In 1997, the literacy rate was 86%; females comprised 78.3% of the illiterate population. Of the literate population, 25.7% completed elementary education, 23.3% completed preparatory education and 22.1% completed secondary or higher education. Many students throughout the Jordan Valley <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> education in Tubas. The Al-Quds Open University based in Jerusalem, has a campus in Tubas known as Al-Quds Open University-Tubas Educational Region. In 2006, 1,789 students were enrolled in the university, it had 90 professors and 24 other employees.|$|E
5|$|In desperation, Mary {{decides to}} tell the truth to Gopalam and Ammi. To save their jobs, Rao makes up a far-fetched story that Mary is possessed by the soul of a Christian woman named after the mother of Jesus. Gopalam lies that he will marry Sita off to Rao. Raju, like Gopalam, is unaware of Rao's deception. In love with Sita, he wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary for help in {{teaching}} music (which ends in disaster). At the end of their first month at the school, Rao and Mary <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> salaries and Mary repays her debt.|$|E

5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} to amount to $30–40million (£20–25million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> bonuses {{before the other}} stakeholders. The remaining profit is to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits are {{to be returned to}} that body.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Baltimore (which is an {{independent}} city) the county is the default unit of local government. Under Maryland law, counties exercise powers reserved in most other states at the municipal or state levels, so there is little incentive for a community to incorporate. Many of the state's most populous and economically important communities, such as Bethesda, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Towson are unincorporated and <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> municipal services from the county. In fact, there are no incorporated municipalities at all in Baltimore County or Howard County, and the state's largest county, Montgomery County, only has three incorporated municipalities. The county-equivalent is also the provider of public schools—school districts as a separate level of government do not exist in Maryland.|$|E

Their last season in the Southern Association was 1961. After sitting out the 1962 season, the Vols returned for a final season {{as a part of the}} South Atlantic League in 1963. Over their 62-year existence, the Vols competed at four class levels: Class B (1901), Class A (1902–1935), Class A1 (1936–1945), and Double-A (1946–1961, 1963). They served as a farm club for eight major league teams.|$|E

As a College academic department, the school's undergraduate offerings are open to any Dartmouth student, including non-majors.|$|E
5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 50; {{they had to}} have a college degree, or two years of college and two years of professional or business experience.
