5|$|Thousands {{of people}} {{evacuated}} from northern {{areas of the}} Philippines as Ivan approached. Power was shut off prior to the storm {{to reduce the risk}} of electrocution. Four flights were cancelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines due to the storm. Residents in Taiwan were advised to take precautions for Typhoon Ivan, though autumn typhoons are rare in the island. Vessels were urged to stay at port due to rough seas throughout the Philippines. Disaster agencies were put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles</b> were prepped.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm moved inland, 700 civil defense {{personnel}} were deployed to the affected region; however, due to damaged roads and poor travel conditions, they struggled to reach isolated regions. The Nicaraguan army supplied relief crews with four helicopters and two AN-2 aircraft for damage surveillance and search-and-rescue missions {{in the wake of}} Ida. The government of Nicaragua allocated roughly $4.4million in relief funds for those affected by the storm. Several agencies from the United Nations provided residents affected by the storm with relief supplies and donated disaster funds to the country. The United Nations Population Fund provided $49,000 in funds; the World Food Programme deployed several <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles</b> and logistics teams; UNICEF also provided logistics assistance in the country. OCHA provided $2million in relief funds; the Government of Sweden provided 400,000 Swedish kronor ($55,946USD) for sanitation and health supplies; the Netherlands Red Cross also donated 20,000 euros ($27,226USD) for non-food items.|$|E

25|$|Also, in Taiwan, another contradiction was {{the radio}} call signs {{for the fire}} trucks or <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For reasons to avoid {{unwanted}} attentions and to remain secrecy, all radio call signs for all police vehicles were uncorrelated with the missions of the subject vehicles, unnecessarily including fire trucks, <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and ambulances of fire brigades. When fire police teams were responding to an emergency situation, these confusing call signs inevitably led to chaos and time delay. A successful fire chief, Chao Kang (趙鋼), convinced the police high command to rearrange the radio call sign assignment for all fire vehicles. Chao Kang then was appointed as the Commissioner of Taiwan Provincial Fire Administration, and the Director-General of National Fire Agency from 10 September 2000 to September 2002.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the basic concept had been well developed, and the {{hovercraft}} {{had found a}} number of niche roles where its combination of features were advantageous.

25|$|Hampering rescue efforts was a six-foot ditch beside and {{parallel}} to runway 27 running {{the length of}} the runway. <b>Rescue</b> <b>vehicles</b> were unable to cross this ditch, though they could have entered {{at either end of the}} runway.

25|$|Fire and {{emergency}} medical services generally use red lights with amber and white as optional colors. Vehicles operated by fire departments, such as fire engines and heavy <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles,</b> prominently use red, a color with strong cultural associations with the fire service, along with some amber and white. Some more modern fire trucks and airport crash units use a yellow-green color, however.|$|E

25|$|At 11:54, Kalmi {{left the}} {{school with the}} {{education}} welfare officer and stopped between the building and a nearby pond {{to talk on the}} telephone.

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the explosion, even before the Kremlin had been informed of the submarine's sinking, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Defense Secretary William Cohen were told that Kursk had sunk. Once officially informed, the British government, along with France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Norway offered help, and the United States offered the use of one of its two deep submergence <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles,</b> but the Russian government refused all foreign assistance. Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev told the American Embassy that the rescue was well under way. The Russian Navy told reporters that a rescue was imminent.|$|E

25|$|Currently NSW Ambulance {{operates}} six primary rescue {{units in}} rural NSW and employs over 200 rescue officers. The rural stations are located at Rutherford, Tamworth, Singleton, Cowra, Bomaderry and Wagga Wagga. Officers are trained for {{all forms of}} rescue including, road crash, vertical, confined space, swift water, trench, industrial, technical and domestic to name a few. They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and radiological procedures. Rescue training commences with the recruitment of up to 12 officers, who are selected to undergo a rigorous six week training course. On successful completion of the course, officers are then rostered to rescue units where training continues with a minimum eight hours of structured training per month. Officers are also required to undergo a recertification program. Ambulance <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles</b> are equipped with {{a vast array of}} equipment including motorised hydraulic tools, air tools, hand held global positioning satellite units, fibre optic search scopes, portable atmospheric testing units, inflatable boat, lighting and breathing apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Early on 17 March, TEPCO {{requested}} {{another attempt}} by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST. The riot police used a water cannon to spray water onto {{the top of the}} reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles</b> were involved in spraying operations. Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure. Lighting in the control room was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and purification system. On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3 – where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed no significant change in radiation levels and the smoke subsided later the same day.|$|E

500|$|The series' {{title was}} derived from a letter written by Gerry's brother, Lionel, while he had been serving {{overseas}} as an RAF flight sergeant during World War II. While stationed in Arizona, Lionel had made reference to Thunderbird Field, a nearby United States Army Air Forces base. Drawn to the [...] "punchiness" [...] of [...] "Thunderbirds", Anderson dropped his working title of [...] "International Rescue" [...] and renamed both the series and IR's <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which had previously been designated Rescues 1 to 5. His inspiration for the launch sequences of Thunderbirds 1, 2 and 3 originated from contemporary United States Air Force launch procedure: Anderson had learnt how the Strategic Air Command would keep its pilots on permanent standby, seated in the cockpits of their aircraft and ready for take-off at a moment's notice.|$|E
500|$|On Skyship One, Alan, Penelope and Parker battle Foster and his {{associates}} in a gunfight and kill {{two of the five}} White Ghost operatives, but are forced to surrender when Tin-Tin is captured as a hostage. The [...] "Gravity Compensation Machine" [...] has also been damaged in the fighting, causing the airship to lose altitude. Crossing the English coast, it crashes into an interception mast at a missile base in Dover. With the airship balanced precariously on top of the mast and its anti-gravity field failing, it is up to Scott, Virgil and Brains to rescue all on board before it collapses onto the base. The Thunderbirds cannot get close enough without their jetwash tipping the airship off balance, and all of their <b>rescue</b> <b>vehicles</b> are too heavy. Gordon proposes that Alan's Tiger Moth, in storage at the NWAC Headquarters, is light enough to land on the airship without precipitating its fall.|$|E
