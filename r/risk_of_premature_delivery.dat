40|$|CONTEXT: Premature {{delivery}} {{is an important}} risk factor for child mortality and psychiatric, metabolic, and cardiovascular disease later in life. In the majority of cases, the cause of prematurity cannot be identified. Currently, it remains controversial whether abnormal maternal thyroid function during pregnancy increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> Therefore, we investigated the relation between maternal serum thyroid parameters and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> in a large prospective population-based study. DESIGN: Serum TSH, free T 4 (FT 4), T 4, and TPO antibodies (TPOAbs) were determined during early pregnancy in 5971 pregnant women from the Generation R study. Data were available on maternal age, parity, smoking, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, maternal anthropometrics, and urinary iodine levels. RESULTS: Of all women, 5. 0 % had a premature delivery (< 37 weeks), 4. 4 % had a spontaneous premature delivery, and 1. 4 % had a very premature delivery (< 34 weeks). High TSH levels and subclinical hypothyroidism were associated with premature delivery but not with spontaneous premature delivery. Maternal hypothyroxinemia {{was associated with a}} 2. 5 -fold increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery,</b> a 3. 4 -fold increased risk of spontaneous premature delivery, and a 3. 6 -fold increased risk of very premature delivery (all P <. 01). TPOAb positivity was associated with a 1. 7 -fold increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> (P =. 01), a 2. 1 -fold increased risk of spontaneous premature delivery (P =. 02), and a 2. 5 -fold increased risk of very premature delivery (P =. 04). These effects remained similar after correction for TSH and FT 4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroxinemia and TPOAb positivity are associated with an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> The increased risk in TPOAb-positive women seems to be independent of thyroid function...|$|E

40|$|Context: Thyroperoxidase {{antibody}} (TPOAb) positivity is {{the main}} risk factor for thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and is consistently associated with premature delivery. However, the underlying mechanism is currently unknown. We hypothesized that TPOAb positivity may interfere with gestational thyroid stimulation induced by the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Design, Setting, and Participants: Thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT 4), TPOAbs, and/or hCG concentrations were measured in early and late pregnancy of 7587 pregnant women from 2 Dutch population-based prospective cohorts (n = 5924, Generation R study; n = 1663, Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and the First Postpartum Year study). Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Thyroidal response to hCG stimulation, premature delivery. Results:In TPOAb-negative women, hCG was positively associated with FT 4 and negatively with TSH in both cohorts (P 0. 40; P for interaction TPOAb positive vs negative â‰¤ 0. 05). Overall, TPOAb positivity {{was associated with a}} 1. 7 -fold higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> TPOAb-positive women with an adequate response of FT 4 to hCG (high FT 4 concentration with high hCG concentration) did not have a higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> In contrast, TPOAb-positive women with an inadequate FT 4 response to hCG (low FT 4 concentration with high hCG concentration) had a 2. 2 - to 2. 8 -fold higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> Conclusion: TPOAb-positive women display an impaired thyroidal response to hCG and this may explain the higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> in these women. This abnormal response in TPOAb-positive women might suggest that these women require a different treatment approach than TPOAb-negative women...|$|E

40|$|Preterm {{birth is}} the most {{important}} cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. In this review, we review potential risk factors associated with preterm birth and the subsequent management to prevent preterm birth in low and high risk women with a singleton or multiple pregnancy. A history of preterm birth is considered the most important risk factor for preterm birth in subsequent pregnancy. General risk factors with a much lower impact include ethnicity, low socio-economic status, maternal weight, smoking, and periodontal status. Pregnancy-related characteristics, including bacterial vaginosis and asymptomatic bacteriuria, appear to be of limited value in the prediction of preterm birth.

40|$|A {{successful}} {{pregnancy is}} characterised {{by an increase}} in Th 2 cytokines and suppression of Th 1 cytokine production. A Th 1 to Th 2 cytokine shift is also observed in the disease progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV viremia, increases CD 4 + cell counts and counteracts the Th 1 to Th 2 shift. We hypothesised that the increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> reported in HIV-infected, HAART-treated pregnant women is mediated through changes in the cytokine environment in pregnancy. Here, we present results relating to levels of interleukin (IL) - 2 (Th 1) and IL- 10 (Th 2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) measured three times during pregnancy in 49 HIV-infected women. Slope values representing the trend of repeated cytokine (IL- 2 -PHA, IL- 2 -Env, IL- 10 -PHA and IL- 10 -Env) measurements within women during pregnancy were estimated and median values compared by prematurity and HAART use. Multiple regression adjusted for HAART and cytokine slope clarified the additional and independent effect of HAART on prematurity risk. Results showed favourable immunomodulation induced by HAART with increased IL- 2 and decreased IL- 10. HAART use and IL- 10 -Env slopes were not significantly associated with prematurity risk, but each unit increase in IL- 2 -PHA slope was associated with an 8 % increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> (AOR, 1. 08; 95 % CI, 1. 0 â€“ 1. 17; pÂ =Â  0. 005).

Aims: In order to confirm or dismiss this hypothesis, which has significant public health implications, we carried out a large population based study on a stratified sample from the whole Campania region. Patients: During {{the period of the}} study, 5345 women were admitted to the OBS-GYN wards regional network: 5055 (95 %) were enrolled in the study. Methods: Antihuman IgA class antitissue transglutaminase (TGASE) antibodies were tested by an ELISA method. Endomysial antibodies (EMA) were investigated on thin sections of human cord blood by an immunofluorescence test. The HLA class II DQA 1 * 0501 /DQB 1 * 02 and DQA 1 * 0301 / DQB 1 * 0302 haplotypes were assessed using the Eurospital Eu-DQ kit. Duodenal biopsy was not considered feasible by the ethics committee for pregnant women near delivery. Results: Fifty one of 5055 patients had confirmed positive results. We added to these 12 women with known coeliac disease, giving a prevalence rate for coeliac disease of 1 : 80 (exactly the value observed during the first study). Comparing the 51 TGASE positive with 4997 negative women, we did not observe an excess <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> abortion, <b>premature</b> <b>delivery,</b> small birth weight, or intrauterine growth retardation.

However, there are ongoing concerns about {{adverse effects of}} GC treatment on the developing human brain, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying GC-induced brain injury are unclear. Here, we identified what {{we believe to be}} novel cross-antagonistic interactions of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and GC signaling in proliferating mouse cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs). Chronic GC treatment (from P 0 through P 7) in mouse pups inhibited Shh-induced proliferation and upregulation of expression of N-myc, Gli 1, and D-type cyclin protein in CGNPs. Conversely, acute GC treatment (on P 7 only) caused transient apoptosis. Shh signaling antagonized these effects of GCs, in part by induction of 11 Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 Î²HSD 2). Importantly, 11 Î²HSD 2 antagonized the effects of the GCs corticosterone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone, but not the synthetic GC dexamethasone. Our findings indicate that Shh signaling is protective in the setting of GC-induced mouse neonatal brain injury. Furthermore, they led us to propose that 11 Î²HSD 2 -sensitive GCs (e. g., hydrocortisone) should be used in preference to dexamethasone in neonatal human infants because of the potential for reduced neurotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase- 2) is an {{important}} enzyme in many biologic processes. Prevailing data reveal a functional polymorphism at bp - 1575 in the human gelatinase A promoter, which is associated with diminished transcriptional response to estrogen and genetic fitness. The reason for the disequilibrium of the - 1575 AA genotype within the Hardy-Weinberg distribution remains unknown. We therefore screened full-term and premature newborns to investigate whether the - 1575 AA genotype might increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery,</b> which {{is often associated with}} decreased survival of infants. Methods: DNA from 959 full-term and 358 premature newborns of North German Caucasian origin was amplified from dried blood on filter paper used for standard newborn screening in Germany. Genotypes were defined by restriction digest of PCR products. Results: No statistically significant difference in Hardy-Weinberg distribution was discovered between full-term and premature infants. However, a trend towards the expected number of homozygous mutants was seen in premature females. Conclusions: Our results warrant the hypothesis that the disequilibrium in - 1575 AA mutational variant might be due to early abortions; the reduced responsiveness to estrogen stimulation in this genotype might be responsible for inadequate estrogen-stimulated gelatinase A enhancement during trophoblast invasion and uterine implantation of the embryo. Further genotyping of couples seeking help from fertility clinics might help to answer this question. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{mortality}} and morbidity rates of newborn children which mainly {{depend on the}} status of their somatic development, are central measures for assessing the health condition of a population and in particular of the quality of neonatal and obstetric care. The chances to survive <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> infants are directly co-determined by the gestational age and by the weight at birth; and both, the perinatal {{mortality and}} the respective morbidity, are primarily burdened by <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> Non-medical <b>risk</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> are frequent among women of childbearing age, many of which, however, may be influenced in a positive way by prevention and intervention measures. Purpose: A retrospect study investigated the influences of two selected social factors - professional activity and partnership status of the mother - on the duration of pregnancy and the child's weight at birth. Method: The data stem from the "Perinatologischen Basis- Erhebungsbogen" (perinatologic basic questionnaires) of those born in the Federal Republic of Germany between 1995 and 1997. For reasons of neutralization of relevant co-factors, the impact of the investigated factors was each calculated by applying specific evaluation models. The results, based on an unusually large number of test persons, de facto turned out to be highly significant for all differences stated. Results: Concerning the impact of the mother's activity within the overall collective, it was shown that the outcomes of pregnancy (both related to the weight at birth and the rate <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery)</b> generally are all the more favorable the higher the professional qualification of the mother. It was also shown that with non-single mothers the rates <b>of</b> hypotrophic and <b>premature</b> infants were lower than with lone mothers. The actual execution of a profession during pregnancy, however, had hardly any influence on the outcome of the pregnancy. Conclusions: The measures of maternity protection appear to be effective. Therefore, the approaches to prevention lie with the social and socio-economic parameters rather than in the field of occupational health care. Here, increased utilization of preventive examinations and appropriate interventions - in particular by those groups of pregnant women showing increased risks (as for instance women belonging to a low social stratum, having a low level of education, and/or insufficient occupational qualification, as well as lone mothers) could significantly reduce the rates <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> and underweight infants...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Universal {{screening}} for thyroid diseases during pregnancy is controversial. Targeted screening does not identify all women with thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are suspected {{to be associated}} with an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> fetal loss, <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> and hypothyroidism. The aim of our study was to assess the rationale behind universal screening and propose thyroxine treatment in particular cases. METHODS: Between January 2008 and May 2009, 537 consecutive iodine-supplemented women with a singleton pregnancy [441 TPOAb- controls and 96 TPOAb+ women (47 nontreated and 49 treated) ] were evaluated using thyroid and obstetric parameters. According to our algorithm for thyroid screening in pregnancy, if thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) exceeded 1 mU/l in TPOAb+ women, 50 Âµg of levothyroxine (L-T 4) was prescribed. RESULTS: The miscarriage rate was significantly higher in the nontreated TPOAb+ group compared with the treated group (16 vs. 0 %; p = 0. 02). Compared to the control group, TSH in TPOAb+ patients was higher at the first prenatal visit prior to L-T 4 treatment (p < 0. 01), while free thyroxine was higher than in the control group after the 20 th week (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the potential benefit of universal screening and L-T 4 treatment for autoimmune thyroid disease during pregnancy.

40|$|Maternal malaria is {{associated}} with reduced birth weight, which {{is thought to be}} effected through placental insufÂ®ciency, which leads to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The impact of malaria on preterm delivery is unclear. The effects of placental malariaÂ±related changes on birth weight and gestational age were studied in 1177 mothers (and their newborns) from Tanzania. Evidence of malaria infection was found in 75. 5 % of placental samples. Only massive mononuclear intervillous inÂ¯ammatory inÂ®ltration (MMI) was associated with in-creased risk of low birth weight (odds ratio [OR], 4. 0). Maternal parasitized red blood cells and perivillous Â®brin deposition both were associated independently with increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> (OR, 3. 2; OR, 2. 1, respectively). MMI is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of IUGR in malaria-infected placentas. This study also shows that placental malaria causes prematurity even in high-transmission areas. The impact of maternal malaria on infant mortality may be greater than was thought previously. Despite recommendations that malaria be controlled among pregnant women in endemic areas [1], malaria during preg-nancy remains a signiÂ®cant cause of maternal and infant mor-tality and morbidity. Problems related to compliance with drug regimens and the use of partially effective antimalarials are some of the reasons that have led many countries to question, and in many cases abandon, malaria control for pregnant women.

40|$|Fetal {{growth is}} {{compromised}} in animal models with high cortisol availability. In healthy pregnancies, the fetus is protected from high circulating cortisol levels by the placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 beta-HSD 2), which is reduced in preeclampsia. We hypothesized increased placental cortisol availability in preeclampsia as missing link to fetal growth restriction and prematurity. Placental tissue {{was obtained from}} 39 pregnant women dichotomized normotensive (n = 16) or preeclamptic (n = 23). Placental steroid hormone metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Apparent 11 beta-HSD 2 enzyme activity was calculated as substrate to product ratio. Estradiol and pregnandiol positively correlated with gestational age. Cortisol was virtually absent in 93. 8 % of controls, yet detectable in 79. 3 % of preeclamptic samples resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 0. 019 (95 % CI 0. 002 - 0. 185) {{for the presence of}} placental cortisol. Apparent 11 beta-HSD 2 activity directly correlated with birth weight (R 2 = 0. 16; p < 0. 02) and gestational age (R 2 = 0. 11; p < 0. 04) ensuing a reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> (OR 0. 12; 95 % CI 0. 02 - 0. 58).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} the association between maternal underweight and preterm delivery. Using the MEDITECH database from Liverpool Womens Hospital we were able to look at women booking on for ante natal care between January 2005 and December 2007. This gave access to 23651 subjects. These subjects were grouped according to pre pregnancy BMI into five groups; severe-moderately underweight (BMI 30). The gestation time of the pregnancy was classified into four groups with standard term delivery being > 37 weeks gestation. The three classifications of premature delivery are; preterm delivery (32 - 36 weeks & 6 days), very preterm delivery (28 - 31 weeks and 6 days) and extremely premature delivery (< 27 weeks and 6 days). Birth outcome was also investigated as associated with preterm delivery. Association between pre pregnancy maternal BMI and both gestation time and birth outcome were examined, with reference to maternal age, smoking behaviour and parity. Results: Women with pre pregnancy underweight were at increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> The risk of still birth was also slightly increased with severe-moderate underweight. There were also interesting findings on smoking and pre pregnancy underweight. Severe-moderate underweight (BMI < 18. 5) shows increased risk of both premature delivery and stillbirth.

40|$|Antineoplastic {{drugs are}} {{pharmaceuticals}} {{commonly used to}} treat cancer (and some non-neoplastic diseases), which are generally referred to as 'chemotherapy'. Oncology nurses are exposed to these drugs via the skin of hands during daily nursing activities, even when protective gloves are being used. Results of tests on bulk and surface contamination samples confirmed that patients intravenously treated with cyclophosphamide excrete the unmetabolized drug. The introduction of new guidelines and regulations on working with antineoplastic drugs, the use of more closed preparation- and infusion-systems and the consequent growing awareness of nurses working with antineoplastic drugs has decreased exposure to antineoplastic drugs considerably. Due {{to an increase in}} number of chemotherapy treatments and centralisation of chemotherapy to specialised departments in hospitals, the average weekly exposure level of an oncology nurse has not markedly changed over time, while low and high exposures occur less frequent. The identification of the patient as a source of contamination and exposure makes it very complicated to further reduce exposure to antineoplastic drugs of nurses. Based on current dermal exposure levels to antineoplastic drugs approximately 50 % of the population of oncology nurses have an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a prolonged time to pregnancy compared with non-exposed nurses, and around 10 % of Dutch oncology nurses have an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a <b>premature</b> <b>delivery</b> and delivering a child with a low birth weight. Other effects on reproduction like spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, gender of offspring, and congenital malformations were not related to exposure to antineoplastic drugs. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> non-lymphocytic leukaemia among oncology nurses after being exposed for 40 years to current dermal exposure levels of cyclophosphamide was estimated to be well below the target risk (one extra cancer case per 10 million per year) and the maximum tolerable risk (one extra cancer case per 100, 000 per year) in the Netherlands. However, this estimate is for cyclophosphamide only and in a worst-case exposure scenario the estimated leukaemia risk exceeded the target risk, so the cancer risk among oncology nurses exposed to antineoplastic drugs should not be ignored. The identification of occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs in sectors outside the hospital environment (i. e. veterinary medicine, home care, nursing homes and industrial laundries) showed that the number of workers potentially exposed to antineoplastic drugs is larger than previously estimated. Exposure levels in these sectors can potentially be higher than in the hospital environment, because exposure routes are complex and awareness of the hazard (and therefore use of protective measures) is limited...|$|R
40|$|Bacground/Aim. Preterm {{delivery}} {{is one of}} the most common complications in pregnancy, and it is the major cause (75 - 80 %) of all neonatal deaths. Bacterial vaginosis predisposes to an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> preterm <b>delivery,</b> <b>premature</b> rupture <b>of</b> membrane and miscarriage. In this syndrome normal vaginal lactobacilli, which produce protective H 2 O 2, are reduced and replaced with anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria and others. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of bacterial vaginosis on the week of delivery and biochemical markers of inflammation in the serum. Methods. A total of 186 pregnant women were included into this study, between the week 16 and 19 of pregnancy. In the study group there were 76 pregnant women with diagnosed bacterial vaginosis by the criteria based on vaginal Gram-stain Nugent score and Amsel criteria. In the control group there were 110 healthy women with normal vaginal flora. Ultrasound examination was performed in both groups. Vaginal fluid and blood samples were taken to determine biochemical markers with colorimetric methods. Results. The week of delivery was statistically significantly shorter in the study group and the levels of biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen in the serum) were statistically significantly higher in women with bacterial vaginosis comparing to the control group. Also the levels of uric acid and white blood cells in the serum were higher in the study group compared to the control one. Conclusion. Our study indicates that the pregnancy complicated with bacterial vaginosis ends much earlier than the pregnancy without it. Also, higher levels of biochemical markers of inflammation in the serum in the study group, similarly to results of other studies, suggest that pathophysiological processes responsible for preterm delivery can begin very early in pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acute {{appendicitis}} {{during pregnancy}} {{may be associated}} with serious maternal and/or fetal complications. To date, the optimal clinical approach to the management of pregnant women suspected of having acute appendicitis is subject to debate. The purpose of this retrospective study was to provide recommendations for prospective clinical management of pregnant patients with suspected appendicitis. Method: Case records of all pregnant patients suspected of having appendicitis whom underwent appendectomy at our hospital between 1990 and 2010 were reviewed. Results: Appendicitis was histologically verified in fifteen of twenty-one pregnant women, of whom six were diagnosed with perforated appendicitis. Maternal morbidity was seen in two cases. Premature delivery occurred in two out of six cases with perforated appendicitis cases and two out of six cases following a negative appendectomy. Perinatal mortality did not occur. Conclusion: Both (perforated) appendicitis and negative appendectomy during pregnancy are associated with a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> Clinical presentation and imaging remains vital in deciding whether surgical intervention is indicated. We recommend to cautiously weigh the risks of delay until correct diagnosis with associated increased risk of appendiceal perforation and the risk of unnecessary surgical intervention. Based upon current literature, we recommend clinicians to consider an MRI following an inconclusive or negative abdominal ultrasound aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy to reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of acute appendicitis should be strived for to avoid unnecessary exploration and to aim for timely surgical intervention in pregnant women suspected of having appendicitis.

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} antenatal corticosteroids (ANCs) {{policies in}} European obstetric units {{and to determine}} factors that influence {{the use of multiple}} courses. Methods: 641 obstetricians from obstetric departments covering a geographical area in 14 European countries responded to a questionnaire on ANCs policies. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that were related to the use of multiple ANCs courses. Results: The survey response rate was 76 % (inter-country range 33 - 94 %) : 11 % (0 - 50 %) of the respondents started ANCs from 23 to 24 wk gestation, 82 % from 24 to 28 wk (50 - 100 %) and 7 % from 28 to 36 wk (0 - 32 %). Eighty-five percent of the units (63 - 100 %) used multiple ANCs courses. After adjustment for country, number of infants delivered at 24 - 32 wk annually in the unit, NICU and maternal hypertension, maternal hypertension tended to be an explicative factor (OR 1. 97; 95 % CI: 0. 75 - 5. 17). Conclusions: The high proportion of departments that initiated ANCs between 24 and 28 wk of gestation is consistent with the high incidence of neonatal morbidity and mortality in that age range. Multiple courses are overwhelmingly prescribed in Europe, although their risk/benefit ratio compared with a single dose is not yet known. The likelihood of using repeated courses of ANCs {{may be related to the}} presence of maternal hypertension, and this highlights the importance of closely monitoring women at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|E
40|$|AIM: Several {{studies have}} shown that preterm delivery, a primary cause of {{perinatal}} mortality and morbidity, is more frequent in HIV-positive women. This study aimed to determine factors associated with prematurity in HIV-infected women and identify risks for which specific interventions could be targeted. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected in a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of different zidovudine prophylaxis durations for the prevention of perinatal HIV transmission in Thailand. Characteristics associated with prematurity - delivery before 37 weeks [...] were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and were subsequently used to identify subgroups of women at risk. RESULTS: Among 979 women, independent prematurity risk factors were: viral load 4. 5 log copies/mL; hemoglobin > 11. 5 g/dL; weight gain < 0. 25 kg/week; and body mass index < 20 kg/m 2. These factors allowed us to define four subgroups with an expected probability of prematurity increasing from 3 % to 30 %. The two subgroups with the highest expected probability of prematurity were considered to be 'at risk' as opposed to the two lowest (odds ratio = 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 7 - 4. 0) and the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction were 51 % and 71 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, four risk factors of preterm delivery were identified allowing the identification of subgroups at increasing risk of prematurity. Adequate nutrition and the provision of highly active antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy as recommended by the World Health Organization for the prevention of perinatal transmission for immunocompromised women in resource-constrained countries may reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>premature</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|E
