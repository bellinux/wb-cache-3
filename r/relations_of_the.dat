5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Following the Council of Trent (1563), Pope Pius V (1566–1572) drew up {{the terms}} {{for the office}} of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State, who was to handle the {{temporal}} affairs of the Papal States and the foreign <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy See. After abortively attempting to divide the duties of the Superintendent between four non-familial cardinals, Pius V acceded to the urgings of the College of Cardinals and his Spanish ambassador, and appointed his grandnephew, Michele Bonelli, as Superintendent, demarcating his duties with a papal bull of March 14, 1566. However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating any real autonomous power to Bonelli.|$|E
50|$|The inverse {{correspondence}} is {{the opposite}} one: given two relational structures, one encodes <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first in <b>the</b> variables <b>of</b> a constraint satisfaction problem, and <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second in <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same problem. For every tuple <b>of</b> every <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first structure, there is a constraint having as values <b>the</b> correspondent <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second structure. This way, a homomorphism corresponds to mapping every scope of every constraint (every tuple <b>of</b> every <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first structure) into a tuple in <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constraint (a tuple in <b>the</b> corresponding <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second structure).|$|R

5|$|One such {{success of}} {{diplomacy}} came with Willy Brandt's ascension to the West German chancellorship in 1969, as West GermanSoviet tension started to ease. Brandt's Ostpolitik policy, along with Brezhnev's détente, {{contributed to the}} signing of the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties in which West Germany recognized the state borders established following World War II, which included West German recognition of East Germany as an independent state. The foreign <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two countries continued to improve during Brezhnev's rule, and in the Soviet Union, where the memory of German brutality during World War II was still remembered, these developments contributed to greatly reducing the animosity the Soviet people felt towards Germany, and Germans in general.|$|E

5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|James Kaliokalani {{was born}} on May 29, 1835. His father High Chief Caesar Kapaʻakea and mother High Chiefess Analea Keohokālole were advisors to the reigning king Kamehameha III. His mother was the {{daughter}} of ʻAikanaka and Kamaʻeokalani while his father was the son of Kamanawa II (half-brother of ʻAikanaka) and Kamokuiki. From his parents, he descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, the royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both his mother and father, was one of the royal twins alongside Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Kaliokalani's family were collateral <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Kamehameha. Another relative of the family was the High Chiefess Kapiʻolani who plucked the ʻōhelo berries and openly defied the goddess Pele as a dramatic demonstration of her new faith in Christianity.|$|E
5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
