40|$|Hazardous, {{radioactive}} {{and other}} toxic substances have routinely been generated and subsequently disposed {{of in the}} shallow subsurface throughout the world. Many of today’s waste management techniques do not eliminate the problem, but rather only concentrate or contain the hazardous contaminants. <b>Residual</b> <b>hazards</b> result from the presence of hazardous and/or contaminated material that remains on-site following active operations or the completion of remedial actions. <b>Residual</b> <b>hazards</b> pose continued risk to humans and the environment and represent a significant and chronic problem that require continuous longterm management (i. e. > 1000 years). To protect human health and safeguard the natural environment, a sustainable system {{is required for the}} proper management of <b>residual</b> <b>hazards.</b> A sustainable system for the management of <b>residual</b> <b>hazards</b> will require the integration of engineered, institutional and land-use controls to isolate residual contaminants and thus minimize the associated hazards. Engineered controls are physical modifications to the natural setting and ecosystem, including the site, facility, and/or the residual materials themselves, in order to reduce or eliminate the potential for exposure to contaminants of concern (COCs). Institutional controls are processes, instruments, and mechanisms designed to influence human behavior and activity. System failure can involve hazardous material escaping from the confinement because of system degradation (i. e., chronic or acute degradation) or by externalintrusion of the biosphere into the contaminated material because of the loss of institutional control. An ongoing analysis of contemporary and historic sites suggests that the significance of the loss of institutional controls is a critical pathway because decisions made during the operations/remedial action phase, as well as decisions made throughout the <b>residual</b> <b>hazards</b> management period, are key to the longterm success of the prescribed system. In fact, given that society has become more reliant on and confident of engineered controls, there may be a growing tendency to be even less concerned with institutional controls...|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years the flood [...] related risk is {{increasing}} worldwide being inundations among the natural disaster which induces the maximum damage {{in terms of economic}} losses. In this study a methodology to map the flooding <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> due to levees failure events induced by piping in embankments protecting flood [...] prone areas is proposed. Ensemble simulations are used to account for uncertainties in location, geometry, and time evolution of the levee breaches. Probabilistic flooding hazard maps are generated combining the results of 192 inundation scenarios, simulated by using 1 D and 2 D hydrodynamic models. The methodology is applied considering 96 different locations and sizes of breache occurred along a 23 [...] km reach protected by the right levee of the Po river, the right levee of the Taro river and the left levee of the Parma river, which limit a 100 km^ 2 study area. The influence of obstacles to the flood propagation and consequent hazard mapping was investigated, taking into account several standard criteria to map flooding hazard in different European countries. The results obtained from this study provide an example of a rational method to map the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> in areas protected against flooding due to embankment overtopping taking into account uncertainties due to breach location, levees fragility and to the presence of topographic obstacles.

40|$|Rockfalls are a {{significant}} safety hazard in open pit mines and underground mine entries from open cut highwalls {{that need to be}} rigorously managed when designing portal entries for punch longwalls. The installation of restraining nets is a common practice to mitigate this hazard. The protective system however does not totally eliminate the rockfall hazard as blocks can still detach and fall in between the net and the highwall. In such cases it is of prime importance to predict the rock fall trajectories and velocities behind the protective net in order to properly map and assess the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard.</b> An integrated approach combining field testing and DEM is currently being developed for which site specific knowledge of the fundamental characteristics of rockfalls is necessary. This work presents numerical analyses from which estimations of rockfall motion, trajectories, arrest zones and potential impacting energy on the protection structure are worked out. The study entails the estimation of the size distribution of unstable block first and then the simulation of their trajectories. The former requires an accurate description of the rock mass structure. By combining digital 3 D photogrammetry analyses with Discrete Fracture Network modelling it is possible to generate a polyhedral model of the rock mass structure. A modeller capable to automatically identify complex polyhedra (rock blocks) has been used to represent a rock mass with finite persistence discontinuities. Size distribution of unstable blocks and trajectories are assessed performing Monte Carlo analyses where unstable blocks are detected using the key-block method for each realisation. Results are compared with the actual history of rockfall events. This site-specific knowledge will later be used for <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> assessment (i. e. trajectories and final velocities behind protective nets) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework considering, in a statistical sense, the residual risk related to possible levee failures in flood hazard mapping is presented. The residual risk is separated into a “design hydraulic residual risk”, RRD, associated to levee failures caused by overtopping for low probability events with return period {{higher than the}} design value, and into the “structural residual risk”, RRS, in case of failure of the protection because of mechanisms other than overtopping, as piping, erosion, structural instability for medium and high probability events. Statistics of levee failure type and breach size on the Po, Piave, Tagliamento and Adige rivers, in Northern Italy, are estimated, {{as a function of}} river morphology and, for the Adige river, of flood intensity. A stochastic framework for probabilistic flood mapping is then discussed, taking into account in a Monte Carlo approach the effect of position, size, density of levees failures on the statistics of depth and velocity of inundated areas. An example is shown of the resulting water velocity uncertainty map which contributes to the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> for the 100 -year return period flooding map for a 23 km-reach in the middle-lower portion of the Po River.

Management {{strategies}} for addressing contaminated sediments can include {{a wide range}} of actions, ranging from no action, to the use of engineering controls, to the use of more aggressive, intrusive activities related to removing, containing, or treating sediments because of environmental or navigation considerations. Risk assessment provides a useful foundation for understanding the environmental benefits, <b>residual</b> <b>hazards,</b> and engineering limitations of different remedy alternatives and for identifying or ranking management options. This article, part of a series of panel discussion papers on sediment remediation presented at the Third International Conference on Remediation of Contaminated Sediments held 20 – 25 January 2005 in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, reviews 2 types of risk that deserve careful consideration when evaluating remedy alternatives. The evaluation of remedy implementation risks addresses predominantly short-term engineering issues, such as worker and community health and safety, equipment failures, and accident rates. The evaluation of residual risks addresses predominantly longer-term biological and environmental issues, such as ecological recovery, bioaccumulation, and relative changes in exposure and effects to humans, aquatic biota, and wildlife. Understanding the important pathways for contaminant exposure, the human and wildlife populations potentially at risk, and the possible hazards associated with the implementation of different engineering options will contribute to informed decision making with regard to short- an...|$|E
40|$|Random {{variables}} that stand for cost, loss or damage must be confronted in numerous situations. Dealing with them systematically for purposes in risk management, optimization and statistics {{is the theme}} of this presentation, which brings together ideas coming from many different areas. Measures of risk can be used to quantify the hazard in a random variable by a single value which can substitute for the otherwise uncertain outcomes in a formulation of constraints and objectives. Such quantifications of risk can be portrayed on a higher level as generated from penalty-type expressions of “regret ” about the mix of potential outcomes. A trade-off between an up-front level of hazard and the uncertain <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> underlies that derivation. Regret is the mirror image of utility, a familiar concept for dealing with gains instead of losses, but regret concerns hazards relative to a benchmark. It bridges between risk measures and expected utility, thereby reconciling those two approaches to optimization under uncertainty Statistical estimation is inevitably a partner with risk management in handling hazards, which may be known only partially through a data base. However, a much deeper connection has come to light with statistical theory itself, in particular regression. Very general measures of error ca...|$|R

40|$|Technology roadmapping is a {{strategic}} planning method used by companies {{to identify and}} plan the development of technologies necessary for new products. The U. S. Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management has used this same method to refine requirements and identify knowledge and tools needed for completion of defined missions. This paper describes the process of applying roadmapping to clarify mission requirements and identify enhancing technologies for the Long-Term Stewardship (LTS) of polluted sites after site cleanup has been completed. The nature of some contamination problems is such that full cleanup is not achievable with current technologies and some <b>residual</b> <b>hazards</b> remain. LTS maintains engineered contaminant barriers and land use restriction controls, and monitors residual contaminants until they no longer pose a risk to the public or the environment.

40|$|At {{the scale}} of forest stands, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative, {{statistically}} valid data on the protective effect of forests against rockfall. Therefore, the first objective of this study was to quantify the velocities, rebound heights as well as the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> of rockfall on a forested and a non-forested slope. The second objective was to evaluate existing rockfall protection forest management guidelines, as well as the underlying criteria. We carried out, filmed and analysed 100 real size rockfall experiments at a non-forested site (Site 1) and 102 identical experiments at a forested site (Site 2) on the same slope. At the non-forested site, results show that the mean maximum velocity is 15. 4 m s− 1 compared to 11. 7 m s− 1 at the forested site. The maximum rebound height decreases from 8 m (Site 1) to 2 m (Site 2) and the number of rocks that surpass the 223. 5 m slope distance decreases from 95 out of 100 (Site 1) to 35 out of 102 (Site 2). A major effect of rockfall on a forested slope is the development of a treeless rockfall path or couloir, which had evolved after releasing 78 rocks at Site 2. During our experiments, none of the rocks attained their maximal velocity within the first 40 m. They did, however, attain destructive velocities (11 – 15 m s− 1) within that distance. Finally, the results proved that forests can provide effective protection against rockfall...|$|R
40|$|For snow avalanches, passive defense {{structures}} are generally designed by considering high return period events. However, defining a return period {{turns out to}} be tricky as soon as different variables are simultaneously considered. This problem can be overcome by maximizing the expected economic benefit of the defense structure, but purely stochastic approaches are not possible for paths with a complex geometry in the runout zone. Therefore, in this paper, we include a multivariate numerical avalanche propagation model within a Bayesian decisional framework. The influence of a vertical dam on an avalanche flow is quantified in terms of local energy dissipation with a simple semi-empirical relation. Costs corresponding to dam construction and the damage to a building situated in the runout zone are roughly evaluated for each dam height-hazard value pair, with damage intensity depending on avalanche velocity. Special attention is given to the poor local information {{to be taken into account}} for the decision. Using a case study from the French avalanche database, the Bayesian optimal dam height is shown to be more pessimistic than the classical optimal height because of the increasing effect of parameter uncertainty. It also appears that the lack of local information is especially critical for a building exposed to the most extreme events only. The <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> after dam construction is analyzed and the sensitivity to the different modelling assumptions is evaluated. Finally, possible further developments of the approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The relict Lemeglio coastal {{landslide}} is a deep-seated mass movement, involving heterogeneous flysch rock-masses. The landslide {{is characterized}} by a complex evolution and composite mechanisms, which were activated under past morphoclimatic conditions and controlled by different mechanical behaviours of the involved geological formations. Despite the current global slope stability, the accumulation zone is still prone to residual movements as it has been recognized since the last decades by diffuse damages suffered by buildings constructed over the landslide foot. To safeguard the urbanized area, different types of remedial works have been carried out through time, which varied from deep drainages to structural measures. This study investigates the engineering geological setting of the landslide body and its current kinematics to assess landslide hazard. For such a purpose, interferometric (PSInSAR technique) and inclinometric monitoring data were analysed. Among the principal results is the characterisation of the landslide accumulation zone, which is still active down to a depth variable from 13 to 48 m. In this area, the maximum recorded ground velocities varied from 24 to 6 – 8 mm year− 1 in the past two decades. This very slow slope deformation regime affecting an urbanized area is a valuable example for both focusing the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> related to a relict landslide and designing effective remedial works consistently to an engineering geological and kinematic model.

40|$|Rockfalls are a {{significant}} safety hazard in mining environments {{that need to be}} rigorously managed, in particular when designing portal entries for punch longwalls. In situ experiments were carried out at a mine in New South Wales (Australia) to improve management of the rockfall hazard {{at the base of the}} highwall. Concrete blocks were released from the top of the highwall. Block sizes were defined according to records of rockfall events and results of polyhedral modelling of the highwall. The tests were carried out on two different sections of the highwall: the first section was draped with a netting protection system whereas the second section had no protection system (net) installed. In the first section, the blocks were released behind the net in order to be able to investigate the effect of the net on the block trajectory and the energy dissipation. Direct comparison was made with the section where no net interfered with the rockfall. The tests were repeated several times and were recorded by using high speed cameras. Analysis of the rockfall images and videos allowed for the gathering of information on the motion type, trajectories, arrest zones and potential impacting energy. Particular emphasis was given to the analysis of the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> once a protection system is in place.

40|$|A complex landslide, which mobilized a {{calcareous}} rock mass {{of about}} 60, 000 m 3, occurred on January 3, 2002, along the southwestern slope of Mt. Catiello, above Positano (province of Salerno, Italy). According to established classification schemes, such a landslide {{can be classified}} as a rock avalanche or as a complex, dry, extremely rapid rock fall???dry, extremely rapid debris flow. Landslides of this type and dimensions are quite rare in the southern Apennines, and even rarer in the Sorrento-Amalfi Peninsula. Therefore this one represents a singular case for assessing both the mechanisms leading to such a type of sudden, often hazardous mass movements, and the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> still existing on Mt. Catiello. Due to the inaccessibility of the near-vertical rock slopes, the characterization of the instability mechanisms of the landslide was based on analyses of terrestrial stereoscopic photographs, taken from lateral and frontal positions {{with respect to the}} 2002 depletion zone, and on measurements/validations of structural settings carried out in accessible sectors of the mountain. Currently, the southwestern slope of Mt. Catiello, which corresponds to the depletion zone of the 2002 landslide, cannot be considered more unstable than the adjacent northern slope, where a smaller rock mass tower, with a volume of 20, 000 m 3 and clear signs of a propagating deformation-fracturing process at the base, was identified.

40|$|Hazards on {{accident}} {{sites are}} such that investigators must balance personal safety against the risks involved in collecting evidence intended to prevent future loss of life. Better knowledge of hazards and their mitigation could reconcile these conflicting objectives to {{a point at which}} risk might be no greater than in other workplaces. Nevertheless, the magnitude and nature of the hazards at any accident site cannot be determined in advance. The perceptions of novice accident investigators of potential hazards are not greatly different from the realities encountered by experienced investigators, although the former tend to focus on general health and safety issues, while experienced investigators are more aware of hazards arising from aircraft systems and materials. Experienced investigators reported most of the hazards they encountered over six years as arising within a narrow range of hazard categories - yet they must be prepared to carry out thorough investigations while protecting themselves against all hazards, including those encountered very infrequently. Both generic and dynamic risk assessments are important in protecting investigators and the integrity of evidence. The ongoing management of an investigation in the field involves a continuous and iterative cycle: identification of hazards, determination of exposure, assessment of risk, introduction of controls, review and assessment of remaining risk, and identification and management of <b>residual</b> <b>hazard.</b> Lives and evidence depend upon the quality of this process.

40|$|Unexploded {{ordnance}} (UXO) presents {{serious problems}} in Europe, Asia, {{as well as}} in the United States. Explosives and mines from World War I and World War II still turn up at European and Asian construction sites, backyard gardens, beaches, wildlife preserves and former military training grounds. The high rate of failure among munitions from 60 - 90 years ago is cited as one of the main reasons for such a high level of contamination. Apart from war activities, military training has resulted in many uncovered ordnance. It is especially true in the United States, where most UXO has resulted from decades of military training, exercises, and testing of weapons systems. Such UXO contamination prevents civilian land use, threatens public safety, and causes significant environmental concern. In light of this problem, there has been considerable interest shown by federal, state, and local authorities in UXO remediation at former U. S. Department of Defense sites. The ultimate goal of UXO remediation is to permit safe public use of contaminated lands. A Defense Science Board Task Force Report from 1998 lists some 1, 500 sites, comprising approximately 15 million acres, that potentially contain UXO. The UXO-related activity for these sites consists of identifying the subareas that actually contain UXO, and then locating and removing the UXO, or fencing the hazardous areas off from the public. The criteria for clearance depend on the intended land end-use and <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> risk that is deemed acceptable.

40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} the reliability of these levee systems, calculating the probability of “failure” of determined levee stretches under different loads, using probabilistic methods that {{take into account the}} fragility curves obtained through the Monte Carlo Method. For this study overtopping and piping are considered as failure mechanisms (since these are the most frequent) and the major levee system of the Po River with a primary focus on the section between Piacenza and Cremona, in the lower-middle area of the Padana Plain, is analysed. The novelty of this approach is to check the reliability of individual embankment stretches, not just a single section, while taking into account the variability of the levee system geometry from one stretch to another. This work takes also into consideration, for each levee stretch analysed, a probability distribution of the load variables involved in the definition of the fragility curves, where it is influenced by the differences in the topography and morphology of the riverbed along the sectional depth analysed as it pertains to the levee system in its entirety. A type of classification is proposed, for both failure mechanisms, to give an indication of the reliability of the levee system based of the information obtained by the fragility curve analysis. To accomplish this work, an hydraulic model has been developed where a 500 -year flood is modelled to determinate the <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> value of failure for each stretch of levee near the corresponding water depth, then comparing the results with the obtained classifications. This work has the additional the aim of acting as an interface between the world of Applied Geology and Environmental Hydraulic Engineering where a strong collaboration is needed between the two professions to resolve and improve the estimation of hydraulic risk. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{implement}} a conceptual framework to consider, in a statistical sense, the residual risk related to possible levee failures in flood hazard mapping. Extending previous analyses on statistics of levee failure type and breach size on a 98 km-reach of the Po River, here we analyze flood events occurred in the Piave, Tagliamento and Adige rivers, in Northern Italy, providing statistics of some hundreds of historical breaches occurred in the last two centuries. Levee failure spatial density, temporal frequency and, partially, size are presented as a function of the geomorphology of the river (i. e. braided, sinuous and meandering) of levees geometry and of flood intensity. A levee fragility function is introduced to take into account the influence of hydraulic and geotechnical factors on the probability of failure. On average a spatial density and temporal intensity of 0. 8 levee's failure km^- 1 100 years^- 1 was observed on the four rivers, in a range between 0. 5 and 1. 1 for levees designed with a return period ranging from 100 to 200 years and a freeboard between 0. 5 and 1 m, on average. This means that the residual risk for the flooding areas is locally higher than the design one. A stochastic framework for probabilistic flood mapping is then discussed, taking into account in a Monte Carlo approach the effect of position, size, density of levees failures on the statistics of depth and velocity of inundated areas. An example is shown of the resulting <b>residual</b> <b>hazard</b> map for the 100 -years return period flooding map for a 23 km-reach in the middle-lower portion of the Po River catchment between the gauging station of Cremona (upstream) and Borgoforte (downstream), in a floodprone area of 100 km 2 in size...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{a family of}} {{stochastic}} orders of random variables defined via the comparison of their percentile residual life functions. Some interpretations of these stochastic orders are given, and various properties of them are derived. The relationships to other stochastic orders are also studied. Finally, some applications in reliability theory and finance are described.

The first essay builds a competitive principal-agent model that considers adverse selection and moral hazard jointly, and characterizes graphically {{various forms of}} separating Nash equilibria. In the second essay, we use panel data on U. S. property liability reinsurance for the period 1995 - 2000 to test {{for the existence of}} adverse selection and moral hazard. We find that (1) adverse selection is present in private passenger auto liability reinsurance market and homeowners reinsurance market, but not in product liability reinsurance market; (2) <b>residual</b> moral <b>hazard</b> does not exist in all the three largest lines of reinsurance, but is present in overall reinsurance markets; and (3) moral hazard is present in the product liability reinsurance market, but not in the other two lines of reinsurance...|$|R
