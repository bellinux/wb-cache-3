5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document <b>reference,</b> <b>document</b> processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E
5|$|The Marriage Charter {{acts as the}} <b>reference</b> <b>document</b> for {{the wedding}} of the 17-year-old Otto II and the 12-year-old Theophanu. The wedding took place on 14 April 972 in St. Peter's Basilica and was officiated by Pope John XIII. Politically, the {{marriage}} marked {{the recognition of the}} Ottonian Empire by the Byzantine Empire. In this document, Otto II granted Theophanu the right to an extensive dower for personal use throughout her life (legitima dos), as well as her entry into a consortium imperii with Otto II, meaning that both would share imperial authority over the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

40|$|<b>Referencing</b> <b>documents</b> on the Web is {{becoming}} increasingly popular due to the convenience provided to both readers and publishers.

A draft Brooklands Conservation Plan was instigated by English Heritage and prepared in 2003 for DaimlerChrysler by DCUK consultants Terence O'Rourke. A Brooklands Heritage Partnership (BHP) was formed in 2010 as an informal partnership of Brooklands Museum, Elmbridge Borough Council, English Heritage and Surrey County Council, to address increasing conservation issues and concerns. In April 2013, a £32,540 grant was secured from English Heritage (now Historic England) to enable the BHP to appoint professional consultants to research and compile a comprehensive <b>reference</b> <b>document</b> on all aspects of Brooklands’ heritage.

The outputs of the process, namely the Sectoral <b>Reference</b> <b>Documents</b> and the JRC Scientific and Policy Reports on best environmental management practice are then outlined, together with the role played in developing the documents by the different actors involved: JRC/IPTS, the Technical Working Group and the EMAS Committee.
