40|$|VH {{replacement}} {{refers to}} RAG-mediated secondary recombination of the IgH genes, which renews {{almost the entire}} VH gene coding region but retains a short stretch of nucleotides as a VH replacement footprint at the newly generated VH-DH junction. To explore the biological significance of VH replacement to the antibody repertoire, we developed a Java-based VH replacement footprint analyzer (VHRFA) program and analyzed the distribution of VH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> in 61851 human IgH gene sequences downloaded from the NCBI database. The initial assignment of the VH, DH, and JH gene segments provided a comprehensive view of the human IgH repertoire. To our interest, the overall frequency of VH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> is 12. 1 %; the frequencies of VH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> in IgH genes using different VH germline genes vary significantly. Importantly, the frequencies of VH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> are significantly elevated in IgH genes derived from different autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and allergic rhinitis, and in IgH genes encoding various autoantibodies or anti-viral antibodies. The identified VH replacement footprints preferentially encoded charged amino acids to elongate IgH CDR 3 regions, which may contribute to their autoreactivities or anti-viral functions. Analyses of the mutation status of the identified VH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> suggested {{that they had been}} actively involved in immune responses. These results provide a global view of the distribution of VH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> in human IgH genes, especially in IgH genes derived from autoimmune diseases and anti-viral immune responses...|$|R

How efficiently different e-cigarettes give nicotine is unclear. Serum cotinine levels are comparable to that of traditional cigarettes, but are inharmonious and rely upon the user and the device.

25|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, {{there is an}} ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. In vitro studies have associated it with cancer, but carcinogenicity has not been demonstrated in vivo. There is inadequate research to demonstrate that nicotine is associated with cancer in humans, but there is evidence indicating possible oral, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer risks.

50|$|Marketing firms {{often use}} survey data to {{estimate}} when consumers will next buy a product. Telescoping errors may bias these estimates and cause faulty marketing campaigns. Respondents on marketing research surveys are often inaccurate when recalling {{the time period}} of their last purchase, and forward telescoping is common. Backward telescoping is also common and leads to respondents overstating their intention to buy a <b>replacement</b> <b>product</b> as they underestimate the likelihood of their product breaking down. Telescoping has {{a significant effect on}} market research and therefore should be taken into account in marketing strategies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} MET-Rx meal <b>replacement</b> <b>product</b> came in two canistersâ€”one labeled MET-Rx [...] "base" [...] and {{the other}} MET-Rx [...] "plus". The instructions were to take two scoops of the base and one scoop of the plus and mix them in milk or water. As the product grew more popular, it was released as one formula combining the [...] "base" [...] and [...] "plus" [...] while removing the micellar casein component. As a result, the original METAMYOSYN blend is no longer used in MET-Rx products, as the current ingredients does not contain micellar casein.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{multiple}} C 1 inhibitor (C 1 -INH) <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> {{have been}} approved {{for the treatment of}} hereditary angioedema (HAE). This review summarizes HAE and its current treatment modalities and focuses on findings from bench to bedside trials of a new C 1 -INH replacement, conestat alfa. Conestat alfa is unique among the other C 1 -INH <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> because it is produced from transgenic rabbits rather than derived from human plasma donors, which can potentially allow an unlimited source of drug without any concern of infectious transmission. The clinical trial data generated to date indicate that conestat alfa is safe and effective for the treatment of acute HAE attacks...|$|R

50|$|Gluten {{proteins}} {{have low}} nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential {{in the human}} diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

Some gluten-free commercial <b>replacement</b> <b>products</b> are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid / carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.|$|R

The author and historian SÃ¸ren MÃ¸rch has characterized Danish cuisine as a [...] "garbage kitchen" [...] of insipid, sweet and unspiced [...] "baby food" [...] where {{the tastes of}} milk and sweetness are the key elements.
