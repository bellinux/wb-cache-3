50|$|Quarter-sawn boards {{have greater}} {{stability}} {{of form and}} size with less cupping, shrinkage across the width, shake and splitting, and other good qualities. In some woods, such as oak, the grain produces a decorative effect which shows a prominent <b>ray</b> <b>fleck</b> and sapele is likely to produce a ribbon figure.|$|E
50|$|In {{their native}} habitat, they can grow tall, 40-60 metres, but rarely reach this in cultivation. The bases of large trees are usually {{prominently}} buttressed. Leaves with white or silver on underside. Argyrodendron actinophyllum and Argyrodendron trifoliolatum occur in scrubs and rainforests {{along the east}} coast of Australia, but Argyrodendron peralatum has a restricted distribution in north Queensland between Tully and Cooktown. The grain is usually straight and open, sometimes interlocked or wavy and irregular producing some beautifully figured wood. Attractive figure on tangential face and large <b>ray</b> <b>fleck</b> on radial face are prominent features of Argyrodendron wood.|$|E
50|$|The company {{distinguished}} {{itself as}} a competitor {{for some of the}} better American pendulum clocks, such as those made by Seth Thomas. Their clocks often looked like models made by Seth Thomas or Sessions but some of their designs, especially the tall mantle clocks, were unique. For their wooden cases, they favored the heart wood of quarter-sawn white oak that showed off beautiful <b>ray</b> <b>flecks.</b> The designs often had elements of the Arts and Crafts Movement which also favored quarter-sawn white oak.|$|R
60|$|What {{will he do}} now? Wander {{over the}} town, and gaze vacantly at one little object and another about the house fronts. One thing he will not look at; {{and that is the}} bright summer sea, all golden in the sun <b>rays,</b> <b>flecked</b> with gay white sails. From all which is bright and calm, and cheerful, his soul shrinks as from an impertinence; he longs for the lurid gas-light of London, and the roar of the Strand, and the {{everlasting}} stream of faces among whom he may wander free, sure that no one will recognise him, the disgraced, the desperate.|$|R
50|$|Quarter sawing {{gets its}} name {{from the fact that the}} log is first {{quartered}} lengthwise, resulting in wedges with a right angle ending at approximately the center of the original log. Each quarter is then cut separately by tipping it up on its point and sawing boards successively along the axis. That results in boards with the annual rings mostly perpendicular to the faces. Quarter sawing yields boards with straight striped grain lines, greater stability than flatsawn wood, and a distinctive <b>ray</b> and <b>fleck</b> figure. It also yields narrower boards, because the log is first quartered, which is more wasteful.|$|R
50|$|Amish {{furniture}} {{is made with}} a variety of quality hardwoods including northern red oak, quarter-sawn white oak, cherry, maple, beech, elm, mahogany, walnut, hickory, cedar, and pine. Northern red oak is a very popular choice for American consumers for its warmth, color, and durability. It is typically grown in Eastern U.S., particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. White oak is slightly harder than red oak and can be cut to show more <b>ray</b> <b>fleck.</b> The antique look of white oak makes it ideal for Mission and Shaker styles. Cherry has a light reddish-brown color that will darken with light exposure. Maple wood offers a spectrum of beauty from different angles. It is significantly harder than oak and is growing in popularity because of its beauty. American beech is white with a red tinge and bends readily when steamed. Elm ranges in color from nearly white to brown with a red tinge and is fairly stiff and heavy. Mahogany is typically used in high-class furnishings because of its attractive finish. As mahogany matures its color varies from yellowish or pinkish to deep red or brown. Walnut is heavy, hard, and stiff and ranges in color from nearly white in the sapwood to dark brown in the heartwood. Walnut holds stain, paint, and polish well. Hickory is harder than oak and distinguished by extreme contrasts of light and dark colors. Hickory’s sapwood is a creamy white while hickory’s heartwood is a red, pink or reddish-brown color and often referred to as red hickory. Cedar has a deep rosy glow and stripes of light golden sapwood. Eastern white pine is a soft wood. It tends to have more knots than a hardwood and can yellow with age.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} a {{precisely}} cut piece of maple, preferably with prominent medullary <b>rays,</b> showing a <b>flecked</b> figure. The bridge forms the lower anchor {{point of the}} vibrating length of the strings, and transmits the vibration of the strings {{to the body of}} the instrument. Its top curve holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard, permitting each to be played separately by the bow. The mass distribution and flex of the bridge, acting as a mechanical acoustic filter, have a prominent effect on the sound.|$|R
60|$|Early frost {{had touched}} the heights with its magic wand. And the forest seemed a temple in which man might worship nature and life rather than steal through the dells {{and under the}} arched aisles like a beast of prey. The green-and-gold leaves of aspens quivered in the glades; maples in the ravines fluttered their red-and-purple leaves. The needle-matted carpet under the pines vied with the long lanes of silvery grass, alike {{enticing}} to the eye of man and beast. Sunny <b>rays</b> of light, <b>flecked</b> with dust and flying insects, slanted down from the overhanging brown-limbed, green-massed foliage. Roar of wind in the distant forest alternated with soft breeze close at hand. Small dove-gray squirrels ran all over the woodland, very curious about Jean and his dog, rustling the twigs, scratching the bark of trees, chattering and barking, frisky, saucy, and bright-eyed. A plaintive twitter of wild canaries came from the region above the treetops--first voices of birds in their pilgrimage toward the south. Pine cones dropped with soft thuds. The blue jays followed these intruders in the forest, screeching their displeasure. Like rain pattered the dropping seeds from the spruces. A woody, earthy, leafy fragrance, damp with the current of life, mingled with a cool, dry, sweet smell of withered grass and rotting pines.|$|R
