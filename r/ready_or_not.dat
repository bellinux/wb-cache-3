25|$|Hitler was {{disappointed}} with Halder's plan and initially reacted by deciding that the German army should attack early, <b>ready</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> {{in the hope}} that Allied unreadiness might bring about an easy victory. Hitler proposed beginning the invasion on 25 October 1939 but accepted that the date was probably unrealistic. On 29 October, Halder presented another plan, Aufmarschanweisung N°2, Fall Gelb, featuring a secondary attack on the Netherlands. On 5 November, Hitler informed Walther von Brauchitsch that he intended the invasion to begin on 12 November. Brauchitsch replied that the military had yet to recover from the Polish campaign and offered to resign; this was refused but two days later Hitler postponed the attack, giving poor weather as the reason for the delay. More postponements followed, as commanders persuaded Hitler to delay the attack for a few days or weeks, to remedy some critical defect in the preparations or to wait for better weather. Hitler also tried to alter the plan, which he found unsatisfactory; his weak understanding of how poorly prepared Germany was for war and how it would cope with losses of armoured vehicles were not fully considered. Though Poland had been quickly defeated, many armoured vehicles had been lost and were hard to replace. This eventually resulted in a dispersion of the German effort; although the main attack would remain in central Belgium, secondary attacks would be undertaken on the flanks. Hitler made such a suggestion on 11 November, pressing for an early attack on unprepared targets.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{development}} and advancements in every research and technology is to provide easy solutions to any user’s problems including the day to day ones. One problem that a farmer might face is to identify whether his crop is <b>ready</b> for harvesting <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Hence the efforts are taken to figure out an easy solution for a farmer where he can use his cellular phone to identify whether his crop is <b>ready</b> for harvesting <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> This he can do by taking picture of his crop through the digital camera of his cellular phone. Therefore image processing plays an active role {{to figure out the}} solution to this problem. This paper proposes image segmentation of the image of a crop such as tomato to identify whether the crop is ripe enough <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> The feature that is extracted for image segmentation is moment. The classification technique used for segmentation is K-means clustering algorithm. The values for the segmented image viz. Mismatching Rate, Misclassification Rate, PSNR and MSE are then calculated Then to identify how much the system is robust noise is inserted in the image and then again the image is segmented and the above mentioned values are calculated. Then the image is denoised and again segmentation of the image is performed and the same process is followed. This paper presents the above mentioned process and the system produces equivalent results in all the three cases. The research work presents here the result of the image segmentation done on the image of a tomato using MATLAB version 7. 10...|$|R
60|$|It was my plan then, {{as it was}} on {{all other}} occasions, to take the {{initiative}} whenever the enemy could be drawn from his intrenchments if we were not intrenched ourselves. Warren had not yet reached the point where he was to halt, when he discovered the enemy near by. Neither party had any advantage of position. Warren was, therefore, ordered to attack as soon as he could prepare for it. At nine o'clock Hancock was ordered to come up to the support of Getty. He himself arrived at Getty's front about noon, but his troops were yet far in the rear. Getty was directed to hold his position at all hazards until relieved. About this hour Warren was ready, and attacked with favorable though not decisive results. Getty was somewhat isolated from Warren and was in a precarious condition for a time. Wilson, with his division of cavalry, was farther south, and was cut {{off from the rest of}} the army. At two o'clock Hancock's troops began to arrive, and immediately he was ordered to join Getty and attack the enemy. But the heavy timber and narrow roads prevented him from getting into position for attack as promptly as he generally did when receiving such orders. At four o'clock he again received his orders to attack, and General Getty received orders from Meade a few minutes later to attack whether Hancock was <b>ready</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> He met the enemy under Heth within a few hundred yards.|$|E
60|$|Between {{four and}} five, the Fabeata {{regiment}} (or folk of that village) on the Mataafa left, {{which had been}} under arms all day, fell to be withdrawn for rest and food; the Siumu regiment, which should have relieved it, was not <b>ready</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> notified in time; and the Tamaseses, gallantly profiting by the mismanagement, recovered {{the most of the}} ground in their proper right. It was not for long. They lost it again, yard by yard and from house to house, till the pilot station was once more {{in the hands of the}} Mataafas. This is the last definite incident in the battle. The vicissitudes along the line of the entrenchments remain concealed from us under the cover of the forest. Some part of the Tamasese position there appears to have been carried, but what part, or at what hour, or whether the advantage was maintained, I have never learned. Night and rain, but not silence, closed upon the field. The trenches were deep in mud; but the younger folk wrecked the houses in the neighbourhood, carried the roofs to the front, and lay under them, men and women together, through a long night of furious squalls and furious and useless volleys. Meanwhile the older folk trailed back into Apia in the rain; they talked as they went of who had fallen and what heads had been taken upon either side--they seemed to know by name the losses upon both; and drenched with wet and broken with excitement and fatigue, they crawled into the verandahs of the town to eat and sleep. The morrow broke grey and drizzly, but as so often happens in the islands, cleared up into a glorious day. During the night, the majority of the defenders had taken advantage of the rain and darkness and stolen from their forts unobserved. The rallying sign of the Tamaseses had been a white handkerchief. With the dawn, the de Coetlogons from the English consulate beheld the ground strewn with these badges discarded; and close by the house, a belated turncoat was still changing white for red. Matautu was lost; Tamasese was confined to Mulinuu; and by nine o'clock two Mataafa villages paraded the streets of Apia, taking possession. The cost of this respectable success in ammunition must have been enormous; in life it was but small. Some compute forty killed on either side, others forty on both, three or four being women and one a white man, master of a schooner from Fiji. Nor was the number even of the wounded at all proportionate to the surprising din and fury of the affair while it lasted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{instruction}} scheduling logic {{is one of}} the most critical components of modern superscalar microprocessors, both from the delay and power dissipation standpoints. The delay and energy requirement of driving the result tags across the associatively-addressed issue queue accounts for a significant percentage of the scheduler’s overhead and also limits the design scalability. We propose two schemes to reduce the power consumption and the delays of the wakeup logic. Our first scheme – instruction packing – shares the associative part of an issue queue entry between two instructions, each with at most one non-ready source. As a result, the number of entries in the issue queue (and, hence, the length of the tag buses) can be reduced by a factor of two with almost no impact on the IPCs, because most instructions either enter the pipeline with at least one of their source operands <b>ready,</b> <b>or</b> do <b>not</b> make use of two source registers to begin with. Our second scheme – tag memoization – avoids driving the upper portion of the tags, if those bits did not change their values from what was driven on the same tag bus during the most recent broadcast. While instruction packing results in the reduced length of the tag buses, tag memoization reduced the number of tag lines that need to be driven. We evaluate our designs using detailed microarchitectural simulations of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks and the SPICE simulations of the issue queue layouts. 1...|$|R
