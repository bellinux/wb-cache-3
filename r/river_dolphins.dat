5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are a very}} {{widespread}} {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and two subspecies. <b>River</b> <b>dolphins,</b> alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> are {{not very}} widely distributed; they are all {{restricted}} to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> feed primarily on fish. Male <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are rarely}} kept in captivity; {{breeding}} {{success has been}} poor and the animals often die {{within a few months}} of capture. , there are only three <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Some dolphin species face an {{uncertain}} future, especially some <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{species such as}} the Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphin,</b> and the Ganges and Yangtze <b>river</b> <b>dolphin,</b> which are critically or seriously endangered. A 2006 survey found no individuals of the Yangtze <b>river</b> <b>dolphin,</b> which {{now appears to be}} functionally extinct.|$|R
50|$|The Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Inia geoffrensis), {{also known}} as the boto, bufeo or pink <b>river</b> <b>dolphin,</b> is a species of toothed whale {{classified}} in the family Iniidae. Three subspecies are currently recognized: I. g. geoffrensis (Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphin),</b> I. g. boliviensis (Bolivian <b>river</b> <b>dolphin)</b> and I. g. humboldtiana (Orinoco <b>river</b> <b>dolphin).</b> The three subspecies are distributed in the Amazon basin, the upper Madeira River in Bolivia, and the Orinoco basin, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The South Asian <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Platanista gangetica) is a {{freshwater}} or <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{found in}} India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan which is {{split into two}} subspecies, the Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (P. g. gangetica) and the Indus <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (P. g. minor). The Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, while the Indus <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{is found in the}} Indus River in Pakistan and its Beas and Sutlej tributaries. From the 1970s until 1998, they were regarded as separate species; however, in 1998, their classification was changed from two separate species to subspecies of a single species (see taxonomy below). The Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> has been recognized by the government of India as its National Aquatic Animal. The Indus <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> has been named as the National Mammal of Pakistan. Further, the Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> is the official animal of the Indian city of Guwahati.|$|R
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are thought}} to have relictual distributions, that is, their {{ancestors}} originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> is paraphyletic. Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian <b>river</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Isthminia panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Piña, Panama.|$|E
5|$|Four {{families}} of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, {{is the only}} accepted family of Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> have a {{relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> lack these needs.|$|E
50|$|The Araguaian <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> or Araguaian boto (Inia araguaiaensis) is a South American <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{population}} whose identification as {{a species}} distinct from the Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Inia geoffrensis) was announced in 2014. It is native to the Araguaia-Tocantins basin of Brazil.|$|R
40|$|Recording of the {{underwater}} call and {{observation of the}} relative behaviour of the <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Platanista gangetica) living in the Indus River were carried out. All of {{the underwater}} calls emitted by this dolphin were clicks which were continuously emitted. This call was mainly used for echolocation and, when small fishes were thrown into the pond, {{it was observed that}} the repetition rate of clicks emitted by the dolphin searching for bait rapidly became higher. The repetition rate was 30 - 200 /sec. (usually 40 - 100 /sec.) The analyzed patterns were monotonous and the particularly strong frequency band was not constant. The clicks emitted by the Indus <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> were very similar to the call of the dolphin living in the Ganges River, but the stratiformed sound, burst, twitter and whistle which the Ganges <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> emitted were not observed with the Indus <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin.</b> !? 1. The underwater calls of the Indus <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> were recorded in Pakistan were compared with that of the Ganges <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> of the same species. 2. This dolphin lives at deep places and sinuous places of the Indus River and is always emitting the calls. 3. The emitting interval of underwater calls almost constant all day. 4. All of the calls of the Indus <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> are of the type of so-called "Clicks" and {{play an important role in}} echolocation. 5. The analyzed pattern of these calls are monotonous and no special strong frequency band is recognized. 6. The repetition rate is 30 - 200 /sec. (usually 40 - 100 /sec.). 7. Regarding that the Ganges <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> was under the breeding condition, the clicks of the Indus <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> and the Ganges <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> may have no difference at all. 8. Other calls observed in the Ganges <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin</b> were not recognized in the Indus <b>River</b> <b>Dolphin...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{is one of}} {{only five}} true {{freshwater}} dolphins in the world. The other four are the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) of the Yangtze River in China, now likely extinct; the Indus <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> of the Indus River in Pakistan; the Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> of the Amazon River in South America; and the Araguaian <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (not considered a separate species until 2014) of the Araguaia–Tocantins basin in Brazil. There are several marine dolphins whose ranges include some freshwater habitats, but these five are the only dolphins who live only in freshwater rivers and lakes.|$|R
5|$|Olfactory lobes {{are absent}} in <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> {{suggesting}} {{that they have no}} sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{have been}} very adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} prey upon similar food {{resources}} include the caimans and large fish that are themselves piscivores. Gymnotids, {{such as the}} electric eel, and the large silurid catfish are among aquatic competitors. Two <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> the tucuxi and boto, might potentially compete with the giant otter, but different spatial use and dietary preferences suggest minimal overlap. Furthermore, Defler observed associations between giant otters and the Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and suggested that dolphins may benefit by fish fleeing from the otters. The spectacled caiman is another potential competitor, but Duplaix found no conflict with the species in Suriname.|$|E
5|$|The Platanistidae were {{originally}} thought to hold only one species (the South Asian <b>river</b> <b>dolphin),</b> {{but based on}} differences in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition, scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s. In 1998, {{the results of these}} studies were questioned and the classification reverted to the pre-1970 consensus. Thus, at present, two subspecies are recognized in the genus Platanista, P. gangetica minor (the Indus <b>river</b> <b>dolphin)</b> and P. g. gangetica (the Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin).</b>|$|R
50|$|Raj Darbhanga used several {{insignia}}s. One of the insignia was a Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{riding the}} waves. The second insignia was a Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> inside a six pointed star. The third insignia was {{a variation of}} second one with the fish curved upwards.|$|R

5|$|River dolphin {{has been}} {{considered}} a taxonomic description, suggesting an evolutionary relationship among the group, although it is now known that they form two distinct clades. 'True' <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> are descendants of ancient evolutionary lineages that evolved in freshwater environments.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are members}} of the infraorder Cetacea, which are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The ears of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> have {{specific}} adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

Apart from dolphins, giant salamanders, Japanese brocade carp, Yangtze alligators and Chinese sturgeon are on display.|$|R
5|$|The {{primitive}} cetaceans, or archaeocetes, {{first took}} to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5–10 million years later. It is unknown when <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> first ventured back into fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Amazon <b>river</b> <b>dolphins,</b> {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability, their seductiveness and love of sex, often resulting in illegitimate children, and their attraction to parties. Despite {{the fact that the}} Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>{{dolphins}}</b> {{are five}} species of dolphins which reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They are classed in the cetacean superfamily Platanistoidea. Four species live in fresh water rivers. The fifth species, the La Plata dolphin, lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. However, it is scientifically classed {{in the river}} dolphin family rather than the oceanic dolphin family. All species have adaptations to facilitate fish catching: a long, forceps-like beak with numerous small teeth in both jaws, broad flippers to allow tight turns, small eyes, and unfused neck vertebrae to allow the head to move {{in relation to the}} body.|$|E
5|$|<b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some {{measuring}} , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that 30,000 chital (Axis axis) are in the Sundarbans part of the delta. Birds found in the delta include kingfishers, eagles, woodpeckers, the shalik (Acridotheres tristis), the swamp francolin (Francolinus gularis), and the doel (Copsychus saularis). Two species of dolphin {{can be found in}} the delta: the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) and the Ganges <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Platanista gangetica gangetica). The Irrawaddy dolphin is an oceanic dolphin which enters the delta from the Bay of Bengal.
