40|$|The {{distribution}} of irrigation water among Subak members {{is based on}} the principle of ayahan. This is the right of the Subak members to make use of available water resources in exchange for ngayah or free communal work on Subak activities. All Subak members have the same <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. The amount of water is computed by dividing the total amount of water available by the number of Subak members. A Subak consists of all the landowners – or their representatives- in a particular rice production area. The Subak is not only responsible for the construction and maintenance of canals, tunnels, aqueducts and dams, and for the {{distribution of}} water, but also coordinates the planting and organisation of ritual offerings and festivals. Registered Subak members are mostly men because they are regarded as the representatives of their family. However, women are also involved in meetings as they {{play a major role in}} the various religious ceremonies. There are about 1500 Subaks on Bali (1999) each with about 200 members and they cover a total irrigated area of more than 90 000 ha. The organisation of the Subak includes the Paruman Subak (General Assembly), the Prajuru Subak (Board), and the Kerama Subak (Members). The general assembly is the highest forum, and allows for open and democratic discussion among the Subak members, in order to create consensus on issues of general interest. The Subak Board is elected through the General Assembly. Participatory management is typical in Subak organisations. A Subak head can call for meetings to discuss and decide upon issues such as maintenance work, cropping plans and the The Subak system makes water available for irrigation in the hills...|$|E
40|$|The {{rights and}} the realities Cue: Water supply {{projects}} are sometimes accused of ignoring the water needs of rural communities in favour of supplying industry and urban areas. And while a country may include a right to water in its constitution, in reality many poor people have a daily struggle to access water for their most basic needs: washing, drinking and cooking. The United Nations Development Programme is working in Kenya to improve the access of the rural population to safe water. Ann Mikia spoke to Mr. Situma Mwichibe, the National Coordinator of the Africa 2000 network to find out his views {{on the rights of}} the rural poor to water. IN:		?I?m talking to Mr Situma Mwichebe, he?s? OUT:		?and as such there is self regulation? DUR?N	 2 ? 50 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Situma Mwichebe talking to Ann Mikia about the reality of water rights in Kenya. Transcript Mikia	I?m talking to Mr Situma Mwichebe, he?s the National Co-ordinator of the Africa 2000 Network, a programme of the United Nations Development Programme. Mr Mwichebe, would you say Kenyans have rights to water? Mwichebe	I would say yes they have rights in the sense that the right to access to water is entrenched in the Kenyan constitution, but whether they have equitable access to water is a different story. Some people have access to water; others normally don?t have equitable access to water. But their right is there. Mikia	So would you say the poor are discriminated against as far as access to water is concerned? Mwichebe	I would not say that the poor are deliberately discriminated against. Maybe discrimination comes about in that the poor hardly ever can afford a water project. Mikia	What would you say about the government projects? Do you think they take their communities? needs into account in placing their projects? Mwichebe	Most government projects are targeting larger community interests other than household or small community interests. They are designed to spur economic growth. They are supplying water to municipalities, they are supplying water to industries and as such sometimes they do not take the needs of the local people in consideration. But there are also other smaller water schemes by the government which actually do address their community needs. So where you have large giant water projects they tend to address national interests but where you have medium and long term small projects, spring protection, they hopefully do address community needs. Mikia	What about irrigation, do you think people are free to do irrigation if they wish to? Mwichebe	Whether every Kenyan has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>irrigation,</b> I think in principle, yes, but there are certain standards that you have to meet and as such you have to go through the political control mechanisms of government which sometimes people perceive to be restrictive. In general any Kenyan can irrigate but there are some community water schemes where the volume of water available is limited. The communities themselves restrict irrigation because they want first of all to meet the household domestic needs first and if you went into irrigation it means out of the six thousand households probably only two hundred would do that, and as such there is self regulation. End of tape. Mr. Situma Mwichebe talking to Ann Mikia about the reality of water rights in Kenya...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Public {{investments}} in farmer-managed tertiary canals can promote an improved distribution of water among farmers, {{enabling them to}} improve water management practices, enhance crop yields, and select from {{a wider variety of}} cropping choices. This paper examines economic issues regarding public programs designed to improve or rehabilitate tertiary canals, particularly in developing countries. Key issues include defining property <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> water or delivery capacity, and to new or improved irrigation facilities; communicating the relative scarcity of agricultural inputs with appropriate prices or allocations; implementing cost recovery; and determining the best mix of public and private sector participation. The transaction costs of implementing market-oriented programs are also discussed. Economic issues are illustrated by describing Egypt’s national Irrigation Improvement Project, for which a set of alternative cost recovery programs is presented.

25|$|In Egypt, Mamluk {{centralization}} over {{agricultural production}} was more thorough than in Syria and Palestine {{for a number}} of reasons. Among them was that virtually all agriculture in Egypt depended on an irrigation single source, the Nile, and the measures and <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> were determined by the river's flooding, whereas in Syria and Palestine, there were multiple sources of mostly rain-fed irrigation, and measures and rights were thus determined at the local level. Centralization over Syria and Palestine was also more complicated than in Egypt due to the diversity of those regions' geography and the frequent invasions of the Syro-Palestinian territories. The state's role in Syro-Palestinian agriculture was restricted to the fiscal administration and <b>to</b> the <b>irrigation</b> networks and other aspects of rural infrastructure. Although the level of centralization not as high as in Egypt, the Mamluks did impose enough control over the Syrian economy to derive revenues from Syria that benefited the sultanate and contributed to the defense of its realm. Furthermore, the maintenance of the Mamluk army in Syria relied on the state's control over Syrian agricultural revenues.|$|R

40|$|Families {{living in}} Gorno-Badakhshan—situated in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan—depend on {{irrigated}} agriculture {{to meet their}} subsistence needs. Because men predominate, and are most visible in, the operation and management of irrigation systems in this region, water-related activities are often labeled as masculine. Yet women historically {{played an important role}} in on-farm irrigation activities and even formed the majority of the agricultural workforce during the Soviet period. Today women are still responsible for the bulk of farming activities, including irrigation. This is partly a consequence of the difficulty of depending on farming alone for making a living, which leads many men to migrate elsewhere in search of employment. Drawing on 6 months of fieldwork in 2 villages in different irrigation systems, this article argues that although formal water rights and power are vested in men, this does not mean that women lack agency, nor is it necessarily a reflection of wider gender inequities. Understanding the power and equity implications of formal distributions of rights and powers among men and women requires an analysis that links formal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> actual <b>irrigation</b> and farming practices and places them in broader historical and livelihood contexts...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Federal commodity programs on returns <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> in the western United States. Returns <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> are defined as average returns to land, management, fixed capital, and water (above variable water cost), net of returns to dryland crop alternatives. Commodity market returns and program revenues per unit of applied irrigation water are estimated by field crop and subregion. Two representative study years - 1984 and 1987 - highlight the effect of differing commodity prices and program support levels under extreme market conditions. Aggregate returns <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> in western field-crop production were fairly constant over the two study years, averaging $ 33 per acre-foot of water. Program revenue contributions per unit-water were highest in the Southern and Northern Plains, and lowest in the Northern Mountain and Northern Pacific regions.

This weighted seasonal stress index was used in a regression equation to estimate corn yield. By including an irrigation cycle in the program, the response <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was simulated;Eight sites were chosen to evaluate the effect of irrigation on corn yield on low moisture-capacity soils in Iowa. The average yield increases ranged from 822 Kg/ha at Cedar Rapids to 3261 Kg/ha at Doon. The greatest irrigation amounts were applied in northwest Iowa (Doon), and the least amounts were applied in eastern Iowa. The soil-moisture program was run for two soils, Webster and Dickman, in southwest Minnesota (Lamberton). On Dickman sand, the average yield increase due <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 4518 Kg/ha, and for the Webster soil, the average yield increase due <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 2144 Kg/ha;The original program was modified to represent conditions existing at the Cisne soil in Fayette County, Illinois. In the first modified program, excess moisture above field capacity gradually filled each layer until the first layer reached saturation. The average yield increase due <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 3755 Kg/ha in the program, in which starting soil moisture was at field capacity. In the same program, when saturation was assumed as the starting soil moisture, the average yield increase due <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 3429 Kg/ha. In the second modified program, daily rainfall filled each layer to saturation and a subroutine was constructed to allow for downward movement for water until field capacity is reached. For the situation when the starting soil mositure was assumed to be at field capacity, the average yield increase due <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 4678 Kg/ha. When the starting soil moisture was assumed to be at saturation, the average yield increase due <b>to</b> <b>irrigation</b> was 4564 Kg/ha.
