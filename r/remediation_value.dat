40|$|In 2000, the re-interpretation of the Waste Strategy (WS 2000) for England and Wales was published. This {{document}} clearly {{laid out}} the Government's new strategy for managing waste and resources more efficiently, and detailed the transformations required to deliver more sustainable human development. Compost-like-output (CLO), a material derived from optimally composting municipal solid waste (MSW), is one potential avenue through which these targets may be achieved. When applied to agricultural land, or, as it is currently used, as a topsoil cover for landfill and reclaimed Brownfield sites, the adsorption of inorganic metal ions can involve several processes. The {{extent to which these}} processes occur in a soil is difficult to predict, but it is these processes that govern the concentrations of metal ions and complexes in soil solution and therefore ultimately determine the availability to plant root systems, access to groundwaters and thus the success of this waste management practice. To authenticate and potentially improve this procedure, a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is needed. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify, quantify and characterise, under specific conditions, the release behaviour of a number of leachate components emanating from CLO and its associated soils, and to compare this performance against those of other waste materials and an agricultural soil. It was found that, although leachates from all treatments were weakly alkaline, substantial metal dissolution had occurred. Numerous heavy metals, nutrients and water-soluble metal salts were identified as being in major breach of landfill and drinking and surface water directives, as well as being significantly higher in concentration than a typical agricultural soil for the Durham region. In particular, extremely high conductivities (> 20 mS m(^- 1)) were recorded in undiluted and mixed CLO treatment leachates. Poor aesthetic quality and an extremely heterogeneous nature were also highlighted as major detrimental properties. In view of this, a simple pre-washing procedure using tap-water was devised which showed that significant <b>remediation</b> <b>value</b> would be gained from this economical pre-treatment technique. However, for the most part, active remediation was found to be insignificant, and mixing significantly reduced the favourable high organic matter (OM) content characteristic of CLO. This suggests that the amending materials chosen offer little more amelioration than that achieved by passive dilution. Further sequential extraction experiments and principal component analyses revealed that prevailing environmental conditions are of central consequence to the levels of contamination incurred. For the CLO-containing treatments, major releases were found to occur under field conditions experienced during the lysimeter trials - an oxic environment. The potential for further substantial contamination has, however, been shown to be immanent if an anaerobic environmental setting prevails. These anoxic releases are also true for sewage sludge, but additionally this material has been shown to intermittently leach components, under the same field conditions and to a significantly greater degree, that are characteristic of acidic, reducing and oxidising environments. It is imperative, therefore, that if CLO or sewage sludge is to be used in agriculture, either as a basis for bio-fuel production or as a soil amendment, the prevailing conditions should be continuously monitored and any necessary action swiftly taken.

Out of a total 38 analyzed soil and sediment samples, only 2 were found to contain heavy metals in concentrations higher than the MAC for agriculture soil. An increased concentration of copper (189. 1 mg/kg) was recorded in a sample of vineyard soil and increased nickel concentrations were recorded in one sample of pasture soil (60. 9 mg/kg). Further research showed that the high Ni concentrations were of the geochemical origin, while the high Cu was of anthropogenic origin. Out of a total 10 sediment samples analyzed according to Dutch criteria for threshold values, increased concentrations of Cu and Zn were found in one sample, and high concentrations of Ni were found in 4 samples.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the concentrations of 11 metals in the soil of asbestos tailings in Stragari, Serbia, and in the selected plant species that grow on it, to determine the ability of the plant species in accumulation and tolerance of researched metals. Concentrations of elements researched in the soil had this order: Mg> Fe> Ca> Ni> Cr> Mn> Co> Zn> Pb> Cu> Cd. Concentrations of the metals in plants was variable, dependent on the plant species and types of metals, and graded in the order: Mg> Ca> Fe> Ni> Mn> Cr> Zn> Co> Pb> Cu> Cd. The concentrations of Ni and Cr in the investigated soil were above <b>remediation</b> <b>values,</b> as well as the maximum allowable concentration of substances in the soil according to regulation of Republic of Serbia, and the concentration of Cd and Co were above limit values for a given metals in the soil. The metal uptake does not necessarily correlate with metal content in the soil. Metal uptake by plants depends on the bioavailability of the metal in soils, which in turn depends on the retention time of the metal, as well as the interaction with other elements and substances. However, the most Mg, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Co and Cr were found in species Sanguisorba minor, Ca and Cu in Eryngium serbicum, Ni in Alyssum murale, and Zn in Euphorbia cyparissias. In the Euphorbia cyparissias, it were determined the biological absorption coefficients greater than 1 for Zn and Cu, and in the species Eryngium serbicum and Sanguisorba minor greater than 2 for Cu. The results of this study emphasize the tolerance of several metal by species Sanguisorba minor, present the ability of Euphorbia cyparissias in accumulation of Zn and Cu, as well as of Eryngium serbicum and Sanguisorba minor in accumulation of Cu.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of large 1. 2 m diameter lysimeters has been implemented to monitor the soil water retention behaviour and permeability characteristics of contaminated soils under remediation. The work was carried out {{as part of a}} larger project focussing on the sustainable <b>remediation</b> of low <b>value</b> brownfield land. Three lysimeters have been filled with lead contaminated soil: one control; one with a WTR amendment; and one with a WTR and compost amendment. A new software system was built to control the TDR point water content measurement and irrigation system, which could log data to an online unified data repository; provided an interface for connectivity to any serial port device; deal with templating for simplified setup; and realtime feedback for the end user. High capacity tensiometers were used in conjunction with the TDR point water content measurement system to read volumetric water contents and suctions in the large control lysimeter over a series of wetting and drying cycles, each lasting several months. The results demonstrate that there was a difference between small scale laboratory tests and the data obtained from the lysimeters, particularly in the near surface soil due to cracking. Where cracking was not present, the agreement was stronger, but differences suggested that the drying curves in the lysimeter was predominantly scanning behaviour whereas the element tests were likely more representative of primary drying behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Portions of the SmartSampling{trademark} {{analysis}} methodology {{have been}} applied to the evaluation of radioactive contaminated landscape soils at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Specifically, the spatial, volumetric distribution of cesium- 137 ({sup 137 }Cs) contamination within Area of Concern 16 E- 1 has been modeled probabilistically using a geostatistical methodology, {{with the purpose of}} identifying the likelihood of successfully reducing, with respect to a pre-existing, baseline remediation plan, the volume of soil that must be disposed of offsite during clean-up. The principal objective of the analysis was to evaluate the likelihood of successful deployment of the Segmented Gate System (SGS), a novel remediation approach that emphasizes real-time separation of clean from contaminated materials during remediation operations. One primary requirement for successful application of the segmented gate technology investigated is that a variety of contaminant levels exist at the deployment site, which would enable to the SGS to discriminate material above and below a specified <b>remediation</b> threshold <b>value.</b> The results of this analysis indicate that there is potential for significant volume reduction with respect to the baseline remediation plan at a threshold excavation level of 23 pCi/g {sup 137 }Cs. A reduction of approximately 50 %, from a baseline volume of approximately 1, 064. 7 yd{sup 3 } to less than 550 yd{sup 3 }, is possible with acceptance of only a very small level of engineering risk. The vast majority of this volume reduction is obtained by not excavating almost all of levels 3 and 4 (from 12 to 24 inches in depth), which appear to be virtually uncontaminated, based on the available data. Additional volume reductions related to soil materials on levels 1 (depths of 0 [...] 6 inches) and 2 (6 [...] 12 inches) may be possible, specifically through use of the SGS technology. Level-by-level evaluation of simulation results suggests that as much as 26 percent of level 1 and as much as 65 % of level 2 soils may actually be uncontaminated. Additionally, numerical experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of selective excavation on the volume and average activity of the remediated materials. These numerical experiments indicate that nonselective excavation may result in mixing of contaminated and uncontaminated materials such that the total volume of material above the threshold excavation level of 23 pCi/g may exceed the baseline volume, thus defeating volume-reduction efforts...|$|R

40|$|In 1999 Soil-use {{specific}} Remediation Objectives (SRO) {{were derived}} for eight metals, PAHs, DDT and drins {{as part of}} the new soil clean-up policy. The SROs represent the minimal degree soil quality in the topsoil after <b>remediation.</b> Derived <b>values</b> are implemented in the policies for soil remediation and soil management. Evaluating this underpinning of the SRO was found necessary for the following reasons: 1) the issue of availability of new (toxicity) data and revised methods, 2) lack of specific toxicity data for plants and adequate risk levels for secondary poisoning, 3) lack of a method to derive a criterion to guarantee the quality of compost from contaminated soil, 4) uncertainty about the ecological impact of using the generic ecological criterion, HC 50. The report focuses on the soil quality criteria for humans, phytotoxicity, secondary poisoning, the generic ecological soil quality criterion and a criterion for maintaining the quality of compost. Several conclusions have arisen from this evaluation. First, when only new data and methods are implemented, derived SROs for soil-use category I need to be slightly changed for chromium, DDT/DDE and PAHs, while derived SROs for soil-use category II need to be changed for most compounds. Secondly, new data on phytotoxicity have made it possible to derive a criterion for phytotoxicity for cadmium, lead, chromium and nickel. However, taking secondary poisoning into account derived risk limits are shown to be lower for cadmium, lead, mercury, methyl-mercury and zinc. Thirdly, the method developed to derive soil quality criteria for producing good-quality compost leads {{to the conclusion that the}} SRO should be lowered for arsenic, zinc and mercury. For zinc, though, the current quality standard is already considered very stringent for practical use. In the investigation on the ecological relevance of HC 50 by comparing laboratory toxicity data with field toxicity data, the field data, in general, were concluded to be slightly higher. It was recommended to use more field toxicity data to be able to carry out a more extensive study. Many aspects like bioavailability influence this comparison. Although the current generic ecological criterion (HC 50) does not guarantee the unhampered functioning of the ecosystems, it was chosen as an acceptable standard. For the future, deriving ecological criteria based on specific protection goals is advisory. To reduce the uncertainty and risk to ecosystems, it was recommended to use the lower limit (when available) of the 90 %-confidence interval for HC 50 (LLHC 50) as the generic ecological soil quality criterion. This use will lead to more stringent SROs for most compounds...|$|R
40|$|Industrial and {{agricultural}} activities heavily constrain soil quality. Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) {{are a threat}} to {{public health and the}} environment alike. In this regard, the identification of areas that require remediation is crucial. In the herein research a geochemical dataset (230 samples) comprising 14 elements (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Ni, Mn, Fe, As, Cd, V, Cr, Ti, Al and S) was gathered throughout eight different zones distinguished by their main activity, namely, recreational, agriculture/livestock and heavy industry in the Avilés Estuary (North of Spain). Then a stratified systematic sampling method was used at short, medium, and long distances from each zone to obtain a representative picture of the total variability of the selected attributes. The information was then combined in four risk classes (Low, Moderate, High, <b>Remediation)</b> following reference <b>values</b> from several sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). A Bayesian analysis, inferred for each zone, allowed the characterization of PTEs correlations, the unsupervised learning network technique proving to be the best fit. Based on the Bayesian network structure obtained, Pb, As and Mn were selected as key contamination parameters. For these 3 elements, the conditional probability obtained was allocated to each observed point, and a simple, direct index (Bayesian Risk Index-BRI) was constructed as a linear rating of the pre-defined risk classes weighted by the previously obtained probability. Finally, the BRI underwent geostatistical modeling. One hundred Sequential Gaussian Simulations (SGS) were computed. The Mean Image and the Standard Deviation maps were obtained, allowing the definition of High/Low risk clusters (Local G clustering) and the computation of spatial uncertainty. High-risk clusters are mainly distributed within the area with the highest altitude (agriculture/livestock) showing an associated low spatial uncertainty, clearly indicating the need for remediation.

Swennen@geo. kuleuven. ac. be Wastewater {{discharge from the}} processing of phosphate ores has contributed to pollution by heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ba) and arsenic in soils adjoining the Grote Beek river (15 km long) in the north-eastern part of the province of ‘Vlaams-Brabant’ (Central Belgium). Dredging activities and the periodical inundation of the floodplain have brought about a severe pollution of the organic- and iron-rich wetland soils along the stream (Table 1). Moreover, the effluents of a polyvinylchloride plant generate chloride concentrations comparable to concentrations in seawater. Besides the determination of total metal concentrations in soils and sediments the speciation of heavy metals was assessed using a multidisciplinary approach, including chemical and mineralogical soil characterisation, porewater analysis, singular and sequential extractions en pHstat leaching tests. The combination of different approaches is essential for a thorough assessment of pollution (Cappuyns et al., 2002).

Elevated concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni, Ba (up to 160, 1000, 150 and 1300 µg/l respectively) and Cl- (up to. 6000 mg/l) were encountered in the porewater. Cd and As however show a low actual availability. MINTEQA 2 calculations suggest that the formation of chlorocomplexes is most important for Cd. The influence of elevated Cl- concentrations on heavy metal mobilisation (batch test) was most pronounced for Cu, Cd and Zn, although total concentrations released by a solution containing 6000 mg/l Cl- are rather low (maximum 1 mg/kg Cd and 3 mg/kg Cu and Zn) A modified SM&T (former BCR) sequential extraction procedure (Quevauviller, 1998), adapted to Fe-rich samples, was applied. The extraction with NH 2 OH. HCl 0. 1 M was repeated twice. To {{make a distinction between}} an easily reducible and a moderately reducible fraction, this extraction was followed by an extraction with NH 2 OH. HCl 0. 5 M in 25 % CH 3 COOH. Cd, Ni and Zn were mostly extracted in the easily reducible (NH 2 OH. HCl 0. 1 M) and acid extractable (CH 3 COOH 0. 11 M) fractions. For As however, the residual fraction and moderately reducible fraction prevailed. The oxidisable fraction (H 2 O 2) was only significant for Cu and Cr in some of the samples. An EDTA-extraction indicated a strong immobilisation of As and Cr, but points to a considerable (> 50 %) potential availability of Cd, Zn, Ni and Cu. pHstat leaching tests were performed at pH 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Leaching behaviour and speciation as a function of pH was modelled with a thermodynamic speciation model (MINTEQA 2, Allison et al., 1991). Reaction kinetics was also considered by mathematical fitting of leaching curves as a function of time (Schwartz et al., 1999). pHstat leaching tests at pH 6 (± soil pH) confirmed the limited actual mobility of most heavy metals and As (compared to the high total concentrations). The slow and constant release of Fe at pH 2 in some samples points to the slow dissolution of poorly stable Fe-oxides. The release of Cr and Cu as a function of pH could be modelled very well only considering adsorption to Fe-oxides and complexation by organic matter. The important release of Cd and Zn at pH 2 could not simply be explained by desorption, but is probably also due to the slow dissolution of poorly stable Fe-oxides. In the dredged sediments, however, the considerable leaching of Cd at pH 2 seems to be controlled by the dissolution of carbonates. Furthermore, the high CaCO 3 content in the dredged sediment results in a high acid buffering capacity. The similar leaching pattern of Ba and Fe suggests coprecipitation of Ba with Fe-oxides. There was almost no release of As in the pH range 2 - 10. Therefore As seems strongly incorporated in poorly reactive Fe-oxides, in accordance with the important residual fraction found in the sequential extraction. At pH 10, a considerable release of Cu is caused by the dissolution of organic matter. Complex formation with Cl- (Cd), dissolved organic matter (Ba, Ni) and OH- (Zn) enable small amounts of heavy metals to exist in the leachate at pH 10. According tot the Flemish regulation on Soil Remediation, sanitation of the alluvial plain of the Grote Beek is compulsory since <b>remediation</b> <b>values</b> are exceeded, particularly for As and Cd. Arsenic however is strongly immobilised in the Fe-rich sediments. Cd shows a low actual mobility, but changing environmental conditions (soil acidification, prolonged flooding) could enhance Cd mobility. This example points to the importance of speciation for the assessment of environmental pollution by heavy metals. References Allison J. D., Brown, D. S., Novo-Gradac, K. J. (1991).

(2) If contaminants of concern are present, determine their nature and extent. (3) Provide sufficient information and data to complete appropriate corrective actions. The CAU 554 dataset from the investigation results was evaluated based on the data quality indicator parameters. This evaluation demonstrated the quality and acceptability of the dataset for use in fulfilling the DQO data needs. Analytes detected during the CAI were evaluated against preliminary action levels (PALs) established in the CAU 554 CAIP for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) benzo(a) pyrene, dibenz(a,h) anthracene, and trichloroethene (TCE). Specifically: (1) The soil beneath and laterally outward from former underground storage tanks at CAS 23 - 02 - 08 contains TPH-diesel-range organics (DRO) above the PAL of 100 milligrams per kilogram, confined vertically from a depth of approximately 400 feet (ft) below ground surface (bgs). The contamination is confined to 12. 5 ft bgs to the subsurface media and laterally within approximately 100 ft of the release. (2) A single soil sample collected from the depth of 99 to 100 ft bgs demonstrated the presence of TCE at a concentration above the PAL. (3) Two soil samples collected from depths of 198 to 199 ft bgs and 380 to 382 ft bgs demonstrated the presence of benzo(a) pyrene at a concentration above the PAL. (4) Two soil samples collected from depths of 240 to 241 ft bgs and 290 to 291 ft bgs demonstrated the presence of dibenz(a,h) anthracene at a concentration above the PAL. Tier 2 final action levels (FALs) were then calculated for these contaminants. The Tier 2 FALs for TCE, benzo(a) pyrene, and dibenz(a,h) anthracene were calculated based on a limited exposure to subsurface contamination scenario, and the Tier 2 FAL for TPH-DRO was established as the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 9 Preliminary <b>Remediation</b> Goal <b>values</b> for the individual hazardous constituents of diesel. The evaluation of TPH-DRO, benzo(a) pyrene, dibenz(a,h) anthracene, and TCE based on the Tier 2 FALs determined that no FALs were exceeded. Therefore, the DQO data needs were met, and it was determined that no corrective action (based on risk to human receptors) is necessary for the site. As a best management practice for the remaining subsurface diesel contamination present at the site, a use restriction was imposed on future site activities that would not allow for future contact of the subsurface contamination. Therefore, the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office provides the following recommendations: (1) No further corrective action for CAU 554. (2) No Corrective Action Plan. (3) A Notice of Completion to the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is requested from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for closure of CAU 554. (4) Corrective Action Unit 554 should be moved from Appendix III to Appendix IV of the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order...|$|R
40|$|The {{public water}} supply in Germany is mainly based on groundwater, and great care is taken to protect these water resources. A major {{challenge}} is, however, the remediation of polluted aquifers. Such is the case at a former gas works site in Karlsruhe, Germany. The "Gaswerk Ost" of the local gas and water supply company, the Stadtwerke Karlsruhe, was in operation for nearly 80 years until it was closed down in 1965. Unwanted by-products from the gas production still contaminate the soil and groundwater of this site. The main contaminants are benzene and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as acenaph-thene, acenaphthylene, fluorene and fluoranthene. For remediation a novel passive methodology was planned. It was decided to install a funnel and gate system to purify the contaminated groundwater in situ by letting it pass through subterranean activated carbon reactors located downstream of the polluted site. During {{the construction of the}} remediation system a further pollutant, vinyl chloride (VC), was detected in the groundwater, a substance which could not be removed adequately by the technology employed. The objective of this research project was to find out whether the PAH and vinyl chloride could be removed from the groundwater by UV irradiation prior to the activated carbon filtration. Investigations consisted of two parts: laboratory experiments were conducted to prove the general degradability of the pollutants and field experiments were earned out to confirm these results on a pilot scale. In addition to sole UV irradiation, ozonation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as UV/aeration, UV/hydrogen peroxide and UV/ozone were performed in the laboratory to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. For the contaminants present at the gas works site, the individual molar absorption coefficients were determined at 254 nm to estimate the degradation performance by direct photolysis at the main emission line of the UV lamps used for the irradiation experiments. It could be shown that all investigated substances were degradable in model test solutions prepared with reverse osmosis water, the degradation of PAH being significantly better than that of benzene and VC depending on the absorption of UV light of the individual substances. During the irradiation of acenaphthene the detection of by-products with an aromatic character showed that no complete mineralisation could, however, be achieved in an acceptable period of time. Degradation experiments performed in tap water as well as in groundwater showed slower degradation behaviour due to the high carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations and a high organic carbon content, mainly resulting from humic substances in the case of groundwater. The high iron concentration of the reduced groundwater led to an increase in turbidity during irradiation, since iron II was oxidised to iron III. In contrast to UV irradiation only, better results were achieved with combined treatment methods and with ozonation. For all methods tested in the laboratory the "Electrical Energy per Order of Magnitude" (EEO) was calculated from the degradation data, ozonation being most efficient for all investigated substances with regard to the energy consumption. On the basis of the laboratory findings it was decided to perform not only UV experiments at the gas works site but to extend the in-situ investigation programme by including ozonation. With UV irradiation the concentrations of the PAH acenaphthylene, fluorene, fluoranthene and pyrene could be reduced by nearly 90 %. The total efficiency of UV irradiation in this specific groundwater was, however, unsatisfactory because the main contaminant acenaph-thene was removed by only 50 % to a concentration of approximately 35 g/l (<b>remediation</b> target <b>value</b> = 0. 2 g/l) although 1. 33 kWh per m 3 were applied with four lamp modules, each containing six lamps. In contrast to this, ozonation resulted in a complete elimination of VC and PAH as well as nearly 90 % removal of benzene, thus confirming the laboratory findings. As almost all contaminants could be removed by ozonation only, combined UV/ozone treatment was not applied in situ. Ozonation technology was found to be the most favourable method for the removal of contaminants present at the former gas works site in Karlsrahe based on its practicability, economic advantages and high efficiency...|$|R
