5|$|Early in {{the first}} half, by much rushing, forcing, snapbacks and {{vigorous}} bullyragging Riggs, the huge Hopkins quarterback, crashed over the goal line for 4 points. Paul Dashiell converted. Riggs <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> performance but Dashiell missed conversion. Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone went over for the first score.|$|E

5|$|After {{his junior}} year at the University of Florida, McKee left the Gators swim team to train {{full-time}} for the 1976 Olympics. The 23-year-old McKee again qualified for the U.S. team in the 400-meter individual medley at the 1976 U.S. Olympic Trials. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, he <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> second-place performance in the men's 400-meter individual medley event, finishing behind gold medalist and fellow American Rod Strachan. The times of both Strachan (4:23.68) and McKee (4:24.62) broke the prior world record in the event final, with Strachan setting the new mark.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{the missionary}} {{established}} a mission among the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, where he <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> Baie-Saint-Paul design: a log chapel at the centre surrounded by small cabins {{for the local}} population, with outlying farms. The mission closed ten years later; Belcourt blamed this on mismanagement by oblates he had entrusted with its management. In 1845, Belcourt served as the chaplain to some buffalo hunters, but returned to his first mission at Baie-Saint-Paul to teach the Chippewa language {{to a group of}} oblates.|$|E
5|$|In 281 BC, at {{the request}} of the Greek city of Tarentum, Pyrrhus, the King of the Greek state of Epirus, went with an army of 25,500 men and 20 {{elephants}} to Italy to help fight the Romans. The Romans had succeeded in conquering most of Italy and were now moving in to take the Greek cities in Magna Graecia. After arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum. Pyrrhus <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> success against Romans by defeating another army at the Battle of Asculum.|$|E

5|$|In the 1937–38 season, O'Reilly {{returned}} to more regular state cricket, and New South Wales duly won the Sheffield Shield {{for the first}} time in five seasons. He took 33 wickets at an average of just over 14 runs each, and against South Australia at Adelaide he <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> feat against Somerset in 1934, taking the last nine wickets of the first innings at a cost of 41 runs. This time, he followed up with five for 57 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{shocked and}} dejected, {{returned}} to the palace since he had already anointed his son, Devavrata, as heir apparent. Devavrata was distressed by his father's condition; he learned about the promise asked by the fisherman-chief from a minister. Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief and begged for Satyvati's hand on his father's behalf. The fisherman <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu was worthy of Satyavati; he had rejected marriage proposals from even Brahmarishis like Asita.|$|E
5|$|The strenuous {{campaign}} took {{a decisive}} toll on Helm's already weakened body. He {{was too weak}} to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's secretary of state read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states. Though he promised protections for blacks, he opposed the idea of black suffrage.|$|E

5|$|Tonelli {{arrived in}} Moscow facing a heavy schedule: he was {{nominated}} in the 100m freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, the 200m backstroke and the 4100m medley and the 4200m freestyle relays. Tonelli came third in his heat of the 100m freestyle to qualify fourth {{with a time of}} 52.04s. However, he swam slower in coming fifth in his semifinal in a time of 52.17s to miss the final by 0.26s. Overall, he was ranked 10th, but if he <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> Australian record of 51.80 set at the selection trials, he would have come sixth.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{told the}} Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg side bowling was <b>repeated,</b> <b>his</b> men {{would leave the}} field and return to London.

Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.|$|E

The following year, 1977, Youngblood was voted to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl and a consensus All-NFC selection and second-team All-Pro while leading the Rams in sacks for the fifth straight season. In 1978, the Rams led the NFL in total defense and Youngblood was a consensus first-team All-Pro for the fourth time in five years.|$|E

5|$|Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and put Hungary {{under an}} interdict on 25 February 1232, because the {{employment}} of Jews and Muslims continued despite the Golden Bull of 1231. Since the archbishop accused the Muslims of persuading Andrew to seize church property, Andrew restored properties to the archbishop, who soon suspended the interdict. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory sent Cardinal Giacomo Pecoraria as his legate to Hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the pope's special authorization. Although Andrew departed for Halych to support his youngest son in a fight against Daniel Romanivich, he continued his negotiations with the papal legate. On 20 August 1233, in the forests of Bereg, he vowed {{that he would not}} employ Jews and Muslims to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues. Andrew <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> oath in Esztergom in September.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Federer lost a much-anticipated {{semifinal}} {{match to}} Novak Djokovic, after squandering two match {{points in the}} fifth set, which <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> previous year's result against Djokovic and added a second loss from two sets up in Grand Slam tournament play to his record. With that loss, it meant that Federer did not win {{at least one of}} the four majors in 2011, the first time since 2002. Later that month in September 2011, in a South African poll, Federer was voted the second most trusted and respected person in the world, next to Nelson Mandela.|$|E
5|$|Dalassenos {{maintained}} an aggressive stance. In 996 his forces raided the environs of Tripoli and Arqa, while Manjutakin, again without success, laid siege to Aleppo and Antartus, but {{was forced to}} withdraw when Dalassenos with his army came to relieve the fortress. The next year, Dalassenos <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> raids against Tripoli, Rafaniya, Awgh, and al-Lakma, capturing the latter. At the same time, the inhabitants of Tyre, {{under the leadership of}} a sailor named Allaqa, rose up in revolt against the Fatimids and requested Byzantine assistance; further south, in Palestine, the Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah attacked Ramlah.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In a {{match between}} the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline {{practitioners}} of 1932–33, employed the strategy with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height. Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg-side bowling was <b>repeated,</b> <b>his</b> men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would {{not return to the}} country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day.

5|$|Kerry {{was second}} in his heat of the 200m {{freestyle}} heat {{in a time of}} 1m 54.86s, but was four seconds off the pace and did not qualify for the final. His time was 2.08s behind the slowest qualifier, placing him 16th. Kerry did not get to swim in the 4200m freestyle relay. The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry <b>repeated</b> <b>his</b> individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth.|$|E
