500|$|The phase {{properties}} of a 90° hybrid coupler {{can be used}} to great advantage in microwave circuits. [...] For example, in a balanced microwave amplifier the two input stages are fed through a hybrid coupler. [...] The FET device normally has a very poor match and reflects much of the incident energy. [...] However, since the devices are essentially identical the reflection coefficients from each device are equal. [...] The reflected voltage from the FETs are in phase at the isolated port and are 180° different at the input port. [...] Therefore, all of the <b>reflected</b> <b>power</b> from the FETs goes to the load at the isolated port and no power goes to the input port. [...] This results in a good input match (low VSWR).|$|E

40|$|A {{homogeneous}} {{distribution of}} SiO 2 precipitates in Czochralski-grown silicon containing different amounts of oxygen were produced by annealing the dislocation-free crystals at 1023 K. The resulting long-range strain field modifies the integrated <b>reflecting</b> <b>power</b> R of the Bragg reflections measured on an absolute scale with 316 keV [gamma]-radiation. The thickness dependence of R has been modelled using {{the results of}} statistical dynamical theory. The assumption made in Kato's original theory, where the correlation length [Gamma] for the wave-field amplitudes {{is proportional to the}} extinction length, has to be abandoned. Recent modifications to statistical dynamical theory by Becker & Al Haddad [Acta Cryst. (1990). A 46, 123 - 139] lead to excellent agreement with the present experimental results. Furthermore, in the present case, the correlation length [tau], describing short-range correlation in the fluctuations of the phase factor caused by the displacement field of the defects, turns out to be very small, so that the contribution of the mixed term to the integrated <b>reflecting</b> <b>power</b> could be neglected. Therefore, the defect scattering is characterized by the static Debye-Waller factor alone, which was determined accurately from the thickness dependence of the measured integrated <b>reflecting</b> <b>power.</b> From the ratio of the static Debye-Waller factors determined for different orders of reflection, the sizes of the SiO 2 precipitates have been calculated and the results are in very good agreement with the values determined directly from small-angle neutron scattering on the same samples...|$|R
