40|$|Value {{creation}} and value appropriation are key aims of business organisations. While value {{has been studied}} in many management contexts, the value creating potential of product returns management remains under-researched. Extant literature on product returns management has concentrated on the cost dimension of the returns process, with limited attention given to exploring the nature of value, its creation, and appropriation. The boundary spanning scope of product returns management has also been ignored, with most studies focussing on the activity of a single party in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain.</b> Further, despite {{the increasing use of}} 3 PLs in product returns management, the role of the 3 PL in value creation remains little understood. This research examines what value means in the context of product returns. It explores how value is created and appropriated in a product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> using a triadic case study composed of a retailer, two of its suppliers, and a 3 PL engaged by the retailer, in the consumer electronics sector. The research extends the understanding of product returns value beyond a single party in the <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> to a triad of entities. Using an inductive qualitative methodology, this study found that value in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> was multi-dimensional. Value consisted of tangible (financial) and intangible elements; residual product value was of little importance to the suppliers and the retailer in the study. The main drivers of value involved the structure of the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain,</b> a collaborative orientation of the parties, and information management. The study also identified a process of value evolution that explains changes in value for the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> parties when the <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> changed from a decentralised configuration to a centralised structure. The study has two major contributions. First, it offers a comprehensive explanation of the nature of value in product returns, and contributes a value evolution matrix to explain how value in a product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> could be realised, based on the value orientation of the <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> members, and the nature of facilitation in the product returns process. Second, it develops a value {{creation and}} appropriation framework to explain how value orientation of the parties in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain</b> and external facilitation by a 3 PL could bring about process alignment to increase resource effectiveness and operational efficiency, and how trust, power, and relationship quality could affect value appropriation. These findings challenge the traditional cost-based view of product returns, offering insights on how a 3 PL could facilitate to align the operations of a retailer with those of its suppliers to create value in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain.</b> The study contributes to our theoretical understanding of the product returns process, and reveals a practical managerial path to value creation and appropriation in product returns management...|$|R
40|$|Product returns {{management}} (PRM) is a core {{supply chain}} management process (Rogers, Lambert et al. 2002). Extant literature on PRM typically focuses on the cost dimension of the returns process (e. g., Stuart, Bonawi-tan et al. 2005), such as efficiency of reverse logistics activities (e. g., Richey, Chen et al. 2005), disposition of the returned products - product reuse, material recycling and salvage - and the associated aspects of production planning and inventory management (e. g., Li and Olorunniwo 2008). This paper overcomes the limitations in extant literature on PRM - it explores value creation and appropriation by several parties in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain.</b> Specifically it answers the following research questions: - What constitutes value in the product returns process for parties involved in the <b>returns</b> <b>chain?</b> - How is value created in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain?</b> - Who appropriates this value in the product <b>returns</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

His most famous work is Life {{is a dream}} (1635), a {{philosophical}} drama in which Segismundo, son of the king of Poland, is chained in a tower because of the fateful predictions of the royal astrologers that he will kill his father. Meanwhile, Rosaura proclaims in the Court that her honor has been violated by Duke Astolfo. Duke Astolfo courts Estrella {{in order to become}} king. The aggressiveness of Segismundo explodes when he is released from his tower, where he <b>returns,</b> <b>chained,</b> believing he has dreamed his experience of freedom. When a riot rescues him again, his will overcomes the predictions: he overcomes his violent nature, marries Rosaura to Astolfo, and accepts the hand of Estrella.|$|R

Successfully managing the collaboration and underlying information chain is critical for the delivery of the end service. This paper gives insights into the challenges present {{in the domain of}} service value chains and their underlying information chains. We focus on collaborations without formal hierarchy where decisions are based on consensus. Subsequently, we introduce an IT management capability framework that can help to overcome these challenges. We validated our framework and deployment approach by applying it in a case study at the Dutch payroll tax <b>return</b> <b>chain</b> (in Dutch: Loonaangifteketen). The results show that our framework helps organizations in value chains to identify their collaboration capability maturity resulting in a selection of improvement areas.

40|$|Value {{creation}} and maximising {{the appropriation of}} value vis-a-vis other entities in the supply chain are key aims of any organisation. Studies on the contribution of product returns management to firm value are limited and fragmented. Most have taken the narrow view that value is derived from product disposal activities. This paper synthesises the literature on value and applies the value construct to the product returns process in the business-to-business (B 2 B) context. The paper reviews the literature on value and distils the applicability of this construct to the management of product returns. The Strategic Profit Model (SPM), which connects an organisation&# 039;s revenues, costs, and resources to its return on assets based on activities in the forward supply chain, guided the literature synthesis. The value elements were mapped against key elements of the SPM to develop an integrated framework for value creation in the B 2 B product <b>return</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

40|$|Design {{has been}} {{recognised}} in the literature as a catalyst {{to move away from}} the traditional model of take-make-dispose to achieve a more restorative, regenerative and circular economy. As such, for a circular economy to thrive, products need to be designed for closed loops, as well as be adapted to generate revenues. This should not only be at the point of purchase, but also during use, and be supported by low-cost <b>return</b> <b>chains</b> and reprocessing structures, as well as effective policy and regulation. To date, most academic and grey literature on the circular economy has focused primarily on the development of new business models, with some of the latter studies addressing design strategies for a circular economy, specifically in the area of resource cycles and design for product life extension. However, these studies primarily consider a limited spectrum of the technical and biological cycles where materials are recovered and restored and nutrients (e. g., materials, energy, water) are regenerated. This provides little guidance or clarity for designers wishing to design for new circular business models in practice. As such, this paper aims to address this gap by systematically analysing previous literature on Design for Sustainability (DfX) (e. g., design for resource conservation, design for slowing resource loops and whole systems design) and links these approaches to the current literature on circular business models. A conceptual framework is developed for circular economy design strategies. From this conceptual framework, recommendations are made to enable designers to fully consider the holistic implications for design within a circular economy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} consumer returns policies. In our model, consumers face valuation uncertainty and realize their valuations only after purchase. There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and refund amount. Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e. g., using 100 % money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e. g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain {{in the presence of}} consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings. consumer <b>returns,</b> supply <b>chains,</b> valuation uncertainty, newsvendor model, supply contracts...|$|R
