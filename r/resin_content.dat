2500|$|Some {{species of}} gum trees drop {{branches}} unexpectedly. In Australia, Parks Victoria warns campers not to camp under river red gums. Some councils in Australia such as Gosnells, Western Australia, have removed eucalypts after reports of damage from dropped branches, {{even in the}} face of lengthy, well publicised protests to protect particular trees. A former Australian National Botanic Gardens director and consulting arborist, Robert Boden, has been quoted referring to [...] "summer branch drop". Dropping of branches is recognised in Australia literature through the fictional death of Judy in Seven Little Australians. Although all large trees can drop branches, the density of eucalyptus wood is high due to its high <b>resin</b> <b>content,</b> increasing the hazard.|$|E

A series of {{laboratory}} experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of resin on the strength of a clay soil and soil-cement mixtures. One group of tests were carried out on samples of the clay soil that were prepared with different <b>resin</b> <b>contents.</b> Another group of tests were conducted on mixtures of soil-cement and soil-cement-resin with specified <b>resin</b> <b>contents.</b> The results show that adding more than 10 % resin increases the strength of the soil, whereas at <b>resin</b> <b>contents</b> below 10 % no significant effect was observed. The strengths of the samples of soil, soil- cement mixture and soil-cement-resin mixture increased with increasing percentages of cement and resin.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that, regardless of origin, the recovery of bitumen from oil sands is related to its viscosity. Asphaltene and <b>resin</b> <b>contents</b> are known to affect the viscosity of bitumen. Here we compare the composition of solvent extracted bitumens from several Athabasca oil sands having very different recovery profiles. After careful removal of any associated mineral matter by ultra-centrifugation, each bitumen sample was separated into saturate, aromatic, resin and asphaltene fractions by an enhanced SARA technique. The individual components were then characterized by several complementary analytical techniques, including CHNS, size exclusion chromatography molecular weight (MWn) plus proton and 93 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Based on this comparison, we see no correlation between the recovery of bitumen and its composition. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

50|$|The {{impregnated}} tows {{are then}} literally wound around a mandrel (mold core) {{in a controlled}} pattern to form {{the shape of the}} part. After winding, the resin is then cured, typically using heat. The mold core may be removed or may be left as an integral component of the part(Rosato, D.V.).This process is primarily used for hollow, generally circular or oval sectioned components, such as pipes and tanks. Pressure vessels, pipes and drive shafts have all been manufactured using filament winding. It has been combined with other fiber application methods such as hand layup, pultrusion, and braiding. Compaction is through fiber tension and <b>resin</b> <b>content</b> is primarily metered. The fibers may be impregnated with resin before winding (wet winding), pre-impregnated (dry winding) or post-impregnated. Wet winding has the advantages of using the lowest cost materials with long storage life and low viscosity.

40|$|A resol type {{phenolic}} resin {{was prepared for}} the impregnation of wood particles used for the reinforcement of PLA. A preliminary study showed that the resin penetrates wood with rates depending on the concentration of the solution and on temperature. Treatment with a solution of 1 wt% resin resulted in a considerable increase of composite strength and decrease of water absorption. Composite strength improved {{as a result of}} increased inherent strength of the wood, but interfacial adhesion might be modified as well. When wood was treated with resin solutions of larger concentrations, the strength of the composites decreased, first slightly, then drastically to a very small value.
