5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young chess {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve {{a lower level of}} chess skill. This <b>result</b> <b>was</b> explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E
5000|$|By convention, {{the three}} primary colors in {{additive}} mixing are red, green, and blue. In {{the absence of}} color or, when no colors <b>are</b> showing, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> black. If all three primary colors <b>are</b> showing, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> white. When red and green combine, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> yellow. When red and blue combine, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> magenta. When blue and green combine, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> cyan.|$|R

5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) {{and union}} members (over wage rates) {{resulted}} in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} season with a 3–0 win in the Charity Shield against last season's Premier League runners-up Manchester United. Goals came from Overmars in the first half, Christopher Wreh after 61 minutes and Nicolas Anelka 11 minutes after.

5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E
5|$|At Miami, Hanulak scored {{first on}} a two-yard rush. Morgan {{recovered}} a Miami fumble {{and on the}} ensuing possession Faloney scored on an eight-yard rush. By halftime, Maryland led 27–0.

5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This <b>result</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E

5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E

His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
