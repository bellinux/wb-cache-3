5|$|Several {{hours after}} the riot had been broken up, police made a retaliatory raid on a gay bar in San Francisco's Castro District. Many patrons were beaten by police in <b>riot</b> <b>gear.</b> Two dozen arrests were made {{during the course of}} the raid, and several people later sued the SFPD.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{closure of}} 150coal mines, {{some of which}} were not losing money, resulted in the loss {{of tens of thousands of}} jobs and had the effect of devastating entire communities. Miners had helped bring down the Heath ministry, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as NCB leader, and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with <b>riot</b> <b>gear,</b> contributed to her triumph over the striking miners.|$|E
5|$|By 1:30 pm, around 1,000 monks had congregated {{inside to}} hold a meeting while outside a large crowd of pro-Buddhist {{students}} had formed a human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but a hundred monks slowly left the compound. Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning <b>riot</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PTU {{officers}} {{are equipped with}} a variegated arsenal of weapons, such as <b>riot</b> <b>gears,</b> pepper spray, batons, the Heckler & Koch HK69A1 tear gas launcher, the Heckler & Koch USP semi-auto pistol and the Heckler and Koch MP5 sub-machine gun.|$|R
50|$|Petra is a {{sculpture}} made in 2010 by the German artist Marcel Walldorf. It is a lifelike {{representation of a}} policewoman in <b>riot</b> control <b>gear</b> squatting down and urinating. Although controversial for its alleged misogyny, it obtained an award from the Leinemann-Stiftung für Bildung und Kunst in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Riot Control Vehicles - Riot Control Vehicle ‘Vajra’ {{based on}} light {{commercial}} vehicle is suitable for law enforcement duties and transportation of security forces along with their <b>riot</b> control <b>gear</b> to the affected areas.

5|$|Later that evening, several police cruisers {{filled with}} {{officers}} wearing <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> {{arrived at the}} Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's protégé Cleve Jones and {{a reporter for the}} San Francisco Chronicle, Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking along the street. The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of the Castro had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year he {{returned}} to the field, West worked in the ALDS. He also umpired in the 2003 and 2004 ALCS. In game six of the latter series, West's crew ruled Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez out for interference after Rodriguez appeared to swat the ball out of the glove of opposing pitcher Bronson Arroyo on his way to first base. Fans threw debris on the field, Red Sox manager Terry Francona pulled his team off the field, and NYPD officers in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> took to the field to calm the crowd. West said fans actually applauded the umpires for the correct call when they came onto the field the following day. West’s first All-Star Game and World Series appearances after his rehire came in 2005; that year he umpired in his second ALDS and his third World Series, serving as World Series crew chief.|$|E
50|$|In {{the modern}} French Army the bonnet de police is still {{worn by the}} 1st Regiment of Spahis in the {{historic}} bright red of this branch. The bonnet de police is also worn by anti-riot law enforcement units, such as the Gendarmerie Mobile of the French Gendarmerie (at least when in <b>riot</b> control <b>gear)</b> and the CRS of the French National Police. Members of these units may have to change quickly from an ordinary headdress to a helmet, and an easily foldable cap is therefore practical.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} social {{dynamics}} {{in the city}} of Salford {{at the time of the}} Pendleton riot, which took place amidst the four days of national rioting that began with the killing of Mark Duggan in Tottenham by the Metropolitan Police Service. Attempting to counter what we see as a dominant narrative of the riots as 'shopping with violence', this article explores the development of the significant disorder in Salford through a triangulation of accounts, including an extensive review of journalistic accounts, alongside interviews from a dozen people who witnessed the riots as police officers, residents and spectators. Beginning with an overview of the events of August 9 th 2011, we argue that the deployment of officers in <b>riots</b> <b>gear</b> in the vicinity of Salford Precinct proved provocative, and created a focal point for the widespread antagonism felt towards the police. Furthermore, we suggest that an understanding of local contextual factors is critical both in terms of answering the question ‘why Salford?’, but also in terms of explaining the ferocity of the violence targeted towards officers of Greater Manchester Police (in contrast to the focus on looting in nearby Manchester city-centre). Interpreting the riots as a response to punitive policing policies that have accompanied state-directed policies of large-scale gentrification, we highlight the degree to which the 'contestations over space' that characterised the riot pointed to an underlying politics of resistance (despite lacking 'formal' political articulation).

50|$|In the film, the First Order {{is led by}} {{a mysterious}} figure named Snoke, who has assumed the title of Supreme Leader. Like the Empire before them, the Order {{commands}} a vast force of stormtroopers, some specially trained {{in the use of}} flamethrowers, man portable light artillery systems, and <b>riot</b> control <b>gear.</b> The First Order also utilizes regular and Special Forces versions of the Empire's venerable TIE fighter. Its primary base of operations is Starkiller Base, a fortified ice planet which houses a superweapon capable of destroying entire star systems from a great distance. The base commander of Starkiller is General Hux, a ruthless young officer dedicated to the Order.|$|R

25|$|On November 17, 2006, 400 protesters, {{including}} UCLA {{faculty and}} staff, parents, community members, and UCLA students, gathered at Kerckhoff Hall to {{protest against the}} incident.

50|$|The {{housing project}} is {{especially}} {{known for a}} pattern of tension between residents, gang members, and police. In 1991, police shot and killed an unarmed gang member, leading to an FBI investigation and grand jury probe {{of the police department}} for it and three other police killings. A firefight between gang members and police in 1996 ended with one gang member dead, a police officer wounded, and an angry crowd. Gang members shot at patrol vehicles in 2006. In 2007, a gang member died while in LAPD custody. The 2007 incident erupted in a riot involving 50 gang members and 100 police equipped in <b>riot</b> control <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Israeli {{forces were}} {{provided}} with <b>riot</b> and crowd-control <b>gear,</b> and were ordered to use live fire only under extreme circumstances. Israel's political leadership instructed the IDF not to take risks and assume major precautions. Soldiers were ordered not to intervene in peaceful demonstrations that did not target soldiers, settlers, or infrastructure. The IDF said that it wanted [...] "zero funerals" [...] during the demonstrations. Senior field officers were deployed in every sector of operations to monitor the situation and assist in the decision-making process. Israeli commanders also monitored internet chatter and social media websites to get {{a clear sense of}} the Palestinian street's mood. IDF Brigades were also trained to deal with clashes between Palestinians and settlers.|$|R
5000|$|The Cleveland Police Department {{received}} $50 {{million in}} federal grants to support local police operations during the event. With this grant money, the City of Cleveland sought to purchase over 2,000 <b>riot</b> control personnel <b>gear</b> sets prior to the convention for $20 million, and the remaining $30 million {{is expected to go}} to personnel expenses. Items such as water guns, swords, tennis balls and coolers have been banned by the City of Cleveland from the 1.7-square-mile [...] "event zone" [...] outside the convention hall by the City of Cleveland, but because of a statewide open-carry law permitting the open carrying of guns, firearms are permitted. The Cleveland chapter of the NAACP raised concerns in March 2016 in a letter to city and county leaders about security at the Convention, writing that police were unprepared for a [...] "possible mix of protesters and demonstrators brandishing guns." [...] The Cleveland Police Union also raised concerns similar to those raised by the local NAACP in March, writing that equipment and training for police was behind schedule. On July 16—the eve of the convention—the Cleveland Police Union asked Governor John Kasich to temporarily suspend Ohio's state open-carry gun law so as to block the carrying of guns within the event zone, but Kasich rejected the request, writing: [...] "Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested." ...|$|R

25|$|A {{few days}} later 200 outraged African-Americans took over a meeting in City Hall and {{threatened}} to bar the doors. For three hours they pummeled City Council with angry accusations, threats, claims of a police cover-up, and physically pushed and shoved a member of Council until they moved to the District 1 police station. For an hour they threw stones and bottles at police in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> and smashed in the station's front door before police opened fire with bean bags, rubber bullets, and tear gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} has also experienced tension with local residents with occasional clashes between local police and {{students at a}} popular off-campus block party. In 2000, the party with about 2,500 students grew out of hand and required a police presence at the Forest Hills townhouse complex on Village Lane. Ten years later, police equipped with <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> used force to disperse a group of 8,000 college-aged individuals at the party. Several participants were airlifted to a medical center in Charlottesville to treat their injuries. The {{university has}} condemned {{the behavior of the}} block party attendees.|$|E
25|$|At about 1:30 am, {{the police}} attacked. A wave of about 150 {{of them in}} <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> charged {{the western part of}} the {{barricades}} in a solid shield wall. Due to an early warning from the lookout post on top of the squat, the defenders were prepared. They bombarded the police with stones and petrol bombs, forcing them to retreat after about 10 minutes. Of the 150 police officers involved in the charge, only about 14 made it near the barricades, and about 40 police officers were injured in the attack.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Rau {{was sent}} to the Management Unit, known simply as Management, which the Baxter {{psychologist}} had specifically warned was not a suitable long-term solution. Management consisted of solitary-confinement cells, with both the bed and the toilet visible to Baxter staff through the windows. Rau was entitled to four hours each day outside her cell (although not in the company of other detainees), and, whenever she had to be returned to her cell, GSL officers wearing <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> would forcibly put her into the cell, according to Sister Claudette Cusack.|$|E
25|$|Polycarbonate is {{commonly}} used in eye protection, {{as well as in}} other projectile-resistant viewing and lighting applications that would normally indicate the use of glass, but require much higher impact-resistance. Polycarbonate lenses also protect the eye from UV light. Many kinds of lenses are manufactured from polycarbonate, including automotive headlamp lenses, lighting lenses, sunglass/eyeglass lenses, swimming goggles and SCUBA masks, and safety glasses/goggles/visors including visors in sporting helmets/masks and police <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> (helmet visors, riot shields, etc.). Windscreens in small motorized vehicles are commonly made of polycarbonate, such as for motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, and small planes and helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 Wiltshire Police {{prevented}} a vehicle convoy {{of several hundred}} new age travellers from setting up at the 11th Stonehenge Free Festival at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, after English Heritage (the custodians of the site) were granted an exclusion zone of some four miles around the Stones. A violent exchange between the travellers and police in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> took place over several hours. eight police officers and sixteen travellers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. One traveller suffered from a fractured skull. As much of the action {{took place in a}} field containing a bean crop, the events became known as the Battle of the Beanfield.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on the {{previous}} day, two battalions from the MVD, troops mainly equipped with truncheons and <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> (those troops who were armed with firearms were armed with blanks and not given the permission to open fire), arrived in Sumgait in buses and armored personnel carriers. As they moved in to secure the town, the soldiers found themselves as targets of the mob. In what became a startling sight for the city's residents, the soldiers were attacked and maimed with the improvised steel objects. Their armored vehicles were flipped over {{and in some cases}} disabled by molotov cocktails, as the troops found themselves in complete disarray.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s {{the city had}} been a popular spring break resort. Glamorized as a {{destination}} in the 1963 movie Palm Springs Weekend, {{the number of visitors}} grew and at times the gatherings had problems. In 1969 an estimated 15,000 people had gathered for a concert at the Palm Springs Angel Stadium and 300 were arrested for drunkenness or disturbing the peace. In the 1980s 10,000+ college students would visit the city and form crowds and parties – and another rampage occurred in 1986 when Palm Springs Police in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> had to put down the rowdy crowd. In 1990, due to complaints by residents, mayor Sonny Bono and the city council closed the city's Palm Canyon Drive to Spring Breakers and the downtown businesses lost money normally filled by the tourists.|$|E
25|$|The same day, Haniyeh {{was allowed}} to return to Gaza without the money, but while {{crossing}} the border, gunmen attacked his car, killing one bodyguard. One of Haniyeh's sons was moderately wounded and his political adviser Ahmed Youssef was lightly wounded. At the time, Fatah PLC member and former Fatah security chief Mohammed Dahlan was blamed for this apparent assassination attempt. Peace activist Ellen Rosser also believes that it were Dahlan's men who tried to assassinate Haniyeh. Fighting broke out in the West Bank after Palestinian National Security Forces fired on a Hamas rally in Ramallah. Security units loyal to Mahmoud Abbas and dressed in <b>riot</b> <b>gear,</b> used clubs and rifles to beat back the demonstrators before the shooting broke out. At least 20 people were wounded in the clashes, which came shortly after the attempt to assassinate Ismail Haniya.|$|E
25|$|Thursday May 9, 1968, strike leaders, {{including}} sanitation {{crew chief}} Joe Savage, encouraged sanitation workers {{to return to}} work. That morning, over 100 sanitation workers reported to the sanitation department. 35 workers had come with the anticipation to work, while others showed up to protest. Police Sergeant Ray Stewart had also come to the sanitation compound along with other officers equipped with <b>riot</b> <b>gear.</b> At approximately 7:10a.m., the first of five garbage trucks attempted to leave the compound under police escort, but was met with a human blockade of protesters barricading the exit. At the advice of attorney James Sanderlin and crew chief Joe Savage, the protesters allowed three trucks to exit. A fourth and fifth truck were eventually able to leave without further incident at 7:28a.m. The five garbage trucks collected garbage from businesses, schools, and hospitals while most residential trash continued to go uncollected.|$|E
25|$|As the {{bargaining}} talks continued in December, sporadic violence broke out. A coal auger was blown up at a mine near Saint Charles, Georgia, a coal train was stopped and delayed in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, and in Utah a state judge issued a 10-day {{restraining order against}} the union and 1,100 summonses issued after replacement miners complained of being harassed by picketers. On December 13, state police in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> tear-gassed about 400 coal miners in Daviess County, Kentucky, who had thrown rocks and bottles at passing coal trucks. Four weeks into the strike, five union miners were indicted on federal charges for conspiracy in the dynamiting of {{a section of the}} Norfolk and Western Railway on which non-union coal was being carried. In Indiana, Gov. Otis Bowen called out the National Guard on February 14 to protect coal truck convoys. In Virginia, Gov. John Dalton {{declared a state of emergency}} on March 7 and ordered the state police to begin patrolling coal-producing areas. But Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp and West Virginia Gov. Jay Rockefeller refused to call out the National Guard in their states, and Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson agreed to let his state police officers to accompany federal marshals but refused to have them enforce federal labor law.|$|E
500|$|For his {{personal}} exhibition in March 2015 entitled [...] "Resisting Against Absurdity", Wong reunited pieces he created for previous protest marches and added new works: {{in particular the}} Black Cop Candle – a set of wax statues of policemen in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> and raised batons. These symbolise the seven [...] "black" [...] (meaning corrupt) cops who beat up a protester and who were caught on film so doing during the 2014 protests; lighting the candles would melt them and transform them into light.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Fall Out Boy {{embarked}} on the Believers Never Die Tour Part Deux, which included dates in the United States and Canada. The {{name of the}} tour {{was based on the}} band's 2004 Believers Never Die Tour. In keeping with the political themes of Folie à Deux, the tour featured symbolic commentary on the current state of corporate America. The group began the sets with a [...] "corporate retreat" [...] in which the group performed in dress suits with policemen in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> playing drums {{by the side of the}} stage. Afterwards, the band would change to casual attire for the rest of the set. Wentz noted that the purpose of the formal dress was to demonstrate [...] "how the rich rob the poor", and encouraged fans to direct attention to poverty-stricken nations such as Sri Lanka and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} gained mostly mixed reviews from critics. Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that it [...] "invited {{all kinds of}} perplexed analysis". Jose Antonio Vargas of The Washington Post {{described}} Knowles' persona as a [...] "ranting, angry woman". Elizabeth Goodman of Rolling Stone speculated {{that the use of}} guards in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> is a reference to Alias. Tom Breihan of The Village Voice described the clip as a [...] "quick-and-dirty" [...] video and a [...] "fast montage of disconnected and disconnecting images". Roger Friedman of Fox News called it a [...] "bizarre video depicting a wildly angry and unappealing Beyoncé telling off someone (maybe Jay-Z?) for cheating as if she were an enraged guest on Maury Povich." [...] The staff members of Pitchfork Media included the music video at number twenty-one on the list of Top 25 Music Videos of 2006. Ryan Dombal further wrote that it was [...] "Almost as good as [...] ". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number six on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos.|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{there was}} a small {{demonstration}} in front of Portland mayor Ted Wheeler's house to protest the arrests. The group protesting outside Wheeler's home had obtained a permit for the demonstration, however, the organizer, Gregory McKelvey, also said that the mayor is [...] "perpetuating this idea we only get hurt or sprayed or physically beat because we don't have a permit". Wheeler later issued a statement in which he said that mistakes were made by the police during the event. He also said, [...] "Yesterday we saw images of a woman in her sixties injured during an arrest. That isn't good for democracy either." [...] The ACLU condemned the actions of Portland police and asked that the force [...] "end the violence against protesters. Stop the unnecessary use of crowd control weapons. Stop sending officers in <b>riot</b> <b>gear</b> to peaceful protests. Stop arresting organizers." [...] Following the arrests of the protesters and their treatment by police, Wheeler, Police Chief Mike Marshman, and the ACLU held discussions about tactics and policies relating to crowd control by the police.|$|E
500|$|In November 1994, the {{eviction}} of Claremont Road took place, bringing {{an end to}} the M11 {{link road}} resistance as a major physical protest. Bailiffs, accompanied by the police in full <b>riot</b> <b>gear,</b> carried out the eviction over several days, and the Central line, running adjacent to the road, was suspended. As soon as eviction was completed, the remaining properties were demolished. In the end, the cost to the taxpayer was over a million pounds in police costs alone. Quoting David Maclean, [...] "I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the cost of policing the protest in order to allow bailiffs to take possession of the premises in Claremont road was £1,014,060." [...] Cohen complained in parliament about police brutality, stating [...] "were not many of my constituents bullied—including vulnerable people, and others whose only crime was living on the line of route?" [...] The then Secretary of State for Transport, Brian Mawhinney, pointed out that there had already been three public enquiries at which protesters could have lodged their objections against the line of the route.|$|E
