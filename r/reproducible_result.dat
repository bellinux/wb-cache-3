A simple, rapid, precise, and reliable reverse phase HPLC method was developed for the separation and estimation of three drugs glimepiride, pioglitazone and metformin in bulk drug mix and pharmaceutical dosage forms.

40|$|The {{public concern}} {{surrounding}} antibiotic contamination {{in food and}} food products has made it imperative to develop analytical methods for their detection. Polyclonal antibodies and protein-hapten conjugates to cephalexin {{were used in the}} development of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) -based inhibition immunoassay to cephalexin. A conjugate consisting of cephalexin-bovine serum albumin (BSA) was immobilised on the dextran gel surface. Dissociation between the antibody and antigen was easily achieved with 10 mmol l- 1 NaOH and was very reproducible. Standards of free hapten were prepared and premixed with antibody and, after a suitable incubation time, passed over the surface of the chip with the protein-hapten conjugate immobilised. The hapten in solution inhibited the binding of antibody to the surface resulting in higher response units of antibody bound at lower concentrations of free drug. Model inhibition immunoassays to cephalexin were developed in PBS and spiked milk samples.

40|$|International audienceModern high {{performance}} computation (HPC) performs {{a huge amount}} of floating point operations on massively multi-threaded systems. Those systems interleave operations and include both dynamic scheduling and non-deterministic reductions that prevent numerical reproducibility, i. e. getting identical results from multiple runs, even on one given machine. Floating point addition is non-associative and the results depend on the computation order. Of course, numerical reproducibility is important to debug, check the correctness of programs and validate the results. Some solutions have been proposed like parallel tree scheme [1] or new Demmel and Nguyen's reproducible sums [2]. Reproducibility is not equivalent to accuracy: a <b>reproducible</b> <b>result</b> may be far away from the exact result. Another way to guarantee the numerical reproducibility is to calculate the correctly rounded value of the exact result, i. e. extending the IEEE- 754 rounding properties to larger computing sequences. When such computation is possible, it is certainly more costly. But is it unacceptable in practice? We are motivated by round-to-nearest parallel BLAS. We can imple-ment such RTN-BLAS thanks to recent algorithms that compute correctly rounded sums. This work is a first step for the level 1 of the BLAS...|$|E
