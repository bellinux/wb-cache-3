5|$|The Interim Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls and the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military {{use of nuclear weapons}} but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of nuclear weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{announced}} that the British government concurred {{with the use of}} nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference.|$|E
5|$|Later on 2 May, {{the remains}} of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring, Wulf) were {{discovered}} in a shell crater by {{a unit of the}} Red Army intelligence agency SMERSH tasked with finding Hitler's body. Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead, and restricted the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to the public. The remains of Hitler and Braun were repeatedly buried and exhumed by SMERSH during the unit's relocation from Berlin to a new facility in Magdeburg. The bodies, along with the charred remains of propaganda minister Goebbels, his wife Magda, and their six children, were buried in an unmarked grave beneath a paved section of the front courtyard. The location was kept secret.|$|E
50|$|As shown previously, non-interference {{policy is}} too strict {{for use in}} most {{real-world}} applications. Therefore, several approaches to allow controlled <b>releases</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> have been devised. Such approaches are called information declassification.|$|R

5|$|Since its {{original}} announcement, <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> became sporadic, leading to video game journalists labeling it as vaporware {{and eventually to}} rumors of its cancellation. After its public rebranding in 2013, the silence continued until its appearance at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show, at which point development and progress information was released on a regular basis. A demo for the game, Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae, was released in March 2015 with first print copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. Promotion for the title was effectively restarted at the 2015 Gamescom. Its release was delayed due to polishing work and the wish for a simultaneous worldwide release, something no other mainline Final Fantasy title had managed to accomplish. Cosmetic, gameplay and story-based downloadable content were developed following the game's release to fix issues raised by players and expand upon the base game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Robertson Panel a series of special military regulations were introduced to regulate reporting of UFO sightings. These were Joint-Army-Navy-Air Force Publication 147 (JANAP 146) of December 1953 and a 1954 revision of Air Force Regulation 200-2 (AFR 200-2) which introduced significant penalties on military, and some civilian personnel, for unauthorized <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> relating to UFO sightings.|$|E

25|$|Wang {{took over}} from disgraced Beijing mayor Meng Xuenong when SARS struck the Chinese capital in spring 2003, {{at which time}} he had only served as the Party Secretary in Hainan for five months. After {{arriving}} in Beijing, Wang took an open approach to the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about SARS to the public.

25|$|By 28 June 2017, {{two weeks}} after the fire, {{residents}} frustrated with the slow <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by the authorities, in particular the lack of official numbers for those known to have survived and those normally resident in the tower, had formed groups conducting their own investigations into the death toll, compiling lists of survivors and people missing. A spokesperson for one of these groups, Grenfell United, estimated that more than 120 people had died in the fire.|$|E

25|$|At the {{international}} level, the PDP {{of a national}} government entity would have the force of law to prevent, delay, or limit the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> – especially if the detection is made by persons working for that agency or under government contract. This sort of information restriction scenario is more likely under circumstances in which the detecting party was the only holder of the technological capabilities required to communicate. The subsequent disclosure of those decisions could provoke international distrust, encouraging other nations to act unilaterally in their communication with ETI.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} of Braithwaite received little publicity at the time.

However, by the 1980s the injustice of Braithwaite's treatment was widely known and in September 2000, the New Zealand Parliament passed a bill, the Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000, that pardoned Braithwaite and four other New Zealand soldiers that were executed during the war.|$|E

For a period of time, Croteam posted weekly updates, but these became bi-monthly, then monthly, and then stopped completely after August 2004, as Gathering of Developers shut down and folded into 2K Games, Croteam's publisher, wanted to handle the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from that point forward.
