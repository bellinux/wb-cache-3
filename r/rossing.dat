2500|$|Many {{mainstream}} Christians {{and certain}} other evangelicals had broader disagreements with the series as a whole, {{pointing out that}} [...] "most biblical scholars largely reject the eschatological assumptions {{of this kind of}} pop end-times literature."

2500|$|Regarded as {{an example}} of [...] "a {{pronounced}} use of height and of vertical movement in sets and settings, in virtual camera movement ... and in the actions of characters" [...] by Epics, Spectacles and Blockbusters: A Hollywood History author Sheldon Hall, Beauty and the Beast {{was one of the first}} feature-length animated films to use computer-generated imagery, which is prominently exhibited throughout the film's [...] "elaborate" [...] ballroom sequence. Light Science: Physics and the Visual Arts author Thomas D. <b>Rossing</b> believes that the filmmakers aimed to achieve [...] "a moving perspective that would follow the dancers around the room, giving visual expression to the soaring emotions of the scene." [...] CGI supervisor Jim Hillin was hired by Hahn to oversee the design of the scene's graphics. However, because the computer-animation medium was so unfamiliar to the filmmakers at the time, at one point they had considered having Belle and the Beast simply dance in complete darkness – save for a single spotlight – should the project be unsuccessful; they jokingly referred to this idea as the [...] "Ice Capades" [...] version.|$|E
