40|$|The results {{presented}} in this report are for nine Precipitate Hydrolysis Aqueous (PHA) Phase 4 glasses. Three of the glasses contained HM sludge at 22, 26, and 30 wt% respectively, 10 wt% PHA and 1. 25 wt% monosodium titanate (MST), all on an oxide basis. The remaining six glasses were selected from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (Purex sludge) but with an increased amount of MST. The high-end target for MST of 2. 5 wt% oxide was missed in Phases 1 and 2 due to {approximately} 30 wt% water content of the MST. A goal of this Phase 4 {{study was to determine}} whether this increase in titanium concentration from the MST had any impact on glass quality or processibility. Two of the glasses, pha 14 c and pha 15 c, were <b>rebatched</b> and melted due to apparent batching errors with pha 14 and pha 15. The models currently in the Defense Waste Processing Facility's (DWPF) Product Composition Control System (PCCS) were used to predict durability, homogeneity, liquidus, and viscosity for these nine glasses. All of the HM glasses and half of the Purex glasses were predicted to be phase separated, and consequently prediction of glass durability is precluded with the cument models for those glasses that failed the homogeneity constraint. If one may ignore the homogeneity constraint, the measured durabilities were within the 95 % prediction limits of the model. Further efforts will be required to resolve this issue on phase separation (inhomogeneity). The liquidus model predicted unacceptable liquidus temperatures for four of the nine glasses. The approximate, bounding liquidus temperatures measured for all had upper limits of 1, 000 C or less. Given the fact that liquidus temperatures were only approximated, the 30 wt% loading of Purex may be near or at the edge of acceptability for liquidus. The measured viscosities were close to the predictions of the model. For the Purex glasses, pha 12 c and pha 15 c, the measured viscosities of 28 and 23 poise, respectively, indicate that DWPF processing may be compromised {{at the low end of}} the viscosity range (20 poise). Although the HM sludge glass examined (10 wt% PHA) had a measured viscosity of {approximately} 90 poise, the HM glasses at 7 wt% PHA are predicted to be higher than the 100 poise limit for DWPF. Further work will be required to resolve these issues...|$|R
50|$|Soapmakers {{frequently}} use <b>rebatching</b> {{as a way}} {{of adding}} substances that could not withstand the high temperatures or caustic chemical environment of cold process or hot process soapmaking, such as certain essential oils (for example, those with a very low flash point). The choice of liquid affects the character of the finished soap; milk is frequently used to give the soap a smooth, creamy consistency. <b>Rebatching</b> can also be used {{as a way of}} salvaging soap that cracked, curdled or separated while being made.|$|E
50|$|In <b>rebatching,</b> commercially {{purchased}} or previously made soap (a soap base) is shredded or diced finely {{and mixed}} with a liquid, into which the soap shreds begin to dissolve. It is then heated at a fairly low temperature until the mass {{is more or less}} homogenous. When it becomes translucent and reaches a thick, gel-like consistency, it is spooned or piped into molds and allowed to harden.|$|E
5000|$|Some soapmakers prefer [...] "melt and pour" [...] {{because the}} process is simple and safe, {{allowing}} the soapmaker to concentrate more on the aesthetic aspects of soap making. Because it avoids the need to handle lye, a hazardous and very caustic chemical, it is a hobby even children can enjoy under adult supervision. Unlike cold-processed soap, which requires a period of [...] "curing" [...] to allow saponification to complete and excess water to evaporate, the [...] "melt and pour" [...] process is completed once the base has cooled and hardened. The meltable base is usually naturally rich in glycerine, a by-product of saponification which has humectant and emollient properties, whereas commercial soap bars have often had this component removed. As with the <b>rebatching</b> method, it {{can be considered a}} misnomer to refer to the melt and pour process as soap making. The process has much in common with candle making using meltable wax which, using a similar process, can be scented, dyed and shaped on a small or large scale of production. Adding value to a melt and pour soap base involves augmentation by colouring, scenting, shaping and wrapping the bars, but the general characteristics of the soap, such as transparency or opacity, lathering, pH, fat content and hardness, will be implicitly those of the manufactured base. Melt and pour does not give the soaper complete control over the ingredients; for example, over the choice of fat to use. Conventional cold process or hot process soaps do not melt readily once they have saponified; the exceptions are clear glycerin soaps, and white soap made from white coconut oil. Melt and pour bases are typically manufactured from these types of soap.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we first}} present a {{variance}} estimation technique {{based on the}} standardized time series methodology for steady-state simulations. The proposed variance estimator has competitive bias and variance compared to the existing estimators in the literature. We also present the technique of <b>rebatching</b> to further reduce the bias and variance of our variance estimator. Second, we present two fully sequential indifference-zone procedures to select the best system {{from a number of}} competing simulated systems when best is defined by the maximum or minimum expected performance. These two procedures have parabola shaped continuation regions rather than the triangular continuation regions employed in several papers. The rocedures we present accommodate unequal and unknown ariances across systems and the use of common random numbers. However, we assume that basic observations are independent and identically normally distributed. Finally, we present procedures for finding a set of feasible or near-feasible systems among a finite number of simulated systems in the presence of multiple stochastic constraints, especially when the number of systems or constraints is large.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two central {{problems in}} simulation methodology: {{the generation of}} conjidence intervals for the steady state means of the output sequences and the sequential of use these conjidence intervals to control the run length. The variance of the sample mean of a covariance stationary process is given approximately by p(O) lN, where p(f) is the spectral density at frequency f and N is the sample size. In earlier an paper we developed a method of confidence interval generation based on the estimation of p(0) through the least squares jit of a quadratic to the logarithm of the periodogram. This method was applied in a run length Control procedure to a sequence of batched means. As the run length increased the batch means were rebatched into larger batch sizes so as to limit storage requirements. In this <b>rebatching</b> {{the shape of the}} spectral density changes, gradually becoming flat as N increases. Quadratics were chosen as a compromise between small sample bias and large sample stability. In this paper we consider smoothing techniques which adapt to the changing spectral shape in an attempt to improve both the small and large sample behavior of the method. The techniques considered are polynomial smoothing with the degree selected sequentially using standard regression statistics, polynomial smoothing with the degree selected by cross validation, and smoothing splines with the amount of smoothing determined by cross validation. These techniques were empirically evaluated both for fixed sample sizes and when incorporated into the sequential run length control procedure. Forjixed sample sizes they did not improve the small sample behavior and only marginally improved the large sample behavior when compared with the quadratic method. Their performance in the sequential procedure was unsatisfactory. Hence, the straightforward quadratic technique recommended in the earlier paper is still recommended as an effective, practical technique for simulation conjidence interval generation and run length control. 1...|$|E
