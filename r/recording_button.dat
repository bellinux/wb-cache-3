50|$|Recording is {{used for}} {{adjusting}} an object over a specific amount of time by placing and manipulating keyframes. The <b>recording</b> <b>button</b> is a red dot button adjacent to the play/pause features. When the button is selected, it lights up red and the dot turns white. Any adjustments made when the button is selected are saved as keyframes. Keyframes act as placeholders that solidify an object's characteristics at a single frame (anything from position and rotation to cropping and size). Using multiple recordings, an object shall reorient itself between the two keyframes to match each set characteristics. Recording can act {{as an alternative to}} movement behaviors that allow more in-depth adjustments.|$|E

The Cuban blogger fought in February 2010 against an ambush-style arrest by the secret police, and the courageous woman {{was able to}} achieve in that {{critical}} moment the impossible, namely to operate unnoticed the <b>recording</b> <b>button</b> on her mobile phone. The ugly face of the ubiquitous apparatus of repression {{in the realm of}} the Castro brothers who still enjoy in certain circles a residual prestige ("After all, Cuba has a free health and education system for all"), could hardly be shown more impressively then as with this dramatic opening sequence."

5000|$|The metal-cased blue-and-silver Walkman TPS-L2, the world's first {{low-cost}} portable stereo, {{went on sale}} in Japan on July 1, 1979 and {{was sold}} for around ¥39,433.58 (or $150.00), or ¥57,109.02 (or $498.66) adjusted for inflation. In June 1980, it {{was introduced in the}} U.S. Also launched in the UK in 1980, it came with stereo playback and two mini headphone jacks, permitting two people to listen at the same time (though it came with only one pair of MDR-3L2 headphones). Where the Pressman had the <b>recording</b> <b>button,</b> the TPS-L2 had a [...] "hotline" [...] button which activated a small built-in microphone, partially overriding the sound from the cassette, and allowing one user to talk to the other over the music. Originally marketed as the [...] "Soundabout" [...] in the U.S., the [...] "Stowaway" [...] in the UK, and the [...] "Freestyle" [...] in Sweden, Sony soon had the new name [...] "Walkman" [...] embossed into the metal tape cover of the device. When the follow-up model, [...] "Walkman II" [...] came out, the [...] "hotline" [...] button was phased out though it was retained on the WM-R2, WM-3, WM-3EX and several models.|$|E
5000|$|Recording {{digitally}} from {{a source}} marked [...] "protected" [...] and [...] "copy" [...] is not allowed: the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> will not work and any ongoing recordings will stop, and an error message is shown on the display.|$|R
50|$|Write-protection is {{typically}} {{enforced by the}} hardware. In the case of computer devices, attempting to violate it will return an error to the operating system while some tape recorders physically lock the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> when a write-protected cassette is present.|$|R
5000|$|Some MIDI {{functions}} are accessed through a special [...] "MIDI Expand" [...] mode. This is entered by holding down the <b>RECORD</b> <b>button</b> and pressing PROGRAM SELECT 5. All of the LEDs for the PROGRAM SELECT buttons blink, and pressing {{one of these}} PROGRAM SELECT buttons now performs one of the following: ...|$|R
50|$|The Jupiter 4 had ten preset {{sounds and}} also {{featured}} eight memory locations for user-created patches. Saving to those locations requires two widely separated write <b>record</b> <b>buttons</b> to be held, {{to protect against}} accidental writing. A battery located deep between the chorus and power supply preserves {{the contents of the}} memory ICs.|$|R
5000|$|This can be {{illustrated}} through {{the discussion of}} a VCR problem. Let us imagine that a user would like to record a television show. They see {{the solution to this}} problem as simply pressing the <b>Record</b> <b>button.</b> However, in reality, to record a show on a VCR, several actions must be taken: ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{innovation is}} buffering: several body cameras {{can be set}} to [...] "pre-record". The cam continually records and stores the most recent 30 seconds. Unless the officer pushes the <b>record</b> <b>button,</b> the <b>recording</b> will be deleted on a 'first in, first out' basis. This {{makes it possible to}} record what happened before an actual confrontation if the officer does not press the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> before an escalation. The buffered video and audio may provide more context. New features are constantly being implemented into the cameras and the data-storage process. Because the amount of data stored can quickly become overwhelming, important innovations have to do with Video Content Analysis, facial recognition, and automatic triggers to start recording, for instance, if a weapon is pulled from a holster or when an officer starts running or falls down.|$|R
50|$|In Jibbigo, {{the user}} holds down a <b>record</b> <b>button</b> and says a phrase. The phrase then appears as text in both {{languages}} and is spoken aloud {{in the target}} language. The app also includes an add name function, a background dictionary, and other features. On iOS, it is compatible with VoiceOver for vision impaired users.|$|R
50|$|Foster {{also ran}} his own Chicago-based <b>record</b> label, Panic <b>Button</b> <b>Records,</b> which {{he started in}} 1997 with Pierson. The label was later {{purchased}} by Lookout! Records.|$|R
50|$|The DVX100 also {{features}} two XLR audio inputs, another rare feature for cameras in its price range. It includes a 4-pin FireWire port, {{as well as}} S-Video and RCA in and out ports. It features manual and servo zoom, with a second zoom control and <b>record</b> <b>button</b> {{on top of the}} handle for recording from low angles.|$|R
5000|$|In iOS 8, Messages gets new {{features}} for group conversations, including a Do Not Disturb mode that disables conversation notifications, {{as well as}} the ability to remove participants from the chat. A new Tap to Talk chat button lets users send quick voice comments to a recipient, and a <b>Record</b> <b>button</b> allows users to record short videos.|$|R
50|$|The Osmo's handle itself weighs 201g, and {{the handle}} is 61.8 x 48.2 x 161.5mm dimensionally. (2.43 x 1.9 x 6.4in) Controls are a <b>record</b> <b>button,</b> a joystick, and a trigger in the front. A power slider for turning {{on and off}} the camera is located in {{the right side of the}} handle. On the left side, a mount can be {{attached}} onto the camera.|$|R
50|$|Wiliam Burroughs {{recorded}} at Red House Studios in Lawrence, Kansas, on September 25, 1992. It was engineered by Brad Murphy. Cobain's guitar part {{was recorded in}} November 1992. Barrett Jones pushed the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> straight to DAT at Laundry Room Studios in Seattle, Washington. The mixdown was engineered by Ed Rose with James Grauerholz at Red House Studios; Grauerholtz also produced. Thor Lindsay served as executive producer.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras, such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).|$|R
50|$|The Strategic Commander is {{designed}} to complement a standard mouse/keyboard setup for Real Time Strategy games. It features a total of 6 programmable command buttons, 2 zoom buttons, 3 shift <b>buttons,</b> a macro <b>record</b> <b>button</b> and a 3-point configuration switch. The device also has three movement axes; X, Y and Z (rotation). Through extensive configuration of the shift and command buttons, {{it is possible to}} create a total of 24 different commands per configuration.|$|R
50|$|AppleScript was {{designed}} {{with the ability}} to build scripts intuitively by recording user actions. When the AppleScript Editor (also called Script Editor) is open and the <b>Record</b> <b>button</b> clicked, any user actions on the computer—in any application that supports Apple events and AppleScript recording—are converted to their equivalent AppleScript commands and placed in the script editor window. The resulting script can be saved and re-run to duplicate the original actions, or modified to be more generally useful.|$|R
50|$|In modern, Digital Audio Workstation-based {{recording}} environments, punching {{in and out}} can be done automatically by pre-selecting the in and out {{points on}} the timeline of the DAW. When the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> is pressed, the DAW software will play back the previously recorded track outside of these points. As soon as the playhead reaches the in-point, the recording begins and the previously recorded material is muted. At the out-point, recording stops and the software reverts to playback.|$|R
50|$|To watch programming, a set-top box, or BBC Selector and BBC Select viewing {{card was}} {{required}} which both decoded and unscrambled the programme. The box also received signals, sent out {{prior to the}} programme start, that would alert the box to the fact the programme was starting. The box would then trigger VCRs to begin recording by sending out a pulse of Infrared to set off the VCR's recorder, as if the viewer had pressed the <b>record</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
40|$|My {{device is}} broken. After {{over a decade}} of {{faithful}} service my Sony Walkman Professional is motionless. One of the quirks of this machine {{is that it has}} no speaker: it is a reception device, not a broadcasting one. Its dumb ear caught me out {{on more than one occasion}} when I first put it to work. Failing to remember to bring some headphones to an interview to listen to the level and play back, I managed to record two hours of absolutely nothing. Soon I learned I didn’t need to listen to the play back in order to check that it was working. Rather keeping a knowing eye on the lights of its VU meter was enough to check the recording level. A few months ago I loaded it with four AA batteries and pushed the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> but it failed to click into life, no flicker of red light on the meter, the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> pushed back against my thumb. I pushed it again and again- each time more frantically than the last- attempting a mechanical version of CPR in a desperate attempt to revive the beloved device from it...|$|R
5000|$|... "Separate Ways" [...] - [...] "the song {{begins in}} the middle of a doomy chord; Tim Mulligan lunged for the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> just as Young and the band dove into the song. Levon Helm rattles out a slow {{counterpoint}} as Ben Keith spins up a stark, bird-on-the-wire steel solo that has to be one of the lonesomest sounds ever recorded. [...] "I won't apologize/The light shone in from your eyes/It isn't gone/And it will soon come back again," [...] sings Young, sounding dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{aimed to}} solve {{repetitive}} stress injuries resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome, after several computer keyboard manufacturers were sued for poor design [...] The Apple Adjustable Keyboard came with contoured plastic wrist rests, {{and a separate}} keypad with function keys and arrow keys. This was the third and last time Apple offered a separate numeric keypad. Unlike its predecessors, it was not sold separately. The keyboard also included volume <b>buttons</b> and a <b>record</b> <b>button</b> {{on the right side}} of the keyboard.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} make a video on eva, a user simply holds their thumb on the in-app <b>record</b> <b>button</b> and {{releases}} it when they are finished. The videos that users take are then automatically uploaded to their personal feed, the wider eva public feed, and grouped by interest topic so they directly {{become a part of the}} right communities. Instead of being saved to users' phones, these videos are saved in the cloud, utilising the powerful cloud-based video editing software developed by FORscene. eva has been described by SourceWire as [...] "beautiful, simple and addictive".|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{camera back}} is also interchangeable {{with a couple}} other units. One is the Data Back FN, which has 3 dials with letters, numbers, and Roman numerals. The left-hand dial is labeled [...] "Year", and has a blank, 0-9, 82-93, I-X, and a-g; the middle dial is labeled [...] "Month", and has a blank, 0-31, and A-G; the right-hand dial is labeled [...] "Day", and has a blank, and 0-31. The back imprints the dial settings onto the film for classification or dating purposes, either {{at the time of}} shutter release, or when the manual <b>record</b> <b>button</b> is pressed.|$|R
5000|$|When the app is launched, {{the user}} sees {{the view of}} the front-facing camera. The app allows the user to create a new clip by tapping on a red <b>record</b> <b>button,</b> or use photos or videos in the device's photo library. Then, after a clip is recorded, it can be added to a project {{timeline}} which is {{at the bottom of the}} screen. The user can share their project on social media platforms. The user can also add filters and effects to the project. [...] "Live Titles" [...] (which come in several styles) can also be created by dictating to the device.|$|R
50|$|Designed by an educator, Spark Video {{includes}} several features intended to scaffold storytelling and media literacy concepts. These include a built-in searchable library of Creative Commons licensed vector images and photographs, automatic tracking and generation of attributions, {{a library of}} music organized by emotional sentiment, and story guides with narrative story structure prompts (such as a simplified “Hero’s Journey” storyboard) to help users learn about narrative structure. It attempts to encourage rapid revision and iteration though its touch-based recording model: to re-record a specific line {{in the middle of}} their story, users press and hold the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> to overwrite their old recording, and the application will automatically adjust audio and animation across the entire video to smoothly accommodate the new recording.|$|R
5000|$|According to President Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary Woods, on September 29, 1973, she was {{reviewing}} {{a tape of}} the June 20, 1972, recordings {{when she}} said she had made [...] "a terrible mistake" [...] during transcription. While playing the tape on a Uher 5000, she answered a phone call. Reaching for the Uher 5000 stop button, she said that she mistakenly hit the button next to it, the <b>record</b> <b>button.</b> For the duration of the phone call, about 5 minutes, she kept her foot on the device's pedal, causing a five-minute portion of the tape to be re-recorded. When she listened to the tape, the gap had grown to 18½ minutes and she later insisted that she was not responsible for the remaining 13 minutes of buzz.|$|R
5000|$|The latest model {{features}} a revised sensor, longer zoom range and improved control layout without fundamentally changing the existing model's formula. It offers {{a more flexible}} 24-90 mm equivalent lens with a bright f/2.0-3.3 maximum aperture range and a comparatively large 10MP sensor in a small body. The body itself is barely changed compared to the LX3 - gaining an improved hand grip, clickable control dial, direct movie <b>record</b> <b>button</b> and a 1:1 position on the aspect ratio slider. Most significantly it gains a connector to add the DMW-LVF1 electronic viewfinder originally launched with the GF1. Other than this, the LX5 gains the AVCHD Lite format for its 720p video, and its image stabilization is branded with the company's latest 'Power O.I.S' designation.http://dpreview.com/news/1007/10072110panasonicdmclx5.asp ...|$|R
50|$|The Tiger {{intercepts}} {{them and}} {{proves to be}} more than a match for four Great Mages. It only leaves when Zabulon joins the battle. Anton realizes that the Tiger is a creature of the Twilight whose purpose is to hunt prophets before they utter their first complete prophecy. If this prophecy is heard by a human, then it becomes inevitable. If an Other hears it, then he or she becomes the Tiger's next target. While the Night Watch is attempting to hold off the Tiger, Kesha utters the prophecy in an empty room (a prophet does not hear his or her own key prophecy), causing the Tiger to leave. However, Anton has previously asked Kesha to press the <b>record</b> <b>button</b> on a toy phone. Anton then copies the phone's recording onto a flash drive.|$|R
