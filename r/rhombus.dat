5|$|Inflation and {{deflation}} yield {{a method}} for constructing kite and dart (P2) tilings, or <b>rhombus</b> (P3) tilings, known as up-down generation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} rules for the <b>rhombus</b> tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E

50|$|The rhombic triacontahedron is a convex {{polyhedron}} with 30 golden <b>rhombi</b> (<b>rhombi</b> whose diagonals {{are in the}} golden ratio) as its faces.|$|R
50|$|The rhombic enneacontahedron is a {{polyhedron}} {{composed of}} 90 rhombic faces, with three, five, or six <b>rhombi</b> meeting at each vertex. It has 60 broad <b>rhombi</b> and 30 slim ones.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{inclusive}} definition, all parallelograms (including <b>rhombuses,</b> rectangles and squares) are trapezoids. Rectangles have mirror symmetry on mid-edges; <b>rhombuses</b> have mirror symmetry on vertices, while squares have mirror symmetry on both mid-edges and vertices.|$|R
25|$|A {{tangential}} quadrilateral is a <b>rhombus</b> if {{and only if}} its opposite angles are equal.|$|E
25|$|Johannes Kepler in Harmonices Mundi (1618) named this {{polyhedron}} a rhombicuboctahedron, being {{short for}} truncated cuboctahedral <b>rhombus,</b> with cuboctahedral <b>rhombus</b> being his {{name for a}} rhombic dodecahedron. This truncation creates new vertices mid-edge to the rhombic dodecahedron, creating rectangular faces inside the original rhombic faces, and new square and triangle faces at the original vertices. The semiregular form here requires the geometry be adjusted so the rectangles become squares.|$|E

5000|$|... {{claims that}} the <b>rhombi</b> of the rhombohedron from which this shape is formed have 5:6 as the ratio between their short and long diagonals, from which the acute angles of the <b>rhombi</b> would be {{approximately}} 80°.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>rhombi</b> of the Bilinski dodecahedron, {{the ratio}} of lengths of the two diagonals is the golden ratio; that is, the faces of this shape are golden <b>rhombi.</b> In contrast, for the {{standard}} rhombic dodecahedron the corresponding ratio is the square root of 2.|$|R
50|$|A rhombic enneacontahedron (plural: rhombic enneacontahedra) is a {{polyhedron}} {{composed of}} 90 rhombic faces; with three, five, or six <b>rhombi</b> meeting at each vertex. It has 60 broad <b>rhombi</b> and 30 slim. The rhombic enneacontahedron is a zonohedron with a superficial {{resemblance to the}} rhombic triacontahedron.|$|R
25|$|Geometrically, in two {{dimensions}} the Klein four-group is the symmetry group of a <b>rhombus</b> {{and of a}} rectangle which are not squares, the four elements being the identity, the vertical reflection, the horizontal reflection, and a 180 degree rotation.|$|E
25|$|The lozenge is a <b>rhombus</b> {{generally}} {{resembling the}} diamonds of playing cards. A more acute lozenge {{is called a}} fusil. A lozenge voided (i.e. with a lozenge-shaped hole) is a mascle; a lozenge pierced (i.e. with a round hole) is a rustre.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{consider that}} the symbols used for representing the feminity are the <b>rhombus</b> for fertility and the triangle as a symbol for fecundity. The cross, symbolizing nature's power of fertility and renewal, was sometimes used to represent masculinity, {{as well as the}} phases of the moon.|$|E
50|$|It is {{analogous}} to the regular hexagonal being dissectable into 3 <b>rhombi</b> and tiling the plane as a rhombille. The rhombille tiling is actually an orthogonal projection of the trigonal trapezohedral honeycomb. A different orthogonal projection produces the quadrille where the <b>rhombi</b> are distorted into squares.|$|R
50|$|The tiling {{has also}} an extremal {{property}} : among the tilings whose <b>rhombuses</b> alternate (that is, whenever two <b>rhombuses</b> are adjacent or {{separated by a}} row of square, they appear in different orientations), the proportion of squares {{is found to be}} minimal in the Ammann-Beenker tilings.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{tangential}} trapezoids are <b>rhombi</b> and squares.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} fins must be {{optimized}} to maximize heat transfer density and {{to minimize the}} pressure drop in the coolant fluid across the heat sink where the space and the materials used for the finned surfaces are constraints. Many shapes {{exist in the literature}} ranging from elliptical and cylindrical cylinders, conical shapes to more sharpened surfaces such as <b>rhombus,</b> square sections.|$|E
25|$|After the Brazilian Declaration of Independence, {{and with}} the {{coronation}} of Pedro I as Emperor of Brazil, the Royal Standard was modified to become {{the flag of the}} Empire of Brazil. The new flag featured the imperial coat of arms within a yellow <b>rhombus,</b> on a green field. The green and yellow colors represented the dynastic houses of Pedro I and his consort Maria Leopoldina of Austria.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{positions}} of the 27 stars on the globe make the Brazilian flag {{one of the most}} complicated national flags to construct. The official design is defined by law no. 5,700, issued on 1 September 1971. The flag's length is twenty modules and the width, fourteen, translating into an aspect ratio of 10:7. The distance of the vertices of the yellow <b>rhombus</b> to the outer frame is a module and seven-tenths (1.7m). The blue circle {{in the middle of the}} yellow <b>rhombus</b> has a radius of three and a half modules (3.5m). The center of the arcs of the white band is two modules (2m) to the left of the meeting point of the extended vertical diameter of the circle with the base of the outer frame. The radius of the lower arc of the white band is eight modules (8m) and the radius of the upper arc of the white band is eight and a half modules (8.5m). The width of the white band is a half of a module (0.5m).|$|E
50|$|The rhombille tiling {{can be seen}} as a {{subdivision}} of a hexagonal tiling with each hexagon divided into three <b>rhombi</b> meeting at the center point of the hexagon. This subdivision represents a regular compound tiling. It can also be seen as {{a subdivision}} of four hexagonal tilings with each hexagon divided into 12 <b>rhombi.</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} supposed {{that there is}} a single, hierarchically organized pathway dedicated to form processing, in which complex forms are elaborated from simpler ones, beginning with the orientation-selective cells of V 1. In this psychophysical study, we undertook to test another hypothesis, namely that the brain’s visual form system consists of multiple parallel systems and that complex forms are other than the sum of their parts. Inspired by imaging experiments which show that forms of increasing perceptual complexity (lines, angles and <b>rhombuses)</b> constituted from the same elements (lines) activate the same visual areas (V 1, V 2 and V 3) with the same intensity and latency (Shigihara and Zeki, 2013; 2014), we used backward masking to test the supposition that these forms are processed in parallel. We presented subjects with lines, angles and <b>rhombuses</b> as different target-mask pairs. Evidence in favour of our supposition would be if masking is the most effective when target and mask are processed by the same system and least effective when they are processed in different systems. Our results showed that <b>rhombuses</b> were strongly masked by <b>rhombuses</b> but only weakly masked by lines or angles, but angles and lines were well masked by each other. The relative resistance of <b>rhombuses</b> to masking by low-level forms like lines and angles suggests that complex forms like <b>rhombuses</b> may be processed in a separate parallel system, whereas lines and angles are processed in the same one...|$|R
25|$|A {{constellation}} in {{this area}} was introduced by Isaac Habrecht II in his celestial globe in 1621, who named it <b>Rhombus.</b> It was replaced with a somewhat different constellation by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the eighteenth century; during his stay at the Cape of Good Hope, he named the constellation le Réticule Rhomboide to commemorate the reticle in his telescope eyepiece. The name was later Latinized to Reticulum in his star catalogue Coelum Australe Stelliferum. In 1810, the stars of Reticulum were used by William Croswell to produce the constellation Marmor Sculptile, which represented the bust of Christopher Columbus, but this did not catch on among astronomers.|$|E

25|$|Ketupat, or packed rice {{is a type}} of rice {{dumpling}} of Indonesia. Also can {{be found}} in Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. It is made from rice that has been wrapped in a <b>Rhombus</b> or kite shaped woven palm leaf pouch and boiled. As the rice cooks, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the ketupat its characteristic form and texture of a rice dumpling. Ketupat is usually eaten with rendang or served as an accompaniment to satay or gado-gado. Ketupat is also traditionally served by Malays at open houses on festive occasions such as Idul Fitri (Hari Raya Aidilfitri). During Idul Fitri in Indonesia, ketupat is often served with opor ayam (chicken in coconut milk), accompanied with spicy soy powder.|$|E

500|$|Penrose {{subsequently}} {{reduced the}} number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the <b>rhombus</b> tiling (tiling P3 below). The <b>rhombus</b> tiling was independently discovered by Robert Ammann in 1976. Penrose and John H. Conway investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by Martin Gardner in his January 1977 [...] "Mathematical Games column" [...] in Scientific American.|$|E
500|$|Penrose's second tiling uses quadrilaterals {{called the}} [...] "kite" [...] and [...] "dart", {{which may be}} {{combined}} to make a <b>rhombus.</b> However, the matching rules prohibit such a combination.
