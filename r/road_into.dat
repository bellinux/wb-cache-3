5|$|Business M-78 (Bus. M-78) was a {{business}} loop through the city of Lansing. It ran from an interchange between US27/M-78 and I-96 on the southwest side of Lansing along US27 (Lansing <b>Road)</b> <b>into</b> downtown. From there, it ran east on Main Street and north on Larch Street. At Saginaw Street, Bus. M-78 turned east to reconnect to M-78.|$|E
5|$|Highway130 has {{retained}} {{most of its}} current route since the mid-1970s, but was longer prior to then, when it extended north of Arthur Street to Oliver Road and then along that <b>road</b> <b>into</b> downtown Thunder Bay, ending at what is now Water Street. The route was originally designated in late 1955.|$|E

5|$|PA 563 {{was first}} created in 1928 to connect Bergey to Harrow, {{following}} its current alignment to PA313 before continuing straight along Ridge Road {{and continuing to}} PA412. By 1940, construction of the <b>road</b> <b>into</b> a state highway was completed. In the early 1970s, PA563 was moved to its current alignment north of PA313 {{as a result of}} the creation of Lake Nockamixon, which severed the original alignment.|$|E
5|$|Travel to {{the area}} before it was a {{national}} park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, {{and the absence of}} real roads in southern Utah.

5|$|In Orson, Route370 passes local {{farms and}} some houses. Shortly after it intersects with the {{northern}} terminus of Route670 (Belmont Turnpike North), which continues north as Oxbow Road. Route370 continues eastward out of Orson, passing Orson Pond and several residences in a mainly rural area before entering the hamlet of Poyntelle. In Poyntelle, the highway passes {{to the north of}} Lake Lorain and Lake Lorain Golf Course. At the intersection with Lake Lorain Road, Route370 turns to the northeast once again, paralleling Cribbs <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> downtown Poyntelle. The two roads cross a former alignment of the Ontario and Western Railroad before merging just north of Poyntelle.|$|E
5|$|M-24 {{continues}} {{north from}} Lapeer running west of Barnes Lake {{and east of}} the community of Columbiaville just south of the M-90 junction. South of the Tuscola County line, the trunkline passes the Greenbriar Golf Club and crosses the Pere Marquette Railroad before turning west along Saginaw <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> the community of Mayville and turning north along Mertz Road. South of Caro, M-24 meets M-46. Once past Frank Street in Caro, M-24 becomes Ellington Street. M-24 then comes to meet M-81 in Caro, where the highway becomes Cleaver Road. M-24 then jogs west along Biebel Road and then north along Unionville Road past a junction with M-138 to end in Unionville at M-25.|$|E
5|$|M-50 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-96 at exit52 south of Lowell in southeastern Kent County. The highway proceeds south along with Alden Nash Avenue and turns east on 92nd Street through farms and {{fields in the}} rural southeastern corner of the county. As the trunkline runs to the east, it crosses into Ionia County. M-50 follows Thompson Road, Nash Highway and Tupper Lake <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> Lake Odessa. In Lake Odessa, the road bends around {{the north side of}} Jordan Lake, curving to the south into the extreme northeastern Barry County. The highway turns back to the east as it heads towards a junction with M-66 and M-43 at the Barry–Eaton county line.|$|E

5|$|North of Welland, Highway58 {{initially}} travelled concurrent with Highway3A along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway to Highway20, where Highway3A ended. Highway58 turned {{east and}} travelled concurrent with Highway20 across the Welland Canal at Allanburg, before turning north onto the current route. However, it continued north along Allanburg <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> Thorold, where it crossed the Welland Canal on a swing bridge and travelled north into St. Catharines along Ormond Street, Merritt Street and Hartzel Road (Niagara Regional Road52) to Highway8 (Queenston Street, now Niagara Regional Road81).|$|E
5|$|North of {{the current}} prison, the highway curves to the {{northwest}} following Bunkerhill Road. Through this area, M-106 runs through farm fields and forests. The highway turns onto Plum Orchard Road near Batteese Lake and runs east into the community of Munith. M-106 merges onto Territorial Road east of the town before crossing the county line into Ingham County. South of Stockbridge, M-106 merges with M-52 and the two run concurrently into that community. M-106 turns east {{in the downtown area}} and continues along Morton <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> Livingston County. The highway ends at a junction with M-36 in Gregory.|$|E
5|$|PA 563 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with PA63 in Upper Salford Township, Montgomery County and heads in an easterly direction on two-lane, undivided Ridge Road. The route passes through wooded areas with some homes, turning southeast at the Township Line Road intersection and forming {{the border between}} Salford Township to the northeast and Upper Salford Township to the southwest. PA563 makes a northeast turn at the Barndt Road–Moyer Road junction, continuing northeast on Ridge <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> Salford Township.|$|E
25|$|This {{current system}} of road classification, {{numbering}} and network management has its origins in the late 1960s. A 1969 study <b>into</b> <b>road</b> construction and management recommended a reclassification of the <b>road</b> system <b>into</b> national <b>roads</b> (primary and secondary), regional roads (primary and secondary) and county roads. This system, without the division of regional <b>roads</b> <b>into</b> primary and secondary categories, was later adopted.|$|R

5|$|Relief efforts {{following}} the hurricane were mostly {{affected by the}} associated flooding. Trucks transporting food and medicine from the Jalisco state government were forced to turn back because of flooded roads. The army then decided on an aerial transport. This effort was hampered because, after three federal helicopters and Air Force planes touched down at the local airport, the <b>road</b> <b>into</b> the city was still flooded, meaning the aid could not be distributed.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the <b>road</b> <b>into</b> a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of NY205 transformed the <b>road</b> <b>into</b> the main north–south connection between West Oneonta and Oaksville. At the same time, the parallel Southern New York Railroad had become unprofitable as the highways running alongside the track {{had become more}} appealing to shippers and travelers than the railroad itself. In 1940, the railroad abandoned the section of its line between West Oneonta and Jordanville, Herkimer County. The track ran alongside state routes {{for most of its}} length, and the presence of NY205 and NY167 was noted as a contributing factor to the line's demise in the railroad's abandonment petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway16 (Bus. US16) was a {{business}} route in the Grand Rapids area in the 1950s and 1960s. When US16 was rerouted to replace Byp. US16 around the southern and western sides {{of the city in}} 1953, the former route of the mainline through downtown was redesignated as the business loop. That loop followed Remembrance Avenue southeasterly to Leonard Avenue in Walker Township. From there, the loop turned easterly on Leonard over the Grand River to Monroe Avenue before turning south parallel to the river along Monroe into downtown. In downtown Grand Rapids, Bus. US16 turned eastward on Fulton Avenue into East Grand Rapids. There the loop followed Cascade <b>Road</b> <b>into</b> Cascade Township where it reconnected to US16 at the intersection with 28th Street. Bus. US16 lasted until 1962 when US16 was decommissioned in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{the parkway}} {{encounters}} MD32 (Savage Road) near Fort Meade. MD32 offers northbound travelers direct access into the fort {{and to the}} National Security Agency, while the next interchange, another employee-only access <b>road</b> <b>into</b> Fort Meade, features only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Fort Meade itself is a military installation opened in 1917 that trained 3.5 million troops during World War II and is still a major fort. To {{the west of the}} parkway off MD32 is the Savage Mill, which was an operating cotton mill from 1822 to 1947 and is currently an antique mall, and the Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, an 1869 cast and wrought iron bridge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Capital Subdivision) line between Baltimore and Washington D.C. After this interchange, the road continues to a cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Jessup Road), where NPS maintenance of the parkway comes to an end {{at the south end of}} the interchange.|$|E
