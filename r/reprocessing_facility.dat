A subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation contributed in Pakistan's efforts to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities by providing 5,000 custom made ring magnets, which are a key component of the bearings that facilitate the high-speed rotation of centrifuges. China has also provided technical and material support in the completion of the Chashma Nuclear Power Complex and plutonium <b>reprocessing</b> <b>facility,</b> which was built in the mid-1990s. China has become increasing concerned about al-Qaeda linked terrorism originating in Pakistan and sought help to set up military bases on Pakistani soil to deal with the problem.|$|E

40|$|Sodium Fast Reactors {{are one of}} {{the three}} {{candidates}} of GEN-IV fast reactors. Fast reactors {{play an important role in}} saving uranium resources and reducing nuclear wastes. Conventional fast reactors rely on transuranic fuels from <b>reprocessing</b> <b>facilities,</b> which are not available in the U. S. Thus, deployment of fast reactors requires decoupling from <b>reprocessing</b> <b>facilities.</b> This motivates the design and deployment of Uranium Startup sodium Fast Reactors (USFR) on a once-through fuel cycle in order to facilitate the transition to fast reactors by reducing their plant costs and increase capacity factor. Three different fuel types including uranium carbide (UC), metal (UZr) and uranium oxide (U 0 2) are investigated and analyzed using the ERANOS code for potential use in USFR designs. A key enabling factor is use of high-albedo MgO or Zr reflectors in place of fertile blankets to reduce uranium enrichment and improve non-proliferation resistance. The different compositions in different fuel types result in different neutronic performance. The softer spectrum and lower allowable fuel volume fractions of oxide fuel have shorter fuel cycle length due to reactivity constraints, whereas fast neutron fluence plays an important role i...|$|R
