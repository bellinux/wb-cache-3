40|$|It is an {{important}} question regarding to the contemporary NDT systems how reliable {{is the result of}} the test. This question is rising connected to all diagnosis system in human medicine mechanical engineering or civil constructions. The reliability of an NDE system means the consistency of capability the system to detect, to classify and to evaluate the existing deviation within test pieces. The main elements of the reliability are: the intrinsic capability of the system, the effect of application parameters and the human factors. At present time we cannot determine all of the effect of the elements, so we have to measure the reliability with different methods like POD (probability of determination) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) methods. According to the modular concept it is possible to determine the reliability all of the modules of NDE systems differently. The NDT section of Scientific Society of Mechanical Engineering recognised the importance of reliability degree of NDE. So we organised a <b>round-robin</b> <b>test</b> of radiographic film evaluation as a module of radiographic test, and try to measure the effect of human factor. The first <b>round-robin</b> <b>test</b> finished and the evaluation method is presented in details as an example of the measuring of reliability.

40|$|Inspection of Nickel Alloy Components (PINC). A {{series of}} <b>round-robin</b> <b>tests</b> was {{conducted}} by teams from Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States. The teams examined a series of test blocks designed to simulate cracked piping dissimilar metal welds and bottom-mounted instrumentation tube penetrations.

The conclusions and recommendations presented in this report are based on the probability of detection, false call probability, and sizing statistics measured in the round robin studies. The highest-performing technique for detection and length sizing, for both dissimilar metal welds and bottom-mounted instrumentation nozzles, was the use of eddy current testing on the cracked surface.

The freshwater limits in Flanders are based on phosphate determined by the molybdate reactive P (MRP) method and the certified laboratories have to adhere to ISO protocols (ISO 15681 - 2 : 2003 or ISO 15923 - 1 : 2013). Surprisingly, filtration is not specified in these guidelines and sample preparation procedures range from unfiltered to 0. 45 µm filtration in these certified laboratories. It is well established that MRP includes both free orthophosphate and phosphate associated with colloidal material such as Fe and Al oxyhydroxides while organic P is only weakly included. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare analytical results among certified laboratories and to identify filtration effects on the analytical results.

In addition, the same waters were tested in our laboratory assessing effects of filtration (paper filter, 0. 45 µm, 0. 1 µm) and dialysis (12 - 14 kDa) on MRP. The MRP concentrations in the water samples decreased gradually by filtration over progressively smaller membrane pore sizes and after dialysis.
