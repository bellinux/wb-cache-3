50|$|The <b>Roman</b> <b>mole,</b> Talpa romana, {{was once}} {{considered}} a subspecies of the European mole {{as they are}} of similar size. The only obvious {{difference between the two}} is that the <b>Roman</b> <b>mole</b> has skin-covered eyes and it also has a caecoid pelvis, whereas T. europaea has a europoid pelvis. Although similar in body, the dentition of T. romana is obviously larger in size than that of the European mole. Both the length of the tooth row and the individual elements are larger. Moreover, the mesotyle of the upper molars is generally divided. The dentition of Talpa europaea is small and the length of M1-M3 is less than 19% of the length of the condyle base. This mole also has relatively small molars for its size.|$|E
