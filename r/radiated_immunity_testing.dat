40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} measurements related to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are radiated emission and <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity.</b> These measurements must be performed in a facility which provides reliability and reproducibility. The Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic Mode (GTEM) cell is one of the facilities for EMC measurement due to its well defined electric and magnetic field distribution in addition to being cost effective. The research undertaken in this project is to determine the field distribution in the GTEM by using Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD). The results from the modeling are then compared with actual measurements and any differences will be noted and explained. The field strength inside a GTEM cell is a fl. lI 1 ction of the input power as well as location along the longitudinal axis or septum height. <b>Radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> measurements require field uniformity (+ 6 dB according to IEC 61000 - 4 - 3 standard) which depends on the design aspects of the GTEM such as size, material and absorbing condition. The capability of the GTEM cell to provide the unifo 1111 field can be tested theoretically and experimentally. FDTD is a numerical method {{that can be used to}} predict the electric field distribution in a GTEM cell. The electric field distribution for frequencies at 100 MHz, 200 MHz, and 400 MHz were calculated using the EZ-FDTD software. In this report, theoretical study on the field strength and distribution in a GTEM cell is described. It is followed by making measurements of the field based on the <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> setup. It is found that at septum height 63 cm for frequency 100 MHz, the measured and simulated results are very close. This is the location recommended by the manufacturer for the placement of equipment under test (EUT) in radiated emission and <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>test.</b> The difference varies from 0. 01 dB to 4. 91 dB. The difference between modeling and actual measurement can be attributed to the input field distribution, inhomogeneous characteristics of the septum and existence of standing wave. In the future, it is recommended that other numerical methods such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Transmission Lines Method (TLM) be used and more accurate model and absorbing boundary condition parameters be implemented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{plane wave}} {{integral}} representation is presented for well-stirred fields in a reverberation chamber. The representation automatically satisfies Maxwell’s equations in a source-free {{region and the}} statistical properties of the fields are introduced through the angular spectrum, which is taken to be a random variable. Starting with fairly simple and physically appropriate assumptions for the angular spectrum, a number of properties of the electric and magnetic fields and the power received by an antenna or a test object are derived. Many of these properties and test object responses are in agreement with other theories or with measured results. An important result for <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>testing</b> is that the ensemble (stirring) average of received power {{is equal to the}} average over plane wave incidence and polarization.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} theory of {{resonances}} of time harmonic fields in resonating cavities, based on the Helmholtz equation, we have presented the principle of operation of the Reverberation Chamber (RC) : a n electrically large cavity where the resonant frequencies are changed with a tunerin order to obtain a uniform maximum electric field, within a time cycle. This type of test facility {{can be used as}} an alternative to the conventional Semi-Anechoic Room (SAR) for testing the immunity of electronic equipment to high intensity radiofrequency fields. But, at the opposite of the deterministic environment present in a SAR, the RC generates electromagnetic waves with a direction of incidence, a polarization and a time of arrival on the Equipment Under Test (EUT) that are varying randomly in time. The presented research had two objectives: the firstis to conceive, design and evaluate the efficiency of innovative and less cumbersome tuning systems and the second is to compare the severity level of RC and SAR for immunity testing by using both facilities available at Royal Military Academy (RMA). The first innovative tuning method (RAIL) we have conceived, designed and assessed in the RC at RMA is a dynamic source-mode tuning based on a translation movement of two broadband antennas on two orthogonal rails. The efficiency analysis shows that it complies with the field uniformity requirement ofthe IEC 61000 - 4 - 21. The second innovative tuning method (STATIC) we have conceived and investigated in the same RC is based on a fixed network of sixteen static antennas where a limited subset of eight antennas is randomly activated by means of fast electronic switches. Tuning is obtained without any movement in the RC. The technological breakthrough is that important testing time reduction can be achievedwhen using the STATIC tuner instead of using conventional mechanical tuners. Using the RAIL tuner, we develop a new method for measuring the radiation efficiency of an antenna in a RC without the need of a reference antenna. In order to perform a severity comparison of the immunity testing to Electric fields between a SAR and a RC, a Canonical Equipment Under Test (CEUT) has been designed, developed and manufactured at the RMA. It is an original realization with no equivalent in the EMC community. An unexpected development of this initiative lies in the fact that it has been accepted as reference material for interlaboratory testing in the field of radiated immunitytesting to RF, according to IEC 61000 - 4 - 3. Moreover, EMC testing laboratories in Germany and Japan have shown interest and have participated inthis campaign. The comparison of radiatedimmunity testing performed both in a SAR and a RC has produced several interesting results. Applied to test RS 103 of the MIL-STD- 461 F, it meansthat with one aspect angle in a SAR, it is recommended to use from 20 to 30 tuner steps, in a RC, in order to achieve equivalence of testing results. For the IEC 61000 - 4 - 3, testing with 4 aspect angles in a SAR willneed from 40 to 60 tuner steps for equivalence. Finally, we have shown experimentally that, in a RC, spatial averages and time averages are equal; this is a characteristic of ergodic processes. This experimental demonstration of ergodicity establishes a scientific breakthrough since, as far as we know, there is no literature about this subject yet. From now on, we can say that the stochastic generation of an electric field in a RC is a stationary process and that various statistical parameters in its volume can be estimatedby measuring the time average in a fixed spatial point.

40|$|Electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic {{compatibility}} (EMI/EMC) {{testing is}} a compulsory part of today’s electronics compliance and reliability. The importance of EMI/EMC arose {{with the advent}} of wireless devices to provide interference free envi-ronment. Spurious emissions emitted by electronic devices cannot be predicted without EMC measurements. If these emissions emanating from a specific device are above a certain limit, they can be harmful for devices operating in its close vicinity. Interference is an unwanted signal that causes disturbance in the normal operation of an electronic device. As a result there occurs degradation in the functionality of the victim device that is unacceptable. To avoid this undesired behavior of the devices, international regulatory authorities have introduced different standards and regulations. All devices consisting of electrical circuits are tested to comply these international standards and rules. The main objective of EMI/EMC testing {{is to make sure that}} a device i. 	Does not create interference to other devices. ii. 	Is not susceptible to emissions produced by other devices. iii. 	Does not cause interference with itself. The prime objectives of this thesis work include the development of testing programs in Agilent VEE intended to conduct radiated emission (RE) and <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> (RI) <b>tests</b> automatically and to study the suitability of an anechoic chamber for radiated im-munity test. The thesis is divided into two major parts. First part contains the introduc-tion and theoretical background and covers first three chapters. It describes the need and importance of RE and RI testing. Second part presents the development of testing programs, test equipment, procedures and results in detail. Testing programs developed during current thesis include most of the necessary features requisite by IEC and CISPR standards and available in commercial testing software for example in Total Integrated Laboratory Environment (TILE), EMC 32 and Schaffner. The study of anechoic cham-ber, testing programs and results illustrate that the expected goals of the thesis have been successfully achieved. For future studies and improvements practical analysis and tests are recommended to be performed on the chamber. It could not be done during current thesis work due to unavailability of power amplifiers for <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

This approach aims at extracting the immunity properties of a device from its probability of failure during a test. We show that under certain conditions, this approach {{can be applied to}} plane wave testing environments and reverberation chambers.

40|$|International audienceIn modern {{electronic}} products, {{the printed}} circuit board (PCB) traces may well form the dominant coupling path in <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> problems. Therefore, {{an understanding of the}} designable parameters that influence the worst-case induced voltages can be of use to the PCB designer, together with rapid simulations. Therefore, a modified single (unmeshed) Taylor cell is combined with transmission line theory to predict the terminal voltages induced by a grazing, vertically polarized plane wave, incident on a multi-segment trace with arbitrary terminal impedances. The resulting model is closed-form and therefore suitable for rapid simulations. Furthermore, the model is geometrically approximated to provide understanding on how designable PCB parameters determine the worst-case induced voltage. Finally, the model is compared to measurement results...|$|R
40|$|In this study, <b>radiated</b> <b>immunity</b> and {{emission}} of a metallic box with apertures {{have been evaluated}} through a fast approach. The influence of printed circuit boards inside the enclosure has been studied and also the effect of placing conductive polymer sheets in the housing in order to characterize the behaviour of these materials used nowadays for shielding cabinets. Measurements {{have been carried out}} in anechoic chamber in order to evaluate the approximated technique showing its limitations and advantages. Since good agreement has been found between simulations and measurements, this approach can be used for design or optimization purposes with the main advantage of reduced time calculations.
