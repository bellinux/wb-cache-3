The alkali-pretreated SCB after washing and drying was cultivated with P. sanguineus during SSF.

The enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated biomass was carried out with cellulase and 10 and 20 FPU/g of substrate in a shaking incubator at 50 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h. The sulfuric acid concentration used in the microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis was 1. 0, 2. 5, and 5 %, either {{with or without the}} addition of activated carbon. Microwave irradiation (330 Watt) was applied for 5 – 12. 5 min. The yield of <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> was better with the microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis, and the yield tended to increase with an increase in the irradiation time. Based on the dry weight of the initial biomass (bamboo), pretreatment with 5 % inoculum loading resulted in a higher <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> yield (17. 06 %) than with 10 % inoculum loading (14. 54 %). At a 1 % acid concentration, the formation of brown compounds decreased, followed by a reduction in the <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> yield. The addition of activated carbon at a 1 % acid concentration seemed to be of no benefit with respect to the yield in the microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. The pretreatment with the 5 % inoculum loading for 12. 5 min at 1 % acid concentration resulted in the highest <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> yield.

40|$|Changes in the {{concentration}} of some carbohydrates and in amylolytic activity have been followed during germination of Zea. Mays L. var. Hickory King and var. Early Pearl. Assay techniques have been developed which permitted assay of individual grains. Thus during the investigation both groups and individual grains were used as samples. The use of groups permitted control of assay technique. Length of radicle, coleoptile and lateral roots were recorded in order to permit quantitative estimation of correlation between growth and {{the concentration}} of the various carbohydrates. Initially, during the study {{of changes in the}} carbohydrate concentration in Hickory King grains, total <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar,</b> sucrose and dextrin concentrations were estimated. However, the results obtained for changes in dextrin concentration, although reproduceable, thereby indicating reliable assay technique, presented a confusing picture and, in view of the apparent importance of sucrose and <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> concentration, assay of dextrin concentration was discontinued in a subsequent study of Early Pearl. Instead changes in total <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar,</b> sucrose and glucose concentrations were followed. The results revealed that there is very considerable variability in physiological activity between grains subjected to the same germination conditions. However, all, irrespective of variety, follow the same basic metabolic pattern during germination. The trends observed were: (i) <b>Reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> accumulates slowly during the first 72 - 96 hours germination, but thereafter accumulation is very rapid, although concentration may decrease {{towards the end of the}} gestation period. (ii) Glucose follows a similar pattern to <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar,</b> accumulating slowly during the early stages of germination, followed by a period of rapid increase in concentration, which may decrease towards the end of the germination period. (iii) Sucrose concentration in dormant grains is fairly high, but it decreases markedly during the first 96 hours germination. This is followed by a phase of sucrose accumulation. (iv) Dextrin concentration shows two peaks. Initial level is low, but it accumulates rapidly during the first 72 hours. The level decreases between 72 and 120 hours but increases when the germination period is increased to 192 hours, after which there is a marked decrease. It was impossible, from the data relating to the study of individual grains, to discern a trend in dextrin concentration. With the exception of dextrin, about which there is little information, the results are in general agreement with the literature. Investigation of correlation between the various carbohydrates and between these and growth revealed that: (i) <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> concentration and growth are positively correlated; (ii) glucose concentration and growth are positively correlated; (iii) sucrose and <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> concentrctions are negatively correlated during the initial stages of germination; (iv) sucrose and glucose concentrations are negatively correlated during early germination; (v) glucose and <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> are positively correlated; (vi) in general, correlation between growth and concentration of the carbohydrates studied, decreases during the later periods of germination. These observations suggested that growth was, at least during the early stages of germination, dependent on the level of <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar,</b> and more particularly on the level of glucose, and that sucrose is the principal source of <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> during this period. The relationship between amylase activity (total alpha- and beta-amylase activity) and <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> concentration tends to be curvilinear, which suggests that amylolytic activity produces relatively little <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> during early gennination, even though amylase activity and growth may be positively correlated. The results suggest, contrary to the observations of previous workers, that alpha-amylolytic activity may be present in dormant grains and that maize is not characterised by low levels of beta-amylase activity during germination. From the observations it is concluded that the initinl accumulati on of <b>reducing</b> <b>sugar</b> is the result of sucrose hydrolysis, and therefore sucrose is an importnnt metabolite durjng early germination.
