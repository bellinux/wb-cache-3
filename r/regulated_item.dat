40|$|Congress often passes {{expansive}} legislation, frequently {{environmental and}} public health regulatory statutes, where both the definition of those items being regulated and the mandate have significant breadth. How should these provisions be construed? While {{it is difficult to}} establish a model which determines whether to broadly or narrowly construe an expansive statutory provision, factors that impact this choice include the existence of express limitations on the mandate, understandings of congressional intent, the need to avoid regulation that might do more harm than good, the nature of the <b>regulated</b> <b>item,</b> and intervening circumstances such as new understandings in law, policy, or science. This Article sets out to establish how, why, and when courts should broadly interpret expansive environmental {{and public health}} legislation. Absent express limitations requiring cost-benefit analysis or technological feasibility, courts should broadly construe expansive environmental legislation. Why? Courts are equipped to interpret the textual mandate, the costs of a failure to regulate, even in an interim period, are potentially great, and Congress, in recognition of changed circumstances, was aware of the breadth of the textual language; whereas courts should allow administrative agencies to narrowly or broadly construe statutory provisions with such limitations subject to Chevron deference...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} was to obtain information on the strategies of retailers of consumer goods andservices in terms of changes to final prices. From detailed data on many price changes in all the monitoredstores we have evaluated, for example, how often the prices of specific items change or rise or fall, and byhow much on average, how these indicators change during the year, whether downwards price rigidityexists and so on. The average price change frequency for all the selected items came to 0. 26, which means that approximatelyone in every four prices was changed compared to the month before. A typical characteristic of theprices of <b>regulated</b> <b>items</b> was that these prices mainly rose and this usually by steps of higher percentagesand mostly {{at the start of}} the year. Food prices had a higher frequency of price changes, mainly in the caseof unprocessed foods, which is a consequence of the volatile development of the prices of agricultural commodities. The prices of tradables excluding food and fuels continuously fell for the whole of the monitoredperiod and only had a low price change frequency. The prices of non-regulated non-tradables continuouslyand smoothly rose and, with the exception of hypothetical rent and package holidays, this subgroupdemonstrated the lowest frequency of price changes. The prices of fuels changed most frequently while onaverage these price changes were the lowest in size, as they react relatively quickly to changes in the pricesof raw materials and the koruna exchange rate...|$|R
40|$|The Hazardous Material Reduction Initiative (HMRI) explores {{using the}} review of {{purchase}} requisitions to reduce both the use of hazardous materials and the generation of regulated and nonregulated wastes. Based on an 11 -month program implemented at the Hanford Site, hazardous material use and waste generation was effectively reduced by using a centralized procurement control program known as HMRI. As expected, several changes to the original proposal were needed during the development/testing phase of the program to accommodate changing and actual conditions found at the Hanford Site. The current method requires a central receiving point within the Procurement Organization to review all purchase requisitions for potentially Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) hazardous products. Those requisitions (approximately 4 % to 6 % of the total) are then forwarded to Pollution Prevention personnel for evaluation under HMRI. The {{first step is to}} determine if the requested item can be filled by existing or surplus material. The requisitions that cannot filled by existing or surplus material are then sorted into two groups based on applicability to the HMRI project. For example, laboratory requests for analytical reagents or standards are excluded and the purchase requisitions are returned to Procurement for normal processing because, although regulated, there is little opportunity for source reduction due to the strict protocols followed. Each item is then checked to determine if it is regulated or not. <b>Regulated</b> <b>items</b> are prioritized based on hazardous contents, quantity requested, and end use. Copies of these requisitions are made and the originals are returned to Procurement within 1 -hr. Since changes to the requisition can be made at later stages during procurement, the HMRI fulfills one of its original premises in that it does not slow the procurement process...|$|R

UK government and industry representatives indicated agreement with the goals of U.

The data indicated that interviewees found U. S. requirements generated significant delay, increased costs, dampened initiative to increase capability or efficiency, established critical and unnecessary restrictions on information sharing, and constructed barriers to effective supply chains. The UK representatives believed that the U. S. has generated a complex system which attempts to <b>regulate</b> all <b>items,</b> and thereby fails to provide a focus on effective security for truly sensitive items. With regard to the impact of U. S. requirements on the future JSF logistical support arrangements, it was too early in the process for UK interviewees to have solid views.

5000|$|The Ordinance was {{presented}} as a serious attempt to reform the court, continuing the household reform of 1525, and formulated as a detailed set of rules regulating {{the life of the}} court.

The lists of household <b>items</b> <b>regulated</b> by the Ordinance (like candle wax) provide the historians an insight into what was deemed expensive or rare. These items, now considered ordinary, formed the [...] "spatial decorum" [...] of the court. The Ordinance was filled with precautions against theft of household items, even furniture, indicating that such theft was commonplace. It attempted to expel [...] "rascals and vagabonds" [...] and replace them with [...] "servants honest in gesture and behaviour". To maintain the moral standard, the Ordinance prescribed creation of a perfectly transparent environment, devoid of private places, where every person would be always watched and evaluated. Pincombe and Shrank noted that the duality of imaginary order and real-life disorder evident in the Ordinance is also present in contemporary literature like the Welles Anthology and the plays of John Heywood.|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to individual learning mechanisms, the thesis further explores {{the effects of}} cultural transmission, social and semantic structures on language evolution. First, it simulates some major forms of cultural transmission, and discusses the role of conventionalization during horizontal transmission in language evolution. Second, it traces the emergence and maintenance of language in some stable social structures, and explores the role of popular agents in language evolution, the relationship between mutual understanding and social hierarchy, {{and the effect of}} exoteric communications on the convergence of communal languages. Finally, it studies language maintenance given different semantic spaces, and illustrates that the semantic structure may cause bias in the constituent word order, which can help to predict the word order bias in human languages. These explorations examine the role of self-organization in language evolution, provide some reconsideration on the bottleneck effect during cultural transmission, and shed light on the study of the social structure effects on language evolution. The thesis presents a multi-agent computational model to explore a key question in language emergence, i. e., whether syntactic abilities result from innate, species-specific competences, or they evolve from domain-general abilities through gradual adaptations. The model simulates a process of coevolutionary emergence of two linguistic universals (compositionality, in the form of lexical items; and regularity, in the form of constitute word orders) in human language, i. e., the acquisition and conventionalization of these features coevolve during the transition from a holistic signaling system to a compositional language. It also traces a "bottom-up" process of syntactic development, i. e., agents, by reiterating local orders between two lexical items, can gradually form global order(s) to <b>regulate</b> multiple lexical <b>items</b> in sentences. These results suggest that compositionality, regularity, and correlated linguistic abilities could have emerged as a result of some domain-general abilities, such as pattern extraction and sequential learning.

40|$|This {{initial report}} is being {{submitted}} pursuant to Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) {section} 761. 75 (c) to request authorization {{to allow the}} disposal of transuranic (TRU) wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which are duly regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Approval of this initial report will not affect the disposal of TRU or TRU mixed wastes that do not contain PCBs. This initial report also demonstrates how the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) meets or exceeds the technical standards for a Chemical Waste Landfill. Approval of this request will allow the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to dispose of approximately 88, 000 cubic feet (ft 3) (2, 500 cubic meters [m 3]) of TRU wastes containing PCBs subject to regulation under the TSCA. This approval will include only those PCB/TRU wastes, which the TSCA regulations allow for disposal of the PCB component in municipal solid waste facilities or chemical waste landfills (e. g., PCB remediation waste, PC B articles, and bulk PCB product waste). Disposal of TRU waste by the DOE is congressionally mandated in Public Law 102 - 579 (as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104 - 201, {{referred to as the}} WIPP Land Withdrawal Act [LWA]). Portions of the TRU waste inventory contain hazardous waste constituents regulated under 40 CFR Parts 260 through 279, and/or PCBs and PCB <b>Items</b> <b>regulated</b> under 40 CFR Part 761. Therefore, the DOE TRU waste program must address the disposal requirements for these hazardous waste constituents and PCBs. To facilitate the disposal of TRU wastes containing hazardous waste constituents, the owner/operators received a Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (HWFP) from the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) on October 27, 1999. The permit allows the disposal of TRU wastes subject to hazardous waste disposal requirements (TRU mixed waste). Informational copies of this permit and other referenced documents are available from the WIPP website. To facilitate the disposal of TRU wastes containing PCBs, the owner/operators are hereby submitting this initial report containing information required pursuant to the Chemical Waste Landfill Approval requirements in 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 (c). Although WIPP is defined as a miscellaneous unit and not a landfill by the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act, WIPP meets or exceeds all applicable technical standards for chemical waste landfills by virtue of its design and programs as indicated in the Engineering Report (Attachment B). The layout of this initial report is consistent with requirements (i. e., Sections 2. 0 through 12. 0 following the sequence of 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [c][i] -[ix] with sections added to discuss the Contingency and Training Plans; and Attachment B of this initial report addresses the requirements of 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][1] through [9] in this order). This initial report includes a description of three proposed changes that will be subject to ''conditional approval. '' The first will allow the disposal of remote-handled (RH) PCB/TRU waste at WIPP.
