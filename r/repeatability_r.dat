To effectively breed for feed intake over the whole growing period, it is necessary to determine average feed intake at different ages, since there were only moderate phenotypic and genetic correlations between average daily feed intake recorded at 140 g, 750 g and 2000 g wet mass. Heritability for average daily feed intake was low (average h 2 = 0. 10), indicating that modest genetic changes can be obtained in response to selection.

Identification of the polysaccharides is achieved by 1 H NMR line shape fitting with pure compound spectra. The monomeric composition was determined using the Saeman hydrolysis procedure, followed by direct monosaccharide quantification by 1 H NMR. In the quantification, both the monosaccharide degradation during hydrolysis, as well as a correction for the non-instantaneous polysaccharide dissolution were taken into account.

40|$|A new {{piezoelectric}} quartz crystal (PQC) sensor using molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as sensing material {{has been developed}} for fast and onsite determination of pirimicarb in contaminated vegetables. Three MIPs particles have been prepared by conventional bulk polymerization (MIP-B) and precipitation polymerization in either acetonitrile (MIP-P 1) or chloroform (MIP-P 2). MIP-P 2, with uniform spherical shape and mean diameter at about 50 nm, has shown the best performance as the sensing material for PQC sensor. The sensor fabricated with MIP-P 2 can achieve a steady-state response within 5 min, a very short response time as compared to MIPs-coated PQC sensor reported in the literature. The sensor developed exhibits good selectivity (low response to those pesticides with similar structures to pirimicarb, such as atrazine, carbaryl, carbofuran and aldicarb) and high sensitivity to pirimicarb with a linear working range from 5. 0 × 10 - 6 to 4. 7 × 10 - 3 mol L- 1 (following a regression equation (r = 0. 9988) of -ΔF = 0. 552 + 1. 79 × 106 C), a <b>repeatability</b> (<b>R.</b> S.

For example, the German reference procedure [distillation/pycnometry (Anon. 1982)] reported r =  0.19  % vol, while the EU reference method (European Commission 2000) reported r =  0.30  % vol (distillation/pycnometry) and r =  0.12  % vol (distillation/electronic densimetry).

Because the method’s precision was already very high using the old instrument, and further improvement was not detectable using the new instrument, it is suggested that the major part of the method uncertainty derives from factors apart from the distillation step such as the uncertainty of the density measurement as well as the volumetric errors in pipetting and filling up the graduated flaks with the distillate, which appear to have the highest influence. Indirect evidence for this finding is also provided by the fact that infrared spectroscopic methods for quantifying alcoholic strength (which are conducted in the beverage itself without any need for sample preparation) usually had a much lower repeatability [for example, r =  0.02  % vol for both spirits (Lachenmeier 2007) and wine (Patz et al. 2004), and 0.05  % vol for liqueurs (Arzberger and Lachenmeier 2008)].|$|R

These sires were chosen at the AI centre according to their breeding values estimated for the mean and the variability of their daughters' litter size. Non-carrier Lacaune dairy ewes were inseminated to produce 121 F 1 daughters and 27 F 1 sons. Twelve sons (four from each sire) were used in turn to inseminate non-carrier Lacaune dairy ewes providing 260 BC progeny ewes. F 1 and BC progeny were brought from private farms and gathered after weaning on an experimental farm where ovulation rates were recorded in the first and second breeding seasons. With an average of 6. 5 records each, the mean OR of hyper-prolific ewes was very high (5. 34), and 38. 4 % of records showed a rate of 6 or more. F 1 data showed high <b>repeatability</b> of OR (<b>r</b> = 0. 54) within ewe, with significant variability among ewes. High OR (≥ 4) were observed in each family. A segregation analysis provided a significant likelihood ratio and classified the three founders as heterozygous. BC ewes also displayed high <b>repeatability</b> of OR (<b>r</b> = 0. 47) and the mean OR varied considerably between families (from 1. 24 to 1. 78). Seven of the 12 BC families presented high-ovulating ewes (at least one record ≥ 4) and segregation analysis yielded a highly significant likelihood ratio as compared to an empirical test distribution. The high variability of the mean ovulation rate shown by a small group of daughters of BC ewes inseminated by putative carrier F 1 rams, and the very high ovulation rate observed for some of these ewe lambs, confirmed the segregation of a major gene with two co-dominant alleles borne by an autosome. The difference between homozygous non-carriers and heterozygous ewes was about one ovulation on the observed scale and 2. 2 standard deviations on the underlying scale...|$|R
40|$|A fourth {{trial with}} {{reference}} materials for water microbiology was organized. Forty-one Dutch laboratories and 37 laboratories of the EC participated. Each laboratory received four capsules of batches of reference materials with the test strains WR 63 Enterococcus faecium and WR 51 Staphylococcus warneri. Each capsule was reconstituted {{according to a}} standardized protocol and analysed by three different culturing methods: faecal streptococci by a reference method and by national standard methods (mf-techniques) and most probable number of faecal streptococci by national standard methods. The method of analysing the results was different from that in the three former trials. A method was used to exclude extreme observations in two steps. Next the <b>repeatability</b> (<b>r)</b> and reproducibility (R) were calculated. The calculated values of r and R were very low and those found for test strain WR 63 almost impossible (theoretically) to improve. Differences found between methods could mostly {{be attributed to the}} medium used. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{an unspoken}} {{assumption}} that imprecision of measurement of phenotypes {{will not have}} large systematic effects on the location of significant associations in a genome wide association study (GWAS). In this report, the effects of two independent measurements of the same trait, subcutaneous fat thickness, were examined in GWAS of 940 individuals. Results The trait values obtained by two independent groups working to the same trait definition were correlated with r = 0. 72. The allele effects obtained from the two analyses were only moderately correlated, with r = 0. 53, {{and there was one}} significant (P Conclusions It is recommended that trait values in GWAS experiments be examined for repeatability before the experiment is performed. For traits that do not have high <b>repeatability</b> (<b>r</b> < 0. 95), two or more independent measurements of the same trait should be obtained for all samples, and individuals genotyped that have highly correlated trait measurements. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, a novel {{electrochemical}} {{technique is}} presented for determination of Bentazon using a nanocomposite based sensor and Continuous Coulometric Fast Fourier transformation cyclic voltammetry (CCFFTCV). In this method, the sensor response is in coulomb and {{is calculated based on}} integrating charge changes {{under the current}} voltammogram in selected potential range. The new sensor was constructed using MWCNT mixed with ionic liquid and reduced graphene oxide on a SiC NPs modified carbon ionic liquid electrode. The experimental conditions were then optimized. The modified electrode has good electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of Bentazon. The presence of the nanoparticles enhanced the electrochemical signal which increased the sensitivity of the sensor. Moreover, the proposed sensor exhibits good accuracy, the response time less than 7 s, with good <b>repeatability</b> (<b>R.</b> S. D value of 2. 3 %) and long term stability. The linear concentrations range of Bentazon was from 1 – 150 nM with a detection limit of 2. 5 ± 0. 01 × 10 - 10 M...|$|E
40|$|Objective To assess {{intraobserver}} and interobserver {{variability in}} ovarian volume and gray-scale and color flow index measurements using transvaginal, three-dimensional, power Doppler ultrasonography. Methods Eleven women (22 ovaries) were examined on day 8 of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation therapy, which {{was part of}} their in vitro fertilization treatment protocol. The patients were examined twice by the first observer and once by the second observer. The acquired volume datasets were analyzed using the VOCAL(TM) imaging program, enabling the assessment of ovarian volume, vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), vascularization flow index (VFI) and mean grayness (MG). For these parameters the intraclass (intra-CC) and interclass (inter-CC) correlation coefficients, within-observer and between-observers <b>repeatability</b> coefficient (<b>r)</b> and limits of agreement were calculated. Results Both intraobserver and interobserver repeatability of ovarian volume measurements were considered very good with an intra-CC value of 1. 00 and inter-CC value of 0. 99, respectively. Also VI, FI, VFI and MG measurements were repeatable by a single observer, the intra-CC ranging from 0. 82 to 0. 91. The interobserver reproducibility was also good for VI, VFI and MG measurements (inter-CC values 0. 73, 0. 70 and 0. 81, respectively), but for FI measurements the reproducibility was poor (inter-CC = 0. 29, r = 7. 87). Conclusions In general, the intraobserver reproducibility was better than interobserver reproducibility for all parameters. The volume assessments were reproducible both by one observer and by two separate observers. The intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were acceptable for VI, VFI and MG, whereas for FI the interobserver reproducibility was poor. Our results suggest that measurement of gray-scale and color Doppler flow indices is reproducible thus allowing them to be used in clinical practice and research...|$|R
40|$|Laser-ultrasound {{resonance}} spectroscopy, a non-contact ultrasonic technique, {{was used}} to determine reliably and rapidly the crystallographic texture, the average plastic strain ratio, and the thickness of sheet metal on the production line. As with laser-ultrasonics, a short laser pulse is used to generate a wide-band pulse of ultrasound and a laser interferometer is used for its detection. In this paper, a large number of echoes are collected and analyzed together using Fourier techniques to measure the natural resonance frequencies in the thickness of the sheet. One longitudinal and two shear resonance frequencies were measured together with their harmonics. From these frequencies, two crystallographic orientation distribution coefficients, W 400 and W 420, are obtained, as well as a highly accurate measurement of the sheet thickness that is corrected for changes in ultrasonic velocity caused by texture variations. Using these coefficients, the average and in-plane twofold and fourfold variations of the plastic strain ratio, respectively r 3 ̆ 04, 3 ̆ 942 r, and 3 ̆ 944 r, can be evaluated. These parameters are indications of the formability of metals sheets, which is of industrial interest. Measurements on 1 mm thick, low carbon steel sheets have shown the following measurement accuracies: r 3 ̆ 04 to within 10. 08, 3 ̆ 942 r, and 3 ̆ 944 r to within 10. 1, and thickness to better than 11 3 ̆bcm. On-line tests at LTV Steel Company showed that the sensitivity of the apparatus is sufficient to detect systematic variations in texture along the length of similar production coils and that the on-line <b>repeatability</b> for <b>r</b> 3 ̆ 04 was of order 10. 02.

40|$|A simple, rapid, accurate, precise, {{sensitive}} and economical UV Spectrophotometric method {{has been developed}} for estimation of agomelatine from bulk and pharmaceutical formulation. The λmax of agomelatine in water {{was found to be}} 233 nm. The parameters linearity, precision, accuracy, robustness were studied according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The drug follows linearity in the concentration range 2 - 8 µg/ml with correlation coefficient value 0. 9981. The accuracy of the method was checked by recovery experiment performed at three different levels i. e., 50 %, 100 % and 150 %. The % recovery was found to be in the range 98. 94 %– 100. 05 %. The low values of % R. S. D. are indicative of the accuracy and reproducibility of the method. The precision of the method was studied as an intra-day, inter-day variations and <b>repeatability.</b> The % <b>R.</b> S. D. value less than 2 indicate that the method is precise.
