50|$|Observation is {{the active}} {{acquisition}} of information from a primary source. In living beings, observation employs the senses. In science, observation can also involve the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> via the use of instruments. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be qualitative, that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or quantitative if a numerical value {{is attached to the}} observed phenomenon by counting or measuring.|$|E
50|$|The signal {{processing}} {{required by the}} acoustic camera is very intensive and needs powerful hardware and plenty of memory storage. Because of this, {{signal processing}} is frequently done after the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> which can hinder or prevent {{the use of the}} camera in analyzing sounds that only occur occasionally or at varying locations. Cameras that do perform signal processing in real time tend to be large and expensive. Hardware and signal processing improvements can help to overcome these difficulties. Signal processing optimizations often focus on reduction of computational complexity, storage requirements, and memory bandwidth (rate of data consumption).|$|E
50|$|Hunter {{served in}} the {{military}} for sixteen months during World War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps. During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests. His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on the national origins of the troops tested. The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention.|$|E

50|$|The {{method that}} the British were {{comfortable}} with was excavating tunnels and deep trenches, which was damaging the mud brick {{architecture of the}} foundation. Instead, {{it was suggested that}} the excavation team focus on tablets and other artefacts rather than pick at the crumbling buildings. Despite the destructive nature of the archaeology used, the <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> was immensely more thorough than in previous Mesopotamian excavations. Walter Andre, one of Koldewey's many assistants, was an architect and a draftsman, the first at Babylon. His contribution was documentation and reconstruction of Babylon.

50|$|Sets of {{descending}} (southbound) paths at U.S. imaging latitudes occurred first over Pacific Ocean areas west of California {{and first}} occurred over eastern {{parts of the}} U.S. nearly a day later.

The last on-board <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on film occurred during the descending leg of the 30th revolution. That film was ejected and recovered over the Pacific Ocean during the descending portion of the 33rd orbit, after which only down-linked data were available. The final ground swath was imaged in the 72nd orbit, during which imaging ceased because the chemical battery providing system power became too discharged for continued payload operation.|$|E
