The U.S.-centered creationâ€“evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a comment on}} Murad Hussain, Defending the Faithful: Speaking the Language of Group Harm in Free Exercise Challenges to Counterterrorism, 117 Yale Law Journal 920 (2008), which argues that burdens imposed upon Muslim {{religious}} practices by post- 9 / 11 counterterrorism policies would be relieved by a new doctrine combining hybrid rights and <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> rights to protect certain kinds of public <b>religious</b> <b>group</b> expression.

The comment concludes that Mr. Hussain has identified a serious gap in American constitutional doctrine that his proposal nonetheless fails to fill...|$|R
