40|$|High turbine inlet {{temperature}} becomes necessary for increasing thermal efficiency of modern gas turbines. To prevent failure of turbine components, advance cooling technologies have been applied to different portions of turbine blades. The detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions along a rotor blade has been studied under combined effects of upstream trailing edge unsteady wake with coolant ejection by the pressure sensitive paint (PSP). The experiment is conducted in a low speed wind tunnel with a five blade linear cascade and exit Reynolds number is 370, 000. The density ratios for both blade and trailing edge coolant ejection range from 1. 5 to 2. 0. Blade blowing ratios are 0. 5 and 1. 0 on suction surface and 1. 0 and 2. 0 on pressure surface. Trailing edge jet blowing ratio and Strouhal number are 1. 0 and 0. 12, respectively. Results show the unsteady wake reduces overall effectiveness. However, the unsteady wake with trailing edge coolant ejection enhances overall effectiveness. Results also show that the overall effectiveness increases by using heavier coolant for ejection and blade film cooling. Leading edge film cooling has been investigated using PSP. There are two test models: seven and three-row of film holes for simulating vane and blade, respectively. Four film holes? configurations are used for both models: <b>radial</b> angle cylindrical <b>holes,</b> compound angle cylindrical <b>holes,</b> <b>radial</b> angle shaped <b>holes,</b> and compound angle shaped holes.

We use a bench-scale prototype machine to synthesize graphene on copper substrates at translation speeds varying from 25 [*]mm/min to 500 [*]mm/min, and investigate the influence of process parameters on the uniformity and coverage of graphene on a continuously moving foil. At lower speeds, high-quality monolayer graphene is formed; at higher speeds, rapid nucleation of small graphene domains is observed, yet coalescence is prevented by the limited residence time in the CTCVD system.

The analysis of a plain disc initially shows the two normal modes at very close frequencies but when asymmetry is introduced, by drilling holes in the rim of the disc, there is a noticeable frequency decoupling of the 2 normal modes. This is also accompanied by a distinct positioning of the antinodes with the antinodes of one mode positioning at the sets of drilled holes, the other mode antinodes being between the holes.

Two field inoculation experiments {{were conducted to}} study intraspecific variation in vertical spread of the P-, S- and F-IS-group isolates of Heterobasidion annosum in stems of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Abies alba. Host-plants were inoculated with four isolates of each IS group after 10 mm long wounds made with a sterile knife (experiment 1) or 3 mm diameter <b>radial</b> <b>holes</b> made with a drill (experiment 2). On pine, the P-group isolates were more virulent than S and F isolates in terms of infection frequency, mortality rate and vertical spread in sapwood.

In this work we evaluate ionisation potentials I and electron affinities A for atoms and ions with one to eighteen electrons using the ACFD functional under the RPA, and with the "PGG (Petersilka-Gossmann-Gross) " and "RXH (<b>radial</b> exchange <b>hole)</b> " model exchange kernels. All calculations are carried out using a real-space, all electron method with an exact exchange groundstate to minimise errors. As expected, the RPA is less accurate even than some regular density functional theory approaches, while {{the introduction of a}} dynamical exchange kernel improves results. In contrast to the case of atomic groundstate energies, the PGG kernel outperforms the RXH kernel for I and A. Mean absolute errors for I/A are found to be 3. 27 / 2. 38 kcal/mol, 4. 38 / 5. 43 kcal/mol, and 9. 24 / 8. 94 kcal/mol for the PGG, RXH, and RPA, respectively. We thus show that the inclusion of even the simple "RXH" kernel improves both quantities when compared to the RPA. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Producing {{accurate}} sub-millimetre size {{holes in}} parts {{for use in}} aerospace, electronic, computer and medical industries necessitate the use of non-conventional machining methods. The electro jet drilling (EJD) {{is one of the}} non-traditional hole drilling techniques which have the necessary potential to meet the stringent requirements of small hole drilling. This paper presents an attempt at modelling the process through response surface methodology and genetic algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on SUPERNI 263 material. Applied voltage, electrolyte concentration and feed rate are selected as independent process variables. The responses have been modelled using a rotatable experimental design. Genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the process parameters subjected to a set of constraints on input variables, <b>radial</b> overcut and <b>hole</b> taper with the objective of maximizing the removal rate. Results of confirmation experiments indicate close agreement with simulated results...|$|R
40|$|We report new {{precision}} {{measurements of}} the properties of our Galaxy’s supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995 - 2007) and radial velocity (2000 - 2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 -meter telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short period star S 0 - 2 provides values for the distance (R 0) of 8. 0 ± 0. 6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4. 1 ± 0. 6 × 10 6 M⊙, and the black <b>hole’s</b> <b>radial</b> velocity, {{which is consistent with}} zero with 30 km/s uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e. g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit and obtain R 0 = 8. 4 ± 0. 4 kpc and Mbh = 4. 5 ± 0. 4 × 10 6 M⊙. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3 - 4 × 10 5 M ⊙ within 0. 01 pc, ∼ 100 x higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 x the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black <b>hole’s</b> <b>radial</b> motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R 0 and the Galaxy’s local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R 0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (θ 0 = 229 ± 18 km s − 1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars {{in the vicinity of the}} black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-σ relation.
