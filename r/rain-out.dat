25|$|The Dodgers {{opened the}} month of June with an 11–4 win over the Rockies on the road. Clayton Kershaw allowed only two earned runs in seven innings, while also {{recording}} three hits and an RBI. Andre Ethier, Jimmy Rollins, Howie Kendrick, and Joc Pederson all homered in the win. The Dodgers and Rockies played a doubleheader on June 2, {{a result of the}} <b>rain-out</b> the previous time they met in Denver. In the first game, Michael McKenry homered, doubled, and drove in three runs and the Rockies won 6–3. In the second game, Alex Guerrero hit a grand slam home run in the ninth inning to give the Dodgers the 9–8 win. This was the first go-ahead grand slam by the Dodgers with two out in the ninth inning or later since Nomar Garciaparra hit one in 2006. Joc Pederson homered in both games of the doubleheader, giving him four straight games with a home run. His second homer on this day was estimated at 480 feet, the longest in the Majors at that point. He homered again in the next game, the first rookie in history to homer in five straight games and tying the Dodgers franchise record (shared with Adrian Gonzalez, Matt Kemp, Shawn Green, and Roy Campanella). The Dodgers lost the game 7–6 when the bullpen coughed up the lead in the ninth as four relievers were only able to record one out.|$|E

50|$|The league {{split into}} an East and West {{division}} of five teams each. The All-Star Game assembled teams comprising {{the best players}} of each division; on July 24, the West beat the East, 4-1. The regular season expanded to 56 games, with each team playing 28 home games and 28 road games. No team actually played 56 games, as <b>rain-outs</b> occurring {{late in the season}} were not made up. The 2014 FCBL playoffs were conducted as in 2013, except that the rules gave the winner of each division the bye in round one, and guaranteed that, of the next four teams with the best overall records, the higher-seeded team would host the one-game play-in.|$|R
50|$|The {{regular season}} was {{extended}} by two days (to August 9 and 10) {{in view of}} the season's many <b>rain-outs.</b> The games scheduled for these days sometimes were not against opponents that were due to complete a rained-out game. The one-game play-in games occurred on the afternoon of August 11 — not {{at the site of the}} higher-seeded team, but at the site of the winner's opponent in the next round, which began the same evening. This next round, a best-of-three series, was slated for alternating sites, though in neither case was the third game necessary. The final round reverted to the prior year's rule, in which the higher-seeded team (in this case, Martha's Vineyard) had the option of hosting the first game or any remaining games. Martha's Vineyard elected to open the series in Nashua, on August 14, and won the series at home the next day.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rain-out</b> {{model can}} be invoked to explain core {{formation}} in all the terrestrial planets, given that these consist primarily of silicates, nickel and iron. It can also be adapted to account for core formation in smaller bodies composed of ices and silicates. In such a case, {{it would be the}} denser silicates which would rain out to form a rocky core, while the volatile components would form an icy mantle.|$|E
50|$|According to the <b>rain-out</b> model, core {{formation}} was {{a relatively}} rapid process, taking a few dozen millennia to reach completion. This occurred {{at the end of}} a lengthy process in which the planets were assembled from colliding planetary embryos. Only the collisions of such large embryos could generate enough heat to melt entire bodies. Furthermore, it was only after all of the iron and nickel delivered by impacting bodies had arrived that core formation could proceed to completion.|$|E
50|$|In September 1988, after a <b>rain-out</b> in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a {{group of}} {{dedicated}} car owners and drivers banded together and formed the Southern Modified Auto Racing Teams, or S.M.A.R.T., as they became known to race fans throughout the region.

5000|$|In 1974, Jim Paul {{bought the}} team for $1000 and assumed the team's $52,000 in {{outstanding}} debt, and proceeded to revolutionize baseball, not only in El Paso but throughout the Minor Leagues and even influence the Majors. Paul's purchase of the team ushered in {{the golden age of}} El Paso baseball. The name of the team was changed to the Diablos, the Spanish word for [...] "devils". Paul held numerous innovative promotions and promoted a lively, fan-friendly atmosphere at the ballpark. Sparing any expense, save a coat of bright yellow paint with the word [...] "BASEBALL" [...] written in twelve foot tall red letters, Dudley Field was converted to [...] "The Dudley Dome." [...] While technically not a dome in any sense of the word, the field had a supernatural ability to avoid <b>rain-outs</b> and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium. The home team dugout had the word [...] "diablos" [...] painted on top while the visitors dugout received a coat of paint that said [...] "enemy." [...] Upon entering the turnstiles fans were given a facial tissue to use for [...] "Bye, Bye, Baby" [...] when the visiting team changed pitchers the outgoing pitcher was serenaded by the Janis Joplin tune over the PA system while the fans in the grandstand waved their tissues. One notable victim was Dennis Eckersly who acknowledged the crowd by tipping his hat, though others were not so considerate and the Texas League created a standard fine for those obscene gestures. Other promotions included 10¢ hotdog night, nickel beer night, and Martinez Appreciation Night where anyone with the last name Martinez received free admission.|$|R

50|$|The {{particle}} sizes {{range from}} submicrometer- and micrometer-sized (created by condensation of plasma in the fireball), through 10-500 micrometers (surface material agitated by the blast wave and {{raised by the}} afterwinds), to millimeter and above (crater ejecta). The size of particles together with the altitude they are carried to, determines the length of their stay in the atmosphere, as larger particles are subject to dry precipitation. Smaller particles can be also scavenged by precipitation, either from the moisture condensing in the cloud itself or from the cloud intersecting with a rain cloud. The fallout carried down by rain is known as <b>rain-out</b> if scavenged during raincloud formation, washout if absorbed into already formed falling raindrops.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rain-out</b> {{model is}} a model of {{planetary}} science that describes the first stage of planetary differentiation and core formation. According to this model, a planetary body is assumed to be composed primarily of silicate minerals and NiFe (i.e. a mixture of nickel and iron). If temperatures within this body reach about 1500 K, the minerals and the metals will melt. This will produce an emulsion in which globules of liquid NiFe are dispersed in a magma of liquid silicates, the two being immiscible. Because the NiFe globules are denser than the silicates, they will sink under the influence of gravity to the centre of the planetary body—in effect, the globules of metal will [...] "rain out" [...] from the emulsion to the centre, forming a core.|$|E

5000|$|In a [...] "day-night doubleheader", {{the first}} game is played in the early {{afternoon}} and the second is played at night; in this scenario, spectators must buy separate tickets to gain admittance to both games.

5000|$|By {{virtue of}} their sweep in the Division Series, the White Sox got to enjoy a three-day break in between the two series, while the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and New York Yankees battled it out. Due to a <b>rain-out,</b> the Angels had to fly from New York to Anaheim for Game 5 of the series, and then fly to Chicago in back to back nights. It was assumed that the White Sox would have the easy {{advantage}} in this series, because they were very well rested and Los Angeles was very tired. However, {{that was not the}} case. The Angels were led by a home run from Garret Anderson in the second, and Chicago was unable to execute in the field, leading to two more Angel runs. The White Sox would get on the board with a Joe Crede home run in the third. They added on another run to cut the lead to 3-2 with A. J. Pierzynski's RBI single in the fourth. However, that would be all the production the Sox could muster, as they wasted opportunities in the later innings, as well as a solid start by José Contreras. He went 8 innings, giving up three runs. It was Contreras's first loss since August 15, when he suffered defeat to the Minnesota Twins. The White Sox were now in a hole, and faced a must-win Game 2, or risk going to Anaheim down 2-0.

5000|$|Ebbets was a {{hands-on}} baseball owner who introduced numerous concepts {{into the game}} that still live on in some form in the present day. His first concept was Ladies Day in 1899, in which women were admitted into the ballpark for a reduced fee. He also helped in changing {{the length of the}} Major League Baseball schedule from 140 to 154 in 1904, based on the distances required to visit each club in the league. In 1906, he helped in the installation of separate batting and fielding practices for his Dodger team and the visiting team along with separate dressing rooms with lockers and running water (at the time, the visiting team came dressed from their hotel before arriving at the ballpark, often getting jeered or pelted by the home fans). He also came up with the [...] "rain check" [...] in 1911, in which a detached portion of the ticket could be used {{in the event of a}} <b>rain-out.</b> Two years later, he came up with the idea for the player's draft, in which the team with the worst record gets the first picks in the draft. [...] During an exhibition game in Memphis on March 28, 1917 between his team and the Boston Red Sox, the two teams wore numbers on their sleeves due to his belief that fans in a non-major league city like Memphis wouldn't be familiar with the players. He proposed having all teams to put numbers on the players' sleeves or caps during a National League meeting on December 13, 1922, but it was left to the discretion of the teams (the practice of numbers on uniforms did not come into popularity until 1929). In 1925, he persuaded others to adopt as a permanent rule the 2-3-2 pattern used in the previous World Series. This format is still used today.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>Rain-Out</b> Model for Planetary {{differentiation}} is a {{very poor}} hypothesis. An actual explanation is offered. According to the <b>Rain-Out</b> Model of planetary differentiation, iron and nickel are heated up to 1500 K within the planetary body so that they melt and sink below the surface forming {{the core of a}} planetary object. This is not a hypothesis at all because no mechanism is offered to explain how the iron/nickel mixture gets heated up in the center of an object in the first place. According to the <b>rain-out</b> model outer space is assumed to be 1500 K. There is evidence that this is not true as the main average temperature of outer space is roughly 3 K. Also if the rain out model is to work how exactly does the middle of the planet become melted as opposed to the surface? A diagram illustrates this point: The core was differentiated as a red dwarf star according to stellar metamorphosis...|$|E

In this study, we quantified hybridization rates in response to experimental manipulations of rainfall, an important dimension of global change. We used <b>rain-out</b> shelters in the field and quantified rates of hybridization between two congeners, Helianthus annuus (common sunflower) and H. petiolaris (prairie sunflower). We found that H. annuus maternal plants produced hybrid progeny more than H. petiolaris maternal plants, with a trend for decreased rates of hybridization with increased soil moisture (when <b>rain-out</b> shelters were absent).
