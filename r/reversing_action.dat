40|$|Objectives: {{to examine}} the effects of {{verapamil}} on the intracellular drug pharmacokinetics of epirubicin using alternative dosing schedules. The results might inform the choices for optimizing clinical chemotherapy. Methods: sensitive parental (MGH-U 1) and multidrug resistant (MDR) (MGH-U 1 R and MGH-U 1 -MMC) bladder cancer cell lines were used. Fluorescence time-lapsed studies were performed on cells incubated with epirubicin alone or combined with verapamil. Flow cytometry was performed after the alternative dosing regimens. Results: verapamil reversed the epirubicin localization patterns in MDR cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that nuclear epirubicin accumulation in MDR cells with verapamil followed the parental curve. The maximal reversal took > 60 minutes. Flow cytometry showed increased epirubicin uptake in MDR cells co-incubated with verapamil. Preincubation was not as effective as co-incubation. Conclusions: the results of our model indicate that longer exposure to MDR-class drugs, exemplified by epirubicin, increases uptake and the MDR <b>reversing</b> <b>action</b> of co-treatment with verapamil. The present results highlight the need for additional clinical trials of drug dosing and scheduling for combination intravesical chemotherapy regimen...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 95 - 97). We study actions of monoids and monoidal categories, and {{their relations with}} (co) homology theories. We start by discussing actions of monoids via bi-actions. We {{show that there is}} a well-defined functorial <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> when a monoid action is given, which corresponds to acting by the inverses for group actions. We use this <b>reverse</b> <b>actions</b> to construct a homotopical structure on the category of monoid actions, which allow us to build the Burnside ring of a monoid. Then, we study categorifications of the previously introduced notions. In particular, we study actions of monoidal categories on categories and show that the ideas of <b>action</b> <b>reversing</b> of monoid <b>actions</b> extends to actions of monoidal categories. We use the <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> for actions of monoidal categories, along with homotopy theory, to define homology, cohomology, homotopy and cohomotopy theories graded over monoidal categories. We show that most of the existing theories fits into our setting; and thus, we unify the existing definitions of these theories. Finally, we construct the spectral sequences for the theories graded over monoidal categories, which are the strongest tools for computation of cohomology and homotopy theories in existence. by Mehmet Akif Erdal.

It has been considered difficult due to strong nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties, the effect of which increases {{with the size of}} booms. A human simulated intelligent control scheme is developed to improve control performance by modifying control mode and control parameters. In addition, considering the negative effects caused by frequent and redundant <b>reverse</b> <b>actions</b> of the proportional valve, a double-direction compensation scheme is proposed to deal with the dead-zone nonlinearity of proportional valve. Sinusoidal motions are implemented on a real boom system. The results indicate that HSIC controller can improve control accuracy, and dead-zone nonlinearity is effectively compensated by proposed compensation scheme without introducing frequent <b>reverse</b> <b>actions</b> of proportional valve...|$|R

50|$|The artistic use of <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> is {{pervasive}} {{in the films}} of Jean Cocteau. In his Beauty and the Beast (1946), for example, an actor placing {{a piece of paper}} in a fire and then walking backwards away was filmed in reverse motion, causing it to appear as though the character walked up to a fire and pulled the paper out of it. Similar instances are where the petals are peeled off a flower. Cocteau filmed this in reverse motion, making it appear on screen as if the flower comes back to life, with petals rejoining the stem. Yet other examples include Cocteau sketching drawings with a rag and unsmashing pottery, with fragments flying up into his hand and joining together. By the time of Le Testament d'Orphée, use of <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> was endemic in Cocteau's work, with more than one critic declaring it so overused as to be an embarrassing personal tic.|$|R
