40|$|Fundamental {{structures}} {{are the main}} tools {{in the study of}} hyperstructures. Fundamental equivalence relations link hyperstructure theory to the  theory of corresponding classical structures. They also introduce new hyperstructure classes. The present paper is a brief reference to the two different approaches to the notion of the fundamental <b>relation</b> <b>in</b> hyperstructures. The first one belongs to Koskas, who introduced the β ∗ - <b>relation</b> <b>in</b> hyperstructures and the second approach to Vougiouklis, who gave the name fundamental to the resulting quotient sets. The two approaches, the necessary definitions and the theorems for the introduction of the fundamental equivalence <b>relation</b> <b>in</b> hyperstructures, are presented...|$|R

5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} {{untouched by the}} Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E
