In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E

40|$|Aim and hypothesis: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} Biodentine™ as a root-end filling. The working hypothesis is that Biodentine™ provides apical bacterial seal as MTA when applied in root-end filling therapy. Materials and methods: For background literature, an electronic search was conducted in PubMed. Key words related to apicoectomy, root-end filling materials and micro leakage were used. Apart from PubMed, the web pages of the manufactures were used to include the information that only has been published in the form abstract or being just “data on file” without any other forum of publication. Simultaneously dye micro leakage lab experiments were conducted, testing Biodentine™, IRM® and ProRoot MTA™ as root-end fillings. The experiments were performed using extracted human teeth and fuchsin-colored dye solution. The experimental protocol was compiled using well-known principles with references. A total of three experiments were performed; a pilot experiment (Experiment 1), Experiment 2 and Experiment 3. The pilot experiment (Experiment 1) aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the dye leakage experiment for ex vivo teeth. The results of the pilot experiment were used as a guideline for the dye leakage experiment in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3 ProRoot MTA™ was used as root-end fillings as a standard to investigate dye leakage after different immersion times. Results: In Experiment 1, two out of five canals filled with Biodentine™ could <b>resist</b> <b>dye</b> penetration. None of the canals filled with ProRoot MTA™ or IRM® <b>resisted</b> <b>dye</b> penetration. In Experiment 2 only one canal filled with ProRoot MTA <b>resisted</b> <b>dye</b> penetration. Biodentine™ and IRM® displayed total leakage through the root-end filling material. However, the specimens with Biodentine™ had less leakage through the gutta-percha compared to IRM®. In Experiment 3 total dye leakage was not seen in specimens immersed in a 1 - to 3 -hour time frame. Total leakage of the root-end filling was first seen after 6 hours. After 12 hours, dye had penetrated both the root-end filling and the gutta-percha. Conclusion: In Experiment 2, ProRoot MTA™ was the only material to resist apical leakage. The proper dye immersion time was established in Experiment 3, using MTA samples only. The experiment should now be repeated in order to establish the ability of Biodentine™ to resist apical leakage compared to ProRoot MTA™...|$|R

40|$|Kurume {{is a city}} on Kyushu Island in Japan {{known for}} {{producing}} dramatic hand-woven e-gasuri (picture ikat) futon-ji (bedding covers). The most famous have a single picture which runs across four or five panels. Both the warp and weft threads were <b>resist</b> <b>dyed</b> using indigo before being woven into a single long and narrow length of fabric. This cloth was then cut into the panel sections and sewn together. Extraordinary skill was required to both accurately tie the areas of thread to be resisted and to maintain a consistent tension when weaving the fabric. This precision produced complex designs with bands of resist that met exactly at the seams, usually consisting of many lines that traveled across multiple seams. A Kurume e-gasuri futon-ji was a prized inclusion in a wedding trousseau. Most existing Kurume futon-ji date from the late 19 th century, when Japan abandoned the policy of isolation from outside contact, to the early period of the Pacific War. During this time Japan made a concentrated effort to modernize and industrialize. Existing Kurume futon-ji from this time feature not only traditional auspicious images but also images of modern subjects like steamships and airplanes. This paper will examine the seeming dichotomy of a labor intensive weaving technique being chosen to portray images of industrialization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} elegant indirectness that certain e-gasuri {{patterns}} exhibit while using traditional symbols to express familiar Japanese sayings and concepts. E-gasuri is the Japanese word for fabrics patterned with pictures created with the ikat resist dying technique. Kasuri essentially means ikat. Kasuri becomes gasuri {{in the compound}} word e-gasuri. E means picture. The ikat technique of dying threads before they are woven produces images with blurred outlines. This blurred appearance is a treasured aspect of the e-gasuri aesthetic. E-gasuri is usually (but not exclusively) associated today with indigo <b>resist</b> <b>dyed</b> blue and white cotton and bast fabrics. The following three paragraphs describe the techniques that were most often used to create {{the majority of the}} Japanese picture ikat textiles that survive today. By the early 19 th century Japanese weavers were creating e-gasuri using yet unwoven warp threads, weft threads or both which were tightly wrapped by hand at predetermined intervals with a material that protected the wrapped areas of thread from absorbing dye when submerged in dye vats, usually filled with indigo. When woven with painstaking care the precisely calculated predetermined white resist segments produced pictures in the finished cloth. By the 1830 ’s e-gasuri warp or weft threads were being patterned, again before being woven, with pairs of wooden boards carved with mirror images of a design that created a resist when clamped together over the threads. The clamped blocks could be submerged in dye vats. Often, holes were drilled into the blocks to allow dye into selected areas. Sometimes dyes were poured directly into the holes. Wax could also be poured into the holes to create a <b>resist</b> for subsequent <b>dye</b> baths. These textiles are called itajime-gasuri but they often include hand tied resist design elements as well...|$|R
5000|$|A resist, used in {{many areas}} of {{manufacturing}} and art, is something that is added to parts of an object to create a pattern by protecting these parts from being affected by a subsequent stage in the process. Often the resist is then removed. For example in the <b>resist</b> <b>dyeing</b> of textiles, wax or a similar substance is added to places where the dye is not wanted.

40|$|I am a weaver and a dyer with {{a passion}} for {{continued}} investigation of these disciplines. My work integrates the two processes of weaving on the loom and dyeing the cloth after it is removed from the loom. I have spent over 25 years developing and refining a technique that I have named woven shibori. Supplemental threads are woven into the cloth while it is on the loom. Once the weaving is complete, the supplemental threads are used to gather the cloth, creating a <b>resist</b> for <b>dyeing</b> or shaping. Both weaving and dying are essential to the final textile. I continue to experiment with new ways of integrating them. A number of years ago I was inspired by an early to mid 20 th century belt from Morocco. I believe this piece was woven with the intent to dye it. The warp is wool. The weft includes stripes of wool and cotton. It has been folded to create a <b>resist</b> and <b>dyed</b> with an acid dye. The dye only attached only to the wool fiber. Using this textile as a starting point, I began an exploration of my own.

40|$|Abstract: Nigerian {{multi-ethnic}} {{and diverse}} culture, gives {{a lot of}} value to its arts, which primarily include ivory carving, grass weaving, wood carving, leather and calabash, pottery, painting, cloth weaving, glass and metal works. Perhaps more than any form of art, the art of cloth (Adire) making reflects the culture from which they come. The art’s value (Adire making) has certainly been developed {{over a long period}} of time, only time make it stronger as it passes from generation to generation. Adire textiles which, is the indigo dyed cloth is an integral part of the culture and cultural heritage of the people of Egba kingdom in south western Nigeria. It is the major local craft by the women who use a variety of <b>resist</b> <b>dye</b> techniques in their entrepreneurial and artistic efforts, to produce various design of adire textile for both the local and national market.

40|$|The {{power loom}} {{has long been}} a time and labor saving device {{resulting}} in a separation of the weaver/designer from the process of making cloth. This is evident in the Taiten shibori fabrics of the early 20 th century, the only form of Japanese loom woven shibori. Taiten fabric was woven of plain weave with heavier threads placed at intervals in the warp. When the cloth is removed from the loom the heavy threads are pulled to form a <b>resist</b> for <b>dyeing.</b> While developing my own process of woven shibori I was not able to understand why the Japanese never developed a similarly expanded vocabulary of woven pattern resist, although they had refined shibori to include extensive patterns of stitched, wrapped and tied resists. Once I realized that the taiten fabrics were made on industrial looms and then taken to dyers to be hand processed, {{it became clear that the}} weaver was not the dyer. In the case of my own woven shibori, the weaver is the dyer, allowing me to make connections between weaving, <b>resist</b> and <b>dyeing.</b> As we enter the 21 st century when Jacquard and industrial equipment is becoming accessible to the textile artist, the relationship between industrial production and hand process deserves examination. My opportunity to work in a small textile mill is resulting in a vastly expanded vocabulary of woven resist patterns for shibori. Access to jacquard looms, combined with the ability to connect designing, weaving and dyeing, is transforming the way I work and the resulting fabrics. 20 -minute presentation including images of historical taiten process and the artist’s fabrics and process...|$|R

40|$|Ajrak is a {{traditional}} cloth from the province of Sindh in Pakistan, whose lineage {{dates back to the}} period of the Indus Valley Civilization which flourished from 2500 - 1500 BC. Pakistan, bordered by India, Afghanistan and Iran, has the River Indus flowing southwards from the Himalayas and emptying into the Arabian Sea. Pakistan is only fifty-three years old as an independent country but excavations here have revealed several major ancient cities and their material cultures, which existed on this land thousands of years ago. Amongst a wealth of pottery and ornaments discovered at the site of Mehergarh (6500 - 4500 BC) was found the impression of a woven cloth. The celebrated statue of the King Priest discovered at Moenjodaro has a trefoil motif on the draped shawl. The ajrak craftsmen claim that the pattern is kakar, a cloud pattern. The same trefoil is seen on the Hathor Cow and on the bodies of Sumerian bulls in Mesopotamia where the concept of trinity was evolved. The trefoil is thought to be composed of three sun discs fused together to represent the inseparable unity of the Gods of Sun, Water and Earth. One of the greatest accomplishments of the sub-continent was the development of the technology of dyeing and printing of fabric. This is evident from the discovery of a dyer 2 ̆ 7 s workshop at Moenjodaro. Indigo Ferra Tinetoria, the most ancient fabled dye also grew in abundance on the banks of River Indus.
