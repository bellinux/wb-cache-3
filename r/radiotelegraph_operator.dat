2500|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} in the United States must be {{licensed by the}} FCC before transmitting. [...] While the FCC maintains control of the written testing standards, it no longer administers the exams, having delegated that function to private volunteer organizations. No amateur license class still requires examination in Morse code; neither the FCC nor the volunteer organizations still test code skills for amateur licenses (commercial license examiners do test code skills for the <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator</b> license).|$|E
2500|$|A {{difference}} between amateur radio licenses and commercial radiotelegraph licenses is that commercial operators {{must be able}} to receive code groups of random characters along with plain language text. [...] For each class of license, the code group speed requirement is slower than the plain language text requirement. For example, for the <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator</b> License, the examinee must pass a 20 word per minute plain text test and a 16 word per minute code group test.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2015, the United States Air Force still trains {{ten people}} a year in Morse. [...] The United States Coast Guard has ceased all use of Morse code on the radio, and no longer {{monitors}} any radio frequencies for Morse code transmissions, including the international medium frequency (MF) distress frequency of 500 kHz. However, the Federal Communications Commission still grants commercial <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operator</b> licenses to applicants who pass its code and written tests. Licensees have reactivated the old California coastal Morse station KPH and regularly transmit from the site under either this Call sign or as KSM. Similarly, a few US Museum ship stations are operated by Morse enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|Hold or {{qualify for}} a GROL, or GMDSS Radio Maintainer's License, or First Class <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator's</b> Certificate, or Second Class <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator's</b> Certificate. Those last two {{licenses}} are no longer issued. The <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator's</b> License (T), issued since May 2013, also can have added to it a ship radar endorsement.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, the International Code of Signals, {{originally}} {{created for}} ship communication by signalling using flags, was expanded {{by adding a}} collection of five-letter codes {{to be used by}} <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Japan was {{of course}} a prime target for radio {{interception}} and cryptanalysis, but there was the problem of finding personnel who could speak Japanese. The Navy {{had a number of}} officers who had served in a diplomatic capacity in Japan and could speak Japanese fluently, but there was a shortage of <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> who could read Japanese Wabun code communications sent in kana. Fortunately, a number of US Navy and Marine <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> operating in the Pacific had formed an informal group in 1923 to compare notes on Japanese kana transmissions. Four of these men became instructors in the art of reading kana transmissions when the Navy began conducting classes in the subject in 1928.|$|R
2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. [...] The First Class license required 20 WPM code group and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test. [...] It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory. [...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete. [...] (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.) [...] Currently, only one class of license, the <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator</b> License, is issued. [...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests. [...] However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20 WPM test requirement.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classes were}} {{conducted}} by the Room 2426 crew, and the <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> {{became known as the}} [...] "On-The-Roof Gang". By June 1940, OP-20-G included 147 officers, enlisted men, and civilians, linked into a network of radio listening posts as far-flung as the Army's.|$|R
50|$|The mid-symbol {{listening}} and interruption capability {{provided by the}} short but ubiquitous Morse code silent periods during QSK or full break-in operation on half-duplex radiotelegraph channels creates the illusion of apparent continuous two-way contact allowing <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> {{to feel as if}} they are sharing a full duplex channel.|$|R
50|$|The {{end result}} of extreme {{receiver}} AFE sensitivity to high power levels is that, for most practical purposes, signal reception is impossible during periods when the associated transmitter is actually transmitting the dot and dash signals. Consequently, <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> cannot hear interruptions from remote receiving stations during normal signal transmission periods when the full transmitter power {{is applied to the}} antenna.|$|R
50|$|Franciszek Ząbecki {{was born}} in Łyszkowice to Rozalia and Franciszek Ząbecki, {{as one of their}} four children. After graduation, he worked for the railway between 29 September 1925 and 15 October 1929 in Bednary near Łowicz, first as an {{apprentice}} and then as the <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operator.</b> Ząbecki was drafted to serve at Zegrze Fortress from 15 October 1929 until 1 September 1931. Soon later, he relocated to Sokołów Podlaski, where his older brother Grzegorz worked at a sugar refinery. Franciszek found employment as a tax collector and got to know the locals.|$|E
50|$|The US Federal Communications Commission does still issue a {{lifetime}} commercial <b>Radiotelegraph</b> <b>Operator</b> License. This requires passing a simple written test on regulations, {{a more complex}} written exam on technology, and demonstrating Morse reception at 20 words per minute plain language and 16 wpm code groups. (Credit is given for amateur extra class licenses earned under the old 20 wpm requirement.) Wireless telegraphy is still used widely today by amateur radio hobbyists where it is {{commonly referred to as}} radio telegraphy, continuous wave, or just CW. However its knowledge is not required to obtain any class of amateur license.|$|E
50|$|He was {{successful}} in his new career, with writing credits for multiple publications including Popular Science, The Rotarian, Harpers, and the Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, {{in addition to being}} the science editor for The Nation. His final book, Sarnoff: An American Success, was published posthumously in 1977. It is best known for fully dispelling the myth that in 1912 David Sarnoff, while working as a New York City <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operator,</b> had been the first person to hear the distress call sent by the RMS Titanic and had operated as the primary contact in the subsequent communications.|$|E
5000|$|An active amateur radio {{operator}} with the call sign WB0RPA, he held an amateur extra class license, the highest grade issued. [...] As {{shown in the}} Federal Communications Commission database, he also earned both a General radiotelephone operator license and a commercial <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operator's</b> license, {{as well as a}} ship radar endorsement on these certificates. He {{was also one of the}} few people to qualify for the now-obsolete aircraft radiotelegraph endorsement on the latter license.|$|R
5000|$|Early radio (initially {{known as}} {{wireless}} telegraphy) included many former wire telegraph operators, {{and within the}} new service [...] "ham" [...] was employed as a pejorative term by professional <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> to suggest that amateur enthusiasts were unskilled. In [...] "Floods and Wireless" [...] by Hanby Carver, from the August 1915 Technical World Magazine, the author noted [...] "Then someone thought of the 'hams'. This is the name that the commercial wireless service has given to amateur operators..." ...|$|R
50|$|During the Great War the Royal Navy enlisted many volunteers as radio telegraphists. Telegraphists were {{indispensable}} at sea in {{the early}} days of wireless telegraphy, and many young men were called to sea as professional <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> who were always accorded high-paying officer status at sea. Subsequent to the Titanic disaster and the Radio Act of 1912, the International Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) conventions established the 500kHz maritime distress frequency monitoring and mandated that all passenger-carrying ships carry licensed radio telegraph operators.|$|R

50|$|Dreher {{was born}} in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria) in 1896, and emigrated to the United States in 1899. Beginning in 1908 he {{operated}} a small amateur radio station while living in the Bronx, and in 1916 qualified for a First Class-First Grade commercial <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operator's</b> license. He attended Townsend Harris Hall, the City College of New York (CCNY) preparatory school, graduating in 1913. He then enrolled at CCNY, where his primary instructor was Dr. Alfred N. Goldsmith. The United States entered World War One in April, 1917, and Dreher received his B.S. degree in May, a month early, {{on the condition that}} he take a civilian position that aided the war effort. He began employment with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, working on war contracts in the company's test shop in Aldene, New Jersey, and also {{became a member of the}} Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE).|$|R
5000|$|Turning over a {{communications}} channel {{is the change}} in communications protocol transmission status that occurs when a transmitting station releases transmitting control of {{a communications}} channel thus turning it over to allow another station to transmit. QSK or full break-in operation {{is one of several}} techniques and protocols for turning over control of a Morse code radiotelegraph communications channel. Usually the transmitter of a radiotelegraph station is manually controlled by an operator using a telegraph key. QSK is a three-letter code group {{that is one of the}} numerous Morse code three-letter code groups belonging to the venerable International Q-code established for <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>operators</b> in the first decade of the 1900s. The three letter code group QSK literally means [...] "I can hear you between my signals; you may break in on my transmission." [...] Because of this, full break-in operation is often referred to as QSK operation. Although radiotelegraphy and Morse code is no longer used for commercial or professional purposes it continues to thrive and grow in the amateur radio community hobby. Today's modern era radio amateurs seem to be as interested in so-called full break-in or QSK operation as professional operators were in the early twentieth century.|$|R
