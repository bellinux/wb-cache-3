40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to study the possibilities of ozone- and bacteriophage treatment (OBPT) in correction of endotoxicosis and immunological disorders in patients of chronic inflammatory diseases <b>of</b> <b>uterine</b> <b>adnexa</b> (CIDUA). Materials and methods. There have been examined 100 patients with CIDUA, 50 of them have received OBPT, and 50 — traditional treatment. Some parameters of systemic and tissue immunity have been studied. Results and Discussion. The analysis of dynamics of clinical and immune values {{against the background of}} the two methods of treatment has revealed that the response to provocation of inflammatory process complication by administration of saturating ozone concentration (5000 mkg/l) and Prodigiosan is the increase of intoxication, CIC, IL- 6. Henceforth, the compared methods of treatment have showed significant difference. So, OBPT has caused the normalization of the changed acute-phase values, immunological parameters including local ones. The patients’ follow-up within a year has revealed lower recurrence rate of CIDUA complications after OBPT. It makes it possible to consider the method of ozone- and bacteriophage treatment to be pathogenetically reasonable component of complex treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases <b>of</b> <b>uterine</b> <b>adnexa...</b>|$|R
40|$|Torsion <b>of</b> <b>uterine</b> <b>adnexa</b> is an {{important}} cause of acute abdominal pain. Torsion of ovarian masses is quite common and isolated torsion of fallopian tube has also been reported in literature. However, torsion of para ovarian cyst is a very rare. We report a rare case of twisted para ovarian cyst resulting in secondary torsion of the fallopian tube. Torsion of fallopian tube and para ovarian cyst are usually seen in the reproductive age group. Physicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this uncommon and often difficult to diagnose cause of abdominal pain...|$|R

30|$|Despite an {{increasing}} number of alternative minimal invasive treatment options, the hysterectomy in the Netherlands is still frequently performed in premenopausal patients with uterine symptoms. According to a Dutch hospital-based database (Prismant), approximately 16, 000 hysterectomies are performed each year.

40|$|Uterine {{leiomyoma}} is {{a common}} benign tumor of the female genital organs. Very often cases of ne­ces­sary invasive treatment in women planning pregnancy appear.

5000|$|A {{hysterectomy}} is {{the surgical}} <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the uterus {{which may be}} carried out {{for a number of}} reasons including the ridding of tumours both benign and malignant. A complete hysterectomy involves the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the body, fundus, and cervix of the uterus. A partial hysterectomy may just involve the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uterine</b> body while leaving the cervix intact. It is the most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure.|$|R
30|$|The {{successful}} {{performance of}} this procedure and the patient's uneventful recovery, including early hospital discharge and rapid return to normal activity the following week (although intercourse was deferred for 4 weeks because of the posterior colpotomy scar), suggest that this technique can be recommended to colleagues. Various laparoscopic supracervical techniques have been described to allow <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uterine</b> body. Morcellation is either time-consuming or expensive, depending on whether a manual or a mechanical technique is employed. Enlargement of the port sites negates {{the advantage of a}} laparoscopic procedure. Morcellation also requires preoperative endometrial assessment as the uterine body is removed in a piecemeal fashion. Posterior colpotomy to allow <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uterine</b> body leads to loss of the pneumoperitoneum. But the use of the McCartney tube inserted transvaginally allows the pneumoperitoneum to be maintained and therefore offers a very safe and effective method for removing and retrieving the uterine body, suturing the posterior colpotomy, and inspecting the operative field [11, 12].|$|R
50|$|Uterus didelphys {{is often}} {{confused}} {{with a complete}} uterine septum. Often more than one method of investigation is necessary to accurately diagnose the condition.

30|$|Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal {{myomectomy}} (LAVM) is a {{minimally invasive}} surgical procedure for removing uterine myomas.

These authors independently worked on a variant of laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) in which the dominant myoma was removed laparoscopically and the uterus was delivered via colpotomy into the vagina for <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>uterine</b> myomas and for uterine closure [1].|$|R

2500|$|Usually {{performed}} by a gynecologist, hysterectomy may be total (removing the body, fundus, and cervix of the uterus; often called [...] "complete") or partial (<b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uterine</b> body while leaving the cervix intact; also called [...] "supracervical"). It is the most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure. In 2003, over 600,000 hysterectomies were performed in the United States alone, of which over 90% were performed for benign conditions. Such rates being highest {{in the industrialized world}} has led to the major controversy that hysterectomies are being largely performed for unwarranted and unnecessary reasons.|$|R

The cloned calves were heavier (57 ± 8 kg) than calves from CONTROL group (36 ± 7 kg), and calves from HIGH-RISK group (37 ± 13 kg) (P = 0. 003). The diameter of the thoracic aorta was positively correlated (R = 0. 62) with fetal birth weight in the CONTROL group (P = 0. 01). Fetal activity was not associated with survival.

30|$|Although {{reducing}} a uterine sarcoma with electromechanical power morcellation {{within the}} abdominal cavity {{is contrary to}} oncologic surgical principles, the question remains if sarcoma cells {{are more inclined to}} implant in the peritoneum after power morcellation then after ‘en bloc’ <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uterine</b> specimen with sarcoma embedded and if survival is affected given the bad prognosis that the sarcoma already has. These two questions have been addressed in literature. Two case reports support the concept of upstaging by power morcellation [80, 81]. In the reported patients, reintervention showed seeding of sarcomatous tissue, which was not visible during initial surgery. These findings have been confirmed in larger studies where the percentage upstaging ranged from 15 to 64  % [18, 28, 82, 83].|$|R

40|$|The fetal ECG can be {{detected}} in the recorded abdominal signals. A new procedure to compute the fetal heart rate (FHR) is proposed. The abdominal signal is first preprocessed in order to remove the baseline and the uterine contractions. Then the ECG of the mother (MECG) is removed using coherent averaging and optimizing the averaged MECG template. The channels containing the clearest fetal ECG signal (FECG) are identified by the autocorrelation function. The FECG is enhanced by the cross correlation between the two channels that show the strongest FECG. This enhancement is possible since the residual noise in the abdominal signal after <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> baseline, <b>uterine</b> contractions and maternal ECG is not correlated among the channels.

40|$|Infections <b>of</b> the <b>uterine</b> <b>adnexa</b> are {{extremely}} uncommon in the neonatal period. Raso (1942) has reported one case of salpingitis in the newborn infant. He {{was unable to}} find a similar case in the literature at that time. His patient had suffered from severe umbilical sepsis and died from peri-tonitis on the eleventh day after birth. At necropsy there was marked umbilical sepsis, peritonitis, and early bilateral bronchopneumonia in addition to hepato-splenomegaly, which the author attributed to syphilis. The left Fallopian tube was found to be enlarged to two or three times the normal size in its middle third. There was a fibrino-purulent exudate in this region. On histological examination the surface epithelium of the mucous membrane was found to be relatively intact, but the corium was the site of an acute inflammatory reaction. The regional lymphatics were also full of pus. The serous coat was involved in the general peritonitis. Streptococci were found in the affected area. The opposite tube and uterus were quite healthy. The author suggested that the sepsis had spread to the peritoneum from the umbilical area and thence to the left tube via the lymphatics. He contrasts this pathogenesis with that of gonococcal salpingitis derived from an endometritis, and considers it resembles more closely septic lymphangitis of the Fallopian tubes in adults. Dunham (1933), in a review of sepsis in the newborn, reported several cases of peritonitis but in no instance were the tubes or ovaries involved. Martz and Foote (1938) have reviewed the literature concerning pyosalpinx in women. The earliest age of onset quoted therein is fifteen years. Dodek (1933) reported one case of a ruptured ovarian cyst in a newborn infant and considers the differential diagnosis. The following case is one of neonatal pyosalpinx.

40|$|Background: Myomectomy is a {{surgical}} technique used for <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>uterine</b> fibroids and historically hysterectomy has represented {{the mainstay of}} treatment. The options of conservative surgical approaches mainly aim at retention of fertility but have to be balanced against potential risks such as haemorrhage; blood loss at myomectomy still remains troublesome with use of various pharmacologic agents yielding inconclusive results. This trial aimed to explore the benefit of combining ornipressin and tranexamic acid during open myomectomy. Study design: A randomized double blind placebo controlled trial. Methods: Women who satisfied eligibility criteria were enrolled into the study and randomized into one of two groups. The experimental group received 1 g of tranexamic acid diluted to 50 ml of saline administered at 100 ml per hour at cutting time (knife to skin). The control group received placebo diluted to 50 ml of saline administered at 100 ml per hour at cutting time. Both groups had five international units ornipressin diluted in 60 ml of saline administered during surgery. The primary outcome (blood loss) was assessed by determining the weight difference of dry and soaked swabs using a digital weighing scale by converting this to volume (ml). Operating time was noted from the time <b>of</b> <b>uterine</b> incision to the time <b>of</b> <b>uterine</b> closure. The need for transfusion was determined by anaesthetists’ assessment of acceptable blood loss and clinical assessment of vital signs. Post-operative stay was calculated {{from the time of}} extubation to 8 am on the day of discharge. Results: A total of thirty-four patients were randomized to two groups; 17 received ornipressin only and 17 received tranexamic acid and ornipressin. There was no difference in blood loss between the groups with a median blood loss in the ornipressin (n = 17) and ornipressin plus tranexamic acid arms of 398 ml (IQR: 251 – 630) ml and 251 ml (IQR: 158 – 501) ml respectively P = 0. 361. Conclusions: Ornipressin administered along with tranexamic acid is not beneficial for blood loss reduction at open myomectomy. In settings such as ours where myomata are prevalent and severe anaemia rampant, blood donation and judicious use of scarce blood resources is key. Efforts to optimize preoperative haemoglobin levels and blood auto-donation seem the most promising options in pre-operative preparation prior to myomectomy.
