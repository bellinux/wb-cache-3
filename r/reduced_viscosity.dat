40|$|There {{has been}} much {{interest}} in alternative to transport viscous crude oil from reservoir {{which is much more}} abundant than conventional oil. There are many authors hard to find the stable of oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion condition which has been considered as critical analysis. In order to <b>reduce</b> the <b>viscosity,</b> the heavy oil is required to modify for <b>reducing</b> their <b>viscosity.</b> Applying diluent and forming o/w emulsion are the selected as alternative for <b>reducing</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The purpose for this investigation is to study factors that influencing stability and viscosity of o/w emulsion.

50|$|Melting is {{a thermal}} process {{that results in}} the phase {{transition}} of a substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal energy of a substance is increased, typically with heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the melting point, at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. Molten substances generally have <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element sulfur, whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.|$|E
50|$|When the red {{cells are}} at rest or at very small shear rates, {{they tend to}} {{aggregate}} and stack together in an energetically favorable manner. The attraction is attributed to charged groups {{on the surface of}} cells and to the presence of fibrinogen and globulins. This aggregated configuration is an arrangement of cells with the least amount of deformation. With very low shear rates, the viscoelastic property of blood is dominated by the aggregation and cell deformability is relatively insignificant. As the shear rate increases the size of the aggregates begins to decrease. With a further increase in shear rate, the cells will rearrange and orient to provide channels for the plasma to pass through and for the cells to slide. In this low to medium shear rate range, the cells wiggle with respect to the neighboring cells allowing flow. The influence of aggregation properties on the viscoelasticity diminish and the influence of red cell deformability begins to increase. As shear rates become large, red blood cells will stretch or deform and align with the flow. Cell layers are formed, separated by plasma, and flow is now attributed to layers of cells sliding on layers of plasma. The cell layer allows for easier flow of blood and as such there is a <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> and reduced elasticity. The viscoelasticity of the blood is dominated by the deformability of the red blood cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{enhanced}} flow {{in carbon}} nanotubes is explained using {{a mathematical model}} that includes a depletion layer with <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> near the wall. In the limit of large tubes the model predicts no noticeable enhancement. For smaller tubes the model predicts enhancement that increases as the radius decreases. An analogy between the <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> and slip-length models shows that the term slip-length is misleading and that on surfaces which are smooth at the nanoscale it may {{be thought of as}} a length-scale associated with the size of the depletion region and viscosity ratio. The model therefore provides a physical interpretation of the classical Navier slip condition and explains why `slip-lengths' may be greater than the tube radius...|$|E

The resulting convective dynamo produces a large scale mean field that exhibits similar irregular cyclic behavior and polarity reversals, and self-consistently maintains a solar-like differential rotation. The main driver for the solar-like differential rotation (with faster rotating equator) is a net outward transport of angular momentum away from the rotation axis by the Reynolds stress, and we found that this transport is enhanced with <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> and magnetic diffusion.

It was found that the cationic polysoaps, CTAB, DTAB, and DMDAAB aggregate far below their normal cmc in the presence of Methyl Orange in aqueous solution. The cationic polysoaps exhibited an about 5 -fold decrease of the <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> {{in the presence of the}} hydrophobic anionic additives but no decrease of the <b>reduced</b> <b>viscosity</b> was found in the presence of hydrophobic nonionic additives and cationic additives (CTAB, DTAB).
