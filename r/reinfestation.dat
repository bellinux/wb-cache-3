40|$|A {{multilateral}} {{approach that}} includes both biotic and climatic data {{was developed to}} detect the main variables that affect the ecology and population dynamics of woolly apple aphid Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann). Crawlers migrated {{up and down the}} trunk mainly from spring to autumn and horizontal migration through the canopy was observed from May to August. Winter temperatures did not kill the canopy colonies, and both canopy and root colonies are the source of <b>reinfestations</b> in Mediterranean areas. Thus, control measures should simultaneously address roots and canopy. European earwigs Forficula auricularia (Linnaeus) were found to reduce the survival of overwintering canopy colonies up to June, and this can allow their later control by the parasitoid Aphelinus mali (Haldeman) from summer to fall.

No other antlparasite measures were used. Follow-up was by clinical examination and telephone interview until the end of the Trombicula season (range one to four months). No adverse effects were seen. Monthly treatment controlled trombicuiids in 15 dogs. In two dogs localised pedal <b>reinfestations</b> were controlled with additional local application of fipronil to the feet every 14 days. In one dog therapy was of no benefit. In the three cats, treatment was Initially effective, but generalised Infestations recurred after seven to 10 days. Fipronil is a safe and effective treatment for tromblculid infestations in dogs.

50|$|Biological {{methods have}} also been {{proposed}} to control whitefly infestation, and may be paired with chemical methods.

Whiteflies are also attracted by the color yellow, so yellow sticky paper can serve as traps to monitor infestations. Dead leaves or leaves that have been mostly eaten by whiteflies can be removed and burned or carefully placed in closed bins to avoid <b>reinfestation</b> and spreading of the disease.|$|E
50|$|This applies once an {{infestation}} is established. In many {{circles the}} first response to cutaneous myiasis once the breathing hole has formed, is {{to cover the}} air hole thickly with petroleum jelly. Lack of oxygen then forces the larva to the surface, where it can more easily be dealt with. In a clinical or veterinary setting {{there may not be}} time for such tentative approaches, and the treatment of choice might be more direct, with or without an incision.

50|$|Another {{method of}} control {{available}} {{is the use of}} controlled burns, however there are risks associated with this method. Principally, C. monilifera has higher moisture levels than many Australian indigenous species and therefore in Australia a higher than normal intensity fire is required for burns to be effective.

Furthermore, fire can trigger regermination from the extensive C. monilifera seed bank, potentially worsening the situation unless a program is implemented to monitor and control C. monilifera seedlings following the burn. If C. monilifera seedlings are removed, however, this can be extremely effective at exhausting the seed bank and minimising the chances of <b>reinfestation.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{catch of}} some noctuid pest species {{in a light}} trap {{operating}} for 18 months in south coastal Queensland was compared {{with the emergence of}} adults in cultures reared simultaneously in a field cage in the trapping area. Generally there was a good positive correlation between the monthly catch and the rearing results. In March 1973 the catch of most species observed was high despite a small emergence of adults, probably because much of the catch consisted of moths entering or flying over the area in connection with weather fronts. A lunar periodicity was found in the catch of most species but not in the emergence of adults in the cultures. Strong illumination, however, suppressed or delayed oviposition. Theoretically five to six generations a year can be expected in the area. None of the more abundant species are, however, adapted to both winter and summer conditions, and all are present in low numbers for some part of the year. If the weather during prolonged periods strongly departed from the long-term local average, the populations of different species could be more or less obliterated. This was, however, in most species compensated for by repeated <b>reinfestations</b> from other areas.

40|$|Background: Triatoma infestans-mediated {{transmission}} of Tripanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, remains {{as a major}} health issue in southern South America. Key factors of T. infestans prevalence in specific areas of the geographic Gran Chaco region - which extends through northern Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay - are both recurrent <b>reinfestations</b> after insecticide spraying and emerging pyrethroid-resistance {{over the past ten}} years. Among alternative control tools, the pathogenicity of entomopathogenic fungi against triatomines is already known; furthermore, these fungi have the ability to fully degrade hydrocarbons from T. infestans cuticle and to utilize them as fuel and for incorporation into cellular components. Methodology and Findings: Here we provide evidence of resistance-related cuticle differences; capillary gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analyses revealed that pyrethroid-resistant bugs have significantly larger amounts of surface hydrocarbons, peaking 56. 2 ± 6. 4 % higher than susceptible specimens. Also, a thicker cuticle was detected by scanning electron microscopy (32. 1 ± 5. 9 μm and 17. 8 ± 5. 4 μm for pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible, respectively). In laboratory bioassays, we showed that the virulence of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana against T. infestans was significantly enhanced after fungal adaptation to grow on a medium containing insect-like hydrocarbons as the carbon source, regardless of bug susceptibility to pyrethroids. We designed an attraction-infection trap based on manipulating T. infestans behavior in order to facilitate close contact with B. bassiana. Field assays performed in rural village houses infested with pyrethroid-resistant insects showed 52. 4 % bug mortality. Using available mathematical models, we predicted that further fungal applications could eventually halt infection transmission. Conclusions: This low cost, low tech, ecologically friendly methodology could help in controlling the spread of pyrethroid-resistant bugs. Facultad de Ciencias Médica...|$|R
40|$|Plantas previamente atacadas por herbívoros podem ter o seu sistema de defesa ativado. As formas de defesa podem ocorrer por diferentes rotas. Algumas das rotas desencadeadas ocorrem logo após a herbivoria, quando a planta passa a {{responder}} de forma indireta através da produção de substâncias voláteis atrativas aos inimigos naturais dos fitófagos infestantes. Uma outra rota seria a resposta direta da planta através da síntese de inibidores de proteases produzidos após a injúria, o que pode afetar o desenvolvimento e crescimento de fitófagos infestantes. As plantas, por sua vez, podem apresentar especifidade nas respostas induzidas, ou seja, as defesas podem intimidar a herbivoria posterior, porém em alguns casos as espécies re- infestantes não tem o desempenho afetado. Estudos recentes têm demonstrado mecanismos de resistência em plantas de interesse comercial contra o ataque de pragas. Plantas de morangueiro que são cultivadas em larga escala no Brasil têm sofrido sérios danos pelo ácaro-rajado Tetranychus urticae, que é praga primária para a cultura. Desse modo, o presente estudo teve como objetivo estudar a resistência induzida direta em plantas de morangueiro (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) sobre populações de T. urticae. Nos estudos experimentais foram utlizadas plantas de morangueiro limpas (controle), plantas injuriadas mecanicamente e plantas pré-infestadas por T. urticae. Para determinação dos inibidores de proteases foram utilizadas amostras de folhas limpas de cada tratamento. Baseado nestes métodos, testou-se no ensaio 1 a hipótese de que a pré-infestação de T. urticae induziria a produção de inibidores de proteases reduzindo o crescimento populacional de seus coespecíficos. No ensaio 2, estudou-se a especificidade dos compostos defensivos, testando a hipótese de que a pré-infestação de T. urticae induziria a produção de inibidores de proteases que afetariam o desenvolvimento do ácaro-vermelho Tetranychus mexicanus, uma espécie de ácaro que também ocorre em morangueiro. No ensaio 3, foi testada a hipótese de que a infestação por T. urticae nas plantas matrizes de morangueiro induziria a produção de inibidores de proteases e estes seriam translocados através dos estolões até as plantas-filhas prejudicando o desenvolvimento de T. urticae nestes propágulos. De acordo com os resultados, menor número de indíviduos de T. urticae foram encontrados em plantas previamente infestadas com o coespecífico. O ácaro T. mexicanus não teve seu desenvolvimento afetado pela resposta induzida decorrente da pré-infestação de T. urticae. A resposta da planta teve efeito contrastante a T. mexicanus, aparentemente as defesas induzidas em morangueiro não atuam em re-infestações de heteroespecíficos, pelo menos para T. mexicanus. O crescimento populacional de T. urticae também foi menor nos propágulos de morangueiro. A defesa induzida por T. urticae em plantas matrizes de morangueiro apresentou sistemicidade, através do estolão, afetando o desempenho dos fitófagos nos propágulos. Nos resultados das concentrações de inibidores de proteases, verificou-se em geral, que as mesmas variaram entre os tratamentos nos experimentos, mas não foram correlacionados ao desempenho dos fitófagos. Possivelmente, outros compostos fitoquímicos produzidos pelas plantas estejam envolvidos nas respostas induzidas por T. urticae. Estes resultados suportam a hipótese de que as plantas que apresentam defesa direta podem reduzir o desempenho de fitófagos coespecíficos na geração seguinte. Plants previously {{attacked by}} herbivores may have their defense system activated. The defense forms may occur by different routes. Some of the unleashed routes take place {{right after the}} herbivory, when the plant starts responding {{in an indirect way}} through the production of volatile substances attractive to natural enemies of the infesting phytophagous. Another route would be the direct response from the plant through the synthesis of proteinase inhibitors produced post-injury, which can affect the development and growth of the infesting phytophagous. The plants can present specificity in the induced responses, that is, the defenses may intimidate a subsequent herbivory; however, in some cases the re- infesting species do not have their performance affected. Recent studies have shown resistance mechanisms in plants of commercial interest against the attack of pests. Strawberry plants which are cultivated in large scale in Brazil have suffered serious damage by the two spotted mite Tetranychus urticae, which is a primary pest for the culture. Therefore, the present study had as an aim to study induced direct resistance in strawberry plants (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) upon the population dynamics of the two-spotted mite T. urticae. In the experimental studies clean strawberry plants (control), plants that were mechanically injured as well as plants pre-infected with the two-spotted mite T. urticae were used. In order to determine the proteinase inhibitors, samples of each treatment were used. Based on these methods, in test 1 the hypothesis that the pre-infestation of T. urticae would induce the production of proteinase inhibitors reducing the population growth of their co-specifics was tested. In test 2, the specificity of the defensive compounds was studied, testing then the hypothesis that the pre- infestation of T. urticae would induce the production of proteinase inhibitors which would affect the development of red mite Tetranychus mexicanus, a species of spider mite that also occur in strawberry plants. In test 3, the hypothesis that the infestation by T. urticae in the mother strawberry plants would induce the production of proteinase inhibitors and these would be translocated through stolons unt il the strawberry runners injuring the development of T. urticae in these daughter plants was tested. According to the results a smaller number of individuals of T. urticae were found in plants previously infected with the co-specific. The spider mite T. mexicanus did not have its development affected by the induced response due to the pre-infestation of T. urticae. The plant response had contrasting effect to T. mexicanus, apparently the induced defenses in strawberry plants do not act in <b>reinfestations</b> of hetero-specifics, ate least for T. mexicanus. The population growth of T. urticae was also smaller in the strawberry runners of strawberry plants. The induced defense by T. urticae in mother strawberry plants presented systemic defense signals through the stolon, affecting the performance of the phytophagous of the strawberry runners. In the results of the concentrations of proteinase inhibitors, one could verify that they varied among the treatments in the experiments, but were not correlated to phytophagous performance. Possibly, other phytochemicals compounds produced by the plants might be involved in the induced responses by T. urticae. These results support the hypothesis that the plants that present direct defense can reduce the performance of co-specific phytophagous in the following generation...|$|R
50|$|Moths {{often do}} not even need a lure, as common glue traps {{sometimes}} work well {{to reduce the number}} of adults.However, the efficiency of such traps is highly doubtful as they only capture males, and usually only a fraction of these, while adult females, eggs and larvae are unaffected, enabling a possible <b>reinfestation.</b> Moths can be deterred from the area by using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. It is most effective to treat the infestation by eliminating the source and any affected food items, interrupting their mating processes, and repelling them from the areas where dried food and grains are kept. Thus it is recommended to first eliminate the source of infestation followed by larvae, eggs and eventual moths in the environment.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and <b>reinfestation</b> is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling Cotton Thistle. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|E
5000|$|Detection methodsInfestations by C. partellus can be {{detected}} by walking through crops looking for the characteristic physical appearance of a deteriorated host plant {{by the presence of}} deadhearts.

Trap plants such as Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) may also be used. These plants draw the adult female away from the crop and more eggs are laid on the trap plant than on the host plant crop, and this leads to poor development of larvae. This method is also known as [...] "push-pull".Also, marking sure to destroy all residue of infested maize to ensure the death of all larvae would decrease the chances of <b>reinfestation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have found}} that when {{separated}} from their host, badger fleas jump repeatedly {{in an effort to}} reconnect. Many voided their gut contents which enabled them to leap significantly further. If they failed to find a suitable host they moved towards the light (the sett entrance) before becoming quiescent. This put them in a position to intercept a badger if one entered the sett. They were stimulated into further bouts of leaping by an increase in the level of carbon dioxide and jumped towards the source of the gas. In a research study they were found to respond to exhaled air by running and jumping in its direction. The most vigorous response was found to be made to a combination of a carbon dioxide source, a piece of dark-coloured card and movement in their vicinity. It was found that 50% of fleas were still alive after 35 days of separation from the host and, as badgers have a habit of moving between different setts, they would not avoid <b>reinfestation</b> by fleas if they returned to an empty sett within a few weeks.|$|E
50|$|Although {{not seen}} when {{groceries}} are purchased, some products {{have the possibility}} of being infested prior to being placed in the pantry. A periodic check of susceptible foodstuffs is necessary, especially in summer months when most insects are more active. In the event an infestation is discovered, steps must be taken to eradicate the insects. Controlling an infestation is a lengthy process and insects may still be seen, albeit in dwindling numbers, for several weeks. All infested items, as well as uninfested items, must be removed from shelves, thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed. After vacuuming, the waste containing the infested material must be removed and discarded. Items should be checked for beetles, larvae, and pupae; all food items must be inspected, as well, and special attention must be paid to items rarely used. The infested items may either be discarded, heated, or frozen to kill the insects. If the food is chosen to be discarded, the item must be completely removed from surrounding premises to prevent <b>reinfestation.</b> Freezing products for three to four days or heating them to about 130 to 140 °F for 30 to 40 minutes will rid the product of the pests. Decorative ornaments and objects made with plant material and seed located in the vicinity of stored products will increase the risk of reinfestation; insects can feed on those items until they locate stored products. These items should also be thrown out or disinfected by freezing or heating.Cleaning the area where the infested products were found is advisable, as well. Cleaning with bleach or ammonia, however, will not help with the eradication of the pests. Using a vacuum cleaner to clean the area thoroughly, especially in cracks and corners where insects may hide, will decrease the chances of <b>reinfestation.</b> Because food will be stored in that area again, pesticides are not a good method of eradication. Pesticides can leave a residue that can contaminate food products stored near it. Also, once a pest is inside the container, the pesticides have no effect. If the infestation is so severe that pesticides are the only way to contain the problem, a professional should be contacted immediately. Do not try to apply pesticides to any area where food is stored for human or animal consumption. Contamination can occur and cause illness or more severe conditions. Proper storage and cleanliness are the only ways to prevent an infestation from occurring. Sanitation is the key to prevention and eradication of any pests.|$|E
50|$|Present in a {{majority}} of colonies, the tineid moth (belongs to an undescribed genus) {{is the most common}} pest of the red paper wasps. The moth lays its eggs and then these eggs hatch into larvae that can burrow from cell to cell and prey on meconia and wasp pupae. While only 0.47% of the brood is lost to predation, the wasps perform many defense mechanisms to protect their nests from these infestations. Adult wasps attempt to remove and kill moth eggs and larvae by chewing down the edges of cells, coating the cells with an oral secretion that gives the nest a dark brownish appearance. The colonies then do not reuse these infested combs to raise another brood. The wasps also clip disused combs, reducing the rate of <b>reinfestation</b> by moths. In some instances, though, the comb clipping is also used to provide room for the construction of new combs. One of the key reasons the Polistes canadensis nests across multiple combs rather than building a single comb like {{much of the rest of}} its genus is as a defense mechanism against the infestation of these moths. The average amount of nesting material required to build a new cell in a comb decreases as the number of cells in the comb increases. Therefore, there are many inefficiencies associated with constructing several smaller combs rather than single larger combs like much of the rest of the Polistes genus does. For example, with the construction of multiple combs, comes the need to build a separate petiole for each comb. By building multiple combs and failing to reutilize them, the costs Polistes canadensis pay to defend its nests are significant and quite large in terms of energy expended in nest construction per brood reared. Other common parasites include three species of the obligate hymenopterous parasitoid: Seminota, Toechorychus albimaculatus and the Pachysomides iheringi. 4.4% of the red paper wasp pupae are lost to these Hymenoptera.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the origin of Triatoma infestans <b>reinfestation</b> and study its dynamics following spraying with deltamethrin inside and around 94 houses in three rural communities in northwestern Argentina. The effectiveness of the spraying was evaluated immediately after the houses were sprayed and two months later. In addition, five residual peridomiciliary foci were found and sprayed, as well as three preexisting ones that had not been sprayed. To monitor <b>reinfestation,</b> biosensors were placed in the houses and each family was also asked to capture triatomines and keep them in plastic bags; in addition, triatomines were searched for in and around houses, using an aerosol that dislodged them from their hiding places. Selective sprayings were carried out only where a colony of T. infestans was found. During the 30 months of follow-up, the percentage of houses in which any T. infestans were captured varied between 3 % and 9 %. In six houses, T. infestans were captured during more than one evaluation. The number of peridomiciliary areas found to be infested (19) was double the number of infested houses (9). Colonies of T. infestans were found only in the peridomiciliary areas, where the number of T. infestans captured was six times higher than in the houses. Chickens were the host most frequently associated with peridomiciliary foci. This area was the origin and principal source of <b>reinfestation.</b> To reduce the speed of <b>reinfestation</b> and the frequency with which sprayings are needed, the following environmental and chemical control methods must be combined in the peridomiciliary area: reduce the number of hiding places of triatomines; restrict the raising of birds to structures that cannot be colonized by triatomines; apply an insecticide that is less likely to be degraded by exposure to the elements, or perform a second spraying 6 to 12 months after the first; and employ a device for early detection of the presence of T. infestans around houses...|$|E

We calculated scabies incidence, bacterial superin-fection prevalence, and <b>reinfestation</b> prevalence during 14 – 365 days after first diagnosis. We used log binomial regression to calculate incidence ratios for scabies by age, sex, and county. Medical record review identified 1, 139 children with scabies (incidence 29. 3 / 1, 00...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The spatio-temporal <b>reinfestation</b> {{patterns}} by Triatoma infestans {{following a}} blanket insecticide spraying {{in the rural}} community of Amamá in northwestern Argentina were analyzed using a geographic information system, satellite imagery, and spatial statistics. Domestic and peridomestic <b>reinfestation</b> by triatomine bugs was monitored from 1993 to 1997. Triatoma infestans was detected {{at least once in}} 75 % of 2, 110 sites evaluated. The prevalence of sites positive at least once for T. infestans during the study period increased sharply from 1993 − 1995 (0. 6 − 2. 9 %) to November 1997 (32 %). The initial source of T. infestans was a pig corral in southern Amamá one year post-spraying. Subsequent infestations were clustered around this initial focus at a distance of approximately 400 meters starting in 1995. In 1996, clustering was maximized in sites within the same or in neighboring compounds at distances of 25 − 175 meters. An effective control program on the community level will be based on the spraying of actual epicenters and sites within 450 meters of these epicenters to prevent the propagation of T. infestans...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of scabies has been progressively increasing {{during the last}} decade. The contrast of clinical manifestations seen in children and adults can make the diagnosis difficult in infants. Up-to-date treatment regimes described provide effective results and should be provided for all family members and close contacts. Only through such an epidemiological approach can ‘ping pong’ <b>reinfestation</b> be avoided, thus reducing the rate of spread and {{incidence of}} scabies in our society...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundScabies, {{a highly}} pruritic and {{contagious}} mite infestation of the skin, is endemic among tropical regions and causes a substantial proportion of skin disease among lower-income countries.

40|$|Blood-sucking triatomine bugs are the vectors of Chagas disease, a {{potentially}} fatal illness that affects millions in Latin America. With no vaccines available, prevention heavily depends on controlling household-infesting triatomines. Insecticide-spraying campaigns have effectively reduced incidence, but persistent household <b>reinfestation</b> {{can result in}} disease re-emergence. What, then, is the best strategy to keep houses free of triatomines and thus interrupt disease transmission in the long run? We reviewed published evidence to (i) assess the effectiveness of insecticide-based vector control, gauging the importance of reinfestation; (ii) compare the efficacy of programme-based (with households periodically visited by trained staff) and community-based (with residents reporting suspect vectors found in their homes) surveillance strategies; and (iii) evaluate the performance of alternative vector-detection methods. The results confirm that insecticide-based vector control is highly effective, but also that persistent house <b>reinfestation</b> is a general trend across Latin America. Surveillance systems are significantly more effective when householders report suspect bugs than when programme staff search houses, either manually or using vector-detection devices. Our results clearly {{support the view that}} long-term vector surveillance will be necessary for sustained Chagas disease control – and that community participation can substantially contribute to this aim...|$|E
40|$|Extract] It can be {{tempting to}} examine the global spread of pediculosis in terms of {{transmission}} risks because most countries have experienced increases in the detection of Pediculus capitis since the 1900 s. Reducing transmission {{is arguably the most}} important factor controlling the spread of infestations. However, the spread of emergent and resurgent diseases due to increased population movement is well documented and pediculosis is no exception. Of far more importance is the issue of <b>reinfestation,</b> which is a common problem in the control of pediculosis. <b>Reinfestation</b> is a highly problematic social and economic transmission issue that even effective pediculicides cannot easily resolve. This chapter considers factors that have a bearing on the transmission of head lice. This has not been a clear-cut topic and there has been difficulty in estimating the importance of head-to-head versus fomite-to-head transmission. This has resulted in some time being invested during the last decade to determine the mechanisms in P. capitis transmission so that control programs do not squander limited resources. Some of these studies are field-based while others involve laboratory experimentation under controlled conditions. As can be expected, results from these two sources do not always agree...|$|E
