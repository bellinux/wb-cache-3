5|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, Srinivasa Sastri {{successfully}} pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 of the Immigration and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Bill which empowered South African immigration officers and boards to cancel <b>registration</b> <b>certificates.</b> Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later {{merged with the}} South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn. The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions of Indians in and around Durban.|$|E

25|$|The label was a wet {{application}} type soaked {{in cold water}} which was then applied to the glass, then squeegeed with a clean sponge to remove remaining gum on the label.

25|$|The last coal {{was drawn}} at Birley East on 15 October 1943 but {{the life of}} the pit was not quite at an end. In December 1943 Ernest Bevin, the Minister of Labour {{announced}} to the House of Commons at a ballot was to be held, from time to time, in which those men whose National Service <b>Registration</b> <b>Certificates</b> end with the chosen number would be transferred to the mines. This gave rise to the term Bevin Boy. Many colliers had the new trainees alongside the production unit but at Birley they were able to use the recently closed facilities. Accommodation was provided in Nissen huts on Beighton Road, the first occupants arriving in early 1944.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, the United States {{instituted a}} peace-time draft with the Universal Military Training and Service Act (also called the Selective Service Act), which {{required}} all male American citizens {{to register with}} a local draft board upon reaching the age of 18. In 1965, Congress amended the Act to prohibit the willful destruction of [...] "draft cards" [...] or <b>registration</b> <b>certificates.</b> These were small white cards bearing the registrant's identifying information, the date and place of registration, and his Selective Service number, which indicated his state of registration, local board, birth year, and his chronological position in the local board's classification record.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{initially}} some violence {{during the first}} year of the programme, where landowners manhandled some officials and harassed bargadars who came forward to record their names. However, with increased governmental and collective support, these incidents reduced. The peasant organizations of the ruling political parties worked along with village-level administration to encourage registration. This thwarted the collusion between landlords and local officials and prevented intimidation. [...] "Settlement camps," [...] which were already being used by land reform officials to maintain and update land records, were actively used as tools of registration. <b>Registration</b> <b>certificates</b> were issued on the spot.|$|E
2500|$|The Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (APGAW) {{released}} {{the results of}} its [...] "inquiry into the health and welfare issues surrounding the breeding of pedigree dogs" [...] in November. The report mentioned the [...] "serious problem with the health and welfare of many pedigree dogs" [...] {{and how they can}} be caused by current breeding practices. It made various recommendations: Breed standards should be based less on [...] "visual aesthetics" [...] and more on whether the dogs would be [...] "fit for purpose". Where available for particular breeds, health tests should be strongly recommended and individuals not tested should have their test status reflected in <b>registration</b> <b>certificates</b> and should not be eligible for champion titles.|$|E
2500|$|First, the law was, to the Court, unquestionably {{within the}} [...] "broad and sweeping" [...] {{constitutional}} powers of Congress under Article I to [...] "raise and support armies" [...] by [...] "classify and conscript manpower for military service". Under the second prong of the test, {{the issuance of}} <b>registration</b> <b>certificates</b> {{was regarded as a}} [...] "legitimate and substantial administrative aid" [...] in the functioning of the draft system, as were laws that insured the [...] "continuing availability" [...] of issued draft cards. The Court rejected O’Brien’s characterization of the draft cards as nothing more than a superfluous notification of registration. Instead, the cards advanced [...] "the smooth and proper functioning of the system" [...] through functions such as providing proof of registration, facilitating contact between the registrant and draft board, reminding the registrant of the need to notify the board of changes of address, and further preventing fraud or forgery. [...] Third, the registration and raising of troops was unrelated to the suppression of speech. And fourth, the Court saw [...] "no alternative means" [...] by which the government could ensure that draft cards would continue to be available than a law that prohibited their willful destruction.|$|E
