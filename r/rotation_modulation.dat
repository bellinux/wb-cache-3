40|$|We have {{developed}} a relativistic model for pulsar radio emission and polarization by taking into account of detailed geometry of emission region, <b>rotation</b> and <b>modulation.</b> The sparks activity on the polar cap leads to plasma columns in the emission region and modulated emission. By considering relativistic plasma bunches streaming out along the rotating dipolar field lines as source of curvature radiation, deduced the polarization state of the radiation field {{in terms of the}} Stokes parameters. We have simulated a set of typical pulse profiles, and analyzed the role of viewing geometry, <b>rotation</b> and <b>modulation</b> on the pulsar polarization profiles. Our simulations explain most of the diverse behaviors of polarization generally found in pulsar radio profiles. We show that both the `antisymmetric' and `symmetric' types of circular polarization are possible within the frame work of curvature radiation.

The characteristics of these signals were so unusual that their identity as a natural planetary emission was questioned at first. Subsequent analysis has shown, however, that the n bursts are modulated at the 17. 24 -hour Uranus rotation period and are, therefore, planetary in origin. It is shown, in addition, that the typical bandwidth and time scale for the bursts are about 5 kHz and 250 ms, respectively.

40|$|<b>Rotation</b> <b>modulation</b> is an {{effective}} method to enhance the accuracy of an inertial navigation system (INS) by modulating the gyroscope drifts and accelerometer bias errors into periodically varying components. The typical RINS drives the inertial measurement unit (IMU) rotation along the vertical axis and the horizontal sensors’ errors are modulated, however, the azimuth angle error {{is closely related to}} vertical gyro drift, and the vertical gyro drift also should be modulated effectively. In this paper, a new rotation strategy in a dual-axis rotational INS (RINS) is proposed and the drifts of three gyros could be modulated, respectively. Experimental results from a real dual-axis RINS demonstrate that the maximum azimuth angle error is decreased from 0. 04 ° to less than 0. 01 ° during 1 h. Most importantly, the changing of rotation strategy leads to some additional errors in the velocity which is unacceptable in a high-precision INS.
