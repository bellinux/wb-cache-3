5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> {{to replace}} him. The {{election}} included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women. Clinton {{won the election}} in November 2000 with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent.|$|E
5|$|In January 1999, President Bill Clinton eased travel {{restrictions}} and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission {{to play an}} exhibition game in Cuba. Angelos met with Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, to discuss a potential exhibition. Bud Selig, the MLB Commissioner, allowed for {{the exploration of the}} series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA. The MLBPA insisted on a second game to be held in the United States. A contingent of United States Representatives, including Ros-Lehtinen, Robert Menendez, Dan Burton, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, and <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio,</b> lobbied Fehr to try to block the series.|$|E
5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio,</b> a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E
50|$|For the 2010 {{election}} season, Diana {{expressed interest}} in pursuing the post of Lieutenant Governor of New York on <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio's</b> ticket. He has also {{expressed interest in}} running in the United States Senate special election in New York, 2010 against incumbent Kirsten Gillibrand.|$|R
50|$|After {{earning a}} B.A. in history in 1999, McHenry {{worked for the}} media {{consulting}} firm DCI/New Media, in Washington, D.C. He was involved in <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio's</b> campaign against Hillary Clinton during the November 2000 United States Senate election in New York; his main project was running a Web site, NotHillary.com. In 2012, he received an Honorary M.B.A. in Entrepreneurship from Yorktown University.|$|R
50|$|Brooks was {{considered}} a potential Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 2006, as a running mate for former Governor of Massachusetts William Weld. Weld instead chose New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs (politician) as his running mate, but later withdrew from {{the race for the}} Republican nomination. Brooks was also a contender to be <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio's</b> running mate New York gubernatorial election, 2010. She was also mentioned as a potential candidate to run for the seat representing New York's 29th congressional district to fill the seat vacated by the Eric Massa who resigned. In 2012, Brooks ran unsuccessfully as the Republican nominee in the 25th congressional district against long-time incumbent Representative Louise Slaughter, losing by 14 points.|$|R
25|$|Suffolk County {{had long}} been a Republican bastion in New York State. U.S. Congressman <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio,</b> who opposed Hillary Clinton in the 2000 Senate race, was from Suffolk County. However, recent {{elections}} have turned the county more toward the Democrats. In 2003, Democrat Steve Levy was elected county executive, ending longtime Republican control. In 2001, Democrat Thomas Spota was elected District Attorney, and ran unopposed in 2005. Although Suffolk voters gave George H. W. Bush a victory here in 1992, the county voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and continued the trend by giving Al Gore an 11-percent victory in the county in 2000. 2004 Democratic candidate John Kerry won by a much smaller margin of one percent, in 2008 Democratic candidate Barack Obama won by a slightly larger 4.4 percent margin, 52%-47%. In 2016, Republican candidate Donald Trump won Suffolk County by a 6.9 percent margin after absentees, marking the largest margin of victory for the Republicans since 1988.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the pardon}} by President Bill Clinton of several convicted {{members of the}} New Square Hassidic community, Greenwald was interviewed by several media outlets {{regarding}} his opinion and even {{his role in the}} affair. The fact that Greenwald had ties to the New Square community, was a former business associate of Marc Rich, another person pardoned by Clinton {{at the end of his}} term and had been questioned by the FBI during its investigation into the pardons, made his opinions regarding the incident highly sought after by media outlets. On March 12, 2001, on The Edge, Paula Zahn conducted a 10-minute interview with Greenwald. He also appeared on The O'Reilly Factor on October 10, 2002, when he was cross examined by host Bill O'Reilly for several minutes regarding the affair. In both interviews, Greenwald conceded that the New Square community probably voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in her race against <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> for U.S. Senate in 2000 with some expectation that some consideration be given to pardoning the members of the New Square community. However, he steadfastly maintained that there had been no quid pro quo or agreement to exchange votes for a pardon.|$|E

500|$|The United States Senate {{election}} in New York in 2000 {{was held on}} November 7, 2000. [...] Hillary Rodham Clinton, then First Lady of the United States and the first First Lady to run for political office, defeated Congressman <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio.</b> The general election coincided with the U.S. presidential election.|$|E
500|$|State Republican leaders, {{who until}} now had avoided talk of {{replacements}} for Giuliani should he not run, now gave {{more attention to}} the matter, with the state party convention coming up on May 30. [...] Former possible contenders <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> and Pete King immediately indicated they were available; other names mentioned included Wall Street financier Theodore J. Forstmann and Governor Pataki, although the latter indicated no interest.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bill Powers, {{chair of the}} New York Republican State Committee, said the report [...] "once again makes us question" [...] the believability of Clinton, and Congressman <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio,</b> her Republican {{opponent}} in the Senate election, said [...] "We believe that character counts in public service." [...] New York Times columnist Safire updated his description of Hillary Clinton to [...] "habitual prevaricator", saying [...] "the evidence {{that she has been}} lying all along is damning" [...] and comparing her dark side to that of Richard Nixon, in whose White House he had once worked.|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{became the}} {{presumptive}} Republican nominee, and by April 1999 {{had formed a}} formal exploratory committee for a Senate run. [...] There were still possible Republican primary opponents. <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio,</b> a Congressman representing Suffolk County on Long Island, was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16; he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican primary voters. [...] In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani. [...] Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed to despite frustration that Giuliani had still not officially {{announced that he was}} running; Lazio said, [...] "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I think he needs to get into this race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate." [...] Nassau County Congressman Pete King also considered running and had raised some funds.|$|E
500|$|While {{previous}} Republican nominee {{candidates and}} fellow Long Island Congressmen <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> and Pete King had both indicated {{an interest in}} replacing Giuliani, upon Giuliani's withdrawal the state party quickly rallied around Lazio, who had more campaign funds and who {{was viewed as a}} potentially strong candidate. [...] In particular, Governor Pataki — who never cared much for Giuliani to begin with — was strongly in favor of Lazio, and praised him as [...] "fresh, unencumbered challenger" [...] to Clinton. [...] This also caused a shuffle in New York's unique third-party ballot-line alignments: the Liberal Party of New York, which was previously set to run Giuliani (whom they had supported in all three of his mayoral races), now switched to Clinton, while the Conservative Party of New York, which had previously been loath to endorse the socially liberal Giuliani (and was set to nominate former Westchester Congressman Joe DioGuardi) lined up behind Lazio. [...] Lazio accepted the unanimous approval of delegates to the Republican Party state convention at a hotel ballroom in Buffalo on May 30.|$|E

2500|$|Claudia Rosett, a {{journalist}} with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a weekly columnist for Forbes, questioned {{the source of}} the funding for the project. Some U.S. politicians such as Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who is an Independent Democrat, and Republicans Peter King and <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> (N.Y.-2), asked for an investigation of the group's finances, especially its foreign funding, despite the fact that fundraising for the project had not yet begun. King said: [...] "The people who are involved {{in the construction of the}} mosque are refusing to say where their [...] funding is going to come from." [...] Lazio said: [...] "Let's have transparency. If they're foreign governments, we ought to know about it. If they're radical organizations, we ought to know about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|New York Republicans who {{criticized the}} plan {{included}} former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani (a [...] "desecration; Nobody would allow {{something like that}} at Pearl Harbor ... Let's have some respect for who died there and why they died there."), former NY Governor George Pataki, Congressman Peter King (R-N.Y.; ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee; [...] "offensive to so many people"), and former NY Congressman and current NY gubernatorial candidate <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio.</b> NY gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino (R) noted: [...] "The vast majority of New Yorkers and Americans have rejected their idea. If a bridge was their intent, why jam it down our throats? Why {{does it have to}} be right there?"; he said that if he were elected Governor of New York, he would use the power of eminent domain to stop construction of the center and instead build a war memorial in its place.|$|E
2500|$|Cisneros {{was well}} praised {{for his work}} as HUD Secretary. [...] Judith Evans {{reported}} in the Washington Post that both critics and supporters of Cisneros said he never lacked passion for his job {{and that he was}} able to make changes at the margin that made HUD a more effective housing provider. Rep. <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> (R-NY), chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community opportunity in 1996 said Cisneros displayed [...] "the correct balance of advocacy on behalf of the president and a willingness to think creatively and outside the box in terms of solutions." [...] In his 1999 book, Inside Game/Outside Game: Winning Strategies for Saving Urban America, urban policy consultant David Rusk wrote “…in my view, (Cisneros was) the most successful of the ten secretaries of Housing and Urban Development since the cabinet agency was formed in 1965.” Clinton said Cisneros was a brilliant public servant, and additionally said that people had no idea how much he contributed to the government.|$|E
2500|$|Portman {{has said}} that his proudest moments as a U.S. Representative were [...] "when we passed the {{balanced}} budget agreement and the welfare reform bill." [...] As a congressman, Portman traveled to Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Mexico. During {{his time in the}} House, Portman began assisting prominent Republican candidates prepare for debates by standing in for their opponents in practice debates. He has taken on the role of Lamar Alexander (for Bob Dole in 1996), Al Gore (for George W. Bush in 2000), Hillary Clinton (for <b>Rick</b> <b>Lazio</b> in 2000), Joe Lieberman (for Dick Cheney in 2000), John Edwards (for Cheney in 2004), and Barack Obama (for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012). His portrayals mimic not only the person's point of view but also their mannerisms, noting for instance that he listened to Obama's audiobook reading to study his pattern of speech.|$|E
