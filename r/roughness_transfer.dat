40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{effort has}} been spent at a European level to establish comprehensive methods for the experimental assessment of rolling noise emission of rail-bound vehicles and tracks. This work was concentrated in the European METARAIL and STAIRRS projects. The objective of these was to improve the accuracy and the reproducibility of pass-by noise measurements compared to the standards that were current at that time. A further aim was to develop experimental methods separately to identify the contributions to rolling noise of the vehicles and the tracks. In these projects, measurement methods were developed that could determine the combined wheel/rail roughness and the ‘transfer functions’ for the vehicle and the track, that is, the separate noise contributions per unit roughness. The <b>roughness</b> and <b>transfer</b> function spectra provide a powerful basis by which vehicles and tracks can be characterized by measurement, to a high extent, independent of the running speed and site conditions. Such {{a description of the}} track and rolling stock allows the prediction of rolling noise spectra for different combinations of vehicles and track from those at which the characteristics have been measured. The measurement effort is limited; only straightforward one-third octave band measurements of pass-by sound pressure and vertical railhead vibration are needed. This paper describes the method, giving the derivation of the calculation by which the <b>roughness</b> levels, <b>transfer</b> function spectra levels and the vibration decay rates in the track are determined from the measured quantities. Typical results are shown. Among other applications, the method allows fast assessment of wheel roughness for whole vehicles or trains, speed-independent assessment of the effectiveness of track and vehicle noise control measures and the separation of rolling noise from noise due to other sources...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} and phase transformation of oxide scale in cooling process (after hot rolling) of rolled microalloyed steels affect tribological features of rolled strip and downstream process, and the produced steel surface quality.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{roughness}} on the directional spectral emissivity {{as well as}} the directional and hemispherical total emissivities was systematically studied for the precious metals silver, gold, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and iridium in order to avoid or minimise the effect of oxidation and other chemical reactions. The microtopography of these surfaces, which were mechanically treated by rolling, turning, grinding, lapping, and polishing, and subjected to an appropriate thermal treatment to remove crystal structure defects caused by roughening, was characterised by roughness measurements yielding roughness profiles and their statistical characteristics such as roughness height, <b>roughness</b> <b>transfer</b> length, and average slope of surface elements. The emis-sivities were measured by radiometric techniques in the wavelength range 2. 5 mm to 51 mm and in the angular range 08 to 758 at a temperature of 150 8 C. The results of the emissivity and roughness measurements are discussed within the scope of the existing theories for the emissivity of rough surfaces. It was found that roughnesses with heights smaller than a fraction 0. 01 of the wavelength can still affect the radiative properties of the surface. However, the emissivity does not monotoni-cally increase with the roughness height but rather correlates with the slope of parts of the surface profile. For the same metal with different surface finish, the directional total emissivity was observed to vary by at most a factor of 20. These changes are much larger than those caused by structural defects due to roughening and should be attributed to the surface topography. ...|$|E
