5|$|As {{a result}} of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys –Hungarian-speaking free warriors {{cultivating}} communal lands– were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13thcentury they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the count of the Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârţa was established in the early 13thcentury, Andrew II ordered that the strip of land <b>running</b> <b>up</b> to the mountains between the rivers Olt, Cârţişoara and Arpaş be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.|$|E

5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. <b>Running</b> <b>up</b> to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Edward {{had been}} living a truly extravagant lifestyle, {{including}} extensive gambling, resulting in his <b>running</b> <b>up</b> debts of some £40,000, which in 1683 forced him to sell many of his estates in Wiltshire. Over the next two years, Edward incurred further debts of around £38,000 (£5,270,000) and in 1686 was finally forced to sell his remaining lands in the south-west, including Farleigh Hungerford Castle, to Sir Henry Bayntun, who purchased them for £56,000 (£7,750,000). Bayntun lived in the castle for a few years, {{until his death in}} 1691.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E

5|$|The Tories {{finished}} with 112seats to the Liberals' 105, while both the CCF and Social Credit gained seats in Western Canada and {{finished with}} 25 and 19seats respectively. Nine cabinet ministers, including Howe, Marler, Garson, Campney and Harris were defeated. Though the Liberals outpolled the Tories by over 100,000votes, most of those votes were wasted <b>running</b> <b>up</b> huge margins in Quebec. St. Laurent could have constitutionally hung onto power until defeated in the House, but he chose not to, and John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar <b>running</b> <b>up</b> through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The public outcry, {{anticipated}} by the {{consultancy report}} for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, was to become reality. With the imminent threat of demolition, the local community rallied to save pier, to widespread media coverage.

5|$|When fielding, Barnes {{stationed}} {{himself as}} close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point. The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in The Invincibles success: Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler <b>running</b> <b>up,</b> but equally important {{was the fact that the}} knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} <b>running</b> <b>up</b> to 1890 the Prince of Wales {{had taken to}} visiting Doncaster Racecourse for the Doncaster Cup. In {{previous}} years he had stayed at Brantingham Thorpe with his friend Sir Christopher Sykes, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Beverley. Sykes had run into financial difficulties and {{could not afford to}} host Edward, and Tranby Croft, home to Arthur Wilson and family, became the venue. After consulting with the prince, the Wilsons also invited some of Edward's inner circle, including Sykes, Gordon-Cumming and the prince's courtiers: the equerry Tyrwhitt Wilson, Lord Coventry, Lord Edward Somerset, Captain Arthur Somerset—his cousin—and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams, along with their wives. Also accompanying the party was Lieutenant Berkeley Levett, a brother officer to Gordon-Cumming in the Scots Guards and a friend of the Wilson family.|$|E
5|$|On senior day in Tuscaloosa, Alabama dipped down {{to college}} football's Football Championship Subdivision and {{defeated}} the Mocs of UT-Chattanooga 45–0. After being stopped {{on their first}} possession, Alabama reached the end zone on the next five consecutive possessions in <b>running</b> <b>up</b> a 35–0 lead in the first half. First-quarter touchdowns included a 2-yard Trent Richardson run, a 25-yard Mark Ingram run, and a 19-yard Julio Jones reception from Greg McElroy. In the second quarter, touchdowns were scored by Javier Arenas on a 66-yard punt return and on a 40-yard Ingram run. With the only third quarter points coming on a 41-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal, Bama's final points of the afternoon came on a 21-yard Roy Upchurch touchdown run in the fourth.|$|E

5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries <b>running</b> <b>up</b> to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free <b>running</b> <b>up</b> to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{and colleagues}} {{interpreted}} {{the presence of}} feathers on Velociraptor as evidence against {{the idea that the}} larger, flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size. Furthermore, they noted that quill knobs are almost never found in flightless bird species today, and that their presence in Velociraptor (presumed to have been flightless due to its relatively large size and short forelimbs) is evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly, making Velociraptor and other large members of this family secondarily flightless, though it is possible the large wing feathers inferred in the ancestors of Velociraptor had a purpose other than flight. The feathers of the flightless Velociraptor may have been used for display, for covering their nests while brooding, or for added speed and thrust when <b>running</b> <b>up</b> inclined slopes.|$|E
60|$|The {{meeting of}} {{parliament}} {{was a great}} relief to Endymion. Besides his office, he had now the House of Commons to occupy him.
