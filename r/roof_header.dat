It assumes {{the shape of the}} cavity and remains intact {{over the life of the}} vehicle, blocking noise, air, and water paths. 1 Structural foam can also provide stiffness to hollow body sections and joints. A bending test found that a tube filled with a lowdensity foam of 3 pcf (pounds per cubic foot) provided nearly twice the bending strength of the unfilled tube. 1 Plastic foam can be used to help increase safety in rollover accidents by enhancing the structural support necessary to prevent roof crush; a structural failure that kills 10, 000 people on the roads every year. 2 • A roof crush simulation aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of foam found that filling the B-pillar ring, B-pillars, and rear <b>roof</b> <b>header</b> with foam raised the strength of the roof by 72 %, as compared to hollow steel components. In fact, filling only the upper portion of the B-pillars (see picture above), which carry most of the roof-crush load, with foam resulted in a substantial 14 % strength improvement. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper – {{which is}} based on a recent {{presentation}} by Giri Nammalwar et al. to the 2011 SIMULIA Customer Conference in Barcelona, Spain – presents a highly automated process for Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) of a vehicle program to achieve weight reduction while balancing the performance for Crash, Body NVH, Full vehicle NVH and Durability attributes. The full vehicle automated MDO process development resulted in tools and techniques that provided a significant time reduction compared to the conventional process resulting in a 8 week execution time. The activity of an automated process development was based on the foundation of scalability and modularity. The focus was to create an automated process that could cut down the amount of resources that need to be engaged on full-time basis for executing an MDO project. The emphasis was to capitalize on the existing technologies for both software and hardware, to enhance the technology as needed and to integrate different tools to fully automate the Ford MDO process. This process was developed to be highly scalable by maintaining the modularity of the software tools and enable seamless integration into Ford's Product Development Process. In order to test the efficacy of this automated process and to fine tune its requirements, the MDO process was implemented on a production vehicle program. This process relied on CAE models to cut down significant time as it is always easier to incorporate changes at CAE level as compared to CAD. The disciplines identified were Vehicle NVH, Body NVH, Safety and Durability. Critical shapes and sections at A, B, C, & D pillars, <b>roof</b> <b>header</b> and rocker, weld pitch at key locations and 60 BIW (Body in White, i. e. body sheet metal structure) component gages were included as parameters and applied directly on the crash model.

40|$|Tubular {{products}} have very important applications in various areas {{especially in the}} transportation industries. For instance, {{in the structure of}} cars there are various tubular products like <b>roof</b> <b>headers,</b> engine cradles, <b>roof</b> rails and frame rails with complex geometries which most of them need multiple steps like tube drawing, tube bending and hydroforming for their production. Based on the recent studies by this group, it was proven that in most of the structural tubular parts in the cars it was not necessary to have constant thickness along the axial direction of tube and it will be considered as overdesign and the overall weight of structures can be reduced considerably by using variable thickness tubes. In this paper, the variable thickness tube drawing and its applications in the tube bending and hydroforming applications were studied. The results showed that this process can have important role in reduction of defective parts in the production of complex tubes by the tube hydroforming method. However especial considerations should be taken into account in the design of thickness distribution along axial direction of these kinds of tubes to avoid problems in the drawing step and as well in the bending and hydroforming steps. 9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

5000|$|The {{removable}} roof {{consists of two}} carbon fiber panels, weighing 6 kg each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar {{to compensate for the}} loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the A-pillars, windshield <b>header,</b> <b>roof</b> panels, and rear window area. The car has a [...] base price. With a total weight of 1625 kg it's only 50 kg heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars).|$|R
