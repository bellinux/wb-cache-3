40|$|Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No. 136, Impairment of Assets, {{was issued}} in 2005. The {{standard}} requires public listed companies {{to report their}} non-current assets at no more than their recoverable amount. When the value of impaired assets is recovered, or partly recovered, FRS 136 requires the impairment charges to be reversed to its new recoverable amount. This study tests whether the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> losses by Malaysian firms is more closely associated with economic reasons or reporting incentives. The sample of this study consists of 182 public companies listed on Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) that reported reversals of their impairment charges during the period 2006 - 2009. These firms are matched with firms which do not reverse impairment {{on the basis of}} industrial classification and size. In the year of reversal, this study finds that the reversal firms are more profitable (before reversals) than their matched firms. On average, the Malaysian stock market values the reversals of impairment losses positively. These results suggest that the reversals generally reflect increases {{in the value of the}} previously impaired assets. After partitioning firms that are likely to manage earnings and those that are not, this study finds that there are some Malaysian firms which reverse the impairment charges to manage earnings. Their reversals are not value-relevant, and are negatively associated with future firm performance. On the other hand, the reversals of firms which are deemed not to be earnings managers are positively associated with both future firm performance and current stock price performance, and this is the dominant motivation for the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> charges in Malaysia. In further analysis, this study provides evidence that the opportunistic reversals are also associated with other earnings management manifestations, namely abnormal working capital accruals and the motivation to avoid earnings declines. In general, the findings suggest that the fair value measurement in impairment standard provides useful information to the users of financial statements...|$|E

After giving {{an overview of the}} general approaches to the subsequent measurement of financial instruments and some background on the development of IAS 39, this paper first {{deals with the}} current provisions of IAS 39. The paper then presents and discusses the proposed changes to subsequent measurement as suggested by the Exposure Draft on proposed amendments to IAS 32 „Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation“ and IAS 39 „Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement“ (ED) issued in summer 2002. Especially the issue whether those proposed changes may alleviate the need {{for the use of the}} specific hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 will be discussed. In summary, the reasons for some of the proposed changes in subsequent measurement are sometimes far from being convincing. While, for example, the changes in designation may overall be welcomed, especially the removal <b>of</b> <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> for available-for-sale financial instruments departs significantly from the treatment <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> in other IAS and leads to inconsistencies within IAS 39. In general, with respect to hedge accounting the IASB is well short of target. Even minor changes which could ease the implementation of the standard without touching the fundamental concepts were obviously not even considered (e. g. lowering the ex ante hedge effectiveness level. required, introducing the short cut method, removal of the restriction of portfolio/index hedging etc.). financial instruments, IAS 39, international accounting, measurement issues...|$|R

40|$|Background and Discussion: Impairment {{has been}} debated within the professionals. IAS 36 {{seems to be}} a {{challenging}} area since it is a focus area for NASDAQs annual review of financial reports in 2012. The report shows that application of IAS 36 is beneath contempt. Assessment of whether an asset has declined in val-ue may be highly subjective and impairments may look like a failure and the management can therefore have incentives to report in a certain way. If the value of assets are overestimated, impairment losses can be avoided and the result is affected. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate difficulties for companies when applying IAS 36 for fixed assets, by exploring if there is a gap between the Standard and practice. Delimitation: This study cover companies in Sweden with accounting in accordance with IFRS and the focus area is <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> fixed assets. This means that goodwill issues are not deeply investigated and disclo-sures as well as <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> are excluded. Methodology: Data collection has been carried out through a qualitative method. One IFRS expert and four auditors at three different agencies were interviewed. Conclusions: IAS 36 implicates several difficult areas for companies, explained by the gap between regula-tion and practice. The main difficulties are recognition <b>of</b> when <b>impairment</b> tests need to be conducted, distinguished the need for impairment losses from the need for changed depreciation time in practice, ap-plication of value in use and determination of CGUs. Companies may in some cases unintentionally report errors due to that the Standard can be difficult to apply. Further research: The following areas would be interesting for further research:  Accomplish a similar study, but focusing on intangible assets, such as goodwill.  Investigate why IASB has not changed or simplified IAS 36 in a higher extent and how the regula-tion can be improved.  Find out how stakeholders react to impairment losses.  Conduct a similar study but focusing on an industry, in order to compare companies, for example the printing industry, which is {{standing in the middle of}} a structural change...|$|R

However, patient expectations have not been studied within a valid theoretical framework. This study employed the World Health Organization's model of health, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), to classify the content of preoperative patient expectations of THR. METHODS: A European cohort of 1, 108 patients preoperatively reported 2 types of expectations. Patients reported what they anticipated surgery would enable them to do that they needed {{to be able to do}} ("need" expectation), and what they would like to be able to do ("desire" expectation) in a year's time. Free-text responses were independently classified by 2 researchers to 1 or more of the ICF constructs <b>of</b> <b>impairment,</b> activity limitation, and participation restriction. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was high (κ = ≥ 0. 87). All patient expectations were classified to the ICF constructs. Less than 5 % of patient expectations were identified as <b>impairment,</b> 58 % <b>of</b> "need" expectations were identified as activity limitations, and 45 % of "desire" expectations were identified as activity limitations and participation restrictions combined.

Methods and Results—Ad. Trx 1 was administered intramyocardially in nondiabetic and diabetic rats immediately after myocardial infarction. Ad. LacZ was similarly {{administered to the}} respective control groups. The hearts were excised for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis at predetermined time points. Myocardial function was measured by echocardiography 30 days after the intervention. The Ad.

40|$|Organisms {{frequently}} make effort-related {{decisions based}} upon assessments of motivational value and response costs. Dopamine (DA) and DA receptors (DA-Rs), particularly in nucleus accumbens (NAc), {{are known to}} regulate such effort-related choice behavior processes. For instance, DA-R antagonists as well as NAc DA depletion can decrease choice behavior. Moreover, previous {{studies have shown that}} systemic administration of adenosine A 2 A antagonists reverses the behavioral effects of DA-R D 2 antagonists in rats responding on the concurrent choice task. MSX- 3, a selective adenosine A 2 A antagonist, is a prodrug of MSX- 2 with better water solubility. MSX- 3 produces a substantial dose-related <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the effects of DA-R D 2 antagonists on lever pressing and chow intake. MSX- 4 is a novel A 2 A antagonist that is an amino acid ester prodrug of MSX- 2, and is thought to have better oral bioavailability than MSX- 3. In the present studies, we investigated the effects of MSX- 4 on choice behavior using the commonly employed fixed ratio 5 (FR 5) /chow feeding procedure. MSX- 4 (2. 0 - 8. 0 mg/kg IP) produced a dose-related <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the effects of 0. 08 mg/kg eticlopride on lever pressing and chow intake, with a similar time course as MSX- 3. Following oral administration, both MSX- 3 and MSX- 4 showed a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> motivational <b>impairments</b> induced by eticlopride at comparable doses. Furthermore, eticlopride-induced increases in c-Fos expression in NAc were reversed by co-administration of MSX- 3 and MSX- 4. Overall, these data suggest that both adenosine A 2 A antagonist pro-drugs induce similar behavioral effects, and similar actions on cellular markers of neural activity in NAc. Additionally, this research further supports the hypothesis that DA and adenosine interact in the regulation of effort-related choice behavior. Further understanding this interaction between DA and adenosine and may have implications for understanding the energy-related motivational dysfunctions, such as psychomotor slowing, fatigue, and apathy, all of which are seen in patients with depression, Parkinson’s disease, and other central nervous system disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) {{definitions}} of blindness and visual impairment are widely based on best-corrected visual acuity excluding uncorrected refractive errors (URE) {{as a visual}} impairment cause. Recently, URE was included as a cause <b>of</b> visual <b>impairment,</b> thus emphasizing the burden <b>of</b> visual <b>impairment</b> due to refractive error (RE) worldwide is substantially higher. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to determine the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>impairment</b> and blindness in the population correcting RE and possible associations between RE and individual characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in nine counties of the western region of state of Sao Paulo, using systematic and random sampling of households between March 2004 and July 2005. Individuals aged more than 1 year old were included and were evaluated for demographic data, eye complaints, history, and eye exam, including no corrected visual acuity (NCVA), best corrected vision acuity (BCVA), automatic and manual refractive examination. The definition adopted for URE was applied to individuals with NCVA > 0. 15 logMAR and BCVA 0. 5 logMAR) and BCVA <= 0. 5 logMAR after optical correction. Results: A total of 70. 2 % of subjects had normal NCVA. URE was detected in 13. 8 %. Prevalence of 4. 6 % of optically reversible low vision and 1. 8 % of blindness reversible by optical correction were found. UREN was detected in 6. 5 % of individuals, more frequently observed in women over the age of 50 and in higher RE carriers. Visual impairment related to eye diseases is not reversible with spectacles. Using multivariate analysis, associations between URE and UREN with regard to sex, age and RE was observed.

40|$|AbstractProgressive {{olfactory}} <b>impairment</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the earliest}} markers of neurodegeneration. However, the underlying mechanism for this dysfunction remains unclear. The present {{study investigated the}} possible role of microgliosis in olfactory deficits using a mouse model of Niemann–Pick disease type C 1 (NPC 1), which is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder with disrupted lipid trafficking. At 7 weeks of age, NPC 1 mutants showed a distinct olfactory impairment in an olfactory test compared with age-matched wild-type controls (WT). The marked loss of olfactory sensory neurons within the NPC 1 affected olfactory bulb (NPC 1 -OB) suggests that NPC 1 dysfunction impairs olfactory structure. Furthermore, the pool of neuroblasts in the OB was diminished in NPC 1 mice despite the intact proliferative capacity of neural stem/progenitor cells in the subventricular zone. Instead, pro-inflammatory proliferating microglia accumulated extensively in the NPC 1 -OB as the disease progressed. To evaluate the impact of abnormal microglial activation on olfaction in NPC 1 mice, a microglial inhibition study was performed using the anti-inflammatory agent Cyclosporin A (CsA). Importantly, long-term CsA treatment in NPC 1 mice reduced reactive microgliosis, restored the survival of newly generated neurons in the OB and improved overall performance on the olfactory test. Therefore, our study highlights the possible role of microglia in the regulation of neuronal turnover in the OB and provides insight into the possible therapeutic applications of microglial inhibition in the attenuation or <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> olfactory <b>impairment...</b>|$|R

This study investigated the cytoprotective effects of a nucleic acid-based health product (Squina [Hong Kong, China] DNA) against oxidative stress, particularly in neuronal cells. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Squina DNA, and changes in mitochondrial antioxidant status and functional capacity were assessed by the activities of antioxidant enzymes and ATP generation capacity in brain, heart ventricular, kidney, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues of control and Squina DNA-treated rats. The effects of Squina DNA pretreatment on brain/neuronal cell injury were investigated in a rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and a neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cell model of beta-amyloid (A beta) protein fragment 25 35 -induced toxicity. Long-term Squina DNA treatment caused dose-dependent increases in mitochondrial antioxidant status and functional capacity in rat brain, heart ventricular, kidney, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues. Squina DNA pretreatment significantly prevented I/R injury in brain tissue. The cerebroprotection was associated with a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> I/R-induced <b>impairment</b> in mitochondrial antioxidant status and disruption in membrane integrity. Squina DNA ethanol extract also significantly inhibited the A beta-induced apoptosis in SH-SY 5 Y neuronal cells, as evidenced by less caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation as well as mitochondrial cytochrome c release in A beta-challenged cells.

Exclusion criteria included serum creatinine ≥ 2. 5 mg/dL. In the VMPT-VT/VMP arms, severe RI (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 30 mL/min), moderate RI (eGFR 31 - 50 mL/min), and normal renal function (eGFR > 50 mL/min), were 6 %/ 7. 9 %, 24. 1 %/ 24. 9 %, and 69. 8 %/ 67. 2 %, respectively. Statistically {{significant improvements in}} overall response rates and progression-free survival were observed in VMPT-VT versus VMP arms across renal cohorts, except in severe RI patients. In the VMPT group, severe RI reduced overall survival (OS). RI was reversed in 16 / 63 (25. 4 %) patients receiving VMPT-VT versus 31 / 77 (40. 3 %) receiving VMP.

40|$|The resting O 2 {{consumption}} of alveolar and peritoneal macrophages obtained from rats at 4 and 24 h after thermal injury was unaltered from control values. However, when heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa or polystyrene latex particles {{were added to}} the cell suspensions to initiate phagocytosis, a significant depression in the respiratory burst accompanying the phagocytic event was demonstrated. The addition of phorbol myristate acetate, used to maximize the respiratory response, was ineffective in elevating, to control values, the respiratory burst of macrophages obtained from burned animals. The deficit was only, in part, serum mediated since the responses could not be restored to control values even when the cells from the burned animals were vigorously washed with control serum and incubated with control serum. The contribution of a burn serum factor, which was non-dialyzable, heat stable at 56 °C but not at 65 °C, and insensitive to pronase treatment, must be considered. These data indicate that thermal injury results in macrophage metabolic alterations which are mediated, in part, by a burn serum factor. Furthermore, the data suggest that pulmonary alveolar macrophages are more sensitive to thermal injury than peritoneal macrophages. Serum factors contributed, in part, to this observed impairment in the respiratory burst as indicated by: (i) an approximate 50 % <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impairment</b> by control serum, and (ii) an approximate decrease of 50 to 80 % in the control alveolar macrophage respiratory burst when serum from the thermally injured rats was added to the culture medium...|$|R

Meanwhile, firms with substantial previous write-downs reversed more impairment charges to achieve their earnings targets in the transition period.

40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) symptoms can impart emotional, {{quality of}} life (QOL), and work productivity burdens, especially in persistent AR (PER). Desloratadine, an H 1 -receptor antagonist, {{has been shown to}} be effective against nasal and nonnasal AR symptoms and to improve QOL. Exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate whether desloratadine-mediated symptom improvement correlated with improvements in QOL and productivity. The Aerius Control: Clinical and Evaluative Profile of Treatment 2 (NCT 00405964) study was a 12 -week, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study of once-daily desloratadine at 5 mg in subjects with moderate-to-severe PER. Assessments included twice-daily symptom severity ratings (0 = none to 3 = severe; total and individual symptoms), sleep interference (morning [A. M. ]), interference with activities of daily living (ADL; evening [P. M. ]), the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire-Standardized version (baseline and days 29 and 85), and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Allergy-Specific questionnaire (baseline and weekly). Pearson product-moment correlation statistics (r) were determined to assess correlations between symptom score improvements and QOL factors. All desloratadine-treated patients (n = 360) were included in this exploratory analysis. In the desloratadine-treated patients, all correlations tested were positive (all p < 0. 0001). The highest coefficients were seen for the correlations between A. M. /P. M. PRIOR total five-symptom score and interference with ADL (r = 0. 72) and between A. M. NOW congestion and ADL interference (r = 0. 69). Continuous daily treatment of moderate-to-severe PER with desloratadine at 5 mg/day significantly improved symptoms, which correlated positively, albeit moderately, with QOL benefits and <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>impairments</b> caused by PE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDopamine D 3 {{receptor}} antagonists exert pro-cognitive {{effects in}} both rodents and primates. Accordingly, this study compared {{the roles of}} dopamine D 3 versus D 2 receptors in social novelty discrimination (SND), which relies on olfactory cues, and novel object recognition (NOR), a visual recognition task. The dopamine D 3 receptor antagonist, S 33084 (0. 04 - 0. 63 mg/kg), caused a dose-related <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> delay-dependent <b>impairment</b> in both SND and NOR procedures in adult rats. Furthermore, mice genetically deficient in dopamine D 3 receptors displayed enhanced discrimination in the SND task compared to wild-type controls. In contrast, acute treatment with the preferential dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist, L 741, 626 (0. 16 - 5. 0 mg/kg), or with the dopamine D 3 agonist, PD 128, 907 (0. 63 - 40 µg/kg), caused a dose-related impairment in performance in rats in both tasks after a short inter-trial delay. Bilateral microinjection of S 33084 (2. 5 µg/side) into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats increased SND and caused a dose-related (0. 63 - 2. 5 µg/side) improvement in NOR, while intra-striatal injection (2. 5 µg/side) {{had no effect on}} either. In contrast, bilateral microinjection of L 741, 626 into the PFC (but not striatum) caused a dose-related (0. 63 - 2. 5 µg/side) <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> NOR. These observations suggest that blockade of dopamine D 3 receptors enhances both SND and NOR, whereas D 3 receptor activation or antagonism of dopamine D 2 receptors impairs cognition in these paradigms. Furthermore, these actions are mediated, at least partly, by the PFC. These data have important implications for exploitation of dopaminergic mechanisms in the treatment of schizophrenia and other CNS disorders, and support the potential therapeutic utility of dopamine D 3 receptor antagonism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kindergarten, first, second, {{and third}} grade {{children}} (n = 36 per grade level) gave eight types {{of responses to}} five categories of letter stimuli, including high and low confusion capital and lower-case letters and frequently reversed letters. An error analysis of these normative data revealed that reversal letters produced more errors than other types of graphic stimuli only for kindergarten children. There was a similar pattern of errors in response to both reversal {{and other types of}} letter stimuli: Number of errors deceased as grade level increased; there were no sex differences; and the eight response types produced differing numbers of errors. It was suggested that letter reversals be remediated by first ascertaining the response modes in which letter reversals occur for each child. Some persons tend to confuse the name of letters, especially p,b,q, and d, or to write mirror images of letters. This phenomenon is commonly labeled letter <b>reversals.</b> A variety <b>of</b> explanations have been offered for letter <b>reversals.</b> Theories <b>of</b> organic <b>impairment</b> include lack <b>of</b> clear-cut cerebral dominance (Orton, 1925; Zangwill, 1962), poor intersensory integration (Birch, 1962; Birch & Belmont...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the role of}} leukotrienes (LTs) in Munich-Wistar rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), an animal model of human membranous nephropathy. 10 d after injection of anti-Fx 1 A antibody, urinary protein excretion rate (Upr) in PHN {{was significantly higher than}} that of control. Micropuncture studies demonstrated reduced single nephron plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, increased transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference, pre- and postglomerular resistances, and decreased ultrafiltration coefficient in PHN rats. Glomerular LTB 4 generation from PHN rats was increased. Administration of the 5 -LO activating protein inhibitor MK 886 for 10 d markedly blunted proteinuria and normalized glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities in PHN rats. An LTD 4 receptor antagonist SK&F 104353 led to an immediate reduction in Upr and to <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> glomerular hemodynamic <b>impairment.</b> Ia(+) cells/glomerulus were increased in PHN rats. In x-irradiated PHN rats, which developed glomerular macrophage depletion, augmented glomerular LT synthesis was abolished. Thus, in the autologous phase of PHN, LTD 4 mediates glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities and a hemodynamic component of the accompanying proteinuria. The synthesis of LTD 4 likely occurs directly from macrophages or from macrophage-derived LTA 4, through LTC 4 synthase in glomerular cells...|$|R
40|$|Marginally housed persons {{experience}} several {{risk factors}} for neurocognitive impairment, including viral infections, psychiatric illness, and substance use. Although interventions exist, marginalized persons often obtain inadequate health services, based upon personal and structural barriers. In study one, we employed structural equation modeling to assess determinants of neurocognition (i. e., viral infections, psychiatric symptoms), predicting that any impairment would impede healthcare access. Our findings revealed that greater exposure to viral infections and more severe psychiatric symptoms were similarly associated with poorer neurocognition. Additionally, more frequent opioid use/less frequent alcohol and marijuana use was associated with better neurocognition. Only viral infections directly predicted healthcare use, an association that was positive despite the negative impact viral infections held with neurocognition. In study two, we assessed whether spontaneous clearance of Hepatitis C (HCV) is associated with <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> neurocognitive <b>impairments</b> by comparing three groups: cleared-HCV, active-HCV, and no exposure to HCV. Our findings did not confirm improved neurocognition with HCV clearance, nor did we find any differences between groups exposed to HCV versus those never exposed to the virus after controlling {{for the effects of}} Hepatitis B (HBV). Nevertheless, our findings revealed that HCV conveys adverse health in marginalized persons (i. e., HCV exposure is associated with increased rates of HIV, liver dysfunction, etc.). Overall, these findings confirm the detrimental impact of viral infections on neurocognition in marginalized persons. Moreover, although neurocognition did not emerge as a personal barrier to accessing care in marginalized settings, structural level barriers may be operating. Specifically, our results point to a system where health care is selectively utilized and may not be targeted towards all persons, such as those experiencing elevated psychiatric symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Chronic methamphetamine (meth) abuse {{can lead}} to {{persisting}} cognitive deficits. Here, we utilized a long-access meth self-administration (SA) protocol to assess recognition memory and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) expression, and the possible <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> cognitive <b>impairments</b> with the mGluR 5 allosteric modulator, 3 -cyano-N-(1, 3 -diphenyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 5 -yl) benzamide (CDPPB). Male, Long-Evans rats self-administered i. v. meth (0. 02 [*]mg/infusion) on an FR 1 schedule of reinforcement or received yoked-saline infusions. After seven daily 1 -h sessions, rats were switched to 6 -h daily sessions for 14 days, and then underwent drug abstinence. Rats were tested for object recognition memory at 1 week after meth SA at 90 [*]min and 24 [*]h retention intervals. In a separate experiment, rats underwent the same protocol, but received either vehicle or CDPPB (30 [*]mg/kg) after familiarization. Rats were killed on day 8 or 14 post-SA and brain tissue was obtained. Meth intake escalated over the extended access period. Additionally, meth-experienced rats showed deficits in both short- and long-term recognition memory, demonstrated {{by a lack of}} novel object exploration. The deficit at 90 [*]min was reversed by CDPPB treatment. On day 8, meth intake during SA negatively correlated with mGluR expression in the perirhinal and prefrontal cortex, and mGluR 5 receptor expression was decreased 14 days after discontinuation of meth. This effect was specific to mGluR 5 levels in the perirhinal cortex, as no differences were identified in the hippocampus or in mGluR 2 / 3 receptors. These results from a clinically-relevant animal model of addiction suggest that mGluR 5 receptor modulation may be a potential treatment of cognitive dysfunction in meth addiction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Drinking alcohol {{mixed with}} energy drink (AMED) has become {{increasingly}} popular, particularly amongst young adults. Many consumers believe that by drinking AMED, the negative effects that occur with alcohol intoxication, such as impaired cognition, will be masked as the stimulant effects of caffeine counteract the depressant effects of alcohol. There is concern that the antagonising effects of caffeinated mixersmay result in consumers underestimating their level of intoxication, leading to higher alcohol consumption. Method: A series of Australian {{studies have examined the}} effects of AMED using laboratory and survey methodologies. The laboratory study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and 4 -arm trial administering 24 participants with 0. 6 g/kg alcohol and 250 ml energy drink and examined the effects of AMED on subjective intoxication, mood and cognitive performance. The online survey consisted of two parts, part 1 gauged participants’ preference of drink type(s) (i. e., alcoholmixed with energy drink or another mixer, or alcohol alone) along with consumption patterns. Part 2 of the survey established scores across a range of personality traits. Results: Findings from these studies indicate that while the addition of energy drink to alcohol does not alter self-rated levels of subjective intoxication, there is <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> intoxication-related <b>impairment</b> on various cognitive tasks. However, this does not seemto increase drinking as AMED users tend to consume less alcohol on AMED occasions compared to non-AMED occasions. Finally, there are significant differences between AMED users and non –users across a range ofmeasures. AMED users are significantly more likely to drink greater amounts of alcohol and more often, use illicit drugs and start drinking at a younger age. Conclusion: These findings suggest that while antagonism is found on selective cognitive tasks, AMED use does not differentially affect subjective intoxication nor result in greater amounts of alcohol consumed compared to alcohol without energy drink...|$|R
40|$|The present studies {{characterized}} the functional profile of N-[4 -methoxy- 3 -(4 -methylpiperazin- 1 -yl) phenyl]- 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 -H-benzo[e]indole- 3 -carboxamide) (S 32212), a combined serotonin (5 -HT) (2 C) receptor inverse agonist and α(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist that also possesses 5 -HT(2 A) antagonist properties (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 340 : 750 - 764, 2012). Upon parenteral and/or oral administration, dose-dependent (0. 63 - 40. 0 mg/kg) actions {{were observed in}} diverse procedures. Both acute and subchronic administration of S 32212 reduced immobility time in a forced-swim test in rats. Acutely, it also suppressed marble burying and aggressive behavior in mice. Long-term administration of S 32212 was associated with rapid (1 week) and sustained (5 weeks) normalization of sucrose intake in rats exposed to chronic mild stress and with elevated levels of mRNA encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampus and amygdala (2 weeks). S 32212 accelerated the firing rate of adrenergic perikarya in the locus coeruleus and elevated dialysis levels of noradrenaline in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of freely moving rats. S 32212 also elevated the frontocortical levels of dopamine and acetylcholine, whereas 5 -HT, amino acids, and histamine were unaffected. These neurochemical actions were paralleled by "promnemonic" properties: blockade of scopolamine-induced deficits in radial maze performance and social recognition and <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> delay-induced <b>impairments</b> in social recognition, social novelty discrimination, and novel object recognition. It also showed anxiolytic actions in a Vogel conflict procedure. Furthermore, in an electroencephalographic study of sleep architecture, S 32212 enhanced slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep, while decreasing waking. Finally, chronic administration of S 32212 neither elevated body weight nor perturbed sexual behavior in male rats. In conclusion, S 32212 displays a functional profile consistent with improved mood and cognitive performance, together with satisfactory tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Current {{antipsychotic}} {{medication is}} largely ineffective against the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. One promising therapeutic development is to design new molecules that balance actions on dopamine D 2 and D 3 receptors to maximise benefits and limit adverse effects. This study used two rodent paradigms {{to investigate the}} action of the dopamine D 3 -preferring D 3 /D 2 receptor partial agonist cariprazine. In adult male rats, cariprazine (0. 03 - 0. 3 mg/kg i. p.), and the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole (1 - 3 mg/kg i. p.) caused dose-dependent <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> a delay-induced <b>impairment</b> in novel object recognition (NOR). Treating neonatal rat pups with phencyclidine (PCP) and subsequent social isolation produced a syndrome of behavioral alterations in adulthood including hyperactivity in a novel arena, deficits in NOR and fear motivated learning and memory, and a reduction and change in pattern of social interaction accompanied by increased ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). Acute administration of cariprazine (0. 1 and 0. 3 mg/kg) and aripiprazole (3 mg/kg) to resultant adult rats reduced neonatal PCP-social isolation induced locomotor hyperactivity and reversed NOR deficits. Cariprazine (0. 3 mg/kg) caused a limited <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the social interaction deficit but neither drug affected the change in USVs or the deficit in fear motivated learning and memory. Results suggest that in the behavioral tests investigated cariprazine is at least as effective as aripiprazole and in some paradigms it showed additional beneficial features further supporting the advantage of combined dopamine D 3 /D 2 receptor targeting. These findings support recent clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of cariprazine in treatment of negative symptoms and functional impairment in schizophrenia patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} four central cholinomimetics to reverse a scopolamine-induced spatial memory {{impairment}} or to improve visual recognition memory in primates was examined. Physostigmine (0. 04 - 0. 08 mg/kg IM) fully reversed {{the effects of}} scopolamine (0. 03 mg/kg). Coadministration of pilocarpine (3. 0 - 5. 0 mg/kg) caused partial <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the scopolamine <b>impairment</b> after intermediate or long retention intervals (10 or 20 s). Treatment with arecoline (0. 1 - 1. 8 mg/kg) or nicotine (1. 0 - 2. 0 mg/kg) generally did not reverse the effects of scopolamine. A task in which memory could be taxed by {{increasing the number of}} visual stimuli presented appeared more sensitive to the effects of cholinomimetics on cognition than the scopolamine reversal model. In this paradigm treatment with physostigmine (0. 001, 0. 01 or 0. 03 mg/kg) increased choice accuracy from about 55 to 70 % correct. Arecoline improved performance at one dose only (0. 1 mg/kg) which also induced marked adverse side-effects (salivation and tremor). Pilocarpine improved performance in the dose range 0. 125 - 0. 35 mg/kg, but not at higher doses which also induced marked salivation. Treatment with nicotine (0. 001 - 2. 0 mg/kg tended to improve performance but this did not reach statistical significance.
