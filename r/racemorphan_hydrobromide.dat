De. xtrorphan tartrate, 4 which, like levorphan and racemorphan, was synthesized by Schnider and associates (1949, 1950), has also received the at-tention of Fromherz (1951), Pellmont (1951), Isbell and Fraser (1951), Benson et al. (1952) and Slomka and Gross (1952). More recently, the corresponding methyl ethers, levomethorphan hydro-bromide, 5 racemethorphan hydrobromide 6 and dextromethorphan hydrobromide 7 were prepared by Schnider and GrUssner (1951). These have been pharma-cologically investigated in animals by Fromherz, Peilmont and B#{ 228 }chtold (1950 - 1953) and by Benson et al. (1952). Slomka and Gross (1951) reported upon the analgesic activity of racemethorphan administered orally to man and Isbell and Fraser (1951) have discussed the addiction liability of this agent. These latter workers (1952) similarly reported upon the addiction liability of levomethorphan {{and the absence of}} addiction liability of dextromethorphan. This paper is concerned with the comparative evaluation of the three parent compounds (levorphan, racemorphan and dextrorphan) and of the three methyl ethers (levomethorphan, racemethorphan and dextromethorphan).
