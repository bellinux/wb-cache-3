5|$|From 1890 to 1893 White {{served two}} terms {{as a member}} of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Hawaiian legislature, for the {{district}} of Lahaina on the island of Maui. In his first term, he initially ran {{as a member of}} the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> against the National <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> candidate J. Nazareta. In 1887, the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> (consisting of many descendants of American missionaries and Hawaiian conservatives) had become the established governmental party following King Kalākaua's coerced signing of the Bayonet Constitution. White was opposed to the constitution, and may have switched allegiance at a later point to the National <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> which was established in opposition to the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> in this session.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{political}} leanings in Lethbridge {{have been}} right-wing. Federally, from 1917 to 1930, Lethbridge voters switched between various federal parties, but from 1935 to 1957, they voted Social Credit in each election. Progressive Conservatives held office from 1958 until 1993, when the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> of Canada was formed. The <b>Reform</b> <b>party</b> and its various subsequent incarnations {{such as the}} current Conservative Party of Canada have dominated the polls since.|$|E

5|$|Harper was {{member of}} the House of Commons for the riding of Calgary Southwest in Alberta from 2002 to 2015 (and for Calgary Heritage till 2016). Earlier, from 1993 to 1997, he was the MP for Calgary West, {{representing}} the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> of Canada. He {{was one of the}} founding members of the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> but did not seek re-election in the 1997 federal election. Harper instead joined and later led the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative lobbyist group. In 2002, he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance, the successor to the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> and returned to parliament as Leader of the Opposition. In 2003, he reached an agreement with Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay for the merger of their two parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada. He was elected as the party's first leader, in March 2004. Harper stepped down as MP on August 26, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesia Party {{remained}} in power until September 1933, when, despite narrowly topping the popular vote, it lost the month's election, winning only {{nine of the}} 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including the new Prime Minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the more rightist members of the party merged with the Rhodesia Party in 1934 to form the United Party, and, with Huggins at the helm, roundly defeated the rump left wing of the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> to begin 28 years of uninterrupted stewardship.|$|E
5|$|At the 1933 elections, the Rhodesia Party was {{defeated}} by the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> of Godfrey Huggins. Guest was a key advocate of accepting the merger of the two parties under the new name of the United Party and Huggins appointed him to his Cabinet in 1938.|$|E

5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa.

This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, who served as a deputy to the national congress, was, like the rest of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political <b>reform</b> <b>party</b> formed in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{endorsement}} that Tancredo received {{was that}} of Bay Buchanan, the sister of perennial presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and former Treasurer of the United States under President Ronald Reagan.

New Hampshire advisor, Shelly Uscinski formerly the New Hampshire chairman of the Christian Coalition. Iowa advisor and former U.S. Senate candidate in 2002 Bill Salier. And campaign official Tim Haley, the former campaign manager of Pat Buchanan's <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> run in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Det norske Arbeiderforbund was {{supported}} by people from individual factories, but the mainly philanthropic activists {{were associated with the}} Liberal Party. However, the strike at Akers Mekaniske had been a failure, as the laborers had returned to work by on 26 Augustwith a 10% pay cut. It soon faced competition from more worker-dominated trade unions, coordinated through the Fagforeningenes Centralkomite. On the political side, a Labour Party was formed in 1887, and from it the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions followed in 1899. The historical role of Det norske Arbeiderforbund, as it turned out, was to mark the transition between two kinds of trade unionism; the one dominated by the bourgeois Liberal Party and the one dominated by the socialist Labour Party. The organization became defunct around 1890. The publication Arbeideren was continued, and beginning in 1906, Arbeideren was the party organ of the newly founded Labour Democrats, a non-socialist labour and social <b>reform</b> <b>party</b> associated with the Liberal Party.|$|E

5|$|Thompson ran for Congress {{several more}} times. In 1900, he ran in Ohio's 3rd congressional {{district}} as the nominee of the Union <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> {{which was made}} up of Prohibition Party members who split from the main party. He received just 0.32% of the vote, and Republican Robert M. Nevin won the election. In 1908, he ran for the same seat for the re-united Prohibition Party, but won just 0.4% of the vote, losing the election to Democrat James M. Cox. In 1910, Thompson ran for governor of Ohio. Despite the growing popularity of the idea of prohibition, the Prohibition Party candidate got just 0.77% of the vote as Democrat Judson Harmon carried the state. His final attempt at election came in Indiana's 4th congressional district, just over the Ohio border. With 2.24% of the vote, it was Thompson's best performance, but he still fell far short of victory.|$|E
5|$|Dawson Creek is {{situated}} in the Peace River South provincial electoral district and is represented by Mike Bernier of the British Columbia Liberal Party in the provincial assembly. Bernier served as mayor of Dawson Creek between 2008 and 2013. His predecessor, Blair Lekstrom, also served as mayor of Dawson Creek, between 1996 and 2001, before being elected as the MLA for the BC Liberals. Bernier became a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 2013 provincial election with 46% support. Before Bernier and Lekstrom, Peace River South was represented by Dawson Creek resident Jack Weisgerber. Weisgerber was first elected in 1986 {{as a member of}} the Social Credit Party and served as the province's Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and Minister of Native Affairs. While the Social Credit Party lost power in 1991, Weisgerber was re-elected and served as interim party leader. He joined the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> of British Columbia in 1994 and won re-election in 1996 as party leader, even though Dawson Creek polls put him in third place behind the BC Liberal Party and New Democratic Party candidates.|$|E
