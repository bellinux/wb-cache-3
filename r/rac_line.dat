In this paper, we suggest a Multi-Grain RAC to adaptively control the <b>RAC</b> <b>line</b> size for each application behavior. We simulate the NUMA systems with the Multi-Grain RAC using MINT, an event-driven memory hierarchy simulator, and analyze the performance of Multi-Grain RAC. At first, with a profile-based determination method, we verify the best <b>RAC</b> <b>line</b> size for each application and then we compare and analyze the performance differences among NUMA systems with difference <b>RAC</b> <b>line</b> size. The simulation result shows that the worst case can be mostly avoided in Multi-Grain RAC and, in addition, the results are very close to the best case with any combination of application and RAC format...|$|E

40|$|The <b>RAC</b> cell <b>lines</b> {{are derived}} from a mammary tumor induced by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Polygonal cells have {{retained}} many characteristics of epithelial cells and induce adenocarcinomas; cuboidal cells are poorly tumorigenic; and elongated cells produce highly malignant sarcoma-like tumors. MMTV proviral integrations, one of which has cis-activated the int- 2 gene, demonstrated that the lines are clonal descendents from a single tumor cell. Polygonal cells have a high constitutive expression of MMTV and contain int- 2 RNA. In contrast, the cuboidal and the elongated cells show no detectable expression of int- 2, even {{in the presence of}} glucocorticoid hormone. Transcription of MMTV in these cells is also low but can be stimulated by dexamethasone, albeit to levels lower than in polygonal cells. Thus, expression of int- 2 seems to be caused by an enhancing activity on the MMTV provirus which is not dependent on steroid hormone and is specific for mammary tumor cells with epithelial characteristics. Progression in this cell system does not require sustained expression of int- 2...|$|R

The <b>RAC</b> 65 cell <b>line</b> is a mutant clone of P 19 cells selected to be RA nonresponsive. RAC 65 cells carry a rearrangement affecting one of the genes encoding a nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR alpha). The mutant gene encodes a protein, RAR alpha', that has lost its 70 C-terminal amino acids, thus truncating the RA-binding domain. The RAR alpha' was found to be a dominant repressor of transcription from an RA-responsive target gene; however, expression of RAR alpha' was insufficient to confer RA nonresponsiveness, suggesting that RAC 65 cells carry an additional mutation(s) affecting RA-induced genes...|$|R

APC is a tumor suppressor gene, mutations in which cause intestinal tumorigenesis in humans and rodents. Both Wnt- 1 expression and APC mutation activate a common signaling pathway involving transcriptional activation mediated by �-catenin/Tcf complexes, but few targets relevant to carcinogenesis have yet been identified. Expression of the inducible prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase- 2 appears critical for intestinal tumorigenesis resulting from APC mutation, suggesting that cyclooxygenase- 2 might be a transcriptional target for �-catenin/Tcf complexes.

40|$|P 19 {{embryonal}} carcinoma (EC) cells differentiate when treated with retinoic acid (RA). The P 19 EC-derived mutant cell <b>line</b> <b>RAC</b> 65 is {{resistant to the}} differentiation-inducing activity of RA. We show that these cells express a truncated retinoic acid receptor alpha(mRAR-alpha-RAC 65), {{probably due to the}} integration of a transposon-like element in the RAR-alpha-gene. This receptor lacks 71 C-terminal amino acids and terminates in the ligand-binding domain. In CAT assays in RAC 65 cells, mRAR-alpha-RAC 65 fails to trans-activate the RAR-beta promoter, which contains a RA-response element. In wild-type P 19 EC cells mRAR-alpha-RAC 65 functions as a dominant-negative repressor of RA-induced RAR-beta activation. Gel retardation assays demonstrate that MRAR-alpha-RAC 65 is still able to bind to the RA-response element of the RAR-beta promoter, indicating that competition with functional RARs for the same binding site leads to the observed dominant-negative effect. In addition, in two RAC 65 clones in which wild-type hRAR-alpha was stably transfected RA-sensitivity was restored and in one RAR-beta expression could be induced by RA. Taken together, these data show that the primary cause of RA-resistance of RAC 65 cells is the expression of a defective RAR-alpha, which prevents the trans-activation of RA-responsive genes and results in a loss of the ability to differentiate...|$|R

Evidence {{indicates that the}} drought-tolerant breeding <b>line</b> <b>RAC</b> 875 is water-use conservative, limiting its transpiration rate (TR) sensitivity to increasing vapour pressure deficit (VPD), thereby saving soil water moisture for later use. However, the physiological basis of the response remains unknown. The involvement of leaf and root developmental, anatomical and hydraulic features in regulating high-VPD, whole-plant TR was investigated on RAC 875 and a drought-sensitive cultivar (Kukri) in 12 independent hydroponic and pot experiments. Leaf areas and stomatal densities {{were found to be}} identical between lines and de-rooted plants didn’t exhibit differential TR responses to VPD or TR sensitivity to four aquaporin (AQP) inhibitors that included mercury chloride (HgCl 2). However, intact plants exhibited a differential sensitivity to HgCl 2 that was partially reversed by β-mercaptoethanol. Further, root hydraulic conductivity of RAC 875 was found to be lower than Kukri’s and root cross-sections of RAC 875 had significantly smaller stele and central metaxylem diameters. These findings indicate that the water-conservation of RAC 875 results from a root-based hydraulic restriction that requires potentially heritable functional and anatomical features.

40|$|Published online: 4 February 2017 The cuticle forms a {{hydrophobic}} waxy layer {{that covers}} plant organs and provides protection from biotic and abiotic stresses. Transcription of genes responsible for cuticle formation is regulated by {{several types of}} transcription factors (TFs). Five orthologous to WAX PRODUCTION (WXP 1 and WXP 2) genes from Medicago truncatula were isolated from a cDNA library prepared from flag leaves and spikes of drought tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum, breeding <b>line</b> <b>RAC</b> 875) and designated TaWXP-like (TaWXPL) genes. Tissue-specific and drought-responsive expression of TaWXPL 1 D and TaWXPL 2 B was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR in two Australian wheat genotypes, RAC 875 and Kukri, with contrasting glaucousness and drought tolerance. Rapid dehydration and/or slowly developing cyclic drought induced specific expression patterns of WXPL genes in flag leaves of the two cultivars RAC 875 and Kukri. TaWXPL 1 D and TaWXPL 2 B proteins acted as transcriptional activators in yeast and in wheat cell cultures, and conserved sequences in their activation domains were localised at their C-termini. The involvement of wheat WXPL TFs in regulation of cuticle biosynthesis was confirmed by transient expression in wheat cells, using the promoters of wheat genes encoding two cuticle biosynthetic enzymes, the 3 -ketoacyl-CoA-synthetase and the cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase. Using the yeast 1 -hybrid (Y 1 H) assay we also demonstrated the differential binding preferences of TaWXPL 1 D and TaWXPL 2 B towards three stress-related DNA cis-elements. Protein structural determinants underlying binding selectivity were revealed using comparative 3 D molecular modelling of AP 2 domains in complex with cis-elements. A scheme is proposed, which links the roles of WXPL and cuticle-related MYB TFs in regulation of genes responsible for the synthesis of cuticle components.

40|$|Background: In wheat, {{grain filling}} {{is closely related}} to flag leaf {{characteristics}} and function. Stomata are specialized leaf epidermal cells which regulate photosynthetic CO 2 uptake and water loss by transpiration. Understanding the mechanisms controlling stomatal size, and their opening under drought, is critical to reduce plant water loss and maintain a high photosynthetic rate which ultimately leads to elevated yield. We applied a leaf imprinting method for rapid and non-destructive phenotyping to explore genetic variation and identify quantitative traits loci (QTL) for stomatal traits in wheat grown under greenhouse and field conditions. Results: The genetics of stomatal traits on the adaxial surface of the flag leaf was investigated using 146 double haploid lines derived from a cross between two Australian lines of Triticum aestivum, RAC 875 and Kukri. The drought tolerant <b>line</b> <b>RAC</b> 875 showed numerous small stomata in contrast to Kukri. Significant differences between the lines were observed for stomatal densitity and size related traits. A negative correlation was found between stomatal size and density, reflecting a compensatory relationship between these traits to maintain total pore area per unit leaf surface area. QTL were identified for stomatal traits on chromosomes 1 A, 1 B, 2 B, and 7 A under field and controlled conditions.

40|$|Drought {{and heat}} can occur during the growth cycle of crops and {{severely}} reduce yield. A QTL associated with yield and yield-related component {{was found in}} four wheat populations (Triticum aestivum L.) on the long arm of chromosome 3 B “qYDH. 3 BL”. The four populations were grown under various climatic conditions including drought, heat and combinations of both {{in a number of}} different areas (Australia and Mexico). Linear mixed models that partition and account for genetic and non-genetic or extraneous variation were used to detect loci in single-environment and/or multi-environment QTL analysis using ASReml-R. The alleles carried by RAC 875, Excalibur or Drysdale improved grain yield by between 5 % and 12. 5 %. Two doubled haploid populations (RAC 875 /Kukri and Excalibur/Kukri) and two recombinant inbred <b>line</b> populations (<b>RAC</b> 875 /Kukri and Gladius/Drysdale) were used to fine map qYDH. 3 BL and identify candidate gene(s). A total of thirty-seven molecular markers were mapped on one or both genetic maps of chromosome 3 B enabling development of a consensus genetic map of the qYDH. 3 BL region. The markers were selected based on comparisons with a published “neighbour map” of chromosome 3 B or designed using either BAC-end, contig or gene sequences from the chromosome 3 B sequencing project; 3 BSEQ ([URL] (cv. Chinese Spring). A positional cloning approach was used to identify candidate genes for qYDH. 3 BL. Molecular markers from the targeted region were assigned to physical contigs by screening the chromosome 3 B BAC library experimentally using PCR or in silico by sequence comparison. A total of eight physical contigs containing 85 genes, were anchored to the qYDH. 3 BL region. Public and in-house resources of wheat transcript sequences were used to restrict the gene list to 65 expressed genes. Based on comparison of the 65 gene sequences to gene probes in a drought transcriptomic database, three genes were found to be differentially expressed between RAC 875 and Kukri under drought conditions. Short genomic sequence reads (10 × coverage) from each of the five parental <b>lines</b> (<b>RAC</b> 875, Kukri, Excalibur, Gladius and Drysdale) were mapped against the 65 genes for polymorphism discovery. One gene exhibited sequence polymorphism between the drought tolerant parents (RAC 875, Excalibur and Drysdale) and the drought-sensitive parents (Gladius and Kukri). In addition, presence/absence polymorphisms were consistently detected throughout a region containing 12 genes, indicating that the drought tolerant parents may have a deletion (or alien introgression) in this region. Thus, in this work, we confirmed the genetic effect of qYDH. 3 BL in multiple environments and multiple populations, saturated the target region with new molecular markers and defined a preliminary list of genes located in the qYDH. 3 BL region and selected candidate genes for further investigations.

40|$|CSIRO 2007 Field and {{glasshouse}} {{experiments were}} undertaken at 2 locations in South Australia to evaluate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) tolerance to metribuzin. Sloop SA barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{was used as}} a standard in the evaluation. Linear and logistic regression models were used to describe the response of wheat genotypes to metribuzin. Parameter estimates of B (slope) and ED 50 (dose required for 50 % inhibition) estimated by the models were used to compare the responses of the genotypes with that of the known sensitive cv. Spear. In the field, wheat cvv. Blade, Kite, EGA Eagle Rock, and Sloop SA barley showed tolerance to metribuzin, exhibiting little change in seedling density and anthesis dry matter (DM) when treated with metribuzin (187. 5 and 375 g/ha). In contrast, wheat cv. Spear, which has 50 % common parentage with Blade, showed a strong negative response to metribuzin for both seedling density (B=− 0. 308) and anthesis DM (B=− 0. 482), indicating sensitivity to the herbicide. Sonora 64 and Tezanos Pinto Precoz, parental lines of Blade, were also sensitive to metribuzin (> 187. 5 g/ha), showing similar negative responses to that of Spear for anthesis dry matter (B=− 0. 307 and − 0. 387). However, Kite, which is another parent of Blade, showed excellent tolerance to this herbicide, exhibiting only a small response (B=− 0. 076), which was statistically (P< 0. 05) different from that of Spear. In the second field study, cvv. Blade, EGA Eagle Rock, and Sloop SA barley were again far more tolerant to metribuzin than the sensitive cv. Spear, requiring almost double the dose of metribuzin to induce 50 % inhibition (ED 50). Glasshouse studies, where metribuzin was highly active in a light sandy potting soil at what would be considered low rates in the field (50 and 100 g/ha), confirmed the sensitivity differences among wheat genotypes observed in the field. Wheat genotypes Blade, Kite, EGA Eagle Rock, and daughter <b>line</b> <b>RAC</b> 0824 were consistently tolerant to metribuzin. Sensitivity to metribuzin (50 g/ha) was observed in Spear, and most parental lines of Blade with the exception of Kite. Interestingly, Kite showed equivalent tolerance to its progeny, Blade and EGA Eagle Rock, exhibiting similar ED 50 and B (slope) values. It is noteworthy that EGA Eagle Rock has recently been specifically bred for tolerance to metribuzin using Blade as a parent. Considering Kite was the only parent to show tolerance to metribuzin in these field and glasshouse studies, it would appear to be the major contributor to metribuzin tolerance in cv. Blade. At present, Kite is not favoured by wheat breeders due to the presence of a rust-resistant gene (SR 26) linked to yield penalty. Further research is required to determine alleles responsible for metribuzin tolerance in wheat and to identify alternative sources of metribuzin tolerance. S. G. L. Kleemann and G. S. Gil...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF 1) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder caused by constitutional inactivation of the NF 1 gene. NF 1 {{is associated with}} extreme phenotypic variability and results in {{an increased risk of}} developing benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). The molecular mechanisms that underlie NF 1 tumorigenesis are poorly understood although inactivation of additional loci in conjunction with NF 1 mutations is postulated to be involved. A combinative approach encompassing genetic, epigenetic and functional analysis was employed to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumorigenesis and progression to malignancy in NF 1. Genetic analysis of benign cutaneous neurofibromas from NF 1 patients with a high tumour burden was undertaken involving PCR, sequencing, Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) at the NF 1 locus. In addition, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) analysis and molecular analysis of the TP 53, RB 1, CDKN 2 A and MMR genes was performed in a subset of these tumours. It was revealed that a small proportion of tumours from such patients harbour LOH of the TP 53 and RB 1 genes, a novel finding which indicates that additional modifying loci may underlie the development of multiple cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with a high tumour burden. Furthermore, Schwann cell culture and Laser Capture Microdissection were used to enhance the somatic mutation detection rate in the NF 1 gene. Pyrosequencing methylation analysis was employed to determine whether NF 1 gene methylation was associated with NF 1 tumorigenesis. Promoter methylation of potential modifying genes RASSF 1 A and MGMT was also assessed. Results of this study demonstrate that methylation of the NF 1 and MGMT genes is unlikely to contribute to NF 1 tumorigenesis. RASSF 1 A promoter methylation was significantly higher in tumour samples in comparison to controls. RASSF 1 A promoter methylation was correlated with a reduction in RASSF 1 A gene expression, as evidenced by 5 aza 2 dc treatment. Non-synonymous missense mutations account for 15 % of lesions in the NF 1 germlihe and somatic mutational spectrum although without a suitable functional test, their pathogenicity cannot be defined with certainty. Site directed mutagenesis, a Ras ELISA and bioinformatic analysis were utilised to develop a novel functional assay to assess the potential pathogenicity of NF 1 gap related domain (GRD) missense variants. Of the 16 mutations functionally analysed, 11 were found to be pathogenic. A panel of 14 candidate genes were found to be aberrantly expressed in 14 tumours and 5 MPNST tumour-derived cell lines by relative quantification. A number of genes in the Rho-GTPase pathway including RAC 1 and ROCK 2 are over-expressed in these tumours, suggesting that these genes might be critical for survival of MPNST cells. ShRNA (short hairpin RNA) for RAC 1 and ROCK 2 were used in adhesion, migration, invasion and wound healing assays on control an d MPNST derived cell <b>lines.</b> <b>RAC</b> 1 and ROCK 2 knockdown in MPNST cell lines resulted in a significant increase in cell adhesion and a reduction in wound healing, migratory and invasive activity. The cMET gene was also over-expressed in MPNSTs. Treatment of MPNST cell lines with cMET inhibitors also resulted in a reduction of cell growth and migration.

40|$|Nonhost-{{resistance}} (NHR) is {{the resistance}} shown by a plant species towards all isolates of a pathogen species. This durable type of resistance protects plants against {{the majority of}} potential pathogens. In this thesis the nonhost-interaction between barley and isolates of the fungal genus Magnaporthe was analysed and compared to the host-interaction. Magnaporthe was isolated from different host plants, and the different isolates were examined for their biological relationship {{to one another and}} for their capacity to infect barley. It was shown that all isolates which were able to cause disease symptoms on barley (host-interaction) belong to the species M. oryzae. In contrast, M. grisea isolates (host: Digitaria) and isolates of a putative novel species which is associated with the host Pennisetum could not reproduce on barley (nonhost-interaction). Comparative cytological analyses showed that formation of papillae (penetration resistance) and hypersensitive epidermal cell death (postpenetration resistance) were predominant nonhost-defense mechanisms. These reactions were apparent by 24 h p. i. at higher frequencies in the nonhost-interaction than in the host-interaction. It was possible to significantly reduce the penetration resistance of barley by treatments with AIP (an inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and cytochalasin E (an inhibitor of actin-polymerisation). Similarly, penetration resistance was reduced in the barley mutant mlo- 5 ror 1 - 2 rar 1 - 2. However, growth of the nonhost-pathogen was arrested in epidermal cells in all cases and the pathogen was never able to generate secondary hyphae. These results underpin the effectiveness of epidermal defence in this nonhost-interaction. Complementary-DNA macroarray-analysis of inoculated barley-epidermis showed a very early (6 h p. i.) and pronounced change in the pattern of gene-expression in the nonhost-interaction as compared to the host-interaction. Particularly, the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism was induced significantly after inoculation with the nonhost-pathogen. For functional analysis of these candidate genes virus-induced gene silencing technology (VIGS) was established for the barley/Magnaporthe-interaction. Results presented here indicate similarities between the NHR and basal resistance of barley towards fungi of the genus Magnaporthe. In general, barley responds to pathogen attack with a similar spectrum of defence mechanisms in nonhost- or host-interactions, but activation of these defences occurs earlier and more efficiently in the nonhost- than in the host-interaction. This phenomenon might depend on an early recognition of nonhost-specific effector molecules by barley. In contrast, the suppression of plant defence by effectors of host-pathogens might be responsible for the delayed defence in the host-interaction. Remarkably, a comparative transcriptome-analysis of three different nonhost-interactions of barley (barley/Magnaporthe, barley/powdery mildew, barley/rust) revealed no genes which were regulated in a similar manner in all interactions. These results point to a pathogen-specific reprogramming of the plant metabolism in nonhost-interactions. During further investigations the significance of the Rom 1 gene for the interaction of barley with different species of the genus Magnaporthe was analysed. The mutation in Rom 1 restores the resistance of susceptible Mla 12 rar 1 - 2 Rom 1 (rar 1 - 2) barley against the powdery mildew fungus Bgh. Remarkably, after infection with M. oryzae, plants of the genotype Mla 12 rar 1 - 2 rom 1 (rom 1) showed more but smaller disease symptoms than wildtype and rar 1 - 2 -plants. Thus, Rom 1 and Rar 1 appear to act antagonistically in epidermal and mesophyll defence scenarios. Moreover, rom 1 -plants showed a higher accumulation of PR 1 b-specific transcripts after inoculation with the Magnaporthe nonhost-pathogen in comparison to wildtype and rar 1 - 2 -plants. This may argue for an augmented responsiveness of rom 1 -plants. Furthermore, the influence of the gene Rac 1, whose overexpression is known to cause hypersusceptibility of barley to Bgh, was investigated in the barley/M. oryzae interaction. In macro- and microscopical analyses a correlation between increased resistance of <b>Rac</b> 1 -overexpression <b>lines</b> against M. oryzae and augmented penetration resistance was observed. These results point to an influence of Rom 1 and Rac 1 on basal resistance and, in the case of Rom 1, on the NHR of barley against different pathogens...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of improving our understanding of the genetic basis of the superior grain yield of an elite bread wheat breeding <b>line,</b> <b>RAC</b> 875, under drought and heat stressed Mediterranean-type climates in southern Australia. Here, these abiotic stresses present a significant barrier to production. Kukri is a locally adapted variety which achieves acceptable grain yield under more favourable conditions, but relatively low grain yields under severe stress. A cross between the two lines resulted in an F₁ derived doubled haploid population consisting of 368 individuals. The population was initially used for the genetic dissection of time to ear emergence and flag leaf glaucousness, with the latter trait hypothesised to explain a significant proportion of RAC 875 ’s relative drought and heat tolerance. Whilst parents of the population achieved similar time to ear emergence, segregation for Ppd-B 1 and Ppd-D 1 a created large variation for this trait within the population. Two novel minor loci were detected for time to ear emergence (Q. Eet. aww- 1 A and Q. Zad. aww- 4 A), in addition to another eight known, minor loci. Five novel loci were detected for flag leaf glaucousness (Q. W. aww- 3 A, Q. W. aww- 3 B, Q. W. aww- 3 D, Q. W. aww- 4 D and Q. W. aww- 5 B), with one in particular (Q. W. aww- 3 A) accounting for up to 52 percent of the genetic variance for this trait. Sixteen field experiments were sown across southern Australia between 2006 and 2010, where average site grain yields ranged from 314 to 5275 kg ha⁻¹. Kernels per square metre was the trait most correlated with grain yield, while spikelet fertility, which had a significant positive correlation with grains per square metre in all experiments and the subsequently derived environment clusters, was also related to grain yield. Nine loci were detected for grain yield independent of time to ear emergence and plant height. Five of these loci co-located with loci for kernels per square metre and only one of these nine loci were associated with any of the loci for flag leaf glaucousness and this genetic effect was opposite (i. e. Kukri allele resulting in large glaucousness value and lower grain yield). The RAC 875 allele at QTL on chromosomes 1 B and 7 A (Q. Yld. aww- 1 B and Q. Yld. aww- 7 A- 2) was associated with greater grain yield, kernels per spikelet and kernels per square metre. These two loci were detected in environment clusters where heat stress was a differentiating factor and it was concluded that these may therefore be associated with heat stress tolerance. Another QTL of large effect was consistently detected on chromosome 6 A (Q. Tkw. aww- 6 A), with the RAC 875 allele positively affecting grain size, flag leaf width and stem water soluble carbohydrate content but resulting in lower kernels per spikelet and therefore kernels per square metre. Experiments were also sown to assess the performance of the population in north-west Mexico under well watered, high yield potential conditions, as well as drip irrigated drought treatment and late planted but well watered conditions to expose the experiments to heat stress. This resulted in three very distinctive treatments and subsequently detected different genetic regions controlling grain yield. Two distinct QTL were detected for grain yield and canopy temperature on chromosome 3 B, under irrigated (Q. Yld. aww- 3 B- 1) and irrigated, drought and heat stressed treatments (Q. Yld. aww- 3 B- 2). The latter QTL accounted for up to 22 percent of the genetic variance for grain yield and 20 percent of the genetic variance for canopy temperature under the heat stress treatment. However, all three treatments failed to detect any major QTL of common effect to southern Australia. This study highlighted the complex genetic basis of grain yield and physical grain quality in drought and heat stressed conditions, as well as the importance of conducting QTL dissection in the target environment. However, key loci detected offer potential for marker development and deployment of marker assisted selection within wheat breeding programmes targeting southern Australia. In the longer term, this should help improve the rate of genetic gain for grain yield, increasing production by growers in the Mediterranean type climate of southern Australia. Thesis (Ph. D.)
