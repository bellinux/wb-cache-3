5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further <b>radar</b> <b>detection.</b> These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later.

5|$|Interceptor {{aircraft}} with ever-improving performance {{remained the}} only effective anti-bomber weapons {{by the early}} 1950s, and even these were having problems {{keeping up with the}} latest designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, in spite of its relatively low speeds. It was later discovered that flying faster also made <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> much more difficult due to an effect known as the blip-to-scan ratio, and any reduction in tracking efficiency would further interfere with the operation and guidance of fighters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radar</b> signal <b>detection</b> {{is mostly}} based in {{conventional}} radar systems on statistical methods. These methods are computationally expensive and often only optimal for {{one type of}} clutter distribution. More recent approaches in <b>radar</b> signal <b>detection</b> consider also artificial neural networks as detectors. These approaches have up to now only treated clutter environments with homogenous distributed clutter. With this project mixed clutter environments were addressed. The experiments with different artificial neural network architectures showed that only a multilayer perceptron architecture could solve the task of <b>radar</b> signal <b>detection.</b> This architecture achieved a good performance in mixed clutter environment compared to a conventional detector.

5|$|The Lockheed Have Blue {{was born}} out of a {{requirement}} to evade <b>radar</b> <b>detection.</b> During the Vietnam War, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) posed a significant threat to US aircraft. As such, strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{designed}} to minimize its radar-signature through stealth (low-observability). This anti-radiation drone is designed to target enemy air-defense systems in a first line of attack, as the small drone (with its small Radar Cross Section) can evade SAMs and <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> systems which are designed to target much larger aircraft or to intercept fixed-trajectory missiles.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{modernization}} the <b>radar's</b> <b>detection</b> performance is efficiently improved. Modernized radar features automatic tracking capability as well as data receiving from other radar sensors. Data can be exchanged over a variety of communication channels in approved format.|$|R
30|$|Once the {{trajectory}} has been estimated, all radar scans can be mapped to world coordinates. By overlaying the scans on the estimated trajectory, a radar map is obtained. Each pixel now describes how many <b>radar</b> <b>detections</b> {{that have occurred}} in that coordinate.|$|R
40|$|Data fusion {{algorithms}} must typically address {{not only}} kinematic issues—that is, target tracking—but also nonkinematics—for example, target identification, threat estimation, intent assessment, etc. Whereas kinematics involves traditional measurements such as <b>radar</b> <b>detections,</b> nonkinematics typically involves nontraditional measurements such as quantized data,attributes, features, natural-language statements, and inference rules...|$|R
25|$|June 1959: The Land panel {{provisionally}} selects the A-11 over FISH, instructing {{both companies}} to re-design their aircraft. In July, the Land panel rejected both the Convair and Lockheed proposals. The Convair FISH used unproven ramjet engine technology {{and would be}} launched from a modified B-58B Hustler which was canceled in June. The susceptibility of the A-11 to <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> was considered too great. On 20 August, both firms provided specifications for their revised proposals.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{withdrawn}} from daylight fighting, the Bf 110 enjoyed later {{success as a}} night fighter, where its range and firepower stood it in good stead {{for the remainder of}} the war. The airframe allowed for a dedicated radar operator, and the open nose had space for radar antennae, unlike the single-engine fighters. As the war wore on, the increased weight of armament and <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> equipment (along with a third crew member) took an increasing toll of the aircraft's performance.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{off from}} Sharm el-Sheikh, {{the task force}} flew along the {{international}} flight path over the Red Sea, mostly flying at a height {{of no more than}} 30m (100ft) to avoid <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and passed south of Djibouti. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya, likely across Somalia and the Ogaden area of Ethiopia. They turned west, passing through the African Rift Valley and over Lake Victoria.|$|E
30|$|It can {{therefore}} be seen that {{the analysis of the}} time-circulating cooperative jamming is similar to the power-cooperative jamming when the entire time-circulating cooperative jamming process is divided. Therefore, this paper mainly discusses selection of the jamming parameters and the <b>radar’s</b> <b>detection</b> performance when using time-synchronized cooperative jamming.|$|R
25|$|In July 1952, after a {{build-up}} {{of hundreds}} of sightings over the previous few months, a series of <b>radar</b> <b>detections</b> coincident with visual sightings were observed near the National Airport in Washington, D.C.

25|$|Another {{result of}} this {{reorganization}} is that the wing assumed the <b>radar</b> <b>detection,</b> warning, and control mission and assigned six Aircraft Control & Warning Squadrons (AC Sq) to perform this mission. Two of these squadrons, the 113th AC Sq and the 119th AC Sq, were federalized ANG squadrons, which were returned to state control in December, while their personnel and equipment were transferred to the 700th AC Sq. In the spring of 1953, five new AC Sqs were activated at Grenier AFB for transfer to stations in Canada. These squadrons were all reassigned to Northeast Air Command shortly after their activation. The 614th AC Sq moved to Georgia and was reassigned later in December.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have raised}} {{doubts about the}} use of canards on a low-observable design, stating that canards would {{guarantee}} <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> and a compromise of stealth. However, canards and low-observability are not mutually exclusive designs. Northrop Grumman's proposal for the U.S. Navy's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) incorporated canards on a stealthy airframe. Lockheed Martin employed canards on a stealth airframe for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program during early development before dropping them due to complications with aircraft carrier recovery. McDonnell Douglas and NASA's X-36 featured canards and was considered to be extremely stealthy. Radar cross-section can be further reduced by controlling canard deflection through flight control software, as is done on the Eurofighter.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{contract}} with the U.S. Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force provided for the design and construction of a small experimental system to determine at the beginning whether the idea was practicable. The designs of communication and <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> equipment {{available at the time}} were known to be unsuited to the weather and atmospheric conditions to be encountered in the Arctic. Prototypes of several stations were designed and built in Alaska and in a rural section of Illinois in 1953. While few of the original designs for either buildings or equipment were retained, the trial installations did prove that the DEW Line was feasible, and they furnished a background of information that led to the final improved designs of all facilities and final plans for manpower, transportation, and supply.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} bombers {{had a slight}} {{performance}} advantage over fighters due to having multiple engines and streamlined, but heavy, cantilever wing designs, so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position {{in front of the}} bombers. Before World War II and the invention of <b>radar,</b> <b>detection</b> systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs these systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. This balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little that could be done about it. For Britain, the answer was to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a deterrent force.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, SAC {{had begun}} moving to {{low-level}} penetration which greatly reduced <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> distances. At the time, SAMs were ineffective against low-flying aircraft, and interceptor aircraft had {{less of a}} speed advantage at low altitudes. The Air Force's Tactical Air Command (TAC) was largely concerned with the fighter-bomber and deep strike/interdiction roles. TAC {{was in the process}} of receiving its latest design, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, which was designed to deliver nuclear weapons fast and far, but required long runways. A simpler variable geometry wing configuration with the pivot points farther out from the aircraft's centerline was reported by NASA in 1958, which made swing-wings viable. This led Air Force leaders to encourage its use. In June 1960, the USAF issued specification SOR 183 for a long-range interdiction/strike aircraft able to penetrate Soviet air defenses at very low altitudes and high speeds. The specification also called for the aircraft to operate from short, unprepared airstrips.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, {{the federal}} {{government}} obtained its first criminal conviction of a wind power operator for killing protected birds {{in violation of the}} 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Duke Energy plead guilty, and was fined $1 million, for the deaths of 160 birds, including 14 golden eagles, at two wind farms in Wyoming. The Justice Department charged that Duke had designed and sited the turbines knowing that they would kill birds; Duke noted that it had self-reported the bird deaths, and that US Fish and Wildlife Service guidelines for reducing bird deaths by wind turbines had not been issued when the turbines were built. After they were charged, Duke implemented a <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> system, at a cost of $600,000 per year, designed to turn off turbines when approached by large birds; the company noted that the system was working, as no golden eagle deaths had been observed {{in more than a year}} of operation since the radar was installed.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Goose Green, the British effort was now free to {{concentrate}} on Port Stanley (called Puerto Argentino by the Argentines). From the period between May 2 to May 28, there were three Vulcan sorties planned, but only one was carried out against Base Aérea Militar Malvinas. Argentine sources reveal that two soldiers were slightly injured but no damage was done to the airstrip. Another attempt against the airstrip was carried out during May 24. A package of four GR3s, flying at very low level to avoid <b>radar</b> <b>detection,</b> managed to drop retarding fuse bombs right on the runway. They were supported by two Sea Harriers tossing air burst bombs from high altitude to deceive the air defences. The low-angle fall, however, produced only surface damage, which was repaired six hours after the strike. Argentine sources acknowledge that a Pucará and an Aermacchi were also damaged. One of the GR3s was also hit either by debris, according to the British version, or by antiaircraft fire, according to Argentine sources.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1953, the 48th FIS, which was converting from World War II era F-47 Thunderbolts to F-84 Thunderjet aircraft, moved from Grenier AFB, New Hampshire to Langley AFB, Virginia and {{was assigned to the}} wing. In February 1953, another major reorganization of ADC activated Air Defense Groups at ADC bases with dispersed fighter squadrons. Air Defense Groups were assigned to defense wings and assumed direct control of the fighter squadrons at those bases, as well as support squadrons to carry out their role as the USAF host organizations at the bases. As a result of this reorganization, the 525th Air Defense Group activated at New Castle. The reorganization also resulted in the wing adding the <b>radar</b> <b>detection,</b> control and warning mission, and it was assigned four Aircraft Control & Warning Squadrons (AC Sq) to perform this mission, although one was reassigned a few months later. In the same reorganization, the wing was reassigned to the 26th Air Division. Fighter squadrons of the wing converted to newer aircraft during the year, the 48th FIS joined the other squadrons of the wing in flying Starfires, although the 95th FIS abandoned its Starfires for F-86 Sabres.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{developments}} of the Luftwaffe had a considerable impact on operations {{in the first half}} of 1944. Harris' new offensive, which culminated in the Battle of Berlin suffered heavy losses and failed to win the war outright, as Harris had expected. The plan was to break German morale at a projected cost of 500 bombers. The mission failed, moreover costing Bomber Command 1,128 bombers compared to German losses of just 256 fighters. Harris sought to reduce losses by introducing the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter to protect the bombers. However, the Bristol Beaufighter was selected instead, which proved inadequate until eventually it was replaced by the Mosquito. In the air during this period, technology and tactics favored the fighter. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, by early July 1944 RAF intelligence discovered the facts of the Monica tail warning sets being detected by the Flensburg gear when a Ju 88G-1 equipped with it and the latest model of the VHF-band SN-2 Lichtenstein radar landed by mistake in England, and similarly their H2S bomb-aiming radar by the Naxos device, and curtailed their use of H2S, rendering these three German AI radar and <b>radar</b> <b>detection</b> methods far less effective. The higher-frequency American H2X bombing radar, operating in the 10GHz frequency range, however is not known to have been detected by any Luftwaffe radio technology that existed before the end of the war.|$|E
