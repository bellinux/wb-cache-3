It is important to hold a study about the prevalence of RF and GABHS and their susceptibility to antibiotics in the Kyrgyz Republic. Materials and Methods: We have studied 200 children with chronic tonsillopharyngitis at the National Center of Pediatrics and Child Surgery in Bishkek (the Kyrgyz Republic) from August till September 2008. 188 (48 out of them are with <b>RF)</b> <b>out</b> of total 200 children are Kyrgyz and 12 are Russian (2 out of them are with RF). 111 out of total are female (34 out of them are with RF) and 89 are male (17 out of them are with RF). The average age of the subjects is 10. 9 ± 6. 0 (from 3 to 17 years old). The presence of GABHS was assessed using two ways: by the rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for outcrop of streptococcus antigen in smear from mucosal surface of tonsils, and by bacterial culture analysis (BA).

There are performances and safety concerned that when the RF transmitters are used in the metallic enclosed environments. In this paper, the field distributions inside a confined room were investigated with multiple portable Wi-Fi devices.

The geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) was applied for the multiple reflections off the ground and walls.
