The earliest irrigation projects focused on Kyaukse where Burmans built a large number of new weirs and diversionary canals, and Minbu a similarly well-watered district south of Pagan. After these hubs had been developed, in the mid-to-late 12th century, Pagan moved into as yet undeveloped frontier areas west of the Irrawaddy and south of Minbu. These new lands included both irrigable wet-rice areas and non-irrigable areas suitable for <b>rain-fed</b> <b>rice,</b> pulses, sesame, and millet. Agricultural expansion and temple construction in turn sustained a market in land and certain types of labour and materials.

Rice is typically cultivated in river valleys and plains on diverse soil types although heavy soil types are preferred as they can retain moisture for a longer period. To assess the effects of soil bunds on the production of <b>rain-fed</b> lowland <b>rice,</b> the crop was cultivated in bunded and non-bunded farmers’ plots under the common agronomic practices in the region, in three successive seasons on Grumic Calcic Vertisols (Pellic). For the three seasons and for the two plot types, crop transpiration was simulated with the BUDGET soil water balance model by using the observed weather data, soil and crop parameters. Comparison between the observed yields and the simulated crop transpiration yielded an exponential relationship with a determination factor of 0. 87 and an RMSE of 0. 15 tonnes ha− 1. With the validated soil water balance model crop yields that can be expected in bunded and non-bunded fields were subsequently simulated for wet, normal and dry years and various environmental conditions. Yield comparison shows that soil bunds can appreciably increase the production of <b>rain-fed</b> lowland <b>rice</b> in south eastern Tanzania in three quarters of the years (wet and normal years) when the soil profile is slow draining (KSAT equal to or less than 10 mm day− 1). In normal years a minimum yield increase of 30 % may be expected on those soil types. In wet years and when the soil hardly drains (drainage class of 0 – 5 mm day− 1), the yield may even double.

Rhamphicarpa fistulosa occurs in at least 36 African countries, 28 of which produce rice in rain-fed lowlands where this species thrives.

This study assessed farmers’ awareness, use, preference and adoption criteria of parasitic weed management practices in <b>rain-fed</b> <b>rice</b> production environments in Tanzania. Surveys and workshops were organized in three affected rice growing areas in Morogoro-rural, Songea and Kyela district, supplemented with on-farm experiments in Kyela. In all districts, farmers {{were aware of}} the locally occurring parasitic weed species, Rhamphicarpa fistulosa (lowland) and Striga asiatica (upland), and they considered these weeds more problematic than non-parasitic weeds. Though they mostly practise hand weeding, farmers were aware {{of a wide range of}} control options. Local access, affordability, ease of implementation and control efficacy were considered important criteria for adoption, whereas trade-offs, like lack of preferred grain quality traits in resistant varieties, were mentioned as an important break on adoption. Based on informal discussions with farmers, altered sowing times, resistant rice varieties and soil amendments were marked as feasible control options and tested in a farmer-participatory manner in four years of experimentation in upland and lowland fields. In both types of fields, the contribution of soil amendment to parasitic weed suppression was not evident, but rice husk was marked as a suitable and cheap alternative to inorganic fertilizers. Control of R. fistulosa in lowlands was perceived to be best realized by early crop establishment, escaping major parasite damage due to the relatively slow early development of this weed species. The local variety Supa India, appreciated for its grain qualities and marketability, remained the preferred variety. For the control of S. asiatica, late planting was preferred, requiring a short-duration variety to minimize risk of drought stress during grain filling. The short-duration NERICA- 10 was most preferred, as it combined a favourable short cycle length with resistance to S. asiatica and good grain appearance. Farmer participation in technology testing showed to be crucial in defining locally adapted and acceptable parasitic weed control strategies. Yet, it is argued that without lifting important constraints related to credit and input supply, it will be impossible to sustainably solve the parasitic weed problem in <b>rain-fed</b> <b>rice.</b> </p...|$|E

The present study fills this gap by analyzing WP in Bangladesh using panel data of 21 districts over 37 years (1968 - 2004) divided into three phases. It estimated levels of, and trends in, WPs of one irrigated rice (rabi) crop, and two mainly <b>rain-fed</b> (kharif) <b>rice</b> crops, with occasional supplementary irrigation.

Overall, WP growth rates varied significantly among districts and between phases with no consistent pattern emerging. On the whole, WPs trended upwards while differing widely among districts and between phases, seasons, ecosystems and areas differentiated by physiographic characteristics. The 1980 s represented a period of stagnation. Drought-prone areas grew faster while salinity-prone areas grew slower vis-à-vis non-drought and non-saline areas. In the Ganges-dependent area, WP grew faster than that in the non-Ganges-dependent area. Rice production in Bangladesh represented a highly groundwater-dependent and fossil fuel-using process with significant environmental implications suggesting that WP growth may be unsustainable. Sustaining WP growth required a range of market and non-market-based policy options...|$|R
40|$|In the Highlands of Madagascar, rice is {{the staple}} crop and food. To face {{the growing demand}} for rice, CIRAD and Fofifa {{developed}} upland rice varieties adapted to the conditions of high elevation areas. However, upland rice was more susceptible to bio-aggressor attacks than rainfed lowland rice, and especially susceptible to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of blast disease. Due to the economical situation of Madagascar farmers, the use of pesticides is limited. Integrated strategies have to be built {{for the management of}} the blast disease. Based on results obtained on rice or other crops, we considered two directions: a) the effect of direct-seeded, mulch-based cropping systems, first used in Madagascar to reduce erosion and soil degradation, b) the effect of cultivar mixtures. Our first results show a significant slow-down of the dynamic of blast epidemic with both management practices. However, no significant difference was detected when the final sanitary state of the crop is considered. This is probably due to the very high susceptibility of the cultivar examined. Nevertheless, it seems possible to improve the system in order to achieve an efficient and sustainable management of the disease. Modelling approaches will be helpful to optimize the cropping systems and the cultivar mixture arrangements. In Madagascar, rice is the staple crop and food. The Highlands are densely populated and farmers traditionally grow irrigated or <b>rain-fed</b> lowland <b>rice</b> wherever possible, with admirable developments in inland valleys and terraces on hillsides.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out {{to learn about the}} drought pattern and its impact on rice mono {{cropping}} in Williamnagar (East Garo Hills district of Meghalaya) having rice based mono cropping system. The rainfall analysis was done based on twelve years (1998 - 2009) daily rainfall data to study monthly, seasonal and yearly drought of Williamnagar based on India Meteorological Department (IMD) protocols. The average annual rainfall of Williamnagar is 3246 mm with 115 numbers of rainy days. During the twelve years period no extreme and moderate drought years were experienced, but there were mild drought occurrences in nine years. The frequency of drought month recorded for the January, February, November and December was 8, 6, 7 and 10, respectively out of 12 years of record. This study revealed that for growing <b>rain-fed</b> <b>rice</b> during monsoon farmers of this region may depend on monsoon as there was hardly any drought occurrence. This study reveal that, winter rice, may needs assured irrigation, because there is fair chance of occurrence of moderate drought during November to February due to very less post monsoon rainfall...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{areas of}} <b>rain-fed</b> <b>rice</b> in the Sahel, savannah nd derived savannah zones of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Madagascar and other Indian Ocean Islands are infested by {{parasitic}} weeds. The affected area accommodates {{some of the}} poorest farmers of the world. Without appropriate management parasitic weeds in rice are expected to increase in importance in SSA due to their general invasive nature and their abilities to adapt to changing conditions such as imposed by predicted climate changes. The most important parasitic weeds in rice are: Striga hermonthica, Striga asiatica, Striga aspera and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa. The first two are primarily found in free-draining uplands while S. aspera is also found on hydromorphic soils and R. fistulosa is restricted to unimproved lowlands including inland valleys. As parasitic weeds are typical production constraints in subsistence rice production, targeting them would directly contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the problems caused by parasitic weeds in rice and discusses management options and opportunities for research for development...|$|E
40|$|The vast 200 million {{hectares}} of wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa represent a {{great potential for}} food production if effectively utilized, says {{a report from the}} International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. According to Dr. F. R Moorman, a soil scientist from the Netherlands, and Dr. A. S. R. Juo, the Director of IlTA's farming systems programme African farmers are by tradition and choice dryland farmers. They prefer well-drained upland to hydromorphic areas (wetlands) for food crop production. The scientists argue that the use of wetlands for intensive rice production in tropical Africa will require a basic change in the existing farming systems of mixed cropping and traditional gathering of forest products. A study carried out in some West African countries indicates that the sub-Saharan wetlands can support largescale production of crops, such as rice, wheat, sorghum, millet, maize, cowpea and vegetables. According to the IITA report, irrigation projects in Africa are in their infancy and this situation should evolve from the present marginal and unstable <b>rain-fed</b> <b>rice</b> cultivation to intensive lowland or paddy production.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{development of the}} rice sector in Ghana is constrained by environmental,socioeconomic, research and development factors. Productivity is generally low, about 1 mt/ha underupland and <b>rain-fed</b> lowland <b>rice</b> ecologies which dominate rice production systems in the country. Therelease and diffusion of the New Rice for Africa (NERICA) varieties across many countries in Africa(including Ghana) brought renewed hope to both farmers and the research community because of thedesirable qualities associated with the NERICAs, and therefore their potential to improve food securityon a sustainable basis. This study therefore sought to assess the extent of exposure and adoption ofthe NERICA varieties across the rice growing districts in Ghana, and determine the key factors thataffect adoption. A total of 489 rice producing households from three districts (Ejura-Sekyedumase,Hohoe and Tolon-Kumbungu) {{were involved in the}} study. The study employs the average treatmenteffect (ATE) methodology which provides an appropriate framework for the identification andconsistent estimation of the population adoption rate and that of the determinants of adoption. Thestudy finds that exposure to NERICA varieties is generally low in Ghana with an average rate of about 6 %. Similarly, the adoption of improved rice varieties is low, and the adoption of NERICA varieties isabout 6 % of the total sample surveyed. The study shows that experience, education and location areimportant determinants of exposure, while age and access to extension also affect adoption. It istherefore recommended that much effort and resources should be invested in promotional activities tofacilitate both the exposure and adoption of the NERICAs among farmers in Ghana...|$|R

Rice farming is the main economic activity of inhabitants of the upper plains. These communities consist of farming groups who cultivate <b>rain-fed</b> or irrigated <b>rice</b> paddies. They tend to live in small family groups or villages. In general, each family cultivates a field prepared by slash and burn techniques, where rice, cucumbers, occasionally corn, and other vegetables are grown. Usually {{a number of different}} traditional varieties of rice are grown, each one adapted to different soil types and water conditions. The farmers use animal fertilizers and traditional farming techniques, such as the swing plow pulled by oxen or buffalo.

40|$|Bangladesh {{has made}} notable {{progress}} in achieving food security, despite extreme population pressures, limited land resources, and an agrarian structure dominated by small and tenant farmers. After {{two decades of}} sluggish performance prior to the late 1980 s, the production of rice—the dominant staple food—has increased much faster than the population. The development of minor irrigation, particularly private, investment-based expansion of shallow tubewells, has contributed to this impressive performance, and was an outcome of the government’s market liberalization policy for irrigation equipment in the late 1980 s. This policy promoted rapid expansion of irrigated “boro” rice farming in the dry season. The fast diffusion of boro <b>rice</b> in the <b>rain-fed,</b> low-yielding “aus” <b>rice</b> area contributed to accelerated growth in rice productivity, {{a reduction in the}} unit cost of production, and a decline in real rice prices. Together, these factors have been a major factor behind attainment of food security and moderately reduced poverty in Bangladesh over the last two decades.
