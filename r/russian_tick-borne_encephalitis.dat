Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H MRS) is an imaging method that provides additional information about the metabolic characteristics of brain tissues. The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to describe brain metabolites using short echo time single-voxel (1) H MRS in dogs with confirmed <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> and compare them with healthy dogs. Inclusion criteria for the affected dogs were neurological symptoms suggestive of <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> previous endemic stay and tick-bite, diagnostic quality brain MRI and (1) H MRS studies, and positive antibody titers or confirmation of <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> with necropsy. Control dogs were 10, clinically normal beagles that had been used in a previous study. A total of six affected dogs met inclusion criteria. All dogs affected with <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> had (1) H MRS metabolite concentration alterations versus control dogs. These changes included mild to moderate decreases in N-acetyl aspartate and creatine peaks, and mild increases in glutamate/glutamine peaks. No lactate or lipid signal was detected in any dog.

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> {{virus is}} an {{important}} human pathogen in Europe. The infection usually presents as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or meningoencephalomyelitis and only rarely as symptoms of isolated myeloradiculitis. We describe the lumbar MR imaging finding in a 48 -year-old man with serologically confirmed <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> {{in which there was}} enhancement of the ventral surface of the conus and the anterior nerve roots from the T 12 level extending {{along the length of the}} ventral cauda. <b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (TBE) is endemic in many parts ofcentral, eastern, and northern Europe, with about 3000 cases reported annually. It is caused by a flavivirus—the <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, or TBEv—which is transmitted into humans by tick bites. The clinical spectrum of the infection ranges from subclinical infection to meningitis, meningoen-cephalitis, and meningoencephalomyelitis. 1, 2 In about 5 % of cases, the infection presents as myeloradiculitis without obvi-ous symptoms of meningoencephalitis. 3 The diagnosis is made serologically. 1, 2 The MR imaging finding of the brai...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is {{a serious}} disease of the central nervous system. It is caused by <b>tick-borne</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, which is {{transmitted}} by ticks.
