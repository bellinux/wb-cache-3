50|$|On {{the night}} of December 4, 1884, near the post office opening <b>reception,</b> a <b>fire</b> occurred.

50|$|The Stamford Yacht Club {{was formed}} in 1890, and the {{following}} year, William A. Lottimer was named its first Commodore. The 4 acre on the western shore were developed by N.W. Barrett of Bridgeport.

5000|$|Critical <b>reception</b> for <b>Fire</b> Make Thunder was {{generally}} favorable. Todd Lyons of About.com gave the album 4 out of 5 stars {{and described the}} album as [...] "evocative progressive metal, {{with the emphasis on}} the progressive" [...] saying it [...] "melts together from one track to the next to give it an artsy yet satisfying integrity". Ken McGrath of Blistering gave the album 7 out of 10, stating that it [...] "may require a little work initially from the listener", but called it a [...] "real charmer of an album" [...] consisting of [...] "sepia-toned memory spiral", [...] "big, fuzzy guitar chorus riffs" [...] and [...] "shimmering notes as if water dripping down glass". Bloody Disgusting's Jonathan Barkan defined the album as [...] "a sonic journey where new and amazing tones and sounds assault you from all sides constantly" [...] noting [...] "something very industrial … not referring to the electronic subgenre" [...] but a vision of [...] "steel factories … grimy smokestacks rising up, a dark smog cloud hanging overhead … it sounds fantastic".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>reception</b> to the <b>Fire</b> Phone was mixed. Although reviewers found Firefly and the Dynamic Perspective {{features}} {{to be significant}} differentiators, they also noticed several drawbacks. Such drawbacks include the 2013-level technical specs (including the lack of Bluetooth LE), the underdeveloped OS, its high price, and the exclusivity of the device to AT&Ts network. The hardware also received a mediocre reception: while some liked the design, others {{were concerned about the}} durability of the glass as well as the thickness and weight. However, the headphones were well received by at least one reviewer from Gizmodo, who said that [...] "all cheap headphones should at least be this great." ...|$|R
50|$|Set in Auckland, New Zealand {{the film}} centres around four Samoan boys: ladies' man Michael, party boy Sefa, good boy Albert, and weird Stanley, who {{although}} {{they are in their}} mid 20s to early 30s have a reputation for behaving immaturely at special occasions such as family weddings. After four particular incidents (Michael having sex with one of the bridesmaids in the wedding limousine; Albert dropping the bride while she was hoisted up on his shoulder; Sefa getting drunk and passing out while going through the wedding cake and the table; and Stanley setting a <b>reception</b> hall on <b>fire),</b> the local minister of their Samoan church rules that the four are to be banned from the wedding of Michael's brother, Sione.|$|R
60|$|The attacking Zulus {{heard the}} mockery of their fellows, and rushed forward {{again with a}} roar. But the Boers in the laager had found time to load, and they met with a warm <b>reception.</b> Reserving their <b>fire</b> till the Zulus were packed like sheep in a kraal, they loosed into them with the roers, and the warriors fell in little heaps. But I saw that {{the blood of the}} Umtetwas was up; they did not mean to be beaten back this time, and the end was near. See! six men had leapt on to a waggon, slain the man behind it, and sprung into the laager. They were killed there, but others followed, and then I turned my head. But I could not shut my ears to the cries of rage and death, and the terrible S'gee! S'gee! of the savages as they did their work of murder. Once only I looked up and saw poor Hans Botha {{standing}} on a waggon smiting down men with the butt of his rifle. The assegais shot up towards him like tongues of steel, and when I looked again he was gone.|$|R
