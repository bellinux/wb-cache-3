Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.|$|E

High-throughput approaches to investigate splicing have, however, been developed, such as: DNA microarray-based analyses, RNA-binding assays, and deep sequencing. These methods can be used to screen for polymorphisms or mutations in or around splicing elements that affect protein binding. When combined with splicing assays, including in vivo <b>reporter</b> <b>gene</b> assays, the functional effects of polymorphisms or mutations on the splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts can then be analyzed.|$|E

2500|$|Reporter genes: Some vectors {{may contain}} a <b>reporter</b> <b>gene</b> {{that allow for}} {{identification}} of plasmid that contains inserted DNA sequence. [...] An example is lacZ-α which codes for the N-terminus fragment of β-galactosidase, an enzyme that digests galactose. [...] A multiple cloning site is located within lacZ-α, and an insert successfully ligated into the vector will disrupt the gene sequence, resulting in an inactive β-galactosidase. [...] Cells containing vector with an insert may be identified using blue/white selection by growing cells in media containing an analogue of galactose (X-gal). Cells expressing β-galactosidase (therefore doesn't contain an insert) appear as blue colonies. White colonies would be selected as those that may contain an insert. Other commonly used reporters include green fluorescent protein and luciferase.|$|E

40|$|Polycomb group (Pc-G) {{proteins}} act to keep {{homeotic genes}} stably and heritably silenced during Drosophila development. Here, it is shown that Polycomb (Pc), {{one of the}} Pc-G proteins, acts as a transcriptional silencer in Drosophila embryos if tethered to <b>reporter</b> <b>genes</b> by the DNA binding domain of GAL 4 (i. e. as a GAL-Pc fusion protein). The results suggest that silencing by GAL-Pc requires the C-terminal portion of Pc, but not the chromodomain. If a pulse of Gal-Pc is provided, synthetic <b>reporter</b> <b>genes</b> are repressed, though only transiently. In contrast, <b>reporter</b> <b>genes</b> containing homeotic gene sequences remain stably and heritably silenced in a Pc-G gene-dependent fashion, even when GAL-Pc is no longer present. This implies that GAL-Pc recruits Pc-G proteins to DNA and suggests that maintenance of silencing requires the anchoring of Pc-G proteins to specific cis-regulatory sequences present in homeotic genes. The extent of DNA over which the Pc-G machinery acts is quite selective, as silencing established on one enhancer does not necessarily 'spread' to a juxtaposed synthetic enhancer...|$|R
2500|$|The DNA {{transmission}} {{capabilities of}} Agrobacterium have been vastly explored in biotechnology {{as a means}} of inserting foreign genes into plants. Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, (University of Ghent and Plant Genetic Systems, Belgium) discovered the gene transfer mechanism between Agrobacterium and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter the bacterium into an efficient delivery system for genetic engineering in plants. The plasmid T-DNA that is transferred to the plant is an ideal vehicle for genetic engineering. [...] This is done by cloning a desired gene sequence into the T-DNA that will be inserted into the host DNA. [...] This process has been performed using firefly luciferase gene to produce glowing plants. [...] This luminescence has been a useful device in the study of plant chloroplast function and as a <b>reporter</b> <b>gene.</b> It is also possible to transform Arabidopsis thaliana by dipping flowers into a broth of Agrobacterium: the seed produced will be transgenic. Under laboratory conditions, the T-DNA has also been transferred to human cells, demonstrating the diversity of insertion application.|$|E

40|$|The {{central dogma}} of {{molecular}} biology, namely {{the process by}} which information encoded in the DNA serves as the template for transcriptional activation of specific mRNA resulting in temporal and spatial control of the translation of specific proteins, stands at the basis of normal and pathological cellular processes. Serving as the primary mechanism linking genotype to phenotype, it is clearly of significant interest for in vivo imaging. While classically, imaging revolutionized the ability to phenotype the anatomical and physiological impact of induction of changes in gene expression, the preceding molecular events remained invisible. Reporter gene-based imaging techniques provide a window for in vivo visualization of such transcriptional activation events. In addition to the widespread use of fluorescent and bioluminescent <b>reporter</b> <b>genes</b> and development of a number of <b>reporter</b> <b>genes</b> for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, there has been significant progress in the development of <b>reporter</b> <b>genes</b> for MRI.

40|$|Correlation of {{quantities}} of transcriptional activators and repressors with the mRNA output of target genes {{is a central}} issue for modeling gene regulation. In multicellular organisms, both spatial and temporal differences in gene expression {{must be taken into}} account; this can be achieved by use of in situ hybridization followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
