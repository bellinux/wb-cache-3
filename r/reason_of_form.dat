40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} nature and place of the spear during the Anglo-Saxon period, based both on material remains and literary evidence. From their origins to {{the period of the}} migrations iron spear-head forms had remained conservative, typically leaf- shaped and often midribbed. Subsequent to the migrations traditional forms survive virtually unmodified throughout Merovingian times on the continent; but in England a divergent series of distinctly insular forms emerge, which are predominantly angular in profile. Separate groups are recognisable, defined by form and significant in chronological and geographical distribution. Smaller numbers of "later” groups are similarly distinguishable by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>form,</b> but dating is latterly more dependent on the less reliable evidence of comparison with manuscript illustrations. No formal break seems to occur at the Conquest, the later series extending uninterrupted into the earlier medieval period, with the effective break appearing instead during the twelfth century. Simply-made as well as complex, spears are the products of both humble and quality forges so that the critical examination of their composition forms a particularly useful index of the techniques of the Dark Age smith. The wide variety of spear-names are examined, showing something of the nature of different types of the weapon. And in the light of this, and with the aid of manuscript illustrations, it is possible to reconstruct the manner of use of the various kinds of darts and hand-spears mentioned in contemporary texts. Simultaneously the literature indicates a wider symbolic significance for the spear generally in Anglo-Saxon society. An attribute of the god Woden, it has recognisable poetic overtones of war and death. At the same time it is seen as the concrete symbol of the free man's status, and one of the insignia of Germanic kingship...|$|E

On this view, something qualifi es as law only if, roughly, it is collectively recognised as law and is constitutively capable of fulfi lling law’s function as an artifact.

According to author, the technologies of lie were created as a result of distortion of Catholicism, departure from a true spiritual component. This policy was considered by its carriers as a competition form. The author considers that misstatement of Orthodoxy was possible to a lesser extent because of its traditional dogmatism; the Russian imperial power did not use technologies of lie at the wide nation-wide and geopolitical level. The phenomenon existed only in local cultures. In article the social and economic and political <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> <b>of</b> these technologies in the Russian Empire and Western Siberia, their manifestations and a consequence are analyzed.

The high value of the activation energy indicate that the driving force of the clustering process is high. In Li-containing aluminium alloy, preferential clustering of lithium-vacancy pairs is thought to occur during solution treatment and quenching, since lithium possesses a higher vacancy binding energy than zinc or magnesium does. The diffusion of Zn and Mg atoms is slowed down because of preferential formation of Li-vacancy aggregates in the alloy, when Li atoms are present in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> solution. The activation energy associated with the precipitation of the θ ` phase was found 61. 63 kJ mol − 1.

The third-party doctrine serves two critical functions. First, the doctrine ensures the technological neutrality of the Fourth Amendment. It corrects for the substitution effect of third parties that would otherwise allow savvy criminals to substitute a hidden third-party exchange for a previously public act. Second, the doctrine helps ensure the clarity of Fourth Amendment rules.
