5|$|In recent centuries the Mendips, {{like the}} Cotswolds to the north, have been quarried for stone {{to build the}} cities of Bath and Bristol, as well as smaller towns in Somerset. The {{quarries}} are now major suppliers of <b>road</b> <b>stone</b> to southern England, among them producing around twelve million tonnes of limestone every year, employing over two thousand people, and turning over approximately £150million per annum.|$|E
5|$|The cromlech was {{discovered}} in 1869 by workmen digging for <b>road</b> <b>stone.</b> An excavation later that year revealed human bones (now known to have belonged to at least 40 people), animal remains, and Neolithic pottery. Samples from the site show the tomb {{to have been in}} use for between 300 and 800years. North-West European lifestyles changed around 6000 BP, from the nomadic lives of the hunter-gatherer, to a settled life of agricultural farming: the Neolithic Revolution. However, analysis of the human remains found at Parc Cwm long cairn show the people interred in the cromlech continued to be either hunter-gatherers or herders, rather than agricultural farmers.|$|E

25|$|In Williamstown, NY183 {{winds through}} fields of Williamstown, {{entering}} a five-way intersection with Grant Road, Gifford <b>Road,</b> <b>Stone</b> Hill Road and Sargent Davis Road. The route bends {{further to the}} northeast, entering the hamlet of Williamstown, passing baseball fields and a local cemetery. A short distance later, NY183 meets with NY13 at a T-intersection {{in the center of}} Williamstown. This intersection serves as the northern terminus of NY183.|$|E
25|$|After the junction, NY137 {{continues}} northward {{through the}} town of Pound Ridge, soon entering the hamlet with the same name. The hamlet consists of several residences, commercial businesses and most importantly, a junction with the eastern terminus of NY172 (Pound Ridge Road). After bending northeast out of downtown, NY137 passes the Hiram Halle Memorial Library and into a junction with NY124 (Salem Road). At this junction, NY137 bends north, intersects with a connector road to NY124 then turns northwest on Stone Hill <b>Road.</b> <b>Stone</b> Hill Road is a two-lane wooded street, and NY137 proceeds northwest {{through the town}} of Pound Ridge past a pond. A short distance later, residences appear along the highway as it climbs westward along Stone Hill.|$|E
25|$|Photographs {{taken in}} the late 19th century show the horse-drawn wagons passing {{in front of the}} {{lighthouse}} and portray the substantial railway incline and storage area. At times the production outstripped the storage capacity and a photograph shows at least three piles of different grades of <b>road</b> <b>stone</b> stockpiled in front of the lighthouse enclosure. The track at the crusher had a siding that ran to the crusher and a set of points that led to the Quarry Pier main line. The Ailsa Craig Granite Company was never a financially sound business and effectively closed in 1928. The course of the mineral line is still evident near the quarries as a linear embankment that ends below Kennedy's Nag. Various artefacts of the quarry enterprise remain, including concrete blocks at Kennedy's Nag and steel and concrete remnants of the stone crusher near the south foghorn.|$|E
50|$|Despite booming development, many upper-middle {{and upper}} class {{residential}} areas towards {{the outskirts of}} town, particularly on the northern side, have remained tranquil and comprise wooded acres, winding <b>roads,</b> <b>stone</b> walls, trees, lakes, and streams.

25|$|Ailsa Craig had two quite {{separate}} {{rail transport}} systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, oil fuel and provisions to the lighthouse and gas works via the North Port {{and later the}} New Jetty and the other transported <b>road</b> <b>stone</b> from the quarries at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board's tramway had a section worked via a powered cable way that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the New jetty. This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 3 feet with junction/points at the gas works and a further set of points {{that led to a}} siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the gas works to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs on down to the lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to {{the southern end of the}} lighthouse buildings block. This section of the line was worked by hand and at least two wagons remain at the site together with a set of spare wheels at the gas works.|$|E
25|$|The mineral {{line was}} built by the Ailsa Craig Granite Company Ltd. in 1909 and ran from the quarry at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher near the south foghorn to the Quarry Pier. This crudely {{constructed}} narrow gauge line was mainly horse drawn, although wagons were also moved by hand or hauled up inclines by winding engines. The mineral railway at the quarry end had a least one siding and a mobile steam crane loaded the larger granite blocks into the wagons that were transported to the stone crusher at the Trammins near the south foghorn, smaller stones being loaded and even moved by hand. Wagons or bogies were winched up to the substantial stone crusher and gravity was used to deliver the different grades of <b>road</b> <b>stone</b> to the waggons below that were then hauled by horses to the Quarry Pier via a line that ran {{in front of the}} lighthouse buildings and took a tight right-angled bend to run up the substantial stone-built incline to the storage area in preparation for delivery via sea to the mainland. Curb stones and stone railway sleepers for sections of the Scotch gauge horse-drawn railway from Ardrossan to Doura were also produced.|$|E
500|$|Workmen {{digging for}} <b>road</b> <b>stone</b> {{discovered}} {{the site in}} 1869. John Lubbock and Hussey Vivian excavated it that year, believing {{it to be a}} round barrow. The excavation revealed human bones that were [...] "much broken and in no regular arrangement", animal remains ("deer and swine's teeth"), and sherds of [...] "plain Western Neolithic pottery". The bones, initially thought to heve been disturbed by repeated access or subsequent interments, were at first thought to be from 20–24individuals, all of whom except three were adults. Archaeologists Alasdair Whittle and Michael Wysocki note that such estimates were commonly based on the [...] "numbers of skulls or mandibles", and recent analysis has shown the bones to be from at least 40individuals. Following the excavation, most of the human remains were reburied in clay pots beneath their original contexts, some are held in the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford, England [...] with the animal and pottery remains [...] and the whereabouts of the remainder are unrecorded.|$|E
