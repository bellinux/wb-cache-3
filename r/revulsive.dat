60|$|The English, whether {{travellers}} or residents, came {{pouring in}} one great <b>revulsive</b> stream, {{back on their}} own country; and with them crowds of Italians and Spaniards. Our little island was filled even to bursting. At first an unusual quantity of specie made its appearance with the emigrants; but these people had no means of receiving back into their hands what they spent among us. With the advance of summer, and the increase of the distemper, rents were unpaid, and their remittances failed them. It was impossible to see these crowds of wretched, perishing creatures, late nurslings of luxury, and not stretch {{out a hand to}} save them. As {{at the conclusion of the}} eighteenth century, the English unlocked their hospitable store, for the relief of those driven from their homes by political revolution; so now they were not backward in affording aid to the victims of a more wide-spreading calamity. We had many foreign friends whom we eagerly sought out, and relieved from dreadful penury. Our Castle became an asylum for the unhappy. A little population occupied its halls. The revenue of its possessor, which had always found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature, was now attended to more parsimoniously, that it might embrace a wider portion of utility. It was not however money, except partially, but the necessaries of life, that became scarce. It was difficult to find an immediate remedy. The usual one of imports was entirely cut off. In this emergency, to feed the very people to whom we had given refuge, we were obliged to yield to the plough and the mattock our pleasure-grounds and parks. Live stock diminished sensibly in the country, from the effects of the great demand in the market. Even the poor deer, our antlered proteges, were obliged to fall for the sake of worthier pensioners. The labour necessary to bring the lands to this sort of culture, employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished manufactories.|$|E

40|$|The Theater {{becomes a}} trench of {{resistance}} against the pretensions of hiding {{the bodies and}} to gobble the parties. It becomes a <b>revulsive</b> expression that can question the very foundations of what is established. Thus, genuine scenic discourses speeches emerge, breaking through the cracks, slipping through the suburbs of the established. And they do so {{in response to the}} multiple faces of the creative act, standing against the designs of the tabula rasa globalization. Man is again treated from his most immediate dimension, his essential measure: his body...|$|E
40|$|Essential oils (EOs) are {{extremely}} complex mixtures containing compounds of several different functional-group classes. A specific aromatic profile should {{be determined by}} gas-chromatography-mass detection methods, to define standards for their safety and efficacy. The chemical constituents of the essential oils, their flavour and their taste act both alone and in synergy, always determining a global psychosomatic action. The main therapeutic activities of the EOs are reported as spasmolythic, <b>revulsive,</b> anti-inflammatory and decongestant, immunomodulant, antimicrobial, antimycotic, expectorant, mucolythic, antioxidant, psychotrope, analgesic and acaricide. The use, posology, route of administration as well as toxicity and adverse effects are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{presents}} {{remarks about}} the category of “the margin” in modern Polish literature, and also an interpretation of Zbigniew Kopeć’s book, Niepokorni. Brudni. Źli. Ludzie marginesu w prozie polskiej XX wieku [The Angry, The Dirty, The Bad: People of the Margin in Polish Fic­tion of the 20 th Century]. The truth of the margin emerges from an en­counter with sheer existence, with life on the bottom, in places marked by suffering and evil, places that are sick, pathological, <b>revulsive,</b> and consequently abandoned by the better-off part of the society. A lit erature that approaches such places attempts to be a quest for pure and simple truth that is touching and deeply human. Kopeć’s and the present author’s remarks, presented in the article, are dedicated to such attempth made by Polish fiction writers of the 20 th century. </p...|$|E
40|$|James Joyce’s Ulysses celebrates all {{facets of}} daily life in its refusal to censor raw human {{emotions}} and emissions. He adopts a critically medical perspective to portray this honest, unfiltered narrative. In doing so, he reveals the ineffectiveness of the physician-patient relationship due to doctors’ paternalistic attitudes that hinder nonjudgmental, open listening of this unfiltered narrative. His exploration of the doctor’s moral scrutiny, cultural prejudices, and authoritative estrangement from the patient underscore the importance in remembering that physicians and patients alike are ultimately just fellow human beings. Wryly, he drives this point to literal nausea, as his narrative proudly asserts the <b>revulsive</b> details of public health, digestion, and death. In his gritty ruminations on the human body’s material reality, Joyce mocks the physician’s highbrow paternalism by forcing him {{to identify with the}} farting, vomiting, decaying bodies around him. In celebrating the uncensored human narrative, Joyce challenges physician and patient alike to openly listen to the stories of others...|$|E
40|$|West African “Peppertree ” [Xylopia aethiopica (Dunal) A. Rich, Annonaceae] is a slim, tall tree {{of about}} 60 – 70 cm in {{diameter}} and up to 15 – 30 m high with straight stem and a slightly stripped or smooth bark. It is widely distributed in the humid forest zones of West Africa especially along rivers in the dry country sides (Irvine 1961). Xylopia aethiopica has {{a wide variety of}} application, the very odorous roots of the plant are employed in West Africa in tinctures, administered orally to expel worms and other parasitic animals from the intestines, or in teeth-rinsing and mouth-wash extracts against toothaches. The fruits are also used in various forms and exhibit <b>revulsive</b> properties, especially when mashed with grains. These properties are used advantageously in the external treatment of rheumatism. Crushed powdered fruits can also be mixed with shea butter fat and coconut oil and used as creams, cosmetic products, and perfumes (Burkill 1985), and the dried fruits are also used as spices in the preparation of two special local soups named “obe ata ” and “isi-ewu” taken widely in the southwest and southeastern parts of Nigeria. Ekong and Ogan (1968), were the first to report on the chemical composition of Xylopia aethiopica, and several publications have appeared subsequently on this subject. A number of diterpenes from the bark, fruits, and pericarp of the plant have been reported, Faulkner et al. (1985); Rabunmi and Pieeru (1992); Harrigan et al. (1994). Ekundayo (1989) published a review of the volatiles in a number of Annonaceae species amon...|$|E
40|$|Up-regulation of CD 4 +CD 25 +CD 127 low/- {{regulatory}} T cells (Tregs) {{is a new}} {{target in}} the treatment of asthma. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can up-regulate CD 4 +CD 25 +CD 127 low/- regulatory T cells in vitro, meanwhile, heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{plays an important role in}} the development and maintenance of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells. However the mechanism has not yet been adequately understood. Hence, we wondered what effect of Heme Oxygenase- 1 made on regulation of CD 4 +CD 25 +CD 127 low/- regulatory T cells mediated by mesenchymal stem cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from asthmatic patients and healthy controls were co-cultured with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells which were pretreated with Hemin (the <b>revulsive</b> of Heme Oxygenase- 1), Protoporphyrin Ⅸ zinc (the inhibitor of Heme Oxygenase- 1) and saline. The expression of Heme Oxygenase- 1 in MSCs was enhanced by Hemin and inhibited by Protoporphyrin zinc in vitro. Overexpression of Heme Oxygenase- 1 elevated the proportion of CD 4 +CD 25 +CD 127 low/- regulatory T cells in CD 4 + T cells, meanwhile, inhibition of Heme Oxygenase- 1 decreased the proportion of CD 4 +CD 25 +CD 127 low/- regulatory T cells in CD 4 + T cells as compared with mesenchymal stem cells alone. Taken together, these data demonstrated that Heme Oxygenase- 1 contributed to the up-regulation of CD 4 +CD 25 +CD 127 low/- regulatory T cells mediated by mesenchymal stem cells in asthma...|$|E

40|$|The {{different}} {{options that}} the social democracy took on during the nineties are analyzed in this article. In a moment of changes and uncertainties {{with the loss of}} one of the ideological pivots in the left {{after the collapse of the}} called «real socialism», the dialogue between the different lefts of are intensified. One of the fruits of that confluence was the «Third way» of Guiddens/Blair, who wanted to monopolize the new ways for which the socialdemocracy had to go in a future. The work shows the existence of other «Third ways» in EE. UU and in Europe and sketches that the arrival of the antiglobalization ideas were the <b>revulsive</b> for the left, that it knew how to assimilate critically everything the happened at the end of the eighties and knew how to consider new alternatives, which situated in the map to a new socialdemocracy much more to the left than what wanted to see those «Third ways». Se analizan las diferentes opciones que adoptó la socialdemocracia durante los años 90. En un momento de cambios e incertidumbres con la pérdida de uno de los pivotes ideológicos en la izquierda tras el derrumbe del llamado «socialismo real», se intensificó el diálogo entre las diferentes izquierdas de ambos lados del atlántico. Uno de los frutos de esa confluencia fue la «Tercera Vía» de Guiddens/Blair, quienes quisieron monopolizar las nuevas vías por las que debiera discurrir la socialdemocracia en un futuro. El trabajo muestra la existencia de otras «Terceras vías» tanto en EE. UU como en Europa y esboza que la llegada de las ideas alterglobalizadoras fueron el verdadero revulsivo para la izquierda, que por fin supo asimilar críticamente todo lo sucedido a finales de los 80 y supo plantear nuevas alternativas, que situaron en el mapa a una nueva socialdemocracia mucho más a la izquierda que lo que quisieran ver esas «Terceras Vías»...|$|E
