5|$|The poem {{ends with}} the narrator turning towards his own fate, {{accepting}} his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is mysterious and tragic. Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs could not keep track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E

50|$|After the {{introduction}} of the p-adic numbers, it was shown that the Newton polygon is just as useful in questions of <b>ramification</b> <b>for</b> local fields, and hence in algebraic number theory. Newton polygons have also been useful in the study of elliptic curves.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} a ban {{may not be}} {{permanent}} and expire after {{a certain period of}} time. This approach is commonly used as a <b>ramification</b> <b>for</b> the abuse of game glitches, harassing players, or benefiting from hackers. Temporary bans may also be utilized in case a violation cannot be fully proven, as is common with anti-cheating methods based on supervision or statistical detection.|$|R
5|$|Loyal to {{the concept}} of the British Empire, Bruce envisaged {{strengthening}} it through mutual economic development, greater political cooperation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her dominions {{in a wide range of}} areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the Chanak Crisis, British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with Greece had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to the crisis was eventually found, dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{his tenure}} is {{associated}} with a major success of long-term significance, the capture of Malta. Of all the islands around Sicily, this was the last to remain in Byzantine hands, and in 869 a fleet under Ahmad ibn Umar ibn Ubaydallah ibn al-Aghlab al-Habashi attacked it. The Byzantines, having received timely reinforcements, resisted successfully at first, but in 870 Muhammad sent a fleet from Sicily to the island, and the capital Melite fell on 29 August 870. The local governor was captured, the town was plundered—Ahmad al-Habashi reportedly took along the local cathedral's marble columns to decorate his palace—and its fortifications razed. The fall of Malta had important <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> the defence of what remained of Byzantine Sicily: with Reggio in Calabria and now Malta in their hands, the Muslims completed their encirclement of the island, and could easily interdict any aid sent from the east.|$|E

40|$|It is {{now known}} that for any prime p and any finite semiabelian p-group G, there exists a (tame) {{realization}} of G as a Galois group over the rationals Q with exactly d = d(G) ramified primes, where d(G) is the minimal number of generators of G, which solves the minimal <b>ramification</b> problem <b>for</b> finite semiabelian p-groups. We generalize this result to obtain a theorem on finite semiabelian groups and derive {{the solution to the}} minimal <b>ramification</b> problem <b>for</b> a certain family of semiabelian groups that includes all finite nilpotent semiabelian groups G. Finally, we give some indication of the depth of the minimal <b>ramification</b> problem <b>for</b> semiabelian groups not covered by our theorem. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the theory that}} can enable the design of genetic algorithms and choose the parameters such {{that the proportion of}} the best building blocks grow. A practical schema theorem has been used for this purpose and its <b>ramification</b> <b>for</b> the choice of selection operator and parameterization of the algorithm is explored. In particular stochastic universal selection, tournament selection, and truncation selection schemes are employed to verify the results. Results agree with the schema theorem and indicate that it must be obeyed in order to ascertain sustained growth of good building blocks. The analysis suggests that schema theorem alone is insufficient to guarantee the success of a selectorecombinative genetic algorithm...|$|R

25|$|Mortality {{from white}} pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50–80% {{during the early}} 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on {{alternate}} hosts of the Ribes genus, the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that {{white pine blister rust}} might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants. The <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> wildlife and habitat ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.|$|E
25|$|Other {{supported}} methods, such {{as those}} outlined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review, include relying on three Ps: protection, prosecution, and prevention. Protection starts with enforcing strict measures on the matters of both trafficking and begging. For many nations {{the first step is}} the criminalization of begging and trafficking. Prosecution should be instituted in the form of greater legal <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> traffickers, with punishment focused on the exploiter rather than the exploited. This becomes difficult with respect to victims of familial trafficking, considering this would require changes in care placement and strict monitoring of each displaced child's welfare. Many organizations affirm that prevention begins with discouraging donations and improving services so that children, and families as a whole, have greater capabilities. Though well-intentioned, by giving child beggars money, individuals only make this practice more profitable, and soon these funds find their way {{into the hands of the}} child's abuser.|$|E

Registered religious organizations operate on a tax-free basis and are required to submit annual reports of their financial operations.

25|$|The Department is {{administered}} and {{governed by the}} Police Commissioner, who is appointed by the Mayor. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, the commissioner serves at the Mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law. However, a police commissioner who comes up from the uniformed ranks retains that status while serving as police commissioner. This has <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> their police pensions {{and the fact that}} any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm, and does retain the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners (like Ray Kelly) do carry a personal firearm, but they also have a full-time security detail from the Police Commissioner's (Detective) Squad.|$|E
25|$|Integer factorization, which underpins the {{security}} of public key cryptographic systems, {{is believed to be}} computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes). By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using Shor's algorithm to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to decrypt many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense {{that there would be a}} polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant <b>ramifications</b> <b>for</b> electronic privacy and security.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{languages}} {{written in a}} Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a Latin alphabet, such as Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Serbian and Romanian (in the Republic of Moldova until 1989, in Romania throughout the 19th century). After {{the disintegration of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of Transnistria, where Moldovan Cyrillic is official), Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan, but Uzbekistan still uses both systems. The Russian government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all federal subjects of Russia, to promote closer ties across the federation. This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as Chechen and Ingush speakers, the law had political <b>ramifications.</b> <b>For</b> example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{conventional}} economic approach to housing is subject to a plethora of weaknesses that renders it, at best, a rather limited basis for understanding housing markets. Conventional analyses assume market efficiency and clearing, and ‘rational’ individuals. These core assumptions present an unnecessarily restrictive view of human behaviour and the economic process. By emphasising utility maximisation and equilibrium, and abstracting from history and social institutions, the conventional approach effectively eschews any analysis of the central forces of the market process. The paper asserts {{that in order to}} achieve this analysts will have to recognise heterodox economic contributions on uncertainty, human behaviour, evolution and exchange.
