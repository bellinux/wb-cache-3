Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service.

Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
