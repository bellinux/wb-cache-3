We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that is a good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter.

Taishi Ci headed to Jing County, where he established a base and managed to recruit the Shanyue people to join him.

2500|$|The MTV {{cable channel}} {{and the band}} were {{launched}} {{at about the same}} time, and each had a hand in propelling the other to greater heights.

Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] was the greatest video I'd ever seen". The band's video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like Sri Lanka and Antigua, creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget [...] "band-playing-on-a-stage" [...] videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] riffs on Raiders of the Lost Ark, [...] "The Wild Boys" [...] on The Road Warrior, etc.). Videos were obviously headed in this direction already, but Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-September 1939, Freud's {{cancer of}} the jaw was causing him {{increasingly}} severe pain and had been declared to be inoperable. The last book he read, Balzac's La Peau de chagrin, prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty {{and a few days}} later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, Max Schur, reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: [...] "Schur, you <b>remember</b> <b>our</b> 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense." [...] When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, [...] "I thank you," [...] and then [...] "Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it." [...] Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3am on 23 September 1939. However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account. This proposes that Schur was absent from Freud's deathbed when a third and final dose of morphine was administered by Dr Josephine Stross, a colleague of Anna Freud's, leading to Freud's death around midnight on 23 September 1939.|$|E
