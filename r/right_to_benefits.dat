Social Security benefits include old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI); Medicare provides hospital insurance benefits for the elderly. The amount that one pays in payroll taxes throughout one's working career is associated indirectly with the social security benefits annuity that one receives as a retiree. This has caused some to claim that the payroll tax is not a tax because its collection is directly tied to benefits that one is entitled to collect later in life.

30|$|In {{the fall}} of 2012, the {{reaction}} of the Government to rising criticism for cynicism towards the long-term unemployed was the introduction of a number of “acute measures” to assist the long-term unemployed, who were at risk of losing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefits</b> in the spring of 2013. The measures included more intense counselling and activation and also a subsidy to make employers give priority to long-term unemployed when hiring for vacant positions. Furthermore unemployed who exhausted the right to unemployment benefits would become entitled to a new educational benefit for up to six months, if they undertook training after dropping out of the benefit system. The new benefit is equal to social assistance and thus somewhat lower than normal unemployment benefits. In spite of these measures, the issue of the shortening of the duration of benefits was still one of the hottest on the Danish political agenda.|$|E

40|$|Every {{acquisition}} of rights to prestations (benefit payments) from the Alimony Fund is always preceded with a realization of duty of alimony (art. 4 of the Alimony Fund Act of July 18, 1974). The notion of duty of alimony {{does not have a}} precise meaning. The author attempts at reconstructing a meaning of that notion. It is found in the conclusion that adll legal bonds conséquent upon familly law regulation, connecting the person entitled with the person obliged, are the grounds for appearance of duties of alimony. On the base of the adopted criterion all duties of providing the means of maintenance and possibly means of education established according to the regulation of art. 753 of Gode of Civil Procedure and Family and Guardianship Code have to be considered as duties of alimony. Next the author discusses the previous evolution and trends of developement of the studied piremise of {{acquisition of}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefits</b> from the Alimony Fund. The 1982 and 1984 amendments of. the Act prove, in the author's opinion, that a formerly tight bond between the existence and scope of duties of alimony and the existence and scope of the right to the Alimony Fund benefits is presently diminishing. Now, the benefits have in a lesser extent a substitute character vs. the unenforced. alimony payments as compared with the initial period of the Fund's functioning. It results from taking over alimony burdens by the State and discharging the obliged from the liability. It is mostly the case of those obliged to alimony payments in a further precedence. The author criticizes the postulates to develop the Fund in that direction. Such a trend would undoubtedly end up in eroding the institution of duty of alimony.

40|$|With {{prevalent}} volatilities in {{the global}} market compounded by unstable currencies, the impact of foreign exchange risk on the banking sector cannot be disregarded. While all banks are exposed to this risk, different types of banks respond differently depending on the underlying principles in their compliance structures. While conventional banks have a multiplicity of instruments at their disposal to help mitigate foreign exchange risk Islamic banks’ response to the same is restricted by the doctrines that govern their structures. Islamic banks’ mode of practice {{is based on the}} stringent principles of Shari’ah law which is mainly {{based on the premise that}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefits</b> has to be supported by proof of ownership and that in order to share profits one should share the costs. Moreover there is no profit without owning the underlying asset. Most of these principles contradict with the underlying principles in conventional banks. This difference in the way risk and reward is allocated and the way risk should be covered partly explains the variations in the level of risk shouldered by each type of banks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of foreign exchange risk on both the Islamic banks and the conventional banks. Thirteen countries in the Islamic world are assessed in an effort to test the hypotheses. The conclusion indicates that while foreign exchange makes a substantial contribution to the value of conventional banks, Islamic banks value is exposed to high sensitivity in the variations of exchange rate. Islamic banks as such shoulder a lot of foreign exchange risk. Moreover the study discovers that banks in Islamic countries are more exposed to US$ risk than other currencies. Furthermore Islamic banks are more exposed to US$ risk than conventional banks. This study aids the revelation that there is an urgent need in the Shari’ah law to incorporate acceptable measures to mitigate currency risk in Islamic banks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{report is}} a critical-realistic {{study of the}} role of the state in {{unemployment}} insurance in Denmark. The study examines the role played by the government in financing unemployment insurance and explores how the so-called activation of those with unemployment insurance has developed between 1967 and 2015. The first year under investigation is 1967 as that was the year when the Danish government took on the entire economic risk of unemployment insurance. Earlier, the economic risk was shared between the government and various unemployment insurance funds. The study examines selected unemployment insurance laws from the period, articles from that age, and historical analyses. This empirical data is subjected to a document analysis and is discussed with appeal to Gøsta Esping-Andersen’s theory of “The three worlds of welfare capitalisms”. In this theory, the author has developed three welfare state regimes: the liberal welfare regime, the corporative welfare regime, and the social democratic welfare regime. Denmark is itself a welfare state in the social democratic welfare regime, which is built on universalism, and invites the question how a freely-chosen unemployment insurance is part of a welfare state. To answer this, the report uses Esping- Andersens term “decommodification”, which is a measurement used to indicate the level of the citizen’s dependency on the market. For creating knowledge within the deep domain, this study uses Asbjørn Sonne Nørgaards theory of path dependency in the context of Danish unemployment insurance. This is done in order to investigate how and why the laws have not changed radically and how they are following a consistent path. The study concludes that the state’s role in unemployment insurance in Denmark has created a high level of decommodification and that there has not been significant changes in the financing of the unemployment insurance. This may be entailed by path dependency the consequence of which is an unchanging unemployment insurance system. The study concludes as well that there have been many changes in the activation of unemployment insured citizens. These changes include the ability of such citizens to reclaim their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefits</b> and whether the reasoning behind the activation is informed by the state’s desire to employ or educate the citizens. Furthermore, changes have affected why and where the government dictates activation for the unemployed in the private or the public sphere. The report concludes that the governmental decrees where unemployment insurance is concerned have effected a high level of economic security for unemployment insured citizens but at the same time a number of strict rules and incentives have been introduced to impel the insured citizens to return to the labour market through activation...|$|E
