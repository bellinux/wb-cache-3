40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the 15 -year and lifetime <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> contralateral <b>breast</b> cancer in breast cancer patients according {{to the age of}} diagnosis of the first cancer and the history <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer in the mother. The <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> contralateral <b>breast</b> cancer were estimated for all 78, 775 breast cancer patients in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database (age at diagnosis <b>of</b> first <b>breast</b> cancer < 70 years). The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> experiencing a contralateral breast cancer within 15 years of diagnosis was 8. 4 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 8. 1 - 8. 7 %] for women with an unaffected mother, was 12 % (95 %CI: 11 - 13 %) for a woman with a mother with unilateral breast cancer and was 13 % (95 %CI: 9. 5 - 17 %) for women with a mother with bilateral breast cancer. In early-onset diagnosed women (< 50 years) with an unaffected mother, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> contralateral <b>breast</b> cancer until age 80 was 23 % (95 %CI: 20 - 26 %) and for late-onset (50 - 69 years) diagnosed women it was 17 % (95 %CI: 14 - 21 %). In a woman with a mother with an early-onset unilateral <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> contralateral <b>breast</b> cancer by age 80 was 35 % (95 %CI: 25 - 46 %).

5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer for the next twenty years.

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about breast}} cancer overdiagnosis have {{increased}} the {{need to understand how}} cancers detected through screening mammography differ from those first detected by a woman or her clinician. We investigated risk factor associations for invasive breast cancer by method of detection within a series of case-control studies (1992 – 2007) carried out in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire (n = 15, 648 invasive breast cancer patients and 17, 602 controls aged 40 – 79 years). Approximately half of case women reported that their cancer had been detected by mammographic screening and half that they or their clinician had detected it. In polytomous logistic regression models, parity and age at first birth were more strongly associated with <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mammography-detected <b>breast</b> cancer than with <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> woman/clinician-detected <b>breast</b> cancer (P ≤ 0. 01; adjusted for mammog-raphy utilization). Among postmenopausal women, estrogen-progestin hormone usewas predominantly associated with <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> woman/clinician-detected <b>breast</b> cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 29, 1. 72), whereas obesity was predominantly associated with <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mammography-detected <b>breast</b> cancer (OR = 1. 72, 95 % CI: 1. 54, 1. 92). Among regularly screened premenopausal women, obesity was not associated with in-creased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mammography-detected <b>breast</b> cancer (OR = 0. 99, 95 % CI: 0. 83, 1. 18), but it was associated with reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> woman/clinician-detected <b>breast</b> cancer (OR = 0. 53, 95 % CI: 0. 43, 0. 64).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many women develop {{breast cancer}} after {{treatment}} for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) {{at a young}} age. We estimated this future risk, taking into account age and calendar year of HL diagnosis, HL treatment information, population breast cancer incidence rates, and competing causes of death. METHODS: Relative <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer for categories defined by radiation dose to the chest (0, 20 - or = 40 Gy) and use of alkylating agents (yes or no) were estimated from a case-control study conducted within an international population-based cohort of 3817 female 1 -year survivors of HL diagnosed at age 30 years or younger from January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1994. To compute cumulative absolute <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, we used modified standardized incidence ratios to relate cohort breast cancer risks {{to those in the}} general population, enabling application <b>of</b> population-based <b>breast</b> cancer rates, and we allowed for competing risks by using population-based mortality rates in female HL survivors. RESULTS: Cumulative absolute <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer increased with age at end of follow-up, time since HL diagnosis, and radiation dose. For an HL survivor who was treated at age 25 years with a chest radiation dose of at least 40 Gy without alkylating agents, estimated cumulative absolute <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer by age 35, 45, and 55 years were 1. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 9 % to 2. 1 %), 11. 1 % (95 % CI = 7. 4 % to 16. 3 %), and 29. 0 % (95 % CI = 20. 2 % to 40. 1 %), respectively. Cumulative absolute risks were lower in women treated with alkylating agents. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer projections varied considerably by type of HL therapy, time since HL diagnosis, and age at end of follow-up. These estimates are applicable to HL survivors treated with regimens of the past and can be used to counsel such patients and plan management and preventive strategies. Projections should be used with caution, however, in patients treated with more recent approaches, including limited-field radiotherapy and/or ovary-sparing chemotherap...|$|R
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time {{has been found to}} {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{affecting}} European women and the leading cause of cancer-related death. A total of 15 - 20 % of women who develop breast cancer have a family history and 5 - 10 % a true genetic predisposition. The identification and screening of women at increased risk may allow early detection <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer and improve prognosis. We established a family risk assessment clinic in May 2005 to assess and counsel women with a family history <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, to initiate surveillance, and to offer risk-reducing strategies for selected high-risk patients. Patients at medium or high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer according to NICE guidelines were accepted. Family history was determined by structured questionnaire and interview. Lifetime <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer was calculated using Claus and Tyrer-Cuzick scoring. <b>Risk</b> <b>of</b> carrying a <b>breast</b> cancer-related gene mutation was calculated using the Manchester system. One thousand two hundred and forty-three patients have been referred. Ninety-two percent were at medium or high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comOne of the primary purposes of genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes in patients with familial breast/ovarian cancer has been to provide accurate advice to at-risk relatives. The provision of such advice has been hampered {{by a lack of}} appropriate data regarding the cancer risks. Chen and colleagues recently provided precise estimates <b>of</b> the relative <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> and ovarian cancer in almost 2000 kindreds with such mutations ascertained through familial cancer clinics across USA. The baseline incidence <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer is lower in Australia than in North America. The relative risks derived from the study have been combined with Australian baseline incidence data to estimate the absolute short-term and long-term <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> and ovarian cancers for Australian carriers of different ages. The results are presented as a series of graphs that may be useful in counselling an unaffected carrier of a specified age. It is of note that the incidence <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer in carriers is high in premenopausal women, but approaches the population incidence in postmenopausal women. Conversely, the incidence of ovarian cancer continues to increase from the age of 40 years. Among carriers of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations, the cumulative lifetime <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer is 50 – 60 % and the equivalent <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ovarian cancer is 20 – 40 %.
