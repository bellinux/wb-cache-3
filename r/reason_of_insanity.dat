5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{was indicted}} on eight counts of {{first degree murder}} on May 7, 1973. He was {{assigned}} the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson—who had defended John Linley Frazier and also been assigned to the Herbert Mullin case—but due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> to the charges. Kemper twice {{tried to commit suicide}} in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.|$|E
25|$|Woodcock {{was tried}} {{only for the}} murder of Carole Voyce. On April 11, 1957, after a four-day trial, he was found not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and was sent to the Oak Ridge {{division}} of the maximum-security Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene, Ontario.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{researchers}} have found that marijuana was never mentioned in any of Licata's psychiatric reports or considered a factor in the killings. Instead it was established that the young man had been identified as mentally ill and there had been steps to incarcerate him before the murders. Two weeks after the murder of his family, 20-year-old Licata was declared unfit to stand trial for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and committed to the Florida State Hospital for the Insane. He remained there until 1950, when he killed himself by hanging.|$|R
25|$|Sullivan was {{captured}} {{soon after the}} attack. He had discarded the knife he used, but was still covered in blood when discovered.

25|$|Three {{separate}} {{mental health}} examinations determined that Berkowitz was competent to stand trial. Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz {{to enter a}} {{plea of not guilty}} by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> but Berkowitz refused. He appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings.|$|E

50|$|In a {{controversial}} decision, Budanov was initially {{found not guilty}} by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity</b> on December 31, 2002, and committed to a psychiatric hospital for further evaluation {{and the length of}} the treatment would have been decided by his doctor.|$|R
50|$|A {{wife with}} three {{children}} whose husband was away at sea, slept with many sailors, became pregnant, killed the baby soon after it was born, went to trial and was acquitted by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity.</b> Soon after that, her young son started stealing things.|$|R
50|$|In Voices <b>of</b> <b>Reason,</b> Voices <b>of</b> <b>Insanity,</b> Leudar and Thomas review nearly 3,000 {{years of}} voice-hearing history. They {{argue that the}} Western World has moved the {{experience}} of hearing voices from a socially valued context to a pathologised and denigrated one. Foucault has argued that this process can generally arise when a minority perspective {{is at odds with}} dominant social norms and beliefs.|$|R
25|$|Sweeney was {{eventually}} {{found not guilty}} by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and committed to full-time psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia. By 1992, Sweeney was on 16-hour-a-day furloughs. Members of the Lowenstein family, who had opposed prosecutorial plans to seek a sentence of death for Sweeney, expressed grave concern about the supervision Sweeney would receive and anger that a murderer was being given such privileges.|$|E
25|$|Taxi Driver formed {{part of the}} {{delusional}} {{fantasy of}} John Hinckley Jr. that triggered his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, an act {{for which he was}} found not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> Hinckley stated that his actions were an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, on whom Hinckley was fixated, by mimicking Travis's mohawked appearance at the Palantine rally. His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.|$|E
25|$|Gacy had {{attempted}} to convince the doctors that he suffered from a multiple personality disorder. His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> to the charges against him, and produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy the previous year to testify to their findings. Three psychiatric experts appearing for the defense at Gacy's trial testified they found Gacy to be a paranoid schizophrenic with a multiple personality disorder.|$|E
50|$|After a {{trial in}} Lansing, Michigan, Francine {{was found not guilty}} by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> {{temporary}} <b>insanity.</b> Both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Francine's plight was sympathetic. However, no jurors have ever confirmed publicly whether that was a factor in their decision. The concept of jury nullification may apply here.|$|R
50|$|Reardon was {{eventually}} {{found not guilty}} of the charges by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> drug-induced <b>insanity.</b> The judge ruled that because Reardon had been taking anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, and was distraught over his son's death, there was no reasonable explanation for the robbery. In addition, Reardon was not required to be committed after the ruling.|$|R
50|$|Coyle {{passed out}} some of the money, in $100 bills, to friends and neighbors.

He was tried, but found not guilty <b>of</b> theft by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity.</b> The armored car company, Purolator Armored Services, eventually recovered around $1 million of the original amount.|$|R

She was released in 1992.|$|E
25|$|On July 26, 2006, the Texas jury in her retrial {{found that}} Yates was {{not guilty by}} <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> She was {{consequently}} committed by the court to the North Texas State Hospital, Vernon Campus, a high-security mental health facility in Vernon, where she received medical treatment and was a roommate of Dena Schlosser, another woman who committed infanticide by killing her infant daughter. In January 2007, she was moved to a low security state mental hospital in Kerrville, Kerrville State Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Reported to {{have been}} driven by an obsessive {{fixation}} on Jodie Foster, he {{was found not guilty}} by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and remained under institutional psychiatric care until September 2016. Public outcry over the verdict led to the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, which altered the rules for consideration of mental illness of defendants in Federal Criminal Court proceedings in the United States. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and lives full-time at his mother's home.|$|E
5000|$|Francine Moran Hughes (later Wilson; August 17, 1947 - March 22, 2017) was an American woman who, after 13 {{years of}} {{domestic}} abuse, {{set fire to}} the bed of her live-in ex-husband Mickey Hughes, on March 9, 1977, in Dansville, Michigan. Mickey was killed and the house destroyed in the resulting fire. At trial, Hughes was found not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity</b> in one <b>of</b> the first cases involving [...] "battered-woman syndrome" [...] as a defense.|$|R

5000|$|Jenckes' {{first wife}} was Martha, the {{daughter}} of John and Mary (Holmes) Brown, {{with whom he had}} nine children and at least 68 grandchildren. Following her death, Jenckes married in 1727 Alice Dexter, the widow of John Dexter who was the son of Gregory Dexter, an early President of Providence and Warwick. Alice was {{the daughter of}} John and Sarah (Whipple) Smith. Jenckes died in 1740, [...] "deemed to die intestate by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> his <b>insanity</b> <b>of</b> mind," [...] and his son Nathaniel was appointed as administrator. Austin wrote that he is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, but this is incorrect.

He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered {{to stay away from}} the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps. Dennis Priven, a fellow Peace Corps worker, was later charged with the murder by the Tonga government. He {{was found not guilty}} by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> and was sentenced to serve time in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism has been that the Peace Corps seemingly worked to keep one of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it would have on the organization.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} members of her family preoccupied, Miriam's {{obsession}} takes a new turn when she finds herself entering people's houses and stealing small objects from them. Several times she is almost discovered, but, though she tries to anchor herself to the real world through emotionally detached sex with Saul, she cannot resist the pull of the empty houses. At the National Spelling Bee, Eliza performs well but does not win, so she begins to prepare for the following year, with Saul's enthusiastic help. But the family is about to be torn apart. Miriam is arrested, pleads not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Aaron announces his intention to leave home, and his faith, to join ISKCON.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the loss}} of his house and several {{setbacks}} {{at the start of the}} trial, Jake perseveres. Jake badly discredits the state's psychiatrist by establishing that he has never conceded to the <b>insanity</b> <b>of</b> any defendant in any criminal case in which he has been asked to testify, even when several other doctors have been in consensus otherwise. He traps the doctor with a revelation that several previous defendants found insane in their trials are currently under his care despite his having testified to their [...] "sanity" [...] in their respective trials. Jake follows this up with a captivating closing statement. After lengthy deliberations, the jury acquits Carl Lee by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity.</b> Carl Lee returns to his family and the story ends with Jake, Lucien and Harry Rex having a celebratory drink before Jake holds a press conference and leaving town to reunite with his family.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually though, [...] "Tori" [...] {{took control}} and {{actively}} sought to destroy everything that Victor Lord had ever built. [...] "Tori" [...] set Llanfair on fire, {{hoping it would}} burn to the ground. But she realized that Viki’s daughter Jessica was still inside. Viki reasserted herself in order to rescue Jessie, and after many months of drama involving the alters, underwent psychotherapy {{to deal with the}} reality of her childhood. She would remember the most terrible secret of her life in therapy though - back in 1976, she briefly became [...] "Tori" [...] and murdered Victor herself (although years later, it would be revealed that Victor survived the attempt on his life). Viki was found not guilty <b>of</b> murder by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity,</b> but her life was forever changed.|$|R
5000|$|On March 9, 1977, Francine Hughes, {{following}} {{thirteen years}} of physical domestic abuse {{at the hands}} of her husband, James Berlin [...] "Mickey" [...] Hughes, tells their children to put their coats on and wait for her in their car. She then pours gasoline around the bed in which Mickey is sleeping in their home in Dansville, Michigan, and sets the bed afire. After the house catches fire, Hughes drives with her children to the local police station in order to confess to the act. Hughes is tried for first degree murder, and is found by a jury of her peers to be not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity.</b> It is widely believed that the judge and the jury largely sympathized with Francine's plight and felt that Mickey's murder was a justifiable action.|$|R
25|$|Anatomy of a Murder {{is based}} on a real murder (and {{subsequent}} trial) that occurred in Big Bay in the early morning of July 31, 1952. Coleman A. Peterson, a lieutenant in the Army, was charged with murdering Maurice Chenoweth. The alleged motive was revenge for the rape of Peterson's wife by Chenoweth. Voelker successfully defended Peterson, who was found not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> Other books by Voelker were based on other legal cases in the Upper Peninsula or his love of fly fishing for brook trout. He authored over 100 opinions during his short tenure on the Michigan Supreme Court, the most famous of which was in a case called People v. Hildabridle involving a nudist colony near Battle Creek.|$|E
25|$|During the 1870s Abe Buford {{suffered}} {{a series of}} financial reversals that forced him into bankruptcy with the resulting loss of Bosque Bonita Farm to his creditors. In addition, he {{suffered a}} devastating personal loss when his only son, William A. Buford, died at age twenty-three in 1872. He lost his wife Amanda Harris Buford in 1879 and on March 26 of that same year, his brother, Colonel Thomas Buford of Henry County, Kentucky, shot and killed Judge John Milton Elliott in Frankfort, Kentucky. Tom Buford surrendered to police and was jailed pending trial. Abe Buford came to his brother's aid and {{spent a great deal}} of money on legal fees for his defense. On appeal of a guilty verdict, Thomas Buford would eventually be found not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and was sent to the Anchorage, Kentucky psychiatric hospital.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1974, Anthony Barbaro was arraigned {{on three}} counts of second-degree murder, six counts of first-degree assault, and five counts of first-degree {{reckless}} endangerment. Barbaro was then being held without bail at the Olean City Jail. Following the shooting, police had found homemade smoke bombs, {{as well as}} gasoline and glass bottles, and empty propane canisters in Barbaro's bedroom. Police also found, in Barbaro's bedroom, bomb recipes and a journal that detailed {{his plans for the}} shooting. In April 1975, he had entered a plea of not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> however he was found competent to stand trial by two court-appointed psychiatrists. Barbaro was soon transferred from the Olean City Jail to the Cattaraugus County Jail in Little Valley. On October 21, 1975, a grand jury was seated for Barbaro's trial at the Olean Municipal Building.|$|E

Bobbitt also claimed that her husband had repeatedly raped and verbally abused her in the past, and that the memories of this abuse [...] "raced through her head" [...] in the moments prior to the attack on her husband. At her trial, Bobbitt's defense attorney argued that she was not guilty by <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>insanity.</b> She was acquitted by this reason and was released after being taken into custody for psychiatric evaluation. Legal critics argued that Bobbitt won her trial by means of the abuse defense.|$|R
