40|$|This article {{starts with}} a brief {{description}} of the origin and eutrophication of shallow Dutch lakes, followed by a review of the various lake restoration techniques in use and the results obtained. Most freshwater lakes in the Netherlands are very shallow (< 2 m), and owe their origins to large-scale dredging and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> during the early 17 th century. They vary in area from a few hectares to a few thousand hectares, and are generally found in the northern and western part of the country. Most of them lie in the catchment areas of the major rivers: the Rhine, the Meuse and the Schelde. Because of their natural and aesthetic value, these lakes fulfil a recreational function. The lakes are important to the hydrology, water balance and agriculture in the surrounding polder country. The external input to the lakes of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and of polluted waters from the rivers and canals have been the major cause of eutrophication, which began during the 1950 s. In addition, more recently climate changes, habitat fragmentation and biotic exploitation of many of these waters have probably led to loss of resilience and thus to accelerated eutrophication. Lake eutrophication is manifested essentially in the poor under-water light climate with high turbidity (Secchi-disc, 20 – 40 cm) caused usually by cyanobacterial blooms (e. g.

40|$|Peatlands cover {{about three}} percent of earth’s land surface in {{primarily}} the northern hemisphere and store an estimated 550 Gigatons of carbon. Peat is the substance formed when organic matter cannot completely decompose due to waterlogged and anoxic conditions. Under these circumstances, peat-lands have sequestered carbon for thousands of years. The construction of ditches to drain mires causes hydrological changes resulting in the drying of the peat which can then be harvested. The dry-ing and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> layers destroys habitat and disables vegetation growth and thus peat accumu-lation. Furthermore, carbon sequestration function is destroyed. Large scale restoration efforts have not been achieved and long-term restoration successes cannot yet be evaluated. Additionally {{there has not been}} an evaluation of the collective impact of mire resto-ration measures. This study aims to determine whether peatland restoration projects meet their goal setting and contribute to re-establish peatland ecosystems and their function in the global carbon cycle and in contribution to biodiversity, by assessing factors that contribute to successes and failures. Therefore, literature research is undertaken to investigate (1) what the restoration techniques are, (2) what successes and failures of restoration can be distinguished, and (3) if efforts meet the goals of restoration of restoration projects undertaken in Canada and Ireland. The evaluation of measures taken at the Canadian and Irish restoration sites were found to take a whole ecosystem approach, focusing on all aspects of a mire ecosystem- hydrology, vegetation, peat accumulation, carbon flux, and biodiversity which is why they were chosen. One project in each country was chosen due to time constraints and the limited number of evaluation studies available. The main measure taken to restore mires is the blocking of drainage ditches which should aid in re-turning hydrological conditions necessary for vegetation establishment and peat accumulation. To investigate if the measures taken reach the goal of restoration, changes to hydrology, biodiversity, and carbon flux of two restoration projects were investigated. At the Bois-des-Bel Bog in eastern Canada restoration measures were carried out, including blocking of drainage ditches, construction of em-bankments, plant fragment spreading, fertilization, and straw mulch application. At Camderry Bog in central Ireland restoration measures included clear felling and embankment of the area and blocking of drainage ditches using peat dams. The goal of restoring Bois-des-Bel Bog is the re-establishment of a self-regulating peat accumulating ecosystem. Camderry bog is restored with the goal to restore threatened raised bog habitats to a favourable status. The pre-restoration conditions of the sites dif-fered in terms of naturally established vegetation. While Bois-des-Bel was nearly void of vegetation, Camderry Bog showed some Sphagnum coverage, indicating favourable conditions for mire-typical vegetation establishment. At both sites water table level and vegetation coverage were monitored. At Bois-des-Bel monitoring was more comprehensive compared to Camderry Bog. At both sites the res-toration measures taken resulted in a raised water table level but increased seasonal fluctuations. Vegetation coverage had significantly increased; however, non-typical mire vegetation is competing with mire-typical vegetation. Amphibian and bird diversity and abundance had increased at Bois-des-Bel bog where artificial pools created habitat and breeding grounds. Although some fungal activity was observed {{there appears to be a}} lag time between vegetation establishment and microorganism re-covery. The carbon sequestration function was not restored. It was concluded that although the indi-vidual objectives of restoration such as raising the water table and establishing vegetation coverage were achieved, the overall goal was not. Restoration measures did not lead to a self-regulating peat accumulating ecosystem at Bois-des-Bel. The goal for Camderry Bog is too ambiguous to determine whether it was met and clarification of “favourable status” is needed. Although these results may not be representative for all bog restoration efforts, they may have implications for future use of pristine bogs; their conservation may be the more feasible option in terms of preserving biodiversity and their role in the global carbon cycle. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether the {{provision}} of small amounts <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> to piglets would influence behaviour and production. At approximately 5 days of age, nine litters received a tray <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> as enrichment, while nine others did not. All piglets had access to solid feed, which was used to compare substrate-directed behaviour. Piglets were weaned at week 4, and half of the pens in the nursery again received peat. The other half did not. This resulted in the following experimental design: peat/peat (PP), peat/no peat (PN), no peat/peat (NP) and no peat/no peat (NN). Each pen was observed for 4 × 1 min in the morning and also in the afternoon. During every minute the behaviour of each piglet was recorded continuously. The main behavioural categories were: foraging, exploration, playing, locomotion, resting, sleeping, biting and fighting. At 9 weeks of age the pigs were moved to the fattening unit, where no peat was provided. However, observations continued until the pigs reached slaughter age, i. e. until about week 24. Production results (weight, weight gain) and skin lesions were recorded from start to end. Piglets with access to peat performed foraging behaviour significantly more often than piglets without peat (P < 0. 0001). After weaning, the results suggested a greater influence of present enrichment than previous experience in the farrowing pen. NP and PP piglets showed significantly less manipulation of pen mates (P < 0. 005), less fighting (P < 0. 001) and less inactivity (P < 0. 0001). No effect on fighting or manipulation of pen mates was found in the fattening phase. Sleeping was observed more in the NP and PP groups (P < 0. 05). Lying was seen less in the NN group than in the other treatment groups (P < 0. 0001). No treatment effect was found on the frequency and severity of skin lesions. Weaning weight of P piglets did not differ from that of the control piglets (N). At the end of the weaning phase, PP piglets had a higher weight than NN piglets (P < 0. 05). PP piglets also had a higher weight gain during weaning than NN and NP piglets (P < 0. 05). The results suggest that providing small amounts <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> to suckling and weaner pigs could be an effective enrichment strategy to increase explorative behaviour and possibly reduce aggression time post weaning. It also had a beneficial effect on weight and weight gain <b>of</b> piglets.

The lakes are important to the hydrology, water balance and agriculture in the surrounding polder country. The external input to the lakes of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and of polluted waters from the rivers and canals have been the major cause of eutrophication, which began during the 1950 s. In addition, more recently climate changes, habitat fragmentation and biotic exploitation of many of these waters have probably led to loss of resilience and thus to accelerated eutrophication. Lake eutrophication is manifested essentially in the poor under-water light climate with high turbidity (Secchi-disc, 20 – 40 cm) caused usually by cyanobacterial blooms (e. g. Oscillatoria sp.), and loss of littoral vegetation. Despite recent perceptible reductions in external P inputs, non-point sources, especially of N from agriculture, still remain high and constitute a major challenge to the lake restorers. Lake recovery is also invariably afflicted by in-lake nutrient sources. These include P loading from the P-rich sediments, mineralization in the water and release by the foraging and metabolic activities of the abundant benthivorous and planktivorous fish, mainly bream (Abramis brama). A variety of restoration techniques have been employed in the Dutch lakes: hydrological management, reduction of P in the external loads, in-lake reduction or immobilisation of P, and complementary ecological management. This last involves biomanipulation, or the top-down control of the food web. Hydrological management has resulted in an improvement in the lake water quality only in a few cases. The failure of lake restoration measures (e. g. in the Loosdrecht lakes, described as a case study) h The restoration studies reveal that decrease of P to low levels is no guarantee that cyanobacterial populations will also follow suit. This is because cyanobacteria can withstand great variation in their P content and thus in their C:P ratios. Thus, for a unit weight of P, the Cyanobacteria can yield relatively more biomass and cause greater turbidity than, for example, green algae, which have relatively lower C:P ratios. This is possibly an explanation for the success of these filamentous Cyano The zooplankton-grazing peak in spring, caused usually by large-bodied grazers, Daphnia spp., is invariably the first step in bringing about a clear-water phase. Subsequently, summer light conditions trigger optimal growth conditions for macrophytes, which then maintain the high water clarity by competing successfully with phytoplankton for nutrients, especially N. The `return' of macrophytes, especially stoneworts (Chara spp.) in some lakes, has contributed to the sustaining of improved light c In general, the achievements of restoration work in the Dutch lakes, especially those using biomanipulation measures, are questionable: there are probably more examples of failures than of successes. The failures are generally linked not only to insufficient or no decrease at all in the autochthonous or in-lake nutrient loadings, but also to rapid increase of the planktivorous fish in the years following their reduction. A 75 % reduction in the existing planktivore population has often been used [KEYWORDS: external loading; lake management; biomanipulation; food web; Lake Loosdrecht; Wolderwijd; Zwemlust; phosphorus; Cyanobacteria; zooplankton; Daphnia; bream; fish; benthivores; planktivores; macrophytes; Chara; northern pike; Secchi-disc]...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional drivers of cost and timely delivery, embodied energy (EE) and embodied carbon (EC) have emerged as major considerations {{in all aspects of}} large construction projects. This is due to stricter environmental regulations introduced in Ireland and the European Union, which have resulted in geotechnical engineers beginning to compare the EC/EE associated with various piling and ground improvement options as part of an overall appraisal of scheme feasibility for road construction projects. Where construction involves the modification or <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat,</b> these calculations become more challenging as allowances should be made for the impact on the carbon stored within the peat and the gases potentially released. To incorporate these allowances in the EE and EC summations in a life cycle assessment (LCA) for a construction project requires the inclusion of peat-related factors such as peat drainage, drainage systems, slope stability, restoration and clearance of vegetation/forest. As there is a dearth of methodologies to quantify EC and EE of ground improvement techniques for road construction on peat, new LCA methodologies need to be developed to more accurately quantify emissions and energy consumed in order to produce more sustainable solutions. Traditionally, excavate-and-replace is the most commonly used method in Ireland, but other techniques such as piling and dry soil-mixing can also be considered. In projects employing an excavate-and-replace solution, peat is often removed to disposal areas and the subsequent drying causes a significant release of CO 2 into the atmosphere. To date, however, in dry soil-mixing the impact of stabilising peat on on-site CO 2 emissions has not been considered and is, therefore, the primary focus of this thesis. A preliminary study of nine columns containing peat and peat mixed with cement was set up in a temperature control room to investigate CO 2 emission rates. Gas samples were collected using the closed chamber method and analysed using a gas chromatograph. The result of the experiment showed that the stabilised peat absorbed CO 2 both from the air and CO 2 released by the oxidised peat due to the carbonation process. Subsequent to this substantial finding, two extensive column studies were undertaken to examine the carbonation potential of stabilised peat whose binders consisted of cement and cement and ground granulated blast slag (GGBS) combinations. As in the first experiment, the CO 2 intake rate decreased with time as the depth of the carbonation front grew. Variables which significantly influenced the CO 2 intake rate included time, initial CO 2 concentration, cement content, GGBS content, water table and surcharge. Besides calculating CO 2 intake rates, the depth of the carbonation front was analysed to produce k-rate factors, representing {{the rate at which the}} carbonation front increases. As this was the first time the carbonation front in stabilised peat was examined, several techniques were used to establish the most suitable procedure to explore this carbonation front: phenolphthalein indicator, pH of stabilised peat slurries, X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), loss on ignition method (LOI), and water evaporation method. From the results, the carbonation front obtained by XRD was similar to those from LOI and FTIR. In contrast, the phenolphthalein method underestimated the carbonation front, while the pH of stabilised peat slurries technique showed a carbonation front greater than the other methods. The laboratory results provided crucial information on the environmental impact of dry soil-mixing and its on-site impact. Using these results and a novel LCA methodology, an LCA to examine EE and EC was performed on a case study of a section of motorway built on peat. To ascertain the optimum solution for EE and EC, several ground improvement scenarios were studied, including excavate-and-replace, dry soil-mixing and a combination of excavate-and-replace and piling. From laboratory results, it was taken for the dry soil-mixing scenario that emissions from the stabilised peat were zero for the lifetime of the road. The LCA also investigated emissions from peat under various management practices and restoration techniques, assessing their strength in terms of hydrology and carbon storage potential. The results showed that dry soil-mixing had a minimal on-site impact and that the EC of the binder could be lowered markedly if the binder type was changed. On the other hand, even though the EC and EE of materials used in the excavate-and-replace solution were low, the on-site impact was immense due to extensive peat disturbance. In the case study which forms part of the subject of this research, a combination of excavate-and-replace and piling was found to be most favourable solution, but the preferred ground improvement technique in general was found to change according to the project and site location. In this research, novel laboratory studies were undertaken and a new LCA methodology was developed. Various techniques to understand the carbonation process in stabilised peat were utilised, with advantages and disadvantages found for all of them. The body of work has international implications as it points to dry soil-mixing having a lower environmental impact than previously thought. Additionally, it provides a platform for further studies in this area. From this research, the environmental impact of building on peat can be quantified more accurately and the understanding of stabilised peat enhanced in terms of emissions and carbonation depth and potential. 2017 - 03 - 0...|$|E

The {{results show that the}} biofilter packed with the mixture <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> and lava rock performed much better than the other one. The effect of operating conditions as, among others, the inlet concentration and the empty bed residence time (EBRT) were studied. A maximum elimination capacity of 33 g m− 3 h− 1 was obtained with the mixed packing with more than 85 % removal efficiency at EBRT of 3 min or more. Somewhat lower performances were reached at shorter EBRT. The results presented here suggest that the mixture of lava rock and peat, subject to further optimization, offers potential for the biological <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> CO from polluted gas streams...|$|R

40|$|Batch {{sorption}} {{experiments were}} performed for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> chromium(III) ions from aqueous solutions using Romanian Sphagnum moss peat (untreated and treated with NaCl solution) as sorbent. In {{order to establish}} the best conditions for the sorption of chromium(III), the influence of initial pH, contact time, peat dose and metal ion concentration was investigated. The Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin–Radushkevich models were applied to describe the sorption isotherms and to calculate its constants. The experimental data fitted well to the Langmuir model with a maximum sorption capacity of 18. 6 mg Cr(III) /g <b>of</b> <b>peat.</b> The mean free energy of sorption suggests that the binding <b>of</b> Cr(III) on <b>peat</b> occurred through an ion exchange mechanism. The kinetic data evaluated by pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models showed that the sorption of chromium onto the peat followed a pseudo-second order rate equation. The chromium(III) could be easily eluted from the loaded peat using 0. 10 M HCl and the peat may be reused in several sorption/desorption cycles. The experimental results indicated the potential <b>of</b> Sphagnum moss <b>peat</b> for <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> Cr(III) from wastewaters...|$|R

Both of the dynamic properties were often related to dynamic loading such as earthquake, moving traffic, machineries and bomb blasting. The study was conducted at western part of Johore such as Parit Sulong and Pontian where deposition <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil were exists and recognised as problematic soils to the engineers. This study was carried out to determine the shear {{wave velocity}} <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil using Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Wave (MASW) method and estimation shear modulus <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> using empirical formula. To use the empirical formula, the density <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil was also needed thus using the peat sampler for every 0. 5 meter depth to obtain the density. From the MASW test for both test sites, the shear velocity <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> at Parit Sulong is between 40 m/s and 55 m/s until depth of 1. 5 m meanwhile at Pontian, the shear wave velocity between 21 m/s and 67 m/s until 2. 5 m depth. Using shear velocity, shear modulus <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> were estimated for Parit Sulong are ranged between 1575 kPa – 3514 kPa and Pontian are ranged between 385 kPa – 5117 kPa.
