5|$|Footprints {{belonging}} to the ichnogenus Brachychirotherium are often associated with aetosaurs. Brachychirotherium has been found from Rio Grande do Sul in Paleorrota, Brazil as well as Italy, Germany, and the eastern United States. They are also common in the southwestern United States, having been found from Canyonlands National Park and Dinosaur National Monument. Many of these tracks have a narrow gauge (meaning left and right prints are placed closely together) and nearly overstep each other. A 2011 functional analysis of the skeleton of Typothorax coccinarum indicated that it had the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> necessary to produce the tracks.|$|E

40|$|Title: Application of {{backstroke}} to {{a patient}} with ankylosing spondylitis Objectives: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the application of backstroke with chosen parameters {{to a patient}} with ankylosing spondylitis. To compare the effectiveness of this swimming exercise programme with a traditional exercise programme held in a gymnasium. This work investigates whether it is suitable to recommend backstroke swimming to patients with ankylosing spondylitis as an effective form of physical exercise for improving <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> and reducing pain. Methods: The effectiveness of a 9 week long swimming programme was evaluated using a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the glenohumeral and coxal joints and of the spine. The presence of pain was measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Diasese Activity Index. The same parameters were measured for another patient with the similar activity of the disease who took part in group exercises in a gymnasium. At the end of the programmes the parameters were compared and evaluated. Results: The swimming programme has improved the patient's posture and has strengthened back muscles. Pain was reduced {{in some parts of the}} back and also general pain measured by BASDAI. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> both glenohumeral joints improved in all measured directions. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear {{to hold their}} necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> would have also allowed the head to feed {{at the level of}} the feet.|$|E
5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The Batmobile has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a novel anthropomorphic robotic neck. It mimics the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> found in the human neck, actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles. The proposed humanoid neck simulates the anatomical functionality and structure of a human neck. Specifications are made according to biological, anatomical and behavioural data. The preliminary results show that the proposed humanoid neck is able to deliver the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> and head velocities comparable to those observed in human necks. These results also demonstrate that biologically inspired musculoskeletal robotic systems represent a reliable and robust platform to investigate motion development...|$|R
5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players {{take on the}} role of Marth and his growing army during their campaign across the continent of Archanea. The game progresses in a linear fashion, with maps being unlocked and played as dictated by the storyline. Each playable character is assigned a unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class affects their <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> and strength on the battlefield; mounted or flying units have greater mobility, archers have a greater attack range, while heavily armored characters have more damage resistance. Each character has a set character class, and each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase randomly. There are a total of 25 characters that can be recruited {{over the course of the}} game, and 21 available classes for the majority of characters, with the exception of main protagonist Marth.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E
25|$|The limited {{movement}} {{possible by}} the infant jaw and mouth might {{be responsible for the}} typical consonant-vowel (CV) alternation in babbling and it has even been suggested that the predominance of CV syllables in the languages of the world might evolutionarily have been caused by this limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the human vocal organs.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} 1 – 2  years of life there {{is likely to}} be a {{significant}} improvement in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> affected joints which can be further improved with manipulation and stretching. The parents need the support of trained physiotherapists to stretch and manipulate all affected joints on a regular basis several times a day, e.g., with each nappy change.|$|R

5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|R

25|$|Joints, {{especially}} synovial joints {{allow the}} body a tremendous <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements.</b> Each movement at a synovial joint {{results from the}} contraction or relaxation of the muscles that {{are attached to the}} bones {{on either side of the}} articulation. The type <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> that can be produced at a synovial joint is determined by its structural type.|$|R
