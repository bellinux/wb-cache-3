Method: The thesis has <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> qualitative research <b>of</b> <b>an</b> observation type. The goal of the work {{was to determine the}} usability of kinetic tests of coordinative abilities for selection of soldiers to the position <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> gunner. <b>A</b> group <b>of</b> ten <b>aerial</b> gunners was subjected to three kinetic tests and activities connected with manipulation with the machine gun PKM 7. 62 mm. The gunners were arranged in particular orders according to results they gained in the individual tests. We looked for correlations in these orders. In the course of the subsequent analysis, we mapped relationships between selected kinetic tests and the level <b>of</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> gunner in Mi 171 Š. To analyze the relationships and dependencies between the variables, we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and material evaluation.
