The {{availability}} of low-noise <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors,</b> which {{are easy to}} deploy in the field, will be of a great interest and should generalize the use of <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors</b> (i.e., the possibility of ambient vibration measurements) and enlarge their possible applications.|$|R
30|$|W =  5.9). This {{sequence}} {{motivated the}} organization of a post-seismic survey of the SINAPS@ project (Hollender et al. 2015; Perron et al. 2017). This survey involved many instruments (i.e., accelerometers, broadband seismometers, <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors)</b> that were deployed on different soil conditions. All datasets recorded during the SINAPS@ post-seismic survey are open (Perron et al. 2017, see “Availability of data and materials” section for more information). The analysis of the accelerometer and broadband seismometer data “alone” has already led to several published studies (Berge-Thierry et al. 2016; Imtiaz et al. 2017; Svay et al. 2017). In the present study, {{we focus on the}} analysis of the rotation data, with the combination of the translational data recorded in co-location with the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{best known}} {{use of the}} Sagnac {{interferometer}} lies in its sensitivity to rotation. The first accounts {{of the effects of}} rotation on this form of interferometer were published in 1913 by Georges Sagnac, who mistakenly believed that his ability to detect a [...] "whirling of the ether" [...] disproved relativity theory. The sensitivity of present-day Sagnac interferometers far exceeds that of Sagnac's original arrangement. The sensitivity to rotation is proportional to the area circumscribed by the counter-rotating beams, and fibre optic gyroscopes, present-day descendants of the Sagnac interferometer, use thousands of loops of optical fibre rather than mirrors, such that even small to medium-sized units easily detect the rotation of the Earth. Ring laser gyroscopes (not illustrated) are another form of Sagnac <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> that have important applications in inertial guidance systems.|$|E
50|$|Many modern speedometers are electronic. In designs {{derived from}} earlier {{eddy-current}} models, a <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> {{mounted in the}} transmission delivers a series of electronic pulses whose frequency corresponds to the (average) rotational speed of the driveshaft, and therefore the vehicle's speed, assuming the wheels have full traction. The sensor is typically a set {{of one or more}} magnets mounted on the output shaft or (in transaxles) differential crownwheel, or a toothed metal disk positioned between a magnet and a magnetic field sensor. As the part in question turns, the magnets or teeth pass beneath the sensor, each time producing a pulse in the sensor as they affect the strength of the magnetic field it is measuring. Alternatively, in more recent designs, some manufactures rely on pulses coming from the ABS wheel sensors. Most modern electronic speedometers have the additional ability over the eddy current type to show the vehicle speed when moving in reverse gear.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{rotation}} angle measurement, one novel type of miniaturization fiber Bragg grating (FBG) <b>rotation</b> angle <b>sensor</b> with high measurement precision and temperature self-compensation is proposed and studied in this paper. The FBG <b>rotation</b> angle <b>sensor</b> mainly contains two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), triangular cantilever beam, and rotation angle transfer element. In theory, the proposed sensor can achieve temperature self-compensation by complementation of the two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), {{and it has a}} boundless angel measurement range with 2 π rad period duo to the function of the rotation angle transfer element. Based on introducing the joint working processes, the theory calculation model of the FBG <b>rotation</b> angel <b>sensor</b> is established, and the calibration experiment on one prototype is also carried out to obtain its measurement performance. After experimental data analyses, the measurement precision of the FBG <b>rotation</b> angle <b>sensor</b> prototype is 0.2 ° with excellent linearity, and the temperature sensitivities of FBG 1 and FBG 2 are 10 pm/℃ and 10.1 pm/℃, correspondingly. All these experimental results confirm that the FBG <b>rotation</b> angle <b>sensor</b> can achieve large-range angle measurement with high precision and temperature self-compensation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{implements}} and analyzes a CMOS an-gular velocity- and direction-selective <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> with a retinal processing circuit. The proposed <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> has a polar {{structure and}} is selective of the angular velocity and direc-tion (clockwise and counterclockwise) of {{the rotation of}} images. The correlation-based algorithm is adopted and each pixel in the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> is correlated with the pixel that is 45 apart. The angular velocity selectivity is enhanced by placing more than one pixel between two correlated pixels. The angular velocity selectivity is related to both the number and {{the positions of the}} edges in an image. Detailed analysis characterizes angular velocity selectivity for different edges. An experimental chip consisting 104 pixels, which form five concentric circles, is fabricated. The single pixel has an area of 91 84 m 2 and a fill factor of 20 %, whereas the area of the chip is 1812 1825 m 2. The experimental results concerning the fabricated chip successfully verified the an-alyzed characteristics of angular velocity and direction selectivity. They showed that the detectable angular velocity and range of illumination of this <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> are from 2 5 10 3 s to 40 s and from 0. 91 lux to 366 lux, respectively.

30|$|Finally, {{at the end}} of {{the dense}} array experiment, the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> was {{installed}} in co-location with a translation accelerometer, again in the Koutavos basin, 140  m from the first location of phase 1, at the location for the future permanent vertical array; this was operated from March 11, 2014, to July 2, 2015 (i.e., for around 16  months). This period is defined as “phase 3.” Within the available open dataset described in Perron et al. (2017), this <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> location is called “ROAN.” Here, it was possible to extract 805 events with both rotation and translation data. The “Argonet” permanent vertical array has been operational since July 11, 2015, and the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> was kept on the site. Here, 29 events from the best records of the permanent array (up to July 28, 2016) were added to this dataset to complete the dataset with the strongest motions. Phase 3 allows the comparison between rotation and translation data without any upper limit in terms of strong motions, which allows analysis over a wider range of motion levels and event magnitudes.|$|E

30|$|Beyond the {{possible}} importance of rotation in earthquake engineering, the measurements of both rotation and translation might increase {{the possible}} applications {{in terms of}} wavefield composition analysis (i.e., part of the energy devoted to body or surface waves), derivation of the propagation velocity of seismic waves, source kinematics, and other aspects (Takeo and Ito 1997; Lee et al. 2009 a; Igel et al. 2012; Marano and Fah 2014). The current limitation {{for the implementation of}} this approach is the relatively low sensitivity of previous <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors</b> {{that could be used in}} the field (like the Eentec R- 1 we used in the present study), as these needed relatively high motion levels to provide an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. However, a new generation of <b>rotation</b> <b>sensors</b> is now available, as, for example, the Eentec R- 2 (Leugoud and Kharlamov 2012) or the BlueSeis 3 A (Bernauer et al. 2017), and these might allow new applications in the near future.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> {{based on a}} modified split ring resonator (SRR) coupled to a coplanar waveguide. It is shown that compared with previous SRR-based rotation sensors, the proposed sensor benefits from a higher dynamic range and superior linearity. It is shown that the geometry of the SRR can be optimized {{to compensate for the}} non-uniformity of the magnetic flux through the SRR, in order to suppress the unwanted frequency shift in the resonance. This is a significant improvement because the sensor can be operated as an inexpensive single frequency system. The concept and simulation results are validated by experimental measurements.

30|$|Initially, the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> was {{collocated}} with a translational accelerometer (Güralp CMG 5; {{linked to}} a Nanometrics Taurus digitizer), from February 6, 2014, to February 19, 2014 (i.e., for around 2  weeks), within the Koutavos park at a soft-soil location (see below {{for more information on}} the soil conditions). This period is defined as “phase 1.” Within the available open dataset described in Perron et al. (2017), this <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> location is called “ROSA.” Using this procedure (as described above), 421 events were extracted. Unfortunately, the analysis of these data showed that one of the horizontal components of the translational accelerometer did not work correctly, which prevented true six-component analysis. Hence, in the present study, the data from phase 1 are only used for the analysis of the rotation records. Note that the <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> was “virtually” placed here in the center of a dense array that had been installed previously in the framework of the NERA program (funded by the European Union), which allowed complete analysis of the ground-motion coherency and the wavefield composition (Imtiaz 2015). This array was no longer in place for the SINAPS@ post-seismic survey, but the results of the rotation measurement could be analyzed using the results of the Imtiaz (2015) study.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> {{with a wide}} {{dynamic range}} is {{designed}} based on tapered U-shaped resonators. The proposed device is composed of a rounded microstrip transmission line that couples to two meandered resonators that are stacked {{on top of each}} other. By rotating the upper resonator, the overlapping area between the two resonators is increased causing a stronger coupling that shifts down the resonance frequency of the device. This frequency shift can be read out in the transmission response from which the rotation angle is determined. The operation principle of the sensor is explained in detail by using a cir-cuit model. A sensor prototype is designed for the microwave frequency range and an experiment is presented for validating the proposed sensing approach. This sensing device is well suited for further miniaturization using microelectromechanical systems technology.

40|$|The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI’s) 4000 meter {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV), Tiburon operates directly off a double helically wound steel cable {{without the use of}} a clump weight. On dives between 1500 and 4000 meters, rotationally induced hockles or tight bends in the umbilical cable have intermittently occurred. The hockles have the potential to disable and possibly even lose Tiburon. In an effort to compensate for this problem, MBARI engineers are designing a <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor</b> that clamps on the cable near the sections where hockles have occurred. A magnetic compass will take the heading of the cable and send the processed information acoustically back to the ship or vehicle. This information will appear on the ROV pilot’s display screen so that the ROV pilot can compensate for any rotation or misalignment before hockles occur. This paper describes the mechanical design and analysis of the umbilical cable <b>rotation</b> <b>sensor.</b> The goals of the mechanical design are to house the electronics and batteries in a safe and clean environment, incorporate the housings in a hydrodynamically balanced cable clamp assembly and allow for easy attachment and removal from the umbilical.
