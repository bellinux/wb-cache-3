It grew more than ten percent per year from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. In 2007, SAS <b>revenue</b> <b>was</b> $2.15 billion, and in 2013 its <b>revenue</b> <b>was</b> $3.02 billion. By the late 1990s, SAS was the largest privately held software company.

The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in <b>revenue</b> <b>was</b> to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E
