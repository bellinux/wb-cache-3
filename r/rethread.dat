However, he criticized the episodes conclusion and final act, writing: [...] "I really enjoyed Fry Am the Egg Man, until the last act when things just sort of petered out. The silly vignettes of the opening gave way to an interesting conflict on a distant planet, only to deliver a relatively weak ending. Does the ending ruin the entire half hour? Not by much, but instead of being the classic it could have been, Thursday nights episode was only pretty darn good." [...] Giving the episode an overall 7.5/10 rating, he concluded his review by writing: [...] "Fry Am the Egg Man was three-fourths of a fantastic episode. And then we got Scooby-Dood." ...|$|E
40|$|Transient fault {{recovery}} {{is important in}} processor availability. However, significant silicon or performance over-heads are characteristics of existing techniques. We uncover an opportunity to reduce the overheads dramatically in modern processors that appears as a side-effect of introducing hardware multithreading to improve performance. We observe that threads are usually short code sequences with no branches and few memory side-effects, {{which means that the}} number of checkpoints is small and constant. In addition, the state structures of a thread already presented in hardware can be reused to provide check pointing. In this paper, we demonstrate this principle of using a hardware/software co-design called <b>Rethread,</b> which features compiler-generated code annotations and automatic recovery in hardware by restarting threads. This approach provides the ability to recover from transient faults without dedicated hardware. Moreover, results show performance degradation under both fault-free condition (less than 5 %) and as a function of fault rate...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{politically}} informed {{visual arts}} project 'Social Closure' is to investigate poignant metaphors to highlight visually the phenomenon ‘small town industrial decline’. In this practice-led research my investigation is underpinned by personal anecdotes together with current social science research carried out in my home town of Kumara, on the West Coast of the South Island where I lived from 1983 until 2006. Cust (2008) states that “[c]urrently much of the township’s infrastructure and essential services have closed or become derelict after the industries it was built around became no longer operational” (p. 4). To unpick and <b>rethread</b> {{a sense of the}} fragility that commonly occurs in these circumstances I have explored the use of textiles and clothing that reference the situations that I witnessed in domestic, industrial and leisure activities in Kumara during the 1980 s. I used this method to investigate ways of representing the consequences of social closure on the people in the community. Using situation-based artwork as a communicative language, I have sought to create an additional space to social science research to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} issues faced by inhabitants of small industry dependant communities experiencing decline...|$|E
40|$|The Irish Linen Memorial {{creative}} {{project is}} an ongoing site conscious memorial installation which seeks to re narrate the almost 4, 000 deaths which {{took place during the}} fraught period in contemporary Northern Ireland, called ‘the troubles’. The dead, far from being gone, remain as a powerful part of the community. How we think about the dead, and the stories we tell about the relationship between the dead and the living, are central to imagining new forms of community and narratives of nationhood. An intimate, yet public, monument to those killed, The Irish Linen Memorial is created on white, linen handkerchiefs, with the names printed and overstitched with embroidery, and spotted with sewn hair. As an adjunct to this counter monument, I constructed a personal installation on the subject of ‘mending’, developed through a residency at The Gunnery studios in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. In addition to The Irish Linen Memorial, in 2002 and 2004, I invited fellow artists to dialogue with the work that, in turn, produced a dance theatre performance and a seven channel sonic surround original music composition. As well, in 2005, new media components were a part of the installation. In all, this project comprises this exegesis, several gallery installations, a DVD that documents the artwork and a portfolio of images in a booklet. The exegesis outlines the complexities of a hybrid memorial grounded equally in contemporary sculpture and textiles. I have outlined the historical context of the material culture of linen and presented a general overview of the socio political landscape of contemporary Northern Ireland from a feminist postcolonial perspective. My case studies center on how installation artists tackle socio political issues of national concern. The thesis exegesis reflects upon the new theoretical positionings of feminist theory in relation to sculpture and textiles, text and textiles, feminist theories of the public and the private, the greater visibility of the migrant artist, in particular, the self consciousness of the migrant artist in Australia, together with the increasing conflation of High/Low, Art/Craft arts practice into an elastic hybridity. The case studies I examine to explore these themes are the work of USA artists Richard Serra (b. 1939) and Maya Lin (b. 1959); in particular Lin’s Vietnam Veteran’s Memorial, 1982, an anti monument on a reconciliatory theme of national importance, and Serra’s Tilted Arc, 1979 89, a courageous exposition of the working chiasmatic power of a federal, pedestrian plaza. My other case studies are contemporary artists Narelle Jubelin (Australian, currently based in Spain, b. 1960) and Doris Salcedo (Colombian, educated in New York City, b. 1958), whose installation artwork is based in sculpture and textiles, and both of whom address touch as an important component of their work. Jubelin addresses national issues through the extreme juxtaposition of petit point needlework with large scale architectonic forms. Salcedo works with art as a witness, re configuring furniture and clothing, leaving the viewer with the affect of the terror, grief and trauma of living with daily political violence. The dimensions of this book are the size of the handkerchief used in the creative project. The side bar of the exegesis acts as a reminder of the central concern of my artwork from 2001 – 2005 : honouring equally all those killed in the troubles, listed chronologically. Thus, the exegesis becomes another artwork: a site, displaced and conveniently mobile, as is The Irish Linen Memorial and the book upon which it is based, Lost Lives: the stories of the men, women and children who {{died as a result of}} the troubles, 2000. The exegesis seeks to pick, unpick and <b>rethread</b> a sense of the fragile, recuperative work involved in a community emerging from conflict, the place of my birth...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: While most of {{the studies}} on {{molecular}} machines have been performed in solution, interfacing these supramolecular systems with solid-state nanostructures and materials is very important in view of their utilization in sensing components working by chemical and photonic actuation. Host polymeric materials, and particularly polymer nanofibers, enable the manipulation of the functional molecules constituting molecular machines and provide a way to induce and control the supramolecular organization. Here, we present electrospun nanocomposites embedding a self-assembling rotaxane-type system that is responsive to both optical (UV−vis light) and chemical (acid/base) stimuli. The system includes a molecular axle comprised of a dibenzylammonium recognition site and two azobenzene end groups and a dibenzo[24]crown- 8 molecular ring. The dethreading and <b>rethreading</b> of the molecular components in nanofibers induced by exposure to base and acid vapors, as well as the photoisomerization of the azobenzene end groups, occur in a similar manner to what observed in solution. Importantly, however, the nanoscale mechanical function following external chemical stimuli induces a measurable variation of the macroscopic mechanical properties of nanofibers aligned in arrays, whose Young’s modulus is significantly enhanced upon dethreading of the axles from the rings. These composite nanosystems show therefore great potential for application in chemical sensors, photonic actuators, and environmentally responsive materials. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{water-soluble}} [3]rotaxanes-(n + 2) and [3]pseudorotaxanes-(n+ 2) with short (propyl, n = 1) and long (dodecyl, n = 10) aliphatic spacers {{have been prepared}} in high yields by a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction catalyzed by cucurbit[6]uril (CB 6). The pH-triggered dethreading and <b>rethreading</b> of CB 6 on these pseudorotaxanes was monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. A previously reported [3]rotaxane- 12 that is known to behave as a bistable molecular switch has two recognition sites for CB 6, that is, the diaminotriazole moieties and the dodecyl spacer. By changing the pH of the system, {{it is possible to}} observe more than one state in the shuttling process. At low pH values both CB 6 units are located on the diaminotriazole moieties owing to an ion-dipole interaction, whereas at high pH values both of the CB 6 units are located on the hydrophobic dodecyl spacer. Surprisingly, the CB 6 units shuttle back to their initial state very slowly after reprotonation of the axle. Even after eighteen days at room temperature, only about 50 % of the CB 6 units had relocated back onto the diaminotriazole moieties. The rate constants for the shuttling processes were measured as a function of temperature over the range from 313 to 333 K and the activation parameters (enthalpy, entropy, and free energy) were calculated by using the Eyring equation. The results indicate that this [3]rotaxane behaves as a kinetically controlled molecular switch. The switching properties of [3]rotaxane- 3 have also been studied. However, even under extreme pH conditions this rotaxane has not shown any switching action, which confirms that the propyl spacer is too short to accommodate CB 6 units. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|The semirigid binuclear {{ruthenium}} complex Delta,Delta-[mu-(11, 11 -bidppz) (phen) (4) Ru- 2](4 +) {{has been}} shown to rearrange slowly from an initial groove-bound nonluminescent state to a final intercalated emissive state by threading one of its bulky Ru(phen) (2) moieties through the DNA base stack. When this complex binds to poly[d(A-T) (2) ], a further increase in emission from the complex is observed after completion of the intercalation, assigned to reorganization of the intercalated complex. We here report a study of the threading process in poly[d(A-T) (2) ], in which the minor groove binding dye DAPI is used as an energy transfer probe molecule to assess the distribution of ruthenium complex during and also after the actual threading phase. The emission from DAPI is found to change with the same rate as the emission from the ruthenium complex, and furthermore, DAPI does not disturb the binding kinetics of the latter, justifying it as a good probe of both the threading and the reorganization processes. We conclude from the change in the emission from both DAPI and the ruthenium complex with time that DAPI-ruthenium interactions are most pronounced during the process of threading of the complex, suggesting that the complexes are initially threaded slightly anticooperatively and thereafter redistribute along the DNA to reach their thermodynamically most favorable distribution. The final distribution is characterized by a small but significant binding cooperativity, probably as a result of hydrophobic interactions between the complex ions despite their tetravalent positive charges. The mechanism of "shuffling" the complex along the DNA chain is discussed, i. e., whether the ruthenium complex remains threaded (requiring sequential base-pair openings) or if unthreading followed by lateral diffusion within the ionic atmosphere of the DNA and <b>rethreading</b> occurs...|$|R
40|$|New Material World: <b>Rethreading</b> Technology {{highlights}} ten contemporary textile {{artists from}} Canada, Denmark, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, who engage modern technology either by employing or studiously resisting {{it in their}} work. The exhibition explores ways in which some artists utilize technology {{as a tool to}} expand their design capabilities and others use it to further their cultural, political, scientific, or social interests. Technology aids in planning and implementing artwork, allowing artists more time to explore new creative ventures. Modern exchanges of information facilitate collaborations between artists and industry. Although technology has benefited many textile artists, others find new meaning in the materials they choose. The use of non-traditional mediums such as combs, stainless steel, paper, and wood have led to innovative new designs. Some artists use technology as a means to production and design, and others consider their choice and use of material inherently antithetical to technological advancement. This tension between handcrafting and modern machinery has historical precedents, perhaps most famously in the Art and Crafts movement of the midto- late 19 th century. During this period in Great Britain, designer William Morris and art critic John Ruskin opposed industrialization and its perceived ills-the alienation of the worker and shoddy mass-productionand envisioned a utopian society of communal laborers dedicated to handcrafting. According to artist Jessica Smith, with today 2 ̆ 7 s digital capabilities, we are at similar crossroads. Smith 2 ̆ 7 s work invites the viewer to consider the connection between innovation and tradition. She uses chemically enhanced pigments and industrial woven cloth to articulate historical textile patterns. Her installations combine hand-printed wall coverings and Jacquard-woven upholstery with digitally-printed ceramics. For New Material World, Smith has recreated a 19 th-century domestic interior. Here, she draws from 17 th-century fabrics that were woven in England and France, but visually inspired by Asian imports such as Chinese porcelains, Indian textiles, and Japanese lacquers. Domestic textiles such as these have communicated both actual and aspiring social status, as well as gender and ethnicity throughout history. Tying the handcrafting versus technology debate with taste and class, Smith is interested in how textiles can transcend historical boundaries...|$|R
