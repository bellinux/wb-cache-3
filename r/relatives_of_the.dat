5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. eturia. The pilot whales were also close <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot whales are the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and Risso's dolphin.|$|E

Tzeltal has {{tens of thousands of}} monolingual speakers.|$|E

5|$|The storm petrels are <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> petrels {{and are the}} {{smallest}} seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E

5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Driscolls {{attempted}} {{to strike back}} at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{classification}} is {{a critical}} component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taxon are hypothesized to be. Biological classification uses taxonomic ranks, including among others (in order from most inclusive to least inclusive): Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.|$|E

5|$|Cladistic {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{found that the}} closest <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), with which they share several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities. Dalatias and Isistius {{are believed to have}} evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (65.5 Ma), {{as part of a larger}} adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats.|$|E
5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cougar.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the group containing the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely. It was estimated that the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two species moved to the island about 35 million years ago, when a land bridge between Nazareth (Rodrigues) or St. Brandon banks and Mauritius formed.|$|E

5|$|McQuarrie and Alexander {{researched}} first-hand accounts, photos, newsreels and texts. They {{also examined}} Gestapo and SS records, as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing {{the events of}} the conspiracy in its aftermath. A timeline of events was created, from which McQuarrie and Alexander shaped the script. After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet with <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} {{anniversary of the}} crash, a plaque on the Charles Landley Bridge was unveiled. The bridge crosses the rail tracks {{at the site of}} the accident, and a {{makeshift}} memorial had been maintained there by victims' families. NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman attended the unveiling along with Mayor Gray. Another memorial plaque was also installed, by Metro officials, at Fort Totten station; it was subject to complaints from <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, who claimed that it was insensitive.|$|E

5|$|Peterborough {{sent two}} members to {{parliament}} {{for the first}} time in 1547. Before the civil war, many were <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy; then for two hundred years after the restoration there was always a Fitzwilliam, or a Fitzwilliam nominee, sitting as member for Peterborough, making it a Whig stronghold. Representation was reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.|$|E
