5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E

25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E

However, [...] "school psychology" [...] itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Learning and Educational Development, 2005 Today, many regular {{schools in}} the State of Victoria provide {{inclusive}} education programs. Educating children {{with and without disabilities}} is linked with upholding the rights of all children regardless of their class, culture, gender or developmental abilities. This study was aimed at exploring perceptions of early childhood and primary school teachers about the inclusion of children with special needs from six independent schools located in metropolitan Victoria. Data were analysed and compared to identify if there were differences in teachers' attitudes in relation to beliefs and values, feasibility of implementing inclusive programs in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> and their confidence to carry out inclusive practices. Findings indicated that all participants in the study were very positive about the philosophy of including children with disabilities in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Several factors were identified as major contributors to the positive perceptions of teachers. Data also revealed that teachers had many concerns regarding the implementation of inclusion in their <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> The findings of this study had implications for best practice to improve the implementation of inclusive programs in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provided}} six behaviorally handicapped {{elementary school}} students with a short-term resource treatment to bring their behavior {{under the control of}} a combination of treatment procedures emphasizing self-evaluation. Once acceptable levels of appropriate behavior were maintained with only minimal external reinforcement and students were accurately self-evaluating their own work and behavior, generalization and maintenance of behavior gains were sought by introducing a reduced form of the self-evaluation procedures in the students' <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> A multiple baseline across pairs of subjects design was used to examine individual student's behavior. Analysis {{of the results of the}} study indicated that students transferred and maintained high levels of appropriate classroom behavior in their <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms,</b> once self-evaluation procedures were extended into those settings. For four of the six students, all extra-training components were faded.

2500|$|Acceleration {{presents}} {{gifted children}} academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, {{and for this}} reason is a low-cost option {{from the perspective of the}} school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. [...] However, for the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially. [...] "Radical acceleration (acceleration by two or more years) is effective academically and socially for highly gifted students." [...] Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, psychologist Miraca Gross reports: [...] "the majority of these children [...] are socially rejected , isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of IQ 180+ who are retained in the <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress." [...] These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible. Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the primary}} school level, {{students}} spend all class {{time with their}} peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may {{be as simple as}} a modified assignment provided by the <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> teacher, or it might include formal programs such as Odyssey of the Mind, Destination Imagination or academic competitions such as Brain Bowl, Future Problem Solving, Science Olympiad, National History Day, science fairs, or spelling bees. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education [...] ). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like English, Spanish, Latin, Philosophy, Science, etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities. [...] Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives. [...] However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences between special and <b>regular</b> education <b>classroom</b> environments and students with learning disability (LD) and behavioral disorder (BD) labels. Specifically, comparisons were made on various teacher, student, task/instructional, and physical environment variables. In addition, the behaviors of identified and non-identified students in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> were compared. Seven-minute observations using the Code for Instructional Structure and Student Academic Response (CISSAR) and a project-developed CISSAR Supplement were conducted on a sample of 824 regular and 536 special education classrooms. Data were analyzed using multivariate analyses of variance and descriptive statistics. ^ Results suggested that although special and <b>regular</b> education <b>classrooms</b> were similar in some respects (e. g., levels of classroom organization and noise), they differed on many environmental components. In special education classrooms, more approval was shown by teachers, more time was spent in reading and free time activities, and readers and worksheet materials were used more often. These classrooms had fewer students and more adults present. Students showed more student academic response behaviors while in special <b>classrooms.</b> In <b>regular</b> education <b>classrooms,</b> more time was spent in instruction via lectures, and in science and social studies instruction. Students displayed more task management and competing behaviors while in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Finally, regardless of setting, students with LD labels engaged in more task management behaviors than students with BD labels. ^ With the exception of student variables, students with BD and LD students were not differentiated {{on any of the}} variables studied. Identified students behavior differed, however, from that of non-identified students in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Specifically, identified students displayed more competing behaviors and less task management than non-identified students. Equal amounts of student academic response behaviors were observed. ^ Results are discussed in terms of how well practices in special and <b>regular</b> education <b>classrooms</b> conform to those found to constitute effective teaching. Two alternative models of special education service delivery are discussed with regard to their feasibility and effectiveness. Finally, implications of obtained results for school psychologists are addressed. ...|$|R

To address effectively the needs of students with mild disabilities in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> and curricula requires a multi-faceted approach that incorporates the dynamics of reciprocal collaboration, cooperative learning, teaming, and effective instructional support technaques. The need for a collaborative ethic among general and special educators is descrihed. The efficacy of cooperative learning that focuses upon achievement outcomes especially related to students with mild disabilities is reviewed. The components of a cooperative approach that enhances the integration of students with mild disabilities and fosters high achievement levels are discussed, as well as a schoolwide restructuring model designed to embrace student diversity and enhance the achievement of all students, including students with mild disabilities, in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms...</b>|$|R
