The nationalist state wished to strengthen the national identity of Estonia. The Estonian National Museum (ENM) as a <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> and knowledge availed its resources to support cultural propaganda. The ethnographer Helmi Kurrik, a woman of strong will and keen interest in folk textiles, managed to fulfil her obligation at the expense of her own health. The primary result of her labours was a handbook entitled Eesti rahvar&otilde;ivad (Estonian Folk Costumes) (1938) which has influenced general knowledge of folk costumes in Estonia up to the present day &ndash; the &lsquo;right&rsquo; national costumes are believed to derive from authentic ethnographical folk costumes held in the Estonian National Museum...|$|E

The cells of the granular layers {{are considered to be}} the principal <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> and it is supposed that information may be transferred to these cells from the extracellular fluid as well as by synaptic stimuli. To provide a basis for this model, conditions are investigated for the transmission of potentials in the extracellular fluid by the neural membrane, and it is shown that selective transmission will occur, provided that an eigenvalue condition is satisfied involving, inter alia, the frequency of the potential and geometrical properties of the membrane surface. Further calculations are made to determine the amplitude of the transmitted potential, and it is verified that this is normally sufficient to excite the cell. The model is developed further to simulate the activity of the neural cells constituting a unit of the cerebellar cortex, and to exhibit the effects of both extracellular and synaptic transmission.

40|$|This thesis {{approaches}} {{the issue of}} form in the Caribbean novel {{from the perspective of}} the key role played by the body as an alternative <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> in the region. Whether in terms of the production of the wage-labourer under capitalism or the regulation and exploitation of the slave, the body was the locus of a series of power relations upon which colonialist / capitalist expansion hinged. Yet for the colonised, its connection to cultural practices such as vodun ritual meant that it served too as the amanuensis of an historical legacy denied 'legitimate' expression. Tracing the impact of the various material and ideological constraints imposed upon not only the body but also land and language from the time of slavery, the thesis explores how three writers in particular - Patrick Chamoiseau, Wilson Harris, and Earl Lovelace - have sought to integrate this embodied tradition in order to transform a body politic scarred by racial polarisation, underdevelopment, and victimhood. The thesis examines how the need for an original epic form able to express the complexity of the Caribbean's history requires are-visionary approach to memory. It suggests that the latter in tum requires the formulation of an original philosophy, one that, reflecting the admixture of cultures in the Caribbean, makes use of a diversity of intellectual traditions, including traditional African religion, to forge ontological and epistemological modes capable of conveying cross-cultural community. The incorporation of the insights provided by rituals based on ego-displacement, for example, contributes to a form that seeks to undo the consolidation of character and narrative, consuming or reritualising the past to release a new vision of the future. Moreover, the worldview behind this form offers a means to envisage the renewal of the national project and the transformation of the capitalist world system...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Travels with Herodotus Ryszard Kapuscinski writes: "Herodotus admits that he was obsessed with memory, fearful on its behalf. He felt that memory is something defective, fragile, impermanent – illusory, even. That whatever it contains, whatever it is storing, can evaporate, simply vanish without a trace. His whole generation, everyone living on earth at that time, was possessed by that same fear. Without memory one cannot live, for it is what elevates man above beasts, determines {{the contours of the}} human soul; and yet it {{is at the same time}} so unreliable, elusive, treacherous. It is precisely what makes man so unsure of himself [...] . In the world of Herodotus, the only real <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> is the individual" (2008 : 75 - 76). In this discussion of memory, Kapuscinski does not ask what memory is. He simply assumes a very basic definition namely that memory’s primary function is to preserve what has gone before. However, Kapuscinki’s reflection on why an “unsuccessful process” such as memory is so fundamental, is more interesting. Memory provides a starting point. One cannot step into the same river twice, but at least the river of memory is there. Without memory no progress of any kind would be possible. Memory establishes what the past contained so that the present can move forward. This is the very basis for all human development. The fact is, as individuals and collectively, we cannot and do not have to start over all the time. Because it already contains the past – even though a fragmented past – memory provides us with a springboard into the future. Taking the importance of memory as a given, I would like to consider briefly why Horace would engage with and celebrate the past so consistently. Subsequently I would like to consider more carefully how this celebration of the past functions as an aide-mémoire for his audience. Publisher's versio...|$|E

40|$|That Terrifying Center is a {{creative}} and philosophical {{experiment in the}} transmission of corporeal experiences and socio-cultural knowledge through poetry. I am bringing together the seemingly disparate threads of my studies into one creative-theoretical project: a collection of original poems exploring the development of multiple subjectivities, the terror of self-examination, and the scrutiny of memory; {{it is also a}} collection of poems that bear witness, that simply tell stories. These are poems that talk about what it 2 ̆ 7 s like to live in a body; they ask questions and translate answers related to becoming woman, demystifying fear, investigating genealogies of pain, and narrating family histories. As the title of the project suggests, That Terrifying Center 2 ̆ 7 s creative synthesis is fearsome work and the discursive chapters of this project are also part of the experiment. My poems interrogate language and somatic realities, this is not just what the body says-or how it is read by outsiders- but how it interprets, interacts with space, location, and geography. I see the body as a <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> and possibility. Consciously, I want to cultivate a poetics of hybridity-experimentation with language and form, while keeping a narrative voice (or voices) telling the story, using absences, space, shifts in time, and memory to translate and even reproduce the sensations of being human. The creative dissertation consists of a critical introduction and two conceptual halves. The first half is a collection of original poetry, divided into the following sections: The Bottom line, Absurdity, Conjure Woman, and Sunterblooms Ik Tew. The second half of the project consists of four discursive chapters. Chapter one presents the cultural and creative framework(s) that prefigure my treatment of 2 ̆ 2 many-selvedness, 2 ̆ 2 and black women 2 ̆ 7 s embodiment as they draw from M. NourbeSe Philip 2 ̆ 7 s concepts 2 ̆ 2 s/place, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 dis place 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 bodymemory. 2 ̆ 2 This chapter also considers 2 ̆ 2 writing the body 2 ̆ 2 and the reconceptualization of creativity in the poetry and essays of Audre Lorde. Chapter two presents my work as an in-process, prismatic poetics (of parallels and intersection, of reflection) -of language and sounds, but also of space and embodied experimentation that uses poetry as an epistemological tool. Taking a cue from poet Barbara Henning 2 ̆ 7 s statement that Mullen adopts a kind of 2 ̆ 2 verbal scat 2 ̆ 2 in her poetry, I consider how the vocal scat in jazz is a particularly resonant metaphor for considering improvisation, language, and the role of 2 ̆ 2 sound image 2 ̆ 2 in the discussion of poetic experimentation in work by Harryette Mullen and others. Chapter three retraces the process of locating the thematic, formal and conceptual centers of the poetry manuscript. This chapter also presents some of the challenges involved in writing critically about my own poetry. In particular, I explore my desire for a poetics of hybridity and the conflicting pull to write conventional criticism and to write creatively in the discursive parts of That Terrifying Center, while considering the genesis and overall design of the creative-theoretical project. Chapter four is a lyric essay that meditates on my personal interaction with these poems, speaking frankly {{about the ways in which}} grief, illness, and memory informed the earliest conceptions of this project, its shifts and its detours. In this final chapter, I reflect on the nature of my project: the poignancy of what it has meant to translate the language of my innermost selves, to plumb my own memories, to offer up the flesh and wonder of my own terrifying poems...|$|E

Having old clothes that they have saved in their closets or purchasing something similar to what they had in their youths that is either an original vintage piece or a vintage-inspired reproduction is a way for them to find safe haven in pleasant memories and reveries.

Together with anatomical and physiological data, the •neuropsychological findings support a model of cortico-hippocampal interactions in which the temporal and representational properties <b>of</b> hippocampal <b>memory</b> processing are mediated separately.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses how residents, governments, and {{the international}} community continue to transform and recast two colonial port cities, Elmina in Ghana and Fort Kochi in India, as heritage sites and museums in order to represent particular histories. These sites act as <b>repositories</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> venues for community rituals, spaces for exhibitions, and backdrops for artistic productions. This exploration of these ports demonstrates the continued relevance and resonance of colonial heritage in postcolonies and exposes how knowledge of colonialism are produced and disseminated through the media of heritage and museums. Elmina and Fort Kochi are ideal case studies in part because of their similar historical trajectories, but principally because of their parallel contemporary existences. Both of these towns have been reconstituted as heritage destinations and are now exhibitionary landscapes with multiple museums, heritage homes, and archeological ruins. Furthermore, both are venues for recurring cultural performances and festivals. Their urban landscapes simultaneously exhibit colonial struggles, modern aspirations, and postcolonial predicaments. By analyzing the revitalization of history in Elmina and Fort Kochi, I show how these cities function as alternative archives that harbor submerged narratives of migration and cultural exchange through unique modes of museum display, both within and beyond the walls of the gallery spaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of devotional music in India {{has been an}} active, sonic conduit where spiritual identities are shaped and forged, and both history and mythology lived out and remembered daily. For the followers of Sikhism, congregational hymn singing has been the vehicle through which text, melody and ritual act as <b>repositories</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> elevating memory {{to a place where}} historical and social events can be reenacted and memorialized on levels of spiritual significance. This dissertation investigates the musical process of Shabad Kirtan, Sikh hymn singing, in a Sikh musical service as a powerful vehicle to forge a sense of identification between individual and the group. As an intimate part of Sikh life from birth to death, the repertoire of Shabad Kirtan draws from a rich mosaic of classical and folk genres as well as performance styles, acting as a musical and cognitive archive. Through a detailed analysis of the Asa Di Var service, Shabad Kirtan is explored as a phenomenological experience where time, place and occasion interact as a meaningful unit through which the congregation creates and recreates themselves, invoking deep memories and emotional experiences. Supported by explanatory tables, diagrams and musical transcriptions, the sonic movements of the service show how the Divine Word as Shabad is not only embodied through the Guru Granth Sahib, but also encountered through the human enactment of the service, aurally, viscerally and phenomenologically...|$|R

We found that expression of a constitutively active mutant form of CaMKII in these structures disrupted spatial memory formation. Immediate post-training activation of the transgene disrupted previously established memory while transgene activation 3 weeks following the training was ineffective. These results demonstrate that, similar to the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex plays a time-limited role in spatial memory formation but is not a final cortical <b>repository</b> <b>of</b> long-term <b>memory.</b> Moreover, these results suggest that the indiscriminate activation of CaMKII is able to disrupt preexisting memories, possibly by altering the pattern of synaptic weight changes that are thought to form the basis <b>of</b> the <b>memory</b> trace...|$|R

Current research explores issues of ageing, intergenerationality, creativity and identities in relation to representations, experiences, practices and also investments across popular culture. At its 2014 summer school, it ran a project called ‘Let’s Dance’ which sought to map out narratives of expectations and experiences of ageing in relation to gender and dance. Undergraduate Popular Music students at The University of Gloucestershire were asked to pick an age group (40 +, 50 +, 60 +, 70 +) and compile a playlist they thought such groups would dance to. Delegates for the summer school submitted three tracks that made them dance. The research team compiled age specific playlists, which were played to the delegates at a club venue in Cheltenham. Delegates’ choices were explained in audio interviews prior to the event and reflections collected afterwards. Drawing on recent work on music and ageing (Bennett, 2006; Hodkinson, 2011; Jennings and Gardner, 2012), ‘WAM!
