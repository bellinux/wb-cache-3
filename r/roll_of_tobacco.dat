2500|$|The English word [...] "tobacco" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} Spanish and Portuguese word [...] "". The precise origin of this word is disputed, {{but it is}} generally thought to have derived at least in part, from Taino, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taino, it was said to mean either a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552) or to tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).|$|E
2500|$|Dunlop schemed to have Sara {{exhibited}} and Cesars was the showman. Dunlop exhibited Baartman in the Egyptian Hall of Piccadilly Circus on November 24, 1810. Dunlop {{thought he}} could make money because of Londoners' lack of familiarity with Africans and because of Baartman's large bottom. Crais and Scully say: [...] "People came to see her because they saw her not as a person but as a pure example of this {{one part of the}} natural world". A handwritten note made on an exhibition flyer by someone who saw Baartman in London in January 1811 indicates curiosity about her origins and probably reproduced some of the language from the exhibition, thus the origin story should be treated with skepticism: [...] "Sartjee is 22 Years old is 4 feet 10 Ins high, and has (for an Hottentot) a good capacity. [...] She lived in the occupation of a Cook at the Cape of Good Hope. Her Country is situated not less than 600 Miles from the Cape the Inhabitants of which are rich in Cattle and sell them by barter for a mere trifle, A Bottle of Brandy, or small <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tobacco</b> will purchase several Sheep – Their principal trade is in Cattle Skins or Tallow. – Beyond this Nation is an other, of small stature, very subtle & fierce; the Dutch could not bring them under subjection, and shot them whenever they found them. [...] 9th Jany. 1811. [...] " [...] The tradition of freak shows was longstanding in Britain at this time, and historians have argued that this is at first how Baartman was displayed. Baartman never allowed herself to be exhibited nude [...] and an account of her appearance in London in 1810 makes it clear that she was wearing a garment, albeit a tight-fitting one.|$|E

5000|$|A cigar is {{a tightly}} <b>rolled</b> bundle <b>of</b> dried and {{fermented}} tobacco which is ignited {{so that its}} smoke may be drawn into the smoker's mouth and expelled; thus the cigar is generally [...] "puffed on" [...] (like a tobacco pipe) {{as opposed to being}} inhaled from (as is the case with cigarettes). The cigar {{is one of the oldest}} methods <b>of</b> preparing <b>tobacco</b> for consumption, some of the first cigars being introduced to Europeans as <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoked by the Taíno of 15th century Cuba.|$|R
6000|$|So the French {{colors were}} taken down; the [...] "kegs of milk" [...] and <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> were rejected; the grand council {{broke up with}} a war-dance, and the ambassadors departed, weeping and howling, and {{predicting}} ruin to the Miamis.|$|E

60|$|The General slept lightly. It {{was three}} o'clock Saturday {{morning when the}} sharp {{challenge}} of a sentry broke the silence.

50|$|In {{the two and}} a half {{following}} months, Santa Rosa {{was involved}} in a lot of loading and unloading procedures.

60|$|We {{made our}} way for the East Indies, by the coast of Brazil; not {{that it is in}} the course of sailing the way thither, but our captain, either on his own account, or by the {{direction}} of the merchants, went thither first, where at All Saints' Bay, or, as they call it in Portugal, the Rio de Todos los Santos, we delivered near a hundred tons of goods, and took in a considerable quantity of gold, with some chests of sugar, and seventy or eighty great <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> every <b>roll</b> weighing at least a hundredweight.|$|R

60|$|At {{this point}} the red-man seemed {{to get into the}} swing of the thing, for a white blanket of medium size, and another of very small dimensions, were demanded. These {{represented}} wife and infant. After this a tin kettle and a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> were purchased. The chief paused here, however, to ponder and count his quills.|$|E
60|$|But as abused {{prosperity}} is oftentimes {{made the}} very means {{of our greatest}} adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with great success in my plantation: I raised fifty great <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty <b>rolls,</b> being each <b>of</b> above a hundred weight, were well cured and laid by against {{the return of the}} fleet from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed often the ruin of the best heads in business.|$|R
5000|$|Discovery Farm {{was built}} land {{patented}} as [...] "Second Discovery" [...] in 1729. A {{house was built}} starting with a kitchen in 1760 with nearby slave quarters.

50|$|Early texts, {{including}} those of Lewis and Clark, indicate that C. l. nubilus was abundant throughout the Great Plains, outnumbering local coyotes. Alexander Henry mentioned wolves several times in his writings on his trips to North Dakota, noting how they fed extensively on bison carcasses, and were bold around humans, sometimes approaching people and entering tents. He recorded that Native tribes occasionally dug up wolf pups and dug large pitfalls to capture adults, while Maximilian of Wied recorded that they would sell wolf pelts in exchange for two <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> each. Though still common by the mid-1800s, a combination of railroad construction, human settlement, the development of stock grazing and the subsequent extermination of bison pushed C. l. nubilus to the remoter regions of its range where the terrain made agriculture impracticable.|$|R
60|$|But {{when the}} woman heard that, {{and found that the}} man did not at all know either when their son would be out of his apprentice-ship, or where he had gone, she packed him off again to find out, and gave him a bag of food and a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> to take away with him.|$|E
6000|$|Keymis has not {{yet been}} to the mine; he could not, 'by reason of the murmurings, discords, and vexations'; but he will go at once, make trial of the mine, and come down to Trinidad by the Macareo mouth.

'Praying God to give you health and strength of body, and a mind armed against all extremities, I rest ever to be commanded, your lordship's, Keymish.' ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{they went}} to a great many masters, but all said that they could make the lad as good as they were themselves, but better than that they could not make him. When the man came home to the old woman with this answer, she said, 'I shall be equally well pleased {{whatever}} you do with him; but this I do say, that you are to have him made a master over all masters.' Then she once more put some food and a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> into the bag, and the man and his son had to set out again.|$|E
60|$|After a {{few days}} farther conference with this ancient friend, be brought me {{an account of the}} six first years income of my plantation, signed by my partner, and the merchants' trustees, being always {{delivered}} in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every year the income considerably increased: but, as above, the disbursement being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old man let me see, that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the place.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} the store he {{went straight to}} a large <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> Canadian twist <b>tobacco,</b> cut off a piece, refilled his pipe, and, sitting down on a bale began or, rather, continued to smoke. He had not been seated long when the door opened, {{and the head of}} a half-breed peeped cautiously in with an uncommonly sly look.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a letter}} of my partner’s, congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved, and what it {{produced}} a year; with the particulars {{of the number of}} squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of my own, and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards’ skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my two merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> {{and the rest of the}} whole account in gold.|$|R

We would like to live beside your village and to hunt with you. You see he has a gun. He has many things as presents, {{and it will be}} well for the village where he settles. Here is some tobacco for all," [...] and Luka handed a small <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> to each of the men. [...] "We have also some presents for the women," [...] and he produced two or three looking-glasses, and some rows of large blue and red beads.

6000|$|... 17. I was so out {{of order}} with my head this morning, that I was going to send my excuses to my Lord Keeper; but however I got up at eleven, and walked there after two, and stayed till eight. There was Sir Thomas Mansel, Prior, George Granville, and Mr. Caesar,(3) {{and we were very}} merry. My head is still wrong, but I have had no formal fit, only I totter a little. I have left off snuff altogether. I have a noble <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> for grating, very good. Shall I send it to MD, if she likes that sort? My Lord Keeper and our this day's company are to dine on Saturday with George Granville, and to-morrow I dine with Lord Anglesea.|$|E

[...] And here he {{suddenly}} leaned down and whispered in my ear: [...] "Take care of the old tod;* he means mischief. Come aboard till I can get a word with ye." [...] And then, passing his arm through mine, he continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: [...] "But, come, what can I bring ye from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour's can command. A <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco?</b> Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone pipe? the mocking-bird that mews {{for all the world}} like a cat? the cardinal bird that is as red as blood?--take your pick and say your pleasure." ...|$|E
60|$|Girdlestone {{called for}} Mrs. Jorrocks, who laid the cloth {{and put a}} piece of cold corned beef and a jug of beer upon the table. Ezra {{appeared}} to have a poor appetite, but Burt ate voraciously, and filled his glass again and again from the jug. When the meal was finished and the ale all consumed, he rose with a grunt of repletion, and, pulling a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> black <b>tobacco</b> from his pocket, proceeded to cut it into slices, and to cram it into his pipe. Ezra drew a chair up to the fire, and his father did the same, after ordering the old woman {{out of the room}} and carefully closing the door behind her.|$|R
6000|$|... 14 The tobacco {{was to be}} used as snuff. About {{this time}} ladies much {{affected}} the use of snuff, and Steele, in No. 344 of the Spectator, speaks of Flavilla pulling out her box, [...] "which is indeed full of good Brazil," [...] {{in the middle of the}} sermon. People often made their own snuff out <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> <b>tobacco,</b> by means <b>of</b> rasps. On Nov. 3, 1711, Swift speaks of sending [...] "a fine snuff rasp of ivory, given me by Mrs. St. John for Dingley, and a large <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> tobacco." ...|$|R

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of: but other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination, of wandering about, and pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make my duty.|$|R
60|$|I {{was struck}} with these {{reflections}} as one astonished, {{and had not}} a word to say, no, not to answer to myself: but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brasilians take no physic but their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I had {{a piece of a}} <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured.|$|E
60|$|Lumley, whose {{powers of}} {{observation}} often surprised me, {{had noticed that}} Attick looked often and with longing eyes at a very small <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> which belonged {{to one of his}} comrades, and lay on the counter temptingly near at hand. Slowly, and, as it were, inadvertently, he advanced his hand until it touched the tobacco, then, laying hold on it, when the owner was busy with something else, he carried it towards the bosom of his leather hunting-shirt. Before it reached that place of concealment, however, Lumley quickly, yet so quietly that the act was scarce perceived, seized the elbow of the chief and gave him a look. Attick promptly put the tobacco down and looked at Lumley with a scowl, but the pale-face chief was smilingly giving some advice to the man, with whom he was trading.|$|E
60|$|The {{spirits of}} the men were farther rejoiced by the coming up of the other party, bearing the good news that the keel of the boat was safe, as well as all her {{planking}} and the carpenter's tools, which fortunately happened to have been secured in a sheltered spot. From the depths of despair they were all suddenly raised to renewed and sanguine hope, so that they wrought with the energy of gold-diggers, and soon their toil was rewarded by the discovery of that which, in their circumstances, they would not have exchanged for all the golden nuggets that ever were or will be dug up from the prolific mines of Australia, California, or British Columbia, namely, three casks of biscuit, a small keg of wine, a cask of fresh water, a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and a barrel of salt junk.|$|E
