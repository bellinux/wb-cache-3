2500|$|Before Milton, [...] "the {{sense of}} regular rhythm... had been knocked into the English head so {{securely}} {{that it was}} part of their nature". The [...] "Heroick measure", according to Samuel Johnson, [...] "is pure... when the accent <b>rests</b> <b>upon</b> <b>every</b> second syllable through the whole line The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable", Caesural pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle {{and the end of the}} line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no enjambed endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included hypermetrical syllables (trisyllabic feet), inversion or slighting of stresses, and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line. Milton deemed these features to be reflective of [...] "the transcendental union of order and freedom". Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: “The English... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit”. Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did Oliver Goldsmith, Henry Pemberton, and Scott of Amwell, whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was [...] "displeasing to a nice ear". It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with Gray) began to appreciate [...] "the composition of Milton's harmony... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification".|$|R

Arguments based upon suggestions of public policy not recognized in the patent laws are not relevant. The field to which we are invited by such arguments is legislative, not judicial.|$|R

30|$|Zhang et al. [30] {{present the}} {{advanced}} Internet of Things (AIoT) paradigm {{based on the}} unified object description language (UODL) proposed by the same authors. UODL allows identifying and interconnecting every object and event with a standard format, making available all the information and events related to the objects, and make the control by management and third party entities easy and flexible. The AIoT paradigm and our framework both take care of identifying objects, handling discovery, and providing a deployment mechanism but the main difference is the way objects are modeled. Our framework is based <b>upon</b> <b>REST</b> and <b>every</b> single framework element is a service that provides resources via simple HTTP requests. Because of this, any existing third party service using HTTP as application protocol can be easily integrated into our framework. In the same way, our framework can directly use the same technologies for security and data privacy as the available on the traditional Web. Finally, AIoT doesn't directly involve the user in the environments where the applications are deployment, our framework is designed to allow users to crate or modify such applications following the mashups concept.|$|R
