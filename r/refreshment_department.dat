60|$|Cyprian {{behaved in}} an {{exemplary}} fashion in the <b>refreshment</b> <b>department,</b> and cheerfully accepted a fish cake and a mince pie {{and a small}} cup of coffee as adequate restoratives after two hours of concentrated shopping. He was adamant, however, in resisting his aunt’s suggestion that a hat should be bought {{for him at the}} counter where men’s headwear was being disposed of at temptingly reduced prices.|$|E
6000|$|I was, and I am, {{sensible}} {{that the}} air of this chamber, in its strong combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the <b>refreshment</b> <b>department.</b> Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life. (I {{was not at all}} happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upstairs was a <b>refreshment</b> <b>department,</b> {{and there}} I got cold meat. There was coffee {{still in the}} urn, and I lit the gas and warmed it up again, and {{altogether}} I did not do badly. Afterwards, prowling through the place in search of blankets--I {{had to put up}} at last with a heap of down quilts--I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits, more than was good for me indeed--and some white burgundy. And near that was a toy department, and I had a brilliant idea. I found some artificial noses--dummy noses, you know, and I thought of dark spectacles. But Omniums had no optical department. My nose had been a difficulty indeed--I had thought of paint. But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like. Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down quilts, very warm and comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|The Bloomsbury hostel started {{upon its}} career with an {{embarrassing}} difficulty. The young {{women of the}} International Stores <b>Refreshment</b> <b>Departments</b> for whom these institutions were primarily intended displayed what looked extremely like a concerted indisposition to come in. They had been circularized and informed that henceforth, to ensure the [...] "good social tone" [...] of the staff, all girls not living {{at home with their}} parents or close relations would be expected to reside in the new hostels. There followed an attractive account of the advantages of the new establishment. In drawing up this circular with the advice of Mrs. Pembrose, Sir Isaac had overlooked the fact that his management was very imperfectly informed just where the girls did live, and that after its issue it was very improbable that {{it would be possible to}} find out this very necessary fact. But the girls seemed to be unaware of this ignorance at headquarters, Miss Babs Wheeler was beginning to feel a little bored by good behaviour and crave for those dramatic cessations at the lunch hour, those speeches, with cheers, from a table top, those interviews with reporters, those flushed and eager councils of war and all the rest of that good old crisis feeling that had previously ended so happily. Mr. Graper came to his proprietor headlong, Mrs. Pembrose was summoned and together they contemplated the lamentable possibility of this great social benefit they had done the world being discredited at the outset by a strike of the proposed beneficiaries. Sir Isaac fell into a state of vindictiveness and was with difficulty restrained by Mr. Graper from immediately concluding the negotiations that were pending with three great Oxford Street firms that would have given over the hostels to their employees and closed them against the International girls for ever.|$|R
