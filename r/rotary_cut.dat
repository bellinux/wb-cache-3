40|$|A {{solid board}} factory {{produces}} rectangular sheets of cardboard {{in two different}} formats, namely large formats and small formats. The production process consists of two stages separated by an inventory point. In the first stage a cardboard machine produces the large formats. In the second stage {{a part of the}} large formats is cut into small formats by a separate <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> machine. Due to very large setup times, technical restrictions, and trim losses, the cardboard machine is not able to produce these small formats. The company follows two policies to satisfy customer demands for <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> format orders. When the company applies the first policy, then for each customer order an ‘optimal’ large format (with respect to trim loss) is determined and produced on the cardboard machine. In case of the second policy, a stock of a restricted number of large formats is determined {{in such a way that}} the expected trim loss is minimal. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> format order then uses the most suitable standard large format from the stock. Currently, the dimensions of the standard large formats in the semi finished inventory are based on intuitive motives, with an accent on minimizing trim losses. From the trim loss perspective it is most efficient to produce each <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> format from a specific large format. On the other hand, if there is only one large format in each caliper, the variety is minimal, but the trim loss might be inacceptably high. On average, the first policy results in a lower trim loss. In order to make efficiently use of the two machines and to meet customer’s due times the company applies both policies. In this paper we concentrate on the second policy, taking into account the various objectives and restrictions of the company. The purpose of the company is to have not too many different types of large formats and an acceptable amount of trim loss. The problem is formulated as a minimum clique covering problem with alternatives (MCCA), which is presumed to be NP-hard. We solve the problem by using an appropriate heuristic, which is built into a decision support system. Based on a set of real data, the actual composition of semi finished inventories is determined. The paper concludes with computational experiments. ...|$|E

In this method, the tilt angle of the intersection curve of two toruses (ICTT) generated from two neighboring <b>rotary</b> <b>cuts</b> in UPRM was measured to identify the spindle inclination error. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the ICTT profile and present {{the relationship between the}} tilt angle of ICTTs and the spindle inclination error by solving the differential of the ICTT function, by which the spindle inclination error can be solved under the given cutting parameters and the tilt angle of ICTTs. The effects of cutting parameters on the tilt angle of ICTTs were explored. An error compensation procedure was designed and a group of groove cutting experiments was conducted to identify and compensate the spindle inclination error.

40|$|Fast growing sengon (Paraserianthes moluccana) {{is largely}} rotary-cut to produce veneer for core plywood production. In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon. The frequency of lathe check affect significantly the glue bond and bending strength, in which the glue bond, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) decrease as the frequency of lathe checks increases.

40|$|Automobile and aero {{industries}} have an increasing interestin materials with improved mechanical properties. However, manyof these new materials {{are classified as}} difficult-to-cut withconventional tools. It is obvious that tools, cutting processesand cutting models has to be devel-oped parallel to materialsscience. In this thesis rotary cutting tools are tested as analternative toexpensive diamond or cubic bore nitridetools. Metal matrix composites mostly consist of a light metalalloy (such as aluminium or titanium) reinforced with hard andabrasive ceramic parti-cles or fibres. On machining, thereinforcement results in {{a high rate of}} tool wear. This is themain problem for the machining of MMCs. Many factors affect thelife length of a tool, i. e. matrix alloy, type, size andfraction of the reinforcement, heat treatment, cuttingconditions and tool properties. In tests, the Al-SiC MMC formed a deformation layer duringmilling, probably affected by lack of cooling. The dominatingfactor for tool life was the cutting speed. Water jet or CO 2 cooling of turning did not provide dramatic increase in toollife. With PCD, cutting speeds up to 2000 m/min were usedwithout machining problems and BUE formation. Tool flank wearwas abrasive and crater wear created an "orange-peel type" wearsurface. PCD inserts did not show the typical increase in flankwear rate {{at the end of its}} lifetime. The use of self-propelled rotary tools seems to be apromising way to increase tool life. No BUE was formed on therotary tool at high cutting data. The measurements indicatethat the rotary tool creates twice as good surface as PCDtools. The longest tool life was gained with an inclinationangle of 10 degrees. Tool costs per component will beapproximately the same, but rotary cutting tool allows higherfeeds and therefore a higher production rate and thus a lowerproduction cost. The rotary cutting operation might have a potential toincrease productiv-ity in bar peeling. The lack of BUE withrotary cutting gives hope on higher tool life. The test resultsshow that tool wear was 27 % lower with rotary cutting tools. Increase of cutting speed from 22 to 44 m/min did not affectcutting forces. This indicates that the cutting speed canincrease without significant change in tool wear rate. Issues related to rotary cutting like cutting models,cutting processes, standards, tools and models have beendiscussed. A tool wear model with kinetic energy has beendiscussed.

40|$|At {{the present}} time, plywood has lost market share to {{competitors}} such as waferboard and {{oriented strand board}} (OSB). Improvement in plywood production and plywood performance is required to make plywood competitive with other wood based panel products. The objectives of this study are: (1) to examine {{the possibility of using}} microwave for drying <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> veneer, (2) to investigate treatment methods for veneer both before and after fabrication of panels using diphenyl-methane diisocyanate (MDI), (3) to test the characteristics of veneer and panels visually and mechanically. The experimental (preliminary and main research topics) approach to addressing this question involves investigating the characteristics of high performance panel products. All experimental designs used in this study are factorial ANOVA models for different factorial levels. A one factorial design was used to analyse the effect of moisture content (0 % and 10 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of veneer samples, and the effect of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of small cube wood samples. A two factorial design was used to investigate uptake of MDI in veneer and plywood treatments. The variables tested included three concentrations of MDI (50 %, 60 % and 70 %) and three levels of soaking times (5. 10, and 15 minutes). Another two factorial design was used to analyse the effects of five levels of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) and three levels of temperature setting (60, 100, and 140 C) on the curing time of MDI solution for small cube wood samples. Analysis of the effects of edge sealing (sealed and unsealed) and pressure type (low and high pressure) on the uptake MDI and Copper Naphthenate was analysed using a two factorial design. The study shows that microwave drying of veneer is technically feasible to cope with veneer drying problems, which at the present time poses a "bottleneck" and is the major consumer of thermal energy used in plywood production. Microwave drying is characterised by having low within charge variability in moisture content after drying; no drying defects and has no effect on the glueability of plywood. However, some importance aspects of the use of microwaves should be taken into account- in designing a commercial drying process. These include: the position, condition, type of wave guide covers and the power level of microwave. Microwave power had a significant effect on drying time. The higher the microwave power used the shorter the drying time. The highest uptake of solid MDI in plywood samples was obtained with 70 MDI following 10 minutes soaking (51 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 MDI (45 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (41 kg/m 3) respectively. The highest solid MDI uptake in radiata pine veneer was obtained with 70 % MDI following 10 minutes soaking (115 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 % MDI (94 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (71 kg/m 3) respectively. Investigation into the curing processes indicated that the best temperature for curing MDI solution was 60 C. Microwave energy could not be applied for curing MDI treated samples. Microwaving resulted in substantial losses of MDI solution from the wood blocks. Pressure impregnation of MDI, increased the uptake of resin compared to soaking techniques. The highest uptake of solid MDI for plywood samples was obtained with 70 % MDI in unsealed samples using high pressure treatment (359 kg/m 3). This was followed by the treatment of plywood which had been edge sealed and high pressure treated (208 kg/m 3), sealed and low pressure treatment (71 kg/m 3) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (51 kg/m 3), respectively. The highest uptake of Copper Naphthenate in plywood samples was obtained for edge-sealed and high pressure treatment (0. 92 % wt/wt Cu) followed by unsealed and high pressure treatment (0. 88 % wt/wt Cu), unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 45 % wt/wt Cu) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 51 % wt/wt Cu), respectively. MDI solution applied to plywood and veneers by immersion improved the surface qualities of these products. The surfaces were smoother, more rigid; there was water resistance compared to untreated samples. Water absorption was limited to 8 kg/m 3 after 5 minutes exposure compared to 84 kg/m 3 for untreated plywood. The average surface hardness of MDI treated veneers (82) was 4 points (in Shore C scale) higher than untreated veneers (78). The greatest hardness was obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (85), followed by 60 % (83) and 70 % (78) MDI solutions. The average surface hardness of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment (85) was 6 points higher than untreated plywood (79). When MDI was applied by pressure impregnation surface hardness scores of 90 were obtained. The average shear strength of MDI treated veneer (0. 183 kN) is 35 % higher than untreated veneers (0. 135 kN). The highest values were obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (0. 202 kN), followed by 70 % (0. 178 kN) and 60 % (0. 169 kN) MDI solutions. The average shear strength of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment was 0. 125 kN. This was 24 % higher than untreated plywood (0. 101 kN). This shear strength value is 19 % higher when compared to that for Cu Naphthenate treated plywood using pressure treatment (0. 105 kN). It can be concluded that MDI resin can be used to improved the water resistance, surface hardness and strength properties of veneer and plywood. Cu naphthenate (in kerosene) preservative can also be used for treating finished plywood without affecting the strength properties of treated plywood.
