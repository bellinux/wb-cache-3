50|$|A {{mass grave}} {{containing}} upwards of 48 bodies and possibly more than 60 was discovered near {{the lake in}} 2001. The bodies {{were believed to be}} those of Kosovo Albanians killed by Serbian forces during the 1999 conflict, brought to the lake in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>lorry</b> dumped there during NATO air raids. The burial site was a gravel spit on the north bank of Derventa River, close to its junction with Lake Perucac, 13 km from Bajina Basta and 2 km from the village of Rastiste. It contained parts of a truck refrigerator container that had formerly held the bodies. The bones and clothing retrieved showed isolated evidence of burning; {{there was no evidence that}} this had occurred atthe burial site.|$|E
40|$|In 1996, the European banana import {{regime was}} {{under attack by}} the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The United States, {{supported}} by three major multinational corporations in the banana industry along with four Latin American countries, placed pressure on Europe to comply with trade obligations regarding its banana import regime, as they deemed it was functioning illegally. There will be many meetings and consultations {{in the coming year}} culminating in a vote on modifying fundamental rules of the Common Market Organization for Bananas (CMOB), which had been adopted at Marrakech in 1995. The new legislation may be very detrimental to member states of the ACP. The possibilities for growth of ACP member states, traditional suppliers to Europe, is dependent upon current negotiations regarding repartition of quotas. The extent of the current socioeconomic crisis, which could prompt WTO to take corrective measures, is already quite alarming for other Caribbean countries where banana production is the main resource (particularly, for example, Dominica, St Lucia, and Jamaica). Indeed, for several years now, these countries have suffered from diminished competitivity because they have not made needed structural changes. However, opportunities for diversification exist, these include: the opening up of other markets, reinvigoration of local markets, amelioration of channels of production and commercialization of high quality products such as organic bananas and the fair trade banana. But it is wise to be realistic, the roads to diversification, although realizable, are not without their challenges. World trade figures for bananas account for only 13. 3 tonnes of bananas (FAO, 1996). Whereas 80 % of all bananas produced worldwide go to domestic markets. In most producing countries, bananas are very popular and used in a variety of local dishes. Both in terms of production and consumption, plantain {{is at the top of}} the popularity hit list. It literally provides food security for millions of people. Of the 28. 3 million tonnes of plantain produced worldwide, 69. 4 % is destined for human consumption, 11. 1 % processed and 8 % fed to livestock. More than 60 % of this world volume is produced and consumed in central and western Africa. Plantain production is targeted for domestic consumption and thus marketed according to traditional strategies. The plantain trade is closely tied to urban market trends, with demand rising steadily as the population grows. This trade is also dependent on the marketing subsector organisation - transporters, wholesalers, retailers - which varies from country to country. Plantain is transported from plantation to market in a variety of ways, e. g. on labourers' backs, in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>lorry,</b> by canoe and on bicycles. In Ghana, market retailers and traders go to the plantations or villages themselves to purchase plantain supplies from farmers with whom they have established agreements. Whole bunches are placed in baskets; banana hands and fingers are put in bags and carried out manually to the road. A lorry driver is then paid to transport the fruit to market, and collector-wholesalers often arrange the lorry transport operation. The bananas are sold to middlemen or traders, who sell them to retailers, who in turn sell them to consumers in bunches or separate fingers. The complexity of the intermediary subsector increases proportionally around distribution hubs with the distance between production and supply markets, especially when the approach routes are in good shape. This trend is well established in Caribbean countries such as St Vincent, whereas it is just emerging in Africa. For instance, jobbers group around important markets in southwestern Cameroon (Mile 60, Bole and Owe). The banana plantations are quite remote from Douala (100 - 150 km), not easily accessible, and often impassable in the rainy season. Large quantities of plantain are delivered to the city markets on a daily basis via regular distribution channels, and the longest one involves three main types of middleman: collector-wholesalers (purchasing 50 - 500 bunches from the producers), sedentary wholesalers, who sell to retailers on a per-bunch basis in the wholesale and retail markets of Douala, and these retailers in turn sell to consumers or other retailers on a per-finger basis. Middlemen have a key role in the plantain marketing subsector - from the wholesaler to the retailer. As this domain becomes increasingly complex, growers are forced to produce greater quantities of higher-quality plantain, more regularly, and at lower cost. Production criteria are gathered by middlemen on the basis of information they obtain on selling prices, consumer demand and market trends. By professionalizing the subsector, the most organized of these go-betweens (dealers, transport agents, etc.) could become key stakeholders and thereby influence domestic market patterns. Reducing postharvest losses As domestic consumer demand is constantly increasing, local market dynamics depend on producers' capacity to maintain adequate sustainable production levels, while staving off postharvest banana losses. The most common cropping practice involves extending yearly production over as long a period as possible. Soil potential is crucial for the success of this strategy. In Cameroon and Rwanda, on volcanic soils in the Dominican Republic, and on river alluvia in the humid intertropical zone, plantain growers have adopted a sustainable production strategy, and this crop is often their main source of income. In Ghana, consumer demand for plantain is high and its retail price is steadily rising, however production has been stagnant for 10 years. This situation could be turned around by planting high yield, strongly pest and disease resistant, cultivars. Postharvest plantain losses are generally heavy and are estimated at about 3 million tonnes worldwide. These losses are due to poor harvest and handling conditions, in addition to a shortage of distribution channels (e. g. CÃ´te d'Ivoire). The quality of communications networks is also an important factor. In most African countries, access routes to markets are in poor condition and poorly maintained, except around large urban centres. For instance, farmers in Rusitu valley in Zimbabwe produce high volumes of dessert bananas. They lose a substantial portion of their overall production during the rainy season because of the very long distances along poor roads that have to be travelled to the nearest urban markets. The EU has set up a system whereby farmers can rent vehicles to facilitate getting to local markets. Still, asphalting the roads represents the most efficient way of promoting trade to external markets. Cameroon is a case in point, there are now paved roads allowing comparatively easy access to the main markets and the capital.

In August 1994 MAFF {{launched}} an inquiry after Greek authorities reported that a lorry loaded with 400 sheep from England had arrived in the Greek port of Igoumenitsa on a ferry from Brindisi, Italy on July 8 with 302 of the animals having died in transit. No export licence to Greece had been granted for the livestock, which left for the Netherlands on the Dover to Calais ferry on 5 July. Chief Superintendent Don Balfour, head of the RSPCA special operations unit, said: [...] "It is an awful example of what can go wrong on these long journeys with live animals. I question why it is necessary to subject animals to such journeys when there are perfectly adequate slaughterhouses in this country and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>lorries</b> to carry the meat abroad." ...|$|R

5000|$|Because {{most of the}} A82 {{is single}} carriageway, and the local {{geography}} means a detour can be a significant distance, there {{is a history of}} strong protest about closing the road. In August 2011, John Grieve, owner of Lochleven Shellfish Company, attempted to challenge Transport Scotland's plans to close the A82 overnight five days a week, for a period of up to three weeks, around the village of Onich, between Glencoe and Fort William. The Scottish Herald reported that, if the road closed, a journey from Oban to Fort William, normally 44 miles km, would require diverting via Loch Tay and Ballinluig, a journey of 166 miles km. Stewart MacLean from the A82 Partnership said, [...] "The proposal to close the road is ludicrous because there is no reasonable detour ... There are commercial vehicles running all the time. The delivery vehicles, the fish farm <b>lorries,</b> <b>refrigerated</b> wagons, they all need to get through." [...] In April 2013, Transport Scotland announced further plans to close the A82 at Onich for resurfacing, but they postponed the work due to an adverse reaction from local business owners.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1890s {{refrigeration}} {{played a}} vital role in the distribution of food. The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available. [...] By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914 almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The big meat packers, Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas. [...] By the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or <b>lorries.</b> <b>Refrigerated</b> vehicles are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between -40 and -20 Â°C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000 kg gross weight (in Europe). [...] Although commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household. First, most refrigerators were far too large. Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons. Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain. Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe. It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases. Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.|$|R
