5|$|Land {{clearing}} {{began on}} December 1, 2000, and {{construction on the}} footers began February 9, 2001. X-Flight was originally supposed to open in early May 2001, but due to technical difficulties, its opening was delayed. During testing, problems were discovered with several devices including the <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the trains and their restraints. X-Flight's media day was eventually held on May 24, 2001, and the ride officially opened two days later on May 26.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were more}} {{changes for the}} 1976 model year. The Classic DPL and Brougham {{featured}} a new design for wheel covers. Both coupe models obtained a new grille design divided in two portions with squared parking lights. The Classic AMX had {{a new and more}} discreet side decal covering only the front fenders and a new metal [...] "AMX" [...] emblem on the trunk lid corner. All three versions shared a new 160 km/h speedometer, tinted windshield, and seat designs that were based in AMC's Oleg Cassini units for the Matador coupes. These were color-keyed {{with the rest of the}} interior, the most unusual ones were those of the AMX as they were individual and included adjustable headrests with integrated Cassini crests and <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This is the only case of a VAM car close to the various U.S. AMC designer cars.|$|E
2500|$|For 1973, VAM {{sought to}} {{standardize}} and consolidate as much parts and components {{as possible to}} cut costs. The company discontinued both the 232 and 252 engine series {{in favor of the}} new 170 gross HP, 8.5:1 compression ratio AMC 258 cu in six cylinder with VAM's inhouse 266 degree camshaft and single-barrel Carter RBS or YF carburetor, which became the powerhouse of the Rambler American Rally of the year. This new engine shared the same crankshaft as VAM's also new 282 cu in six introduced two years before in the VAM Javelin model, allowing VAM to optimize resources and reduce costs. With the engine came a change in the rear differential gear ratio from 3.54:1 to 3.31:1. Aside from the revised taillights, the first set of high-back bucket seats became present, which were shared with the second-generation VAM Javelin. Strangely, unlike all previous models, they were not available with <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism.</b> New side panel designs accompanied a now standard parcel shelf incorporating both courtesy lights. The front end was completely updated as in the standard Rambler American models except for the unique characteristic of the blackout grille. The engine displacement emblems got their last digit changed into number eight keeping the same design as last year's units. The rectangular [...] "Rambler" [...] rear emblem was removed and its place taken by the manuscript [...] "Rally" [...] unit that was no longer present on the front fenders.|$|E
5000|$|Humanscale’s other notable task {{chair is}} its Liberty chair, also {{designed}} by Niels Diffrient, which {{was introduced in}} 2004. The Liberty chair is a tri-panel mesh back design, which allegedly provides lumbar support. [...] Like the Freedom chair, Liberty is also outfitted with a balanced <b>recline</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that is supposed to}} support all sitters throughout recline.|$|R
50|$|One {{product from}} Zodiac is the 5751 {{slimline}} economy class seat. This particular model of seat uses a unique <b>recline</b> <b>mechanism</b> where the seat bucket moves forward while reclining. This model of seat is currently used by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines on all several aircraft including Delta's 717, 737-700/800, 747-400, 767-300, 777, MD-90, and international/premium transcontinental 757-200, {{as well as}} American Airlines' 777-300ER and all reconfigured 737-800 and 757-200 aircraft. However, Delta is using the competing Pinnacle seat by BE Aerospace for the Airbus A330 fleet upgrades, {{as well as on}} the Boeing 737-900ER fleet), while American is using the competing CL 3620 seat by Recaro on its A319 and A321 fleets. United Airlines also uses the 5751 on its pre-merger United Boeing 777-200ERs equipped with the International Premium Travel Experience (IPTE) cabin.|$|R
2500|$|The 1977 American GFS {{incorporated}} the same appearance and equipment novelties as the American ECD {{of the same}} year. Like the two-door 1976 American ECD, the model kept the individual front seat and floor-mounted automatic transmission configuration, with the notable difference of incorporating <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as standard equipment. From this model the [...] engine was also retained, but incorporating the new head and intake manifold designs {{as well as the}} 3.07:1 rear gear ratio from the American Rally model of the year. The most unique aspect of the 1977 American GFS was its design of rear side windows and roof. VAM designers created a half Landau-type vinyl top carrying the roof Targa band AMC used for the 1977 Hornet AMX models and shortened flip-open rear side windows creating a thicker B-pillar. AMC really liked this styling touch and adopted it for its 1978–1979 Concord DL/Limited two-door models (except {{for the use of the}} Targa band).|$|R
2500|$|As the 1977 models arrived, the {{engineering}} upgrades {{seen on the}} 258 six the year before finally saw {{the light on the}} 282. An all-new head design with Quench-type combustion chambers took compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity. The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns {{and for the first time}} since 1972 <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism</b> (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanism were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear. In the exterior, the largest novelty of the year was the application of the new Gremlin front clip. New decals covering only the front fenders in their top sides started near the doors all the way to the marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a [...] "Rally 4.6" [...] sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option. The hood and trunk lights as well as the glove box unit were added to the standard equipment list.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the turmoil}} of 1982, Renault de México took over VAM from the Mexican {{government}} in February 1983. As with AMC, Renault was most interested in the Jeep line, VAM's production facilities, and its established dealer network. As soon as the agreement was finalized, Renault ordered the termination of VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. VAM's 1983 models existed mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories as well as fulfilling previous agreements with sourcing companies. The American line for 1983 soldiered on in a very limited form. The American GFS and American ECD models were virtually not produced for the final year. Both sedan models existed as the base manual and semi-equipped automatics units. Cars with manual transmissions had a parcel shelf as standard equipment while the units with automatic transmission featured aluminum road wheels, the same door panels and seat designs as the previous GFS and ECD models along with their respective door armrest safety reflectors. The two-door automatic models had a <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism</b> for their front seats. Regardless of the transmission, standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, and dual remote mirrors. The American DL station wagon model was virtually the only high-trim American model to be available. For 1983, the base automatic and the basic DL were merged into a single version alongside the equipped DL and the base manual, creating three versions for the year unlike the four {{of the last two}} years. The mid-range version had the same equipment as the sedan models with automatic transmission of the year, it was also called [...] "American DL" [...] and carried the same woodgrain panels and moldings that were never seen in the base automatics of the previous two years. The differences between the mid-range DL and the top-of-the-line DL are the presence of the AM/FM stereo radio, reading dome light, lighted vanity mirror, intermittent wipers and air conditioning in the latter model. The only optional accessories available were the AM/FM stereo tape player radio, remote-controlled door mirrors and electric antenna. Only the top-of-the-line DL carried the [...] I6 while the rest had the [...] Cars equipped with air conditioning included the larger 282 engine. Leftover 1983 VAM Americans were sold as 1984 models.|$|E
50|$|Available {{models for}} 1969 {{included}} a two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, four-door pillared sedan, and four-door station wagons with six- or nine-passenger capacity. A new Brougham option package included a vinyl roof on sedans and hardtops and a split-bench front seat with a <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{on the passenger}} side (except on the two-door hardtops). Monaco wagons received woodgrained vinyl trim along their sides and across the dual-action (side- and bottom-hinged) tailgate.|$|E
40|$|The frame {{response}} of occupied forward-facing wheelchairs secured by a surrogate four-point strap-type tiedown was characterized {{using data from}} 575 WC 19 frontal-impact sled tests. Powerbase, manual, and stroller-type wheelchairs with fabric or planar seats and seatbacks were tested. Loading mechanisms that caused damage to the base frame were identified {{and the effect of}} seating system type was considered. The most frequent types of wheelchair frame damage were failure or deformation of the rear securement brackets or frame members to which these are attached, main frame members, front caster assembly, footrests, seat tilt and seatback <b>recline</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and seatback canes. Wheelchairs with fabric seats were more likely to experience frame damage, but there was no relationship between seatback type and frame damage. There was no evidence of a relationship between base frame damage and wheelchair rotation. The patterns of frame damage and the relationships between damage and seating system type will be used to guide the design of a reusable surrogate wheelchair seating system (SWCSS) for use in frontal-impact tests of wheelchair base frames independent of commercial seating systems...|$|R
40|$|Summary, key points: Transport {{considerations}} {{ought to}} be factored into the initial phase of the wheelchair & seating assessment process. Manufacturers of wheelchairs and seating systems should make information relating to the safe transportation of their products readily available - and easy to understand. With the desire to provide the safest possible transport environment for wheelchair-seated passengers, and other vehicle occupants, all stakeholders must engage in a multi-disciplinary approach to ensuring transport safety; involving the wheelchair user with their families, carers, equipment prescribers, and transport providers*. A proven crashworthy wheelchair, {{used in conjunction with}} a proven wheelchair tie-down and occupant restraint system (WTORS), is fundamental to the provision of safe transport for both people who remain seated in their wheelchairs in a motor vehicle and other vehicle occupants. Exceptions exist on certain high-mass, low-speed urban public transport vehicles, where the likelihood of a crash situation and the severity thereof are low. Powered and manual wheelchairs offer a large variety of seated postures through their tilt, <b>recline,</b> and other <b>mechanisms.</b> Guidelines {{ought to be}} given by manufacturers with respect to use of these mechanisms during transport. The combination of a crashworthy seating system, that accommodates the proper fit of the occupant restraints, and a crashworthy wheelchair serve to indicate to the prescriber that the risks of equipment failure when exposed to crash conditions during transport have been reduced as far as reasonably possible. To minimise injury risk for wheelchair occupants, prescribers shall seek to ensure that the means of attachment of the seating system to the wheelchair is suitable for use in transport. It is imperative that the manufacturer’s instructions for use and fitting instructions for seating systems are carefully adhered to. Due to the individual nature of disability, prescribers may at times be faced with the need to work beyond manufacturers’ recommendations for the use of systems in order to maximise medical benefits, and to address the postural and functional needs of a wheelchair user. In such cases a risk management process ought to be followed, and transport providers should have a working comprehension of the relevant documented risk assessment process and understand the subsequent Risk/Benefit analysis. When properly used, a WTORS allows the wheelchair to be well secured to the vehicle floor and the passenger in the wheelchair to benefit from a properly fitted seatbelt system. Wheelchair manufacturers should highlight in their pre-sale literature any special requirements relating to the use of their wheelchair with WTORS. This information should include the configuration of the representative wheelchair, which was subjected to crash testing, so that informed decisions can be made with respect to wheelchair selection & configuration. Prescriber awareness of the type of transport environment and the facilities available to assist vehicle entry and egress is highly beneficial in the risk analysis process...|$|R

5000|$|In 1928, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker partnered and {{invested}} in the furniture business {{in the small town}} of Monroe, Michigan. They set out to design a chair for what they called [...] "nature’s way of relaxing." [...] Using orange crates to mock-up and refine their idea, they invented a wood-slat porch chair with a <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Knabusch and Shoemaker then upholstered their innovation and marketed it as a year-round chair. The chair was a success; they held a contest to name it—La-Z-Boy was the winner.|$|E
50|$|Seats are {{frequently}} equipped with further amenities. Airline seats may {{be equipped with}} a <b>reclining</b> <b>mechanism</b> for increased passenger comfort, either reclining mechanically (usually in economy class and short-haul first and business class) or electrically (usually in long-haul first class and business class). Most aircraft also feature trays for eating and reading, either in the seatback which folds down to form a small table in most economy class seats, or inside the armrest which folds out in most first class, business class, bulkhead, and exit row seats. Most airline seats also feature a pocket which may contain an in-flight magazine and safety instructions.|$|E
