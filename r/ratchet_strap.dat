40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{validity}} and reliability of an affordable crane scale for measuring peak force during an isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP); it may then provide a viable device to test with if a force plate is unattainable. Eight recreationally active males (age: 24 ± 2. 98 years, height 178 ± 7. 25 cm, mass 84. 9 ± 20. 16 kg) performed five IMTP trials with one-minute rest, the two largest outliers were discarded leaving three scores used in the analysis providing 24 data points for comparison. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Coefficient of Variation (CV) demonstrated strong levels of reliability (ICC = 0. 97; CV = 3. 3 % and ICC = 0. 93; CV = 4. 9 %) for force plate (FP) and crane scale (CS) respectively. The CS showed good construct validity against the FP (ICC = 0. 94; CV 4. 4 %) with the CS having a systematic bias of 49. 99 ± 161. 37 Newtons. Coaches should consider the crane scale as a valid, reliable and affordable alternative to the FP if one is not available to them. It is quick and easy to set up; requiring a box, <b>ratchet</b> <b>strap,</b> crane scale and pulling handle. This method provides an alternative to one-repetition max testing typically used in facilities where expensive measuring devices are unavailable...|$|E

50|$|Tie down <b>straps</b> (also called <b>ratchet</b> <b>straps,</b> lashing straps or tie downs) are {{fasteners}} used to {{hold down}} cargo or equipment during transport. Tie down straps are essentially webbing that is outfitted with tie down hardware. This hardware allows the tie down strap to attach to the area surrounding the cargo or equipment, loop over the cargo or equipment, and/or attach to the cargo or equipment. It usually also includes a method of tensioning the strap, such as a ratchet.|$|R
50|$|Two-piece {{tie down}} straps are a single {{assembly}} that is constructed out of two separate pieces of webbing each with their own hardware that are fastened at {{one end to the}} area surrounding the equipment to be protected and connect to each other, typically at the fastener.Webbing with linking device is a product used for fastening of goods with truck, trailer, pallets, boxes, containers etc. This is also known as <b>Ratchet</b> lashing, <b>Ratchet</b> <b>straps,</b> <b>Ratchet</b> tie down, tie down straps, lashing with webbing etc.|$|R

40|$|This body is wheelchair-bound. Not in {{the sense}} of the ableist idiom, but literally: bound to a nine-pound {{titanium}} frame through Velcro and <b>ratchet</b> <b>straps</b> ripped from snowboards. This wheelchair is body-bound, bound to the flick of a hip against strapping, pulling through plastic and metal and rubber and gravity and wood, into a tilt onto one wheel. This metal, this flesh, this materiality is bound, too, by rhythm and soundscape: chairs crashing; prodding questions; polite onlookers, silent; the percussive thud of wheels on uneven terrain. It is bound to the gaze of audience and reader and performer and lover. It is bound with the discourses of (dis) ability, in(ter) dependence, materiality and boundedness. This essay too, is wheelchair-body-bound. It is bound to explorations of previous works on the practices, discourses, and materialities of the wheelchair. It is bound by the authors’ personal narratives of living, playing, moving and thinking with, in and through various wheelchairs and other technologies of (im) mobility. It is bound through critical artistic engagement: bound with thinking and, literally, dancing through the ways that flesh-chair-discourse-power bind in the form of a subject, or an articulation, or an assemblage. Finally, this essay is bound through an unabashed and unbounded passion for the exploration of the local, specific, strategic, accidental, and creative ways that one may remake or even re-imagine the bonding of their tools, communities, ideas, bodies, and mobilities...|$|R

In 2005, Zoggs launched Predator Goggles with Wiro-frame Bio-Integral design technology. This delivered the versatility of a one piece goggle with a frame which offered individualised fit and comfort. 2005 also saw Zoggs {{become one of the}} first brands to introduce PVC safe inflatables as standard to their water confidence range. The following year, the Push-pad and <b>Ratchet</b> Quick-fit <b>strap</b> systems were launched. These have advanced strap mechanisms built into the frames claiming to make the goggle straps easier to adjust.|$|R
50|$|A pair of {{independent}} treadle mechanisms collected {{power from the}} rider's legs instead of a crank. Power from each treadle {{was transferred to the}} rear wheel by a leather <b>strap</b> over a <b>ratchet</b> mechanism. (See image in gallery below.) The attachment point of the leather strap could be moved to provide multiple gear ratios, and both treadles could be pressed simultaneously for a brief increase in torque. A spring attached to the <b>ratchet</b> rewound the <b>strap</b> when the foot was raised. This treadle arrangement also allowed riders of different sizes to ride the same bike comfortably without modification, as the pedals were not constrained to trace a circle about an axle.|$|R
50|$|Open {{commercial}} car carrier trailers typically have a double-decker design, with both decks subdivided {{into a number}} of loading and storage ramps that can be tilted and lifted independently of one another with hydraulics. Unlike flatbed tow trucks, which often need to transport non-running vehicles, car carrier trailers are not equipped with loaders or winches, instead relying on the vehicles to be loaded under their own power. The trailer hydraulics allow the ramps to be aligned on a slope so cars can be driven up and secured to the ramp floor with chains, tie-down <b>ratchets</b> or wheel <b>straps,</b> after which the ramp can be tilted in any direction to optimize stacking.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore {{potential}} designs for a table that attaches to poles and street signs outside food trucks. A convenient placement of tables could greatly facilitate and improve the eating experience for food truck customers and simultaneously keep people nearby for repeated business and community development. A table design without legs, that uses existing structures, such as street signs, telephone poles and lamp posts for support, was initially explored. Three goals were identified for the table's functionality. These goals included clamping to signs and poles of various diameters, safely supporting large loads and a simple, quick deployment process. Initial prototypes failed in fulfilling all three goals, largely due to inappropriate clamping mechanisms. In choosing a <b>ratchet</b> tie down <b>strap</b> as the final clamping mechanism, further improvements and designs were explored. Ultimately, an all in one table and brace system, involving an unfolding table surface was settled on. by Bryan A. Macomber. Thesis (S. B.)
