40|$|The gene-mutation-cancer {{hypothesis}} {{holds that}} mutated cellular protooncogenes, such as point-mutated proto-ras, “play a dominant part in cancer,” {{because they are}} sufficient to transform transfected mouse cell lines in vitro [Alberts, B., Bray, D., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K. & Watson, J. D. (1994) Molecular Biology of the Cell (Garland, New York) ]. However, in cells transformed in vitro mutated human <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed more than 100 -fold than in the cancers from which they are isolated. In view of {{the discrepancy between the}} very low levels of ras transcription in cancers and the very high levels in cells transformed in vitro, we have investigated the minimal level of human ras expression for transformation in vitro. Using point-mutated human <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> recombined with different promoters from either human metallothionein-IIA or human fibronectin or from retroviruses we found dominant in vitro transformation of the mouse C 3 H cell line only with <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> linked to viral promoters. These <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> were expressed more than 120 -fold higher than are native <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> of C 3 H cells. The copy number of transfected <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> ranged from 2 – 6 in our system. In addition, nondominant transformation was observed in a small percentage (2 – 7 %) of C 3 H cells transfected with <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> that are expressed less than 20 times higher than native C 3 H <b>ras</b> <b>genes.</b> Because over 90 % of cells expressing ras at this moderately enhanced level were untransformed, transformation must follow either a nondominant ras mechanism or a non-ras mechanism. We conclude that the mutated, but normally expressed, <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> found in human and animal cancers are not likely to “play a dominant part in cancer. ” The conclusion that mutated <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> are not sufficient or dominant for cancer is directly supported by recent discoveries of mutated ras in normal animals, and in benign human tissue, “which has little potential to progress” [Jen, J., Powell, S. M., Papadopoulos, N., Smith, K. J., Hamilton, S. R., Vogelstein, B. & Kinzler, K. W. (1994) Cancer Res. 54, 5523 – 5526].

These findings underscore the complementary functions of oncogenic and wild type Ras in tumor cells and identify a potential new targeting strategy for Ras-driven tumors. As bona fide members of the GTPase family, the functional output of Ras proteins depends on their GTP binding status which is dictated by the counteracting actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) 1.

50|$|Aflatoxin B1 is {{a potent}} {{genotoxic}} hepatocarcinogen with its exposure strongly linked {{to the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma, liver tumors, especially given co-infection with hepatitis B virus. These effects seem to be largely mediated by mutations at guanine in codon 249 of the p53 gene, a tumor suppressing gene, and at several guanine residues in the 12th and 13th codons of the <b>ras</b> <b>gene,</b> a gene whose product controls cellular proliferation signals. Aflatoxin B1 must first be metabolitzed into its reactive electriphilic form, Aflatoxin B1-8,9-exo-epoxide by cytochrome p450. This active form then intercalates between DNA base residues and forms adducts with guanine residues, most commonly Aflatoxin B1-N7-Gua. These adducts may then rearrange or become removed from the backbone all-together, forming an apurinic site. These adducts and alterations represent lesions which, upon DNA replication cause the insertion of a mis-matched base in the opposing strand. Up to 44% of hepatocellular carcinomas in regions with high aflatoxin exposure bear a GC → TA transversion at codon 249 of p53, a characteristic mutation seen with this toxin.Prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals exposed to aflatoxin, increases with co-infection of hepatitus B virus. One study estimated that while individuals with urinary aflatoxin bio-markers were at 3x greater risk than the normal population for hepatocellular carcinoma; those infected with hepatitis B virus were at a 4x risk; and those with the bio-markers and infected with hepatitis B virus were at a 60x greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma than the normal population.|$|E

Here we show that treatment of cancer cells carrying the activated <b>ras</b> <b>genes</b> with Kobe 0065 or a siRNA targeting Ras downregulates the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX), which has been implicated in metastasis. LOX expression is enhanced by co-expression of Ras(G 12 V) through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt and concomitant accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α.

Mutational damage was investigated in mussels chronically exposed to the water-accommodated fraction of # 4 fuel-oil (WAF), and in mussels collected along the NW coast of Portugal in sites with different levels of petrochemical contamination. A <b>ras</b> <b>gene</b> point mutation was identified in the codon 35 of one individual exposed to 12. 5 % WAF No mutations were detected in mussels from the WAF control or environmental samples. This represents the first report of a <b>ras</b> <b>gene</b> mutation, experimentally-induced by petrochemical exposure, in an invertebrate species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Primary proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 1 beta, play {{a crucial}} {{pathogenic}} role in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and may represent, therefore, a suitable therapeutic target. We have previously established the delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), based on intracisternal (i. c.) injection of non-replicative HSV- 1 -derived vectors. Here we show the therapeutic efficacy of i. c. administration of an HSV- 1 -derived vector carrying the interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 <b>ra)</b> <b>gene,</b> the physiological antagonist of the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1, in C 57 BL/ 6 mice affected by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE. IL- 1 <b>ra</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is effective preventively, delaying EAE onset by almost 1 week (22. 4 +/- 1. 4 days post-immunization vs 15. 9 +/- 2. 1 days in control mice; P= 0. 0229 log-rank test), and decreasing disease severity. Amelioration of EAE course was associated with a reduced number of macrophages infiltrating the CNS and in a decreased level of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA in the CNS, suggesting an inhibitory activity of IL- 1 ra on effector cell recruitment, as antigen-specific peripheral T-cell activation and T-cell recruitment to the CNS is unaffected. Thus, local IL- 1 <b>ra</b> <b>gene</b> therapy may represent a therapeutic alternative for the inhibition of immune-mediated demyelination of the CNS...|$|R
40|$|Although {{cellular}} {{mutation analysis}} techniques are still {{used for the}} identification of mutagens, they are unsuitable {{for the study of}} disease-related mutations. Restriction site mutation (RSM) is an alternative method to traditional mutation recognition techniques that have some limitations. RSM technique aims of selecting certain DNA target by restriction enzyme digestion and resistant restriction enzyme recognition sequences (mutant) are amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, RSM has been developed as a genotypic mutation method in the rat. The method has been applied to rat p 53 and <b>ras</b> <b>genes.</b> Since RSM is the combination of restriction enzyme digestion and PCR, a number of factors have been investigated for use in the RSM. Several suitable restriction enzymes and primer pairs have been defined for analyzing base changes in the rat p 53 and <b>ras</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Ras</b> <b>genes</b> are {{the most}} common targets for somatic gain-of-function {{mutations}} in human cancers. In this study, we found a high incidence of correlation between Ras oncogenic mutations and c-Src activation in human cancer cells. We showed that oncogenic Ras induces c-Src activation mainly on the Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we identified p 120 RasGAP as an effector for oncogenic Ras to activate c-Src. The recruitment of p 120 RasGAP to the Golgi complex by oncogenic Ras facilitated its interaction with c-Src, thereby leading to c-Src activation, and this p 120 RasGAP-mediated activation of c-Src was important for tumor invasion induced by oncogenic Ras. Collectively, our findings unveil a relationship between oncogenic Ras, p 120 RasGAP, and c-Src, suggesting a critical role for c-Src in cancers evoked by oncogenic mutations in <b>Ras</b> <b>genes.</b> Cancer Res; 72 (9); 2405 – 15. © 2012 AACR...|$|R
