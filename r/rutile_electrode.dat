40|$|Historically, the {{investigation}} of the solid–liquid interface has seen four major breakthroughs: van Troostwijk and Deiman reported the first splitting of water in 1789 using a spark discharge source [1]. Becquerel observed the photoelectric effect at the solid–liquid interface in 1839 [2] and, 183 years after the first water splitting, Fujishima and Honda reported the light-induced dissociation of water at a TiO 2 <b>rutile</b> <b>electrode</b> [3]. Three years later, Gerischer published an article demonstrating that a rectifying contact can be realized at the semiconductor–redox electrolyte junction upon judicious choice of the semiconductor–electrolyte pairing [4]. This latter work laid the basis for all present energy-converting electrochemical devices for the conversion of sunlight into electricity or fuels at the solid–liquid interface [5]. Numerous reports followed after this inception of photoelectrochemical energy conversion [6 – 16] which included the development of regenerative photoelectrochemical solar cells [17 – 21], water splitting half-cells [22, 23], excitonic solar cells [24], and the dye sensitization cell of Graetzel [25, 26] which represents the first photoelectrochemical solar cell that has been realized as a technical device...|$|E
40|$|A new flux for metal {{arc welding}} has been developed. The basic {{components}} {{fall under the category}} of the <b>rutile</b> <b>electrode.</b> These include: titanium (iv) oxide, iron powder, Cellulose, sodium silicate binder and other additives. In this work, one of the major components was technically and economically substituted. The more popular but expensive potassium silicate binder was replaced by the more readily available sodium silicate. For the newly chosen binder to perform effectively, it was enriched with potassium carbonate (Potash). The flux formulation was not based on the old method of trial and error but some mathematical methods, especially the experimental design approach were applied. The Mc-Cleans and Anderson method was used in the preliminary design to generate the orthogonal array that guided the formulation. Four major components: Titanium dioxide, Iron powder, cellulose and Sodium silicate binder enriched with Potash were considered as the major contributing elements. An electrode made out of the flux was used by some professional welders and their comment {{on the quality of the}} electrode was impressive. Tests on the sample of the weldment showed that it could withstand a tensile strength up to 430 N/mm 2. The Brinell’s harness value gave a maximum of 608 N/mm 2. Also, the Nick Break revealed a good penetration, no slag inclusion. The micrograph presented an acceptable grain structure...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates photo-anodes {{based on}} {{titanium}} dioxide (TiO 2) {{that can be}} used to produce hydrogen by the photo-electrochemical decomposition of water. TiO 2 is a wide band gap semiconductor that absorbs only the UV region of the solar spectrum. Sensitization of TiO 2 to visible light by the addition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was studied. AuNPs sustain localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that results in the absorption of light at the resonant energy. The evidence for water splitting by Au-TiO 2 systems is discussed critically. Fabrication of arrays of AuNPs was done by; annealing sputtered gold thin films, micellar nanolithography, and nano-sphere lithography. The optical characteristics and photo-electrochemical ‘water splitting’ performance of AuNP coated rutile (110) electrodes were determined. Nb-doped crystals coated in AuNPs of ca. 20 nm exhibited a small photocurrent that was not present with the bare <b>rutile</b> <b>electrode.</b> Reduced un-doped rutile (110) with AuNPs did not exhibit the ‘plasmonic photocurrent’. Some Nb-doped electrodes did not exhibit an effect. Batches of Nb-doped and reduced rutile were examined using voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy and it was found that the ‘inactive’ Nb-doped TiO 2 was partially reduced. Thin films of TiO 2 were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) onto amorphous and single crystal substrates. The effect of growth conditions on the phase and orientation of the film were studied, and procedures to grow anatase films oriented with (100), (001), and (101) were developed. The temperature and heating regime of TiO 2 films fused silica affected the orientation of film growing. Nb doping of the films also affected the temperature of the anatase-rutile phase transition and the orientation of the films, acting to stabilize anatase at higher temperatures. Surprisingly, highly doped films were found to be non-conductive. The importance of the oxygen partial pressure in producing conductive films for use as electrodes is discussed. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{lithium-ion}} batteries represent the state-of-the-art of energy storage devices. Within this context the work herein presented {{deals with the}} investigation and {{the improvement of the}} electrochemical behavior of anode materials for {{lithium-ion batteries}}. Conductive agents play a fundamental role in determining the electrochemical performance of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Super-P carbon is often used in the electrode formulations in order to increase the electrical conductivity and to improve the contact between particles. In this work we synthesized a copper-modified Super-Pbased conductive agent, in which copper nanoparticles supported on the carbon matrix have been obtained by a microwave-assisted reduction of Cu (II) ions. The obtained copper/Super-P composite showed good dispersion of the nanoscaled copper particles on the carbon matrix. The synthesized conductive agent has been used instead of pristine Super-P during the manufacturing process of graphite and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 electrodes. Graphite is at the moment the most commonly used anode material in lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately when graphite anodes are forced to work at low temperature and/or at high charge/discharge rate, the electrochemical performance drastically decreases. In this work electrodes made of oxidized KS- 15 graphite (Timcal) have been tested at low temperature and high charge/discharge rate. Two different anodic formulations have been tested. Unmodified electrodes have been prepared using pristine Super-P as conductive agent. On the other hand, copper-modified ones have been manufactured with the synthesized copper/Super-P composite. It has been demonstrated that the use of the copper/Super-P composite in the electrode formulation leads to improved performances at low temperature (down to - 30 °C) and at increased charge/discharge rate. Furthermore, we propose a detailed study of the differential capacity curves dQ dE- 1 vs. V and a set of experiments to investigate the electrical properties of the tested samples. The obtained results showed decreased polarization and increased electrical conductivity for copper-modified electrodes. The effect of both pristine Super-P and Cu/Super-P on anodes electrochemical behavior is explained by DC- and AC -electrical studies. The results show decreased electrical resistance and metallic-like behavior of the electronic conductivity {{as a function of the}} temperature on samples containing Cu/Super-P. It implies that when the temperature is decreased, the electrical conductivity linearly increases. Conversely, the sample containing pure Super-P follows a classical semi-conductor behavior, with the electrical conductivity decreasing with the decreasing temperature. Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is considered a safer alternative to carbonaceous anodes. The main disadvantages of LTO-based electrodes are related to the poor ionic and electronic conductivity of this compound, which determine poor rate capability and poor electrochemical performances at low-temperature. In this thesis we demonstrate that the use of the copper/Super-P composite instead of pristine Super-P positively affects the electrochemical behavior of the tested anodes. Electrodes manufactured starting from commercial LTO purchased from Aldrich, have been tested in the temperature range of - 30 ≤ T≤ 20 °C. The results demonstrate excellent performances of the copper-modified electrodes. Moreover, the rate capability and the cycling stability of the LTO electrodes have been remarkably improved by the use of copper/Super-P in the electrode composition. Rutile-TiO 2 has been considered for a long time as almost inactive towards lithium insertion. Lately it has been proven that by controlling the particles size during its synthesis it is possible to reversibly insert a relevant amount of lithium ions into the rutile structure. In this work, nanoscaled rutile-TiO 2 has been synthesized following a sol-gel procedure. The electrochemical tests performed on <b>rutile</b> <b>electrode</b> demonstrated the excellent electrochemical behavior at low temperature. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that rutile-TiO 2 electrodes can be cycled within an enlarged potential window (0. 1 - 3 Volts) in addition to the classical 1 - 3 Volts window of TiO 2 system. The results obtained in this thesis have been the subject of the following publications and proceedings of congress: M. Marinaro, M. Pfanzelt, P. Kubiak, R. Marassi, M.

5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. <b>Rutile</b> <b>electrodes,</b> coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|R
40|$|A {{less well}} known form of {{transverse}} cracking in carbon manganese and low alloy steel weld metals, generally referred to as chevron cracking, {{has been found in}} a large number of industrial welds. These cracks are characterized by their macroscopic orientation, which is approximately transverse to the welding direction and at 45 with the plane of the plates (in a butt joint), and by the staircase morphology, which is easily recognized under microscopical examination. A special test was designed to reproduce these cracks under laboratory controlled conditions and a large number of welds was carried out. Chevron cracks were found in the tests with medium strength weld metals deposited by submerged arc with a basic agglomerated flux and by manual metal arc with basic and cellulosic electrodes. No chevron cracks were observed in the welds with <b>rutile</b> <b>electrodes.</b> High temperature baking of the submerged arc flux and the basic electrodes eliminated or reduced markedly the incidence of cracking in all cases indicating that hydrogen was the main factor controlling the cracking occurrence.

Design/methodology/approach: Studies of thermo-mechanical phenomena during manual arc welding MMA of tee-joints between plate girders and insert plates were carried out to identify possible sources of the concrete damage due to high welding temperature and stresses. Findings: It was shown that MMA welding at vertical-up position, by a <b>rutile</b> coated <b>electrode</b> of diameter 3, 2 [mm], at welding current 110 - 120 [A], of the butt welds of tee-joints of girders and the insert plate does not cause any harmful and damaging effect to concrete, which temperature in a region of the contact with the bottom surface of the insert plate does not exceed 240 [°C] during full cycle of welding. Tensile and compression stresses of concrete are transmitted mainly by anchoring bars, fixed in concrete and also by reinforcing fabric of concrete, and do not cause any cracks of concrete. Research limitations/implications: To achieve more consistent results of the numerical analysis of stresses and deformation distribution in the insert plate with experimental results, it is necessary to calculate plastic deformation of materials and also take into consideration nonlinear change of yield point (plasticity) as a function of temperature.

40|$|Abstract. The primary {{limitation}} of weldability of high strength {{low alloy steel}} is susceptibility to cold cracking. The important reason of the formation of cold cracks, besides forming brittle structure and residual stresses, is the presence of diffusible hydrogen in welded joint. The most effective methods reducing the susceptibility to cold cracking are connected with decreasing the amount of potential hydrogen. This process may be carried out in technological (drying welding filler materials, preheating components) or in a metallurgical way (filler metals with austenitic structure, adding rare-earths elements to filler metals as traps for hydrogen atoms in steel). The possibility to minimize the amount of diffusible hydrogen by changing the welding parameters seems to be particularly interesting. The article presents the results of a literature survey and preliminary tests which set out effects of welding conditions on the amount of diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal. Experiments were conducted by using <b>rutile</b> coated <b>electrodes</b> which generate high contents of diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal. The amount of diffusible hydrogen was determined by a glycerin test. Eleven factors were considered: the electrode angle, the grinding of sample, the preheat temperature, the polarity of welding current, the welding current, the welding – cooling time, the electrode usage, the time of welding, the thickness of specimen, the welding – measurement time and thickness of electrode coating. All factors were optimized using a Plackett-Burman design to get the most relevant variables. The results of the preliminary tests indicate that appropriate choice of welding parameters may considerably reduce diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal. However, the range of parameters is limited by the necessity of providing stability of the welding process and obtaining required properties of the welded joint...|$|R

The calculated lithium intercalation voltage starts at 3. 50 V for single-atom insertion and decreases to 2. 23 V for full lithiation, to the LiVO 2 compound, which agrees well with experimental results. The Mg insertion features a plateau about 1. 6 V up to Mg 0. 5 VO 2 and then another plateau-like region at around 0. 5 V up to Mg 1 VO 2.
