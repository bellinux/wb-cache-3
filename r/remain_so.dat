5|$|During the Ottoman wars in Europe, Klis Fortress {{became an}} {{administrative}} centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> for a century. As the first Sanjak-Beg of Klis, Murat-beg Tardić built a notable mosque inside the Klis Fortress. That same year, the Ottoman forces took Vrana, while Nadin and Perušić fell in 1538.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, Smythe became {{involved}} in charities and would <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> {{for the rest of}} his life. He became heavily involved in the Ontario Society for Crippled Children. Smythe helped organize the financing and construction of their Variety Club Village complex in Toronto. In 1975, at the age of 80, Smythe organized the financing and building of the Ontario Community Centre for the Deaf, which opened in 1979.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} battle, which {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory and in Petar Kružić's death, the Klis defenders, who were lacking in water supplies, finally surrendered to the Ottomans {{in exchange for their}} freedom on 12 March 1537. Citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army. Klis became an administrative centre or sanjak (Kilis Sancağı) of the Bosnia Eyalet, and would <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> for a century.|$|E

5|$|Driven by growth, India's nominal GDP {{per capita}} has {{steadily}} increased from US$329 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,265 in 2010, {{to an estimated}} US$1,723 in 2016, {{and is expected to}} grow to US$2,358 by 2020; however, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> in the near future. However, it is higher than Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and others.|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would <b>remain.</b> <b>So</b> while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|Development of Igor quickly ceased once it {{was named}} as a nearby {{disturbance}} produced moderate wind shear over the storm, displacing convection from its center. Embedded within a monsoon trough over the eastern Atlantic, the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on September9. Intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of Igor; it would <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> throughout {{the remainder of the}} cyclone's existence. Contrary to its earlier movement, the storm's forward motion markedly increased. Following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around its center, Igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{most of the}} town's {{inhabitants}} and {{the local}} elite were Saxons, largely descended from settlers brought in by the Kings of Hungary in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to develop and defend the southern borders of the province. By {{the middle of the}} next century roughly half the population had Hungarian names. In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian. In Kolozsvár, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations. New settlers to the town largely spoke Hungarian, a language that many Saxons gradually adopted. (In the seventeenth century, out of more than thirty royal free towns, only seven had a Hungarian majority, with Kolozsvár/Klausenburg being one of them; the rest were largely German-dominated.) In this manner Kolozsvár became largely Hungarian speaking and would <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> through the mid-20th century, though 4.8% of its residents identified as German as late as 1880.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to <b>remain</b> <b>so.</b> Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E

5|$|With a {{relatively}} dry environment along its projected path, Emily {{was expected to}} strengthen only gradually until its predicted passage through the Greater Antilles. For several hours into August2, the cyclone fluctuated little in intensity and organization as it developed banding features. Emily's appearance later improved on satellite images, and it developed a ragged central dense overcast; the NHC estimated that the storm had reached its peak sustained winds of 50mph (80km/h) by 0000UTC on August3. Nevertheless, reconnaissance revealed that its circulation remained poorly organized, and at the time, several forecast models even supported dissipation prior to landfall in Hispaniola. An increase in upper wind shear removed the deepest convection from the circulation center, and it would <b>remain</b> <b>so</b> {{for the rest of}} the storm's duration. On August4, the cloud pattern and convective banding became better organized near the center as the upper outflow over the cyclone expanded. Emily proceeded to track just south of the Dominican Republic, where its weak circulation became increasingly disrupted due to the adjacent high terrain and increasing vertical wind shear. The cyclone accelerated over Hispaniola and degenerated into an open trough around 2100UTC that day.|$|E
