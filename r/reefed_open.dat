40|$|Variation in {{reproductive}} {{parameters of}} Plectropomus leopardus populations between coral <b>reefs</b> <b>open</b> and closed to fishing was examined in two geographic regions (off Townsville (19 °S) {{and in the}} Swains (22 °S)) of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The reproductive parameters that were examined included the operational (reproductive) sex ratio and size and age structure of mature females, sex-changing individuals (transitionals), and mature males. There was {{a greater proportion of}} males above the minimum size and age of harvest on reefs closed to fishing for 8 - 10 years than on <b>reefs</b> <b>open</b> to fishing, although the effect varied with geographic region. Nevertheless, neither the sex ratio, mean age, nor mean size of males or transitionals varied significantly with reef closure status. Females, however, were significantly older and larger on closed than on <b>open</b> <b>reefs</b> in both regions. Marked regional variations in the sex ratio and average age of transitionals were found independent of reef closure status, suggesting regional variation in reproductive strategies. Controlled manipulations, inclusion of broad spatial scales, and detailed studies of intra- and inter-specific variation in serranid reproductive biology are necessary to resolve such complexities in the responses of protogynous serranids to fishing pressure and management strategies...|$|R

The problem of time point to open main parachute (tm) in this UAV Recovery System is analyzed by simulation results of this model, and a series of meaningful conclusion is drawn. When recovery system works while UAV is flying steadily, tm becomes earlier as velocity increases, and later as pitch angle increases. tm is earliest when relieve drag parachute reefing at the time when control subsystem stops working. Larger the drag characteristics of the fully opened drag parachute is, earlier tm is, and larger the drag characteristics of the <b>reefing</b> <b>opened</b> drag parachute is, later tm is.

40|$|The {{effects of}} size and age on {{reproductive}} dynamics of common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus populations were compared between coral <b>reefs</b> <b>open</b> or closed (no-take marine reserves) to fishing and among four geographic {{regions of the}} Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. The specific reproductive metrics investigated were the sex ratio, the proportion of vitellogenic females and the spawning fraction of local populations. Sex ratios became increasingly male biased with length and age, as expected for a protogyne, but were more male biased in southern regions of the GBR (Mackay and Storm Cay) than in northern regions (Lizard Island and Townsville) across all lengths and ages. The proportion of vitellogenic females also increased with length and age. Female P. leopardus were capable of daily spawning during the spawning season, but on average spawned every 4 · 3 [*]days. Mature females spawned most frequently on Townsville reserve reefs (every 2 · 3 [*]days) and Lizard Island fished reefs (every 3 · 2 [*]days). Females on Mackay <b>reefs</b> <b>open</b> to fishing showed no evidence of spawning over 4 [*]years of sampling, while females on reserve reefs spawned only once every 2 – 3 [*]months. No effect of length on spawning frequency was detected. Spawning frequency increased with age on Lizard Island fished reefs, declined with age on Storm Cay fished reefs, and declined with age on reserve reefs in all regions. It is hypothesized that the variation in P. leopardus sex ratios and spawning frequency among GBR regions is primarily driven by water temperature, while no-take management zones influence spawning frequency depending on the region in which the reserve is located. Male bias and lack of spawning activity on southern GBR, where densities of adult P. leopardus are highest, suggest that recruits may be supplied from central or northern GBR. Significant regional variation in reproductive traits suggests that a regional approach to management of P. leopardus is appropriate and highlights the need for considering spatial variation in reproduction where reserves are used as fishery or conservation management tools...|$|R
50|$|While many beach huts were former fishermen's huts, boatsheds or {{converted}} bathing machines, some of {{the earliest}} purpose built beach huts in the UK were erected at Bournemouth, either side of Bournemouth Pier in 1909. Designed by F. P. Dolamore, Bournemouth's Borough Engineer, they were offered for hire for £12 10s per year. 160 huts, or bungalows as they were styled, were initially built before the World War I. Today, Bournemouth features around 520 huts owned by the Council; there are in addition a further 1200 privately owned huts. They vary in style from the traditional, wooden, shed-like constructions to the ultra modern, concrete terrace style huts such as the 1950s Overstrand beach huts at Boscombe. These were renovated to designs by Wayne and Gerardine Hemingway, founders of the Red or Dead label, as Beach Pods for the Surf <b>Reef</b> <b>opened</b> in Autumn 2009.|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{effects of}} {{herbivory}} across broad gradients of varying ocean climate conditions and over small spatial scales {{is crucial for}} understand- ing its influence on primary producers. Effects of her- bivory on the distribution and abundance of kelp re- cruits were examined experimentally at two regions under contrasting ocean climate. Specifically, the abundance and survivorship of kelp recruits and the abundance of macro-herbivores were compared be- tween a ‘cool’ and a ‘warm’ region in northern and central Portugal, respectively. In each region, the abundance of kelp recruits {{and the intensity of}} grazing were compared between habitats of different topography within <b>reefs</b> (<b>open</b> <b>reef</b> vs. crevices). Com- pared to the ‘warm’ region, the abundance of kelp re- cruits was 3. 9 times greater in the ‘cool’ region, where 85 % of recruits were found in <b>open</b> <b>reef</b> habitats. In contrast, 87 % of recruits in the ‘warm’ region were re- stricted to crevices. The ‘warm’ region had 140 times greater abundances of sea urchins, 45 times more herbivorous fish and 4. 1 times more grazing marks on kelp recruits than the ‘cool’ region. Grazing assays showed ca. 50 times higher rates of kelp biomass con- sumption, mainly by fishes, and zero survivorship of kelp recruits in the ‘warm’ relative to the ‘cool’ region. This study suggests both temperature and herbivores affect abundances of kelp recruits across latitudes, and demonstrates how herbivores affect their distri- bution at local scales, driving kelp recruits into ‘hiding’ in crevices under intense herbivory. Conse- quently, where net recruitment success is compro- mised by herbivory, the persistence of kelps will be contingent on availability of topographical refuges...|$|R
50|$|The reef urchin is an {{important}} grazer on fleshy algae in the Caribbean area. Its abundance is reduced by predation by fish, especially the jolthead porgy (Calamus bajonado), the queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), the ocean triggerfish (Canthidermis sufflamen) and the hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus). Because of this predation, the <b>reef</b> urchin avoids <b>open</b> <b>reef</b> flats and in these locations there is an overgrowth of fleshy algae. It is unable {{to take over the}} algal controlling role of the black sea urchin (Diadema antillarum) which is subject to great fluctuations in population.|$|R

40|$|Periodically-harvested {{closures}} {{are commonly}} employed within co-management frameworks to help manage small-scale, multi-species fisheries in the Indo-Pacific. Despite their widespread use, {{the benefits of}} periodic harvesting strategies for multi-species fisheries have, to date, been largely untested. We examine catch and effort data from four periodically-harvested reef areas and 55 continuously-fished reefs in Solomon Islands. We test the hypothesis that fishing in periodically-harvested closures would yield: (a) higher catch rates, (b) proportionally more short lived, fast growing, sedentary taxa, and (c) larger finfish and invertebrates, compared to catches from <b>reefs</b> continuously <b>open</b> to fishing. Our study showed that catch rates were significantly higher from periodically-harvested closures for gleaning of invertebrates, but not for line and spear fishing. The family level composition of catches did not vary significantly between <b>open</b> <b>reefs</b> and periodically-harvested closures. Fish captured from periodically-harvested closures were slightly larger, but Trochus niloticus were significantly smaller than those from continuously <b>open</b> <b>reefs.</b> In one case of intense and prolonged harvesting, gleaning catch rates significantly declined, suggesting invertebrate stocks were substantially depleted {{in the early stages}} of the open period. Our study suggests periodically-harvested closures can have some short term benefits via increasing harvesting efficiency. However, we did not find evidence that the strategy had substantially benefited multi-species fin-fisheries...|$|R
40|$|The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is {{the largest}} coral reef {{system in the world}} and the coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus (Pisces: Serranidae, Lacepede 1802) is one of its most {{widespread}} and abundant piscivores (Ayling and Ayling 1986). Despite the importance of the coral trout fishery, very little is known about the feeding ecology of P. leopardus on the GBR. The principal objective of this study was to describe the diet and feeding of P. leopardus on this large reef system. Variation in the diet of this piscivore over a range of latitudes along the GBR and on <b>reefs</b> <b>open</b> and closed to fishing was examined. Seasonality of feeding by P. leopardus was addressed by comparing rates of digestion, consumption of food and diet in the austral summer and winter. Within populations of P. leopardus, the ontogenetic shifts in diet and individual feeding behaviour were examined. Plectropomus leopardus is one of the major predators of adult coral reef fishes on the GBR. After their first year of life, P. leopardus are almost entirely piscivorous oh adult fishes (99...|$|R

40|$|Batch {{fecundity}} {{of female}} Plectropomus leopardus, a coral reef fish targeted by commercial and recreational fishing, was compared between <b>reefs</b> <b>open</b> to fishing and reefs within no-take marine reserves within three {{regions of the}} Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Length, weight, and age had positive effects on batch fecundity of spawners from northern and central reefs but negligible effects on spawners from southern reefs. Females were least fecund for a given length, weight, and age in the southern GBR. Batch fecundity of a 500 -mm fork length female was 430 % greater on central reefs and 207 % greater on northern reefs than on southern reefs. The effects of length and age on batch fecundity {{did not differ significantly}} between reserve and fished reefs in any region, but weight-specific fecundity was 100 % greater for large 2. 0 kg females on reserve reefs compared with fished reefs in the central GBR. We hypothesize that regional variation in batch fecundity is likely driven by water temperature and prey availability. Significant regional variation in batch fecundity highlights the need for understanding spatial variation in reproductive output where single conservation or fishery management strategies cover large, potentially diverse, spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|Abundance, {{growth rates}} and {{nutrient}} {{limitation of the}} heterotrophic bacteria present in the reef water column and reef cavity water were measured on a fringing reef at Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles).
