50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Pallot opened Central Motor Works at Sion, Trinity, an {{agricultural}} works. He was a gifted engineer, and invented several agricultural implements which were employed on Jersey farms, {{and are now}} displayed in the museum, including the Pallot elevator digger, the last furrow <b>reversible</b> <b>plough,</b> the single furrow <b>reversible</b> <b>plough,</b> the tractor mounted Côtil winch, and the tractor mounted 2 point linkage transport box. His ability to improvise proved invaluable during the difficult years of the Occupation of Jersey by Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|R
25|$|One set of ploughs was right-handed, and {{the other}} left-handed, {{allowing}} continuous ploughing along the field, as with the turnwrest and <b>reversible</b> <b>ploughs.</b> The man credited with {{the invention of the}} ploughing engine and the associated balance plough, in the mid nineteenth century, was John Fowler, an English agricultural engineer and inventor.|$|R
50|$|The <b>reversible</b> <b>plough</b> has two {{mouldboard}} ploughs mounted back-to-back, one {{turning to the}} right, {{the other to the}} left. While one is working the land, the other is carried upside-down in the air. At the end of each row, the paired ploughs are turned over, so the other can be used. This returns along the next furrow, again working the field in a consistent direction.These ploughs date {{back to the days of}} the steam engine and the horse. In almost universal use on farms, they have right- and left-handed mouldboards enabling them to work up and down the same furrow. <b>Reversible</b> <b>ploughs</b> may either be mounted or semi-mounted and are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|R

50|$|The new DA 30 DT was {{launched}} in 1957. Offered as 8 variants, this model was the replacement for the DA 25. During this period, SAME also introduced and manufactured a range of specific implements such as ploughs (single blade, double blade, disc and <b>reversible</b> <b>ploughs),</b> spring tine cultivators, disc harrows, rototillers, backhoes, cutter bars, tipper trailers, irrigation pumps and auger drills. The first DA 30 DT models were painted orange with green wheels, while {{towards the end of}} the 1950s. The colour scheme was changed to red for the bodywork and wheels and dark grey for the engine.|$|R

Using previous {{experience with the}} implementation of new ADI cast shares for <b>reversible</b> <b>ploughs</b> and single-sided ploughs, the design and appropriate technology were developed to cast subsoiler coulters and culti-vator duckfoot. These castings were heat treated (austempered) and used in performance tests. The development of these tools, innovative in terms of their shape geometry and selection of suitable cast material resistant to extra heavy operating condi-tions, improved the functionality and prolonged service life of the agricultural machinery.

25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} <b>reversible</b> <b>ploughs,</b> {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have between two {{and as many as}} seven mouldboards– and semi-mounted ploughs (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can have as many as eighteen mouldboards. The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from the tractor so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough a two or three mouldboards-plough can be mounted {{on the front of the}} tractor if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the FEM {{analysis}} of manually operated tilting mechanism of three furrows <b>reversible</b> <b>plough</b> is presented. Plough is important agricultural equipment used for soil preparation. The mainobjective {{of this analysis}} was to optimize the design of tilting mechanism. The existing tilting mechanism which is manufactured by local small scale manufacturer gets failed at different points afterapproximately 150 Hr of uses. To analyze this tilting mechanism using FEM, firstly a proper CAD model is developed using Pro/E cad software. Then by using ANSYs software FEM analysis is done to determine the von Mises stresses. After carried out the analysis {{it has been found}} out that the existing design of the mechanism is not proper and there is need to change in weld thickness, spring diameter and also the material of the spring for efficient working and to withstand the different static and dynamic load...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a <b>reversible</b> animal-drawn <b>plough</b> and a ridger is presented. The plough was developed {{on the basis of}} laboratory experiments reported earlier to determine optimum parameters for acurved implement. The basic design principles of conventional mouldboard ploughs and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a shear bolt. Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a ridger by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute. ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30 percent less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the <b>reversible</b> <b>plough</b> under working conditions. The identified frequencies were 0. 5, 1. 3 and 3. 3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0. 84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0. 63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field. The difference in speed is explained by the greater body weight of the cows and the correspondingly greater pull that could be exerted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hydraulic Cylinder (HC), {{one of the}} key {{components}} of Horizontally <b>Reversible</b> <b>Plough</b> (HRP), takes the responsibilities for the commuting soiltillage of HRP. The dynamic behaviors of HC surely affectthe tilling performances of HRP. Based on our previously related work, this paper further addresses the effects of HC movements during tillage on ploughshare, especially at share-point, of HRP. For HC, uniform motion was considered in this study. A combined finite element and multi-body dynamics analysis (MDA) was implemented to assess both tillage kinematics and kinetics of the ploughshare. These numerical predictions were primarily involved in five different HC movement velocities and two actual HRP tilling scenarios, respectively, where loading data due to the HC movements were obtained from an MDA and applied to load a finite element modal of the ploughshare. Our results show that the importance of performing MDA as a preliminary step FEA to obtain an insight into the actual stress and strain variations at the share-point. Our findings demonstrate that the different movements of HC have no adverse effects on the service life of the ploughshare though they result in the maximum stress and strain at the sharepoint during HRP tillage...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of setup of three point linkage on {{energetic}} and performance parameters of tractor aggregate. For this purpose were made two series of measurements. The first series was realized with the tractor NewHolland T 7050 aggregate with 5 -furrow <b>reversible</b> <b>plough</b> plough KUHN HUARD VM 150 5 NS. Data such as engine load, engine revolution, diesel fuel consumption, diesel fuel temperature, were got from CAN Bus network during the measurement. Then were measured following parameters total time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing, time of turning and swath of the tractor aggregate. The specific consumption of diesel fuel and the efficiency of the aggregate were calculated using the aforementioned parameters. The second series of measurements was realized with the tractor Zetor Proxima Plus 115 aggregate with four-furrow plough Kverneland 150 B. During the measurement the data such theoretical and actual speed of the tractor and force in the top link of three point hitch were recorded in the computer. Then were measured following parameters such as main time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing and swath of the tractor aggregate. By the first and second tractor aggregate were approved linear dependence of slip, performance and fuel consumption on the force in top link of three point linkage...|$|R
40|$|Tire {{pressure}} and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant}} role in tillage operations for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. The study was focused on the tire {{pressure and}} extra weight variation effect on fuel consumption and work productivity for soil tillage at normal tractor wheels slippage (7 - 15 %). The experimental research unit composed of an 82. 3 kW 4 WD tractor and a <b>reversible</b> 4 -bodies <b>plough</b> is presented. Tests were carried out on a stubble loam, where slip of tractor driving wheels was 15 %, tractor front ballast mass was varied in the range from 0 to 520 kg and inflation pressure in the tires from 240 kPa to 100 kPa. Dependences of tractor performance indicators on ballast mass and tires inflation pressure are presented. When tractor tire slip varies in the range from 7 to 15 percent (which is normal slip in the soil), reducing the tires inflation pressure decreases the driving wheel slip and fuel consumption, while increases work productivity. Increasing the additional mass of the tractor (adding ballast weights) decreases the driving wheel slip, increases work productivity, but also increases fuel consumption and soil compaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of animal drawn implements should {{be within the}} range of the pulling capacity of draught animals. The effects of design and operational parameters such as tail angle, side rake angle and radius of curvature of a curved soil tillage implement on horizontal and vertical forces have been investigated under laboratory conditions. Seven different wings of different radii of curvature (150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 mm) were designed. The range of tail angle used was between 32 ° and 54 ° and the range of side angle was between 40 ° and 65 °. The effect of curvature on the horizontal force showed anomalous behaviour for different tail angles. For smaller tail angles (about 30 ° to 40 °) the horizontal force decreased significantly with an increase of radius. For a tail angle of about 45 °, the horizontal force decreased first with the increase of radius of curvature and then increased with further increase of radius. For tail angles greater than 50 ° the horizontal force increased with an increase of radius. The variation of the behaviour of radius and force relation is presumably due to the edge rake angle, since it varies with the radius. For larger radii, the effect of edge rake angle on the horizontal force is much more pronounced than the effect of radius on the horizontal force. For the vertical force (directed downward), it was observed that, for all tail angles used, the force increased significantly with a decrease of radius and this relation was described well by a third order polynomial equation. Variation of tail angle showed a significant effect on both horizontal and vertical forces. This is mainly due to an increase of normal compression forces and gravitational force when the tail angle is increased. For the range of tail angle used the horizontal force could be described by a trigonometric model. The effect of variation of side rake angle on the resulting forces for different speeds and radii was also investigated. Experimental investigation showed that variation of speed and radius affects the of side rake angle and force relation. The study recommends a combination of larger radius and smaller side rake angles for high speed operations to achieve a good penetration performance and reduced horizontal force. From the analysis made, a radius of about 275 mm was found to be an optimum for a curved implement. On the basis of the results obtained from the soil bin experiments and from the basic design of a conventional mouldboard plough and an ard type <b>plough,</b> a <b>reversible</b> animal drawn <b>plough</b> was designed...|$|R
