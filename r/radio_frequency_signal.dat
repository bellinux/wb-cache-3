5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006 the Mars Express {{spacecraft}} {{has encountered}} a superior solar conjunction (alignment of Earth-Sun-Mars Express). The angle Sun-Earth-MEX reached a minimum on 23-Oct at 0.39 deg. {{at a distance}} of 2.66 AU. Operational measures were undertaken to minimize the impact of the link degradation, since the higher density of electrons in the solar plasma heavily impacts the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the {{demodulation}} of amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple filter and fed into an audio amplifier or transducer, which generates sound waves.|$|E

25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b> Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
25|$|To {{perform a}} study, {{the person is}} {{positioned}} within an MRI scanner that forms a strong magnetic field around the area to be imaged. In most medical applications, protons (hydrogen atoms) in tissues containing water molecules create a signal that is processed to form {{an image of the}} body. First, energy from an oscillating magnetic field temporarily is applied to the patient at the appropriate resonance frequency. The excited hydrogen atoms emit a <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> which is measured by a receiving coil. The radio signal may be made to encode position information by varying the main magnetic field using gradient coils. As these coils are rapidly switched on and off they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state. Exogenous contrast agents may be given intravenously, orally, or intra-articularly.|$|E
2500|$|MRI uses strong {{magnetic}} fields to align atomic nuclei (usually hydrogen protons) within body tissues, then uses a radio signal {{to disturb the}} axis of rotation of these nuclei and observes the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> generated as the nuclei return to their baseline states. [...] The radio signals are collected by small antennae, called coils, placed near the area of interest. An advantage of MRI {{is its ability to}} produce images in axial, coronal, sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease. MRI scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities. With advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution, and improvements in computer 3D algorithms and hardware, MRI has become an important tool in musculoskeletal radiology and neuroradiology.|$|E

2500|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{require a}} local oscillator and mixer, combined in {{the function of}} a single pentagrid converter tube. Various alternatives such as {{using a combination of}} a triode with a hexode and even an octode have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both control grids (at a low potential) and screen grids (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b> The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers including the miniature tube version of the [...] "All American Five". Octodes such as the 7A8 were rarely used in the US, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.|$|E
2500|$|The crystal {{detector}} demodulates the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> extracting the modulation (the audio signal {{which represents the}} sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, the detector was a cat's whisker detector [...] consisting of a fine metal wire, the [...] "cat's whisker", on an adjustable arm that touched a pea-sized lump of semiconducting mineral. The point of contact between the wire and the crystal produced a diode effect. [...] The cat's whisker detector was a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes. [...] The crystal functions as an envelope detector, rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, {{so it can be}} converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E

The chromatic processing methodology developed at the University of Liverpool has been explored for discriminating between various <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signals</b> measured With different techniques, by Glasgow Caledonian University, UMIST, the University of Southampton and the University of Bath. Such discrimination is based on three chromatic parameters: hue (dominant <b>frequency),</b> lightness (nominal <b>signal</b> strength) and saturation (effective signal bandwidth).
