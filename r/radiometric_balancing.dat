40|$|Although well established, digital {{photogrammetry}} {{continues to}} change. More sources offer imagery {{which can be}} treated photogrammetrically. Users need improved scanner performance as they attempt to offset costs by feeding clusters of workstations or establishing bureau services; increased speed, variable pixel size, use of roll film and "on the fly" dodging are desirable scanner characteristics. On the workstation side, the demand for the Windows NT platform has been irresistible. New applications and the quest for higher productivity have resulted in demands including output of orientation data to analytical plotters, processing of data from airborne GPS and inertial measurement unit (IMU), triangulated irregular network (TIN) DTMs, automated <b>radiometric</b> <b>balancing</b> in mosaicking, smoother operation within feature collection and batch processes. Moreover, the market place itself changes, with suppliers, their customers and the end users all competing for position...|$|E
40|$|Space Imaging’s Digital Airborne Imaging System (DAIS- 1 ™) is a 12 -bit {{multispectral}} imaging {{platform for}} the generation of orthomosaics at ground sample distances ranging from 0. 3 to 2 meters. At {{the core of the}} system is a custom-built four-camera assembly utilizing narrow field-of-view sensors, with exterior orientation parameters provided by an onboard GPS/IMU navigation platform. Because all data collection is digital and no ground control is needed, seamless orthomosaics suitable for 1 : 4800 base mapping and land cover classification are generated within a very short time of overflight. Before the system was brought online, rigorous calibration procedures were required to ensure geometric accuracy and <b>radiometric</b> <b>balancing</b> of the final image product. This paper describes the DAIS platform and discusses the laboratory and field calibration required to prepare the system for production of accurate, tonally balanced orthomosaics. 1...|$|E
40|$|FIFEDOM (Frequent-Image-Frames Enhanced Digital Ortho-rectified Mapping) is a {{multidisciplinary}} ongoing research project aiming to provide low-cost and high information content digital mapping by developing an intelligent digital airborne image acquisition strategy, and novel image processing techniques. In particular, FIFEDOM {{is designed to}} exploit {{the high degree of}} overlapping of the digital aerial imagery to generate accurate map products. FIFEDOM utilizes high-overlap digital image acquisition to provide multiple-look-angle reflectance for each pixel in a scene. The FIFEDOM project concentrates on four technology areas, Image Acquisition System and Sensor Calibration, <b>Radiometric</b> <b>Balancing,</b> Digital Surface Model (DSM) generation, and Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model extraction. This paper emphasizes the FIFEDOM DSM module. It introduces an innovative, and breakthrough methodology for automated DSM generation. This is achieved through utilization of multi-view, multi-frame highly overlapped digital images. This capability improves the result significantly by generating a very dense, high quality, and reliable Digital Surface Model. The paper also discusses sensor calibration and radiometric-balancing, as they are prerequisite steps for the successful completion of the DSM task. 1...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{balance is}} the {{fraction}} of incident solar radiation upon earth surface which is available {{to be used in}} several natural processes, such as biological metabolism, water loss by vegetated surfaces, variation of temperature in farming systems and organic decomposition. The present study aimed to assess and validate the performance of two estimation models for Rn in Ponta Grossa city, Paraná State, Brazil. To this end, during the period of 04 / 01 / 2008 to 04 / 30 / 2011, from radiometric data collected by an automatic weather station set at the Experimental Station, of the State University of Ponta Grossa. We performed a linear regression study by confrontation between measurements made through <b>radiometric</b> <b>balance</b> and Rn estimates obtained from Brunt classical method, and the proposed method. Both models showed excellent performance and were confirmed by the statistical parameters applied. However, the alternative method has the advantage of requiring only global solar radiation values, temperature, and relative humidity...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} urba n orthoimage {{generation is}} being deployed in all level {{government agencies and}} private sectors. However, the early procedures and algorithms for digital orthoimage generation in the National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP) were based on earlier USGS mapping operations, which have not considered the urban case so that the Standard for Digital Orthophoto formulated by USGS has not considered the requirements of large-scale city orthophoto generation. To provide advanced technical basis (algorithms and procedures) and experience needed for national large-scale digital orthophoto generation and the revision of the Standards for National Large-scale City Digital Orthophoto in National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP), this paper presents a comprehensive study on theories, algorithms, and methods of large-scale urban orthoimage generation. These techniques include DTM-based orthoimage generation, DBM-based orthoimage generation, and their mergence for true orthoimage generation, the problems of orthoimage generated using traditional method, building occlusions and compensation, the data structure to model urban buildings for accurately generating urban orthoimage, shadow detection and removal, the optimization of seamline for automatic mosaic, and <b>radiometric</b> <b>balance</b> of neighbor images, street visibility analysis...|$|R
