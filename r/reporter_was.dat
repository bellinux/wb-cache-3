5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the <b>reporter</b> <b>was</b> all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E

On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the Agents-General of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lewis Harcourt, and the High Commissioners of other British Dominions. That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks.

5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The <b>reporter</b> <b>was</b> provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{high degree}} of {{political}} and civil corruption in the region in the 1920s and 1930s. The mainstream newspapers hardly mentioned what was going on, as any outlet that published articles critical of the status quo was threatened.

Howard Guilford of the Twin City <b>Reporter</b> <b>was</b> shot and killed on September 6, 1934.

25|$|At {{the same}} time as his horse, <b>Reporter,</b> <b>was</b> dying in early 1869, it was also {{reported}} that his wife and family were 'very ill' but no further details were given. So after an unsuccessful Grand National, Green retired to Walsoken to his farming interests. Soon, though, he was coaxed back to training with Lord Poulett in Hampshire in 1870, taking his family with him. He won the 1871 Grand National but was soon back with his family at Walsoken - sources disagree whether this was in late 1871 or April 1872 when his father died.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967. Don Gregory was running the meeting in the absence of Alan Shepard and so it was he who answered the red phone to be informed that there was a fire in the Apollo 1 CM. When the enormity of the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper <b>reporter</b> <b>was</b> the first to his house.|$|E
25|$|Hayes {{moved to}} Sausalito, California in 2000. He became {{the public face}} of the duo, doing most of the media. Hayes {{announced}} that Savage Garden had broken up in October 2001 during a chat with an Australian journalist. Hayes thought the information would be saved for a later article; it was not. When confronted with this information during the early morning hours, before an unrelated interview, Jones denied the break-up of the band. However, it appears that Jones did not believe the <b>reporter</b> <b>was</b> accurately quoting Hayes and denied what he thought was yet another breakup rumour. Still, the fact that Jones took a back seat in all promotional activities for Affirmation seems indicative that Jones was not content to remain within Savage Garden as it had operated in the past. Savage Garden had sold over 23 million albums by that stage.|$|E
