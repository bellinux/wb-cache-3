40|$|A classic {{problem in}} actuarial science is the following: An insurer sells {{insurance}} contracts to N individuals. Each individual {{is subject to}} a random loss of Xi. Each insurance contract pays max(0,Xi‐D) for some common deductible D. The insurer has historic data on each loss Xi. The insurer must determine a premium for each insurance contract, Pi, given that its prior beliefs about the true marginal distribution of each Xi are symmetric over i. That is to say, {{there is nothing to}} distinguish the loss distributions before the insurer looks at the data. For this project the reverse question is posed: Given that the insurer must charge <b>a</b> common <b>premium</b> <b>P</b> for all insurance contracts, how should deductibles Di be determined? One naive approach would be to set Di so that the historic average payout equals the target <b>premium</b> <b>P.</b> However, such <b>an</b> approach would not be robust to outliers, and will not be efficient. A more appealing approach would be to employ notions from Bayesian inference and Bulhmann's Credibility Theory.

40|$|An {{insurance}} company offers <b>an</b> insurance contract (<b>p,</b> K), consisting of <b>a</b> <b>premium</b> <b>p</b> and <b>a</b> deductible K. In this paper, {{we consider the}} problem of choosing the premium optimally {{as a function of}} the deductible. The {{insurance company}} is facing a market of N customers, each characterized by their personal claim frequency, α, and risk aversion, β. When a customer is offered an insurance contract, she/he will, based on these characteristics, choose whether or not to insure. The decision process of the customer is analyzed in detail. Since the customer characteristics are unknown to the company, it models them as i. i. d. random variables; A 1, …, A N for the claim frequencies and B 1, …, B N for the risk aversions. Depending on the distributions of A i and B i, expressions for the portfolio size n (p; K) ∈ [0, N] and average claim frequency α (p; K) in the portfolio are obtained. Knowing these, the company can choose the premium optimally, mainly by minimizing the ruin probability...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} some insurance policies related to drawdown and drawup events of log-returns for an underlying asset modeled by a spectrally negative geometric Lévy process. We consider four contracts, {{three of which}} were introduced in Zhang et al. (2013) for a geometric Brownian motion. The first one is an insurance contract where the protection buyer pays a constant premium until the drawdown of fixed size of log-returns occurs. In return he/she receives a certain insured amount at the drawdown epoch. The next insurance contract provides protection from any specified drawdown with a drawup contingency. This contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup event occurs prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of the previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows the investor to terminate the contract earlier. We focus on two problems: calculating the fair <b>premium</b> <b>p</b> for the basic contracts and identifying the optimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature.

The Irish race <b>P.</b> <b>a.</b> hibernicus is distinguished from britannicus by the pale sulphur-yellow cheeks, breast and belly. It also has a paler rump (due to light fringes of the uppertail coverts) and a larger bill than its relatives from Britain and the Continent.|$|R

P.) : {{the system of}} continuous positive airway pressure (C. <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>P.),</b> the bubble and the intermittent mandatory ventilation with C. <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>P.</b> (I. M. V. -C. <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>P.)</b> by Servo-Ventilator 900 B. The results are conclusive with the C. <b>P.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>P.</b> unit used for post-traumatic adult patients in acute respiratory distress and for patients who have been anesthetized {{for more than three}} hours. The PaO 2 significantly increase in subjects whose PaO 2 in the ambient air without P. E. E. P. is lower than 70 mm Hg. The bubble is less used due to its drawbacks. The Servo 900 B offers many possibilities, one of which is reported in this paper. Peer reviewe...|$|R
