40|$|Abstract—The future metropolitan-area {{wireless}} mesh networks (WMNs) {{are expected}} to contain compromise-prone Mesh Access Points (MAPs) with a high frequency of inter-domain roaming/handoff events. This paper introduces a novel secure localized authentication and billing (SLAB) scheme, which aims to address both security guarantee and performance in terms of system compromise resilience capability, inter-domain handoff authentication latency, and workload of the <b>roaming</b> <b>broker</b> (RB). With extensive analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be a practical solution for achieving secure roaming and billing in metropolitan-area WMNs. Index Terms—Wireless mesh networks, security, inter-domain handoff, authentication and billing. I...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} (WLANs) {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in offices, homes, and public places. In public “hotspots ” such as airports and hotels, these networks {{can be used to}} provide broadband wireless connectivity for people on the move. In Finland, hotspot networks are operated by TeliaSonera and DNA Finland. Because of interference issues, only one WLAN network can usually be built in one hotspot site. This leads to competition between the operators of the hotspot locations. Otherwise, the barriers for operators to enter the public WLAN market are sufficiently low. A number of different players are expected to enter the market, with different kinds of backgrounds. The business models pursued by the players may vary considerably. Roaming agreements can be used to enable subscribers of one operator to access their services using networks of other operators. A number of different roaming models exist, including bilateral agreement, clearinghouse, and <b>roaming</b> <b>broker</b> models. By far, the Finnish public WLAN operators have used bilateral agreements to enable roaming with international partners. National WLAN roaming is not available, decreasing the service coverage of all operators and hindering the success of the whole public WLAN market...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{metropolitan}} area sharing networks (WMSNs) are wide-area wireless networks with nodes owned and managed by independent wireless Internet service providers (WISPs). To support seamless roaming in emerging WMSNs, in this paper, we propose a localized and distributed authentication and billing architecture that aims at enabling efficient and privacy-preserving mutual authentication between mobile users (MUs) and WISPs. User anonymity and identity privacy can be protected, {{even in the}} presence of collusion between WISPs and a <b>roaming</b> <b>broker</b> (RB), which is considered to be the strongest user privacy protection. An efficient billing architecture is introduced and performed in the same stage of roaming, where U-tokens are defined and can be purchased by MUs from an RB as authentication credentials for the MUs to access the wireless network. The WISPs, thus, can cash the collected U-tokens in the RB for payment. We show that the proposed authentication and billing architecture can support localized inter-WISP authentication through the divisible blind signature scheme and a local witness strategy. A detailed analysis on a number of performance metrics, such as computation time and power consumption, is given to validate the performance of the proposed architectures. Index Terms—Billing, partially blind signature, privacy protection, roaming, wireless {{metropolitan area}} sharing network...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} make {{international}} roaming calls is of increasing importance to customers in Europe. This contrasts with various complaints that retail prices of roaming calls are rigid and excessive. The focus if the paper is on wholesale roaming, which is the prime determinant of retail roaming prices. The paper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have impaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the two leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new entrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. The paper argues {{that a number of}} developments are under way that are likely to modify this situation in the future. With the introduction of SIM over-the-air programming, home mobile operators will be able to direct customers to networks with the lowest charges. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800 operators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear. Given the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently provide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for preferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it will be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a pan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for preferred roaming status. This could discriminate against mobile operators in downstream retail markets that do not have a pan-European footprint and that lack the bargaining power. However, arbitrage by <b>roaming</b> <b>brokers,</b> new entry and wider geographical markets on the retail roaming level will work against this. Comment: 29 th TPRC Conference, 200...|$|R
