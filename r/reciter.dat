5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a <b>reciter</b> of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E

50|$|He {{participated in}} a conference of <b>reciters</b> in 1937 which {{resulted}} in the establishment of a Reciters' Association.

50|$|Both {{surviving}} subcommentaries on {{the passage}} about <b>reciters</b> explain the apparent {{difference between the}} <b>reciters</b> as being, not a substantive disagreement on {{the contents of the}} Canon, but merely a nominal one on its classification. Thus they say for example that the Digha <b>reciters</b> did regard 15 as canonical but counted it as part of 10 instead of a separate book. Similarly, the more recent subcommentary, compiled by the head of the Burmese sangha about two centuries ago, says that 16 and 17 were counted as part of 11 and/or 12.|$|R

500|$|To {{solve the}} problem, {{he went to}} Lahore in September 1711 and had discussions with Haji Yar Muhammad, Muhammad Murad and [...] "other {{well-known}} men". At their meeting, he read [...] "books of authority" [...] to justify using the word wasi.

500|$|Born in London, Holloway {{pursued a}} career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage {{appearances}} before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in Kissing Time when the musical transferred to the West End from Broadway. [...] In 1921, he joined a concert party, The Co-Optimists, and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and <b>reciter</b> of comic monologues were soon recognised. [...] Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by Marriott Edgar, were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in variety, pantomime and musical comedy, including several revues.|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{feared that}} people would find him mentally and {{physically}} repulsive. However, those who met him found him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence, and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance. Brod compared Kafka to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers {{had the ability to}} describe a situation realistically with precise details. Brod thought Kafka {{was one of the most}} entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate <b>reciter,</b> who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music. Brod felt that two of Kafka's most distinguishing traits were [...] "absolute truthfulness" [...] (...) and [...] "precise conscientiousness" [...] (...) [...] He explored details, the inconspicuous, in depth and with such love and precision that things surfaced that were unforeseen, seemingly strange, but absolutely true (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1873, Grossmith and {{his father}} began joint tours of humorous recitations and comic {{sketches}} at literary institutes and public halls, to church groups and to branches of the YMCA all over England and even in Scotland and Wales. [...] Young Grossmith's sketches at this time included The Puddleton Penny Readings, Our Choral Society and In the Stalls. [...] They toured almost constantly for the following three years, but they returned to see their families in London on weekends. Around this time, he met and became firm friends with Fred Sullivan, and afterwards, he met Sullivan's brother Arthur. Through Arthur Cecil, Sullivan, {{and some of their}} friends, Grossmith began to be invited to entertain at private [...] "society" [...] parties, which he continued to do throughout his career. [...] Later, these parties would often occur late in the evening after Grossmith performed at the Savoy Theatre. In 1876, he collaborated with Florence Marryat, the author and <b>reciter,</b> on Entre Nous. [...] This piece consisted of a series of piano sketches, alternating with scenes and costumed recitations, including a two-person [...] "satirical musical sketch", really a short comic opera, called Cups and Saucers, which they then toured. Grossmith also took a number of engagements, including recitals at private homes. In 1877, Lionel Brough introduced another popular Grossmith song, [...] "The Muddle Puddle Junction Porter". By then, Grossmith had become friendly with many in the music and theatre establishments, including Arthur Sullivan and impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte; and Grossmith had the opportunity to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury and other Sullivan works at charity benefits.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{scholars}} such as D.K.

In his landmark work, The Singer of Tales, Albert Lord refers to the work of Francis Peabody Magoun and others, saying [...] "the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate.
