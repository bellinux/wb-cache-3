40|$|Aim. To examine {{neutrophil}} F-actin, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis dymanics {{in patients}} with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), {{in an effort to}} understand the mechanisms that <b>regulate</b> <b>switch</b> of neutrophil activation program. Methods. Whole blood neutrophils obtained from 37 attack-free FMF patients and 20 normal donors (ND) were activated with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cellular F-actin content, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis determined by flow cytometry. F-actin oscillation amplitude and period were calculated from the curves generated by mathematical simulation giving the assumption that in neutrophil F-actin oscillates about a fixed point in a harmonic motion. Results. Unstimulated neutrophil F-actin content was markedly increased in FMF patients. fMLP- but not PMA- or LPS-stimulated and Col-pretreated neutrophils where characterized by different pattern of F-actin dynamics and delayed time period of F-actin oscillation during FMF. Neutrophils from FMF patients failed to induce chemoattractant receptor desensitization during repeated action of fMLP, while in ND it occurred with significant reduction of F-actin oscillation amplitude and period. In FMF patients we observed significant enhancement of phagocytosis but not macropinocytosis amplitude and frequency. Conclusions. Impaired neutrophil F-actin, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis oscillations amplitude and frequency that tightly <b>regulate</b> <b>switch</b> of neutrophil activation program during its encounter with increasing concentration of chemoattractants may be a potential pathogenic mechanism causing aberrant resolution of inflammation during FM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—DC-DC {{converters}} {{are widely}} used in <b>regulated</b> <b>switched</b> mode power supplies and in DC motor drive applications. There are several sources of unwanted nonlinearity in practical power converters. In addition, their operation is characterized by switching that gives birth {{to a variety of}} nonlinear dynamics. DC-DC buck and boost converters controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM) have been simulated. The voltage waveforms and attractors obtained from the circuit simulation have been studied. With the onset of instability, the phenomenon of subharmonic oscillations, quasi-periodicity, bifurcations, and chaos have been observed. This paper is mainly motivated by potential contributions of chaos theory in the design, analysis and control of power converters, in particular and power electronics circuits, in general.

30|$|Modern {{electric}} power systems {{have increased the}} usage of switching power converters. These tightly <b>regulated</b> <b>switching</b> power converters behave as constant power loads (CPLs). They exhibit a negative incremental impedance in small signal analysis. This negative impedance degrades the stability margin {{of the interaction between}} CPLs and their feeders, which is known as the negative impedance instability problem. The feeder can be an LC input filter or an upstream switching converter. Active damping methods are preferred for the stabilization of the system. This is due to their higher power efficiency over passive damping methods. Based on different sources of damping effect, this paper summarizes and classifies existing active damping methods into three categories. The paper further analyzes and compares {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each active damping method.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} precisely <b>regulated</b> <b>switch</b> from gene repression to gene activation represent a central question in mammalian development. Here, we report that transcriptional activation mediated by liganded nuclear receptors unexpectedly requires the actions of two highly related F box/WD- 40 -containing factors, TBL 1 and TBLR 1, initially identified as components of an N-CoR corepressor complex. TBL 1 /TBLR 1 serve as specific adaptors for the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugating/ 19 S proteasome complex, with TBLR 1 selectively serving to mediate a required exchange of the nuclear receptor corepressors, N-CoR and SMRT, for coactivators upon ligand binding. Tbl 1 gene deletion in embryonic stem cells severely impairs PPARγ-induced adipogenic differentiation, indicating that TBL 1 function is also biologically indispensable for specific nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation events. The role of TBLR 1 and TBL 1 in cofactor exchange appears to also operate for c-Jun and NFκB and is therefore likely to be prototypic of similar mechanisms for other signal-dependent transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|To mate, the fungal {{pathogen}} Candida albicans must undergo homozygosis at the mating-type locus {{and then}} switch {{from the white}} to opaque phenotype. Paradoxically, opaque cells {{were found to be}} unstable at physiological temperature, suggesting that mating had little chance of occurring in the host, the main niche of C. albicans. Recently, however, it was demonstrated that high levels of CO 2, equivalent to those found in the host gastrointestinal tract and select tissues, induced the white to opaque switch at physiological temperature, providing a possible resolution to the paradox. Here, we demonstrate that a second signal, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a monosaccharide produced primarily by gastrointestinal tract bacteria, also serves as a potent inducer of white to opaque switching and functions primarily through the Ras 1 /cAMP pathway and phosphorylated Wor 1, the gene product of the master switch locus. Our results therefore suggest that signals produced by bacterial co-members of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota <b>regulate</b> <b>switching</b> and therefore mating of C. albicans...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} <b>regulating</b> <b>switches</b> {{in species}} interactions along gradients of stress {{are yet to}} be fully elucidated. In particular, the role of temporal variability in environmental severity or consumer pressure has been not explored either empirically or theoretically. Here, through a spatially explicit model (i. e. a two-dimensional lattice), we show that variations in the temporal variance of environmental stress can {{be as important as}} those in the mean intensity in regulating the spatial distribution and coexistence range of species differing in their relative competitive ability and tolerance to stress, as well as the direction and magnitude of their interactions. In addition, our simulations suggest that enhanced temporal fluctuations in environmental stressors can enhance absolute levels of stress perceived by interacting species. This study shows that tests including both the mean and temporal variance of environmental stress will be key to forecast changes in species interactions under different scenarios of climate change...|$|R
40|$|Several clones were {{isolated}} from a rat genomic library {{in order to}} further characterize a region of variability within the third membrane-spanning region of the fourth motif (IVS 3) of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel. We report here that this diversity arises from alternative splicing of a primary transcript containing a single pair of adjacent exons each encoding a unique sequence for the IVS 3 region. Definitive proof of a mutually exclusive splicing mechanism was obtained by genomic mapping of flanking upstream and downstream exons and by extensive sequence analysis of the relevant exon/intron boundaries. S 1 nuclease protection experiments revealed that both variant forms of the IVS 3 were equally expressed in newborn and fetal rat heart, whereas only a single isoform predominated in adult rat heart. The results demonstrate the existence of an important developmentally <b>regulated</b> <b>switch</b> mediated by alternatively spliced exons in cardiac tissue at a time when major changes in excitation occur...|$|R
40|$|Root {{growth is}} {{modulated}} by environmental factors and depends on cell {{production in the}} root meristem (RM). New cells in the meristem are generated by stem cells and transit-amplifying cells, which together determine RM cell number. Transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling factors have been implicated in <b>regulating</b> the <b>switch</b> from stem cells to transit-amplifying cells. Here, we show that two Arabidopsis thaliana paralogs encoding plant-specific histone deacetylases, HDT 1 and HDT 2, <b>regulate</b> a second <b>switch</b> from transit-amplifying cells to expanding cells. Knockdown of HDT 1 / 2 (hdt 1, 2 i) results in an earlier switch and causes a reduced RM cell number. Our data show that HDT 1 / 2 negatively regulate the acetylation level of the C 19 -GIBBERELLIN 2 -OXIDASE 2 (GA 2 ox 2) locus and repress the expression of GA 2 ox 2 in the RM and elongation zone. Overexpression of GA 2 ox 2 in the RM phenocopies the hdt 1, 2 i phenotype. Conversely, knockout of GA 2 ox 2 partially rescues the root growth defect of hdt 1, 2 i. These results suggest that by repressing the expression of GA 2 ox 2, HDT 1 / 2 likely fine-tune gibberellin metabolism and they are crucial for <b>regulating</b> the <b>switch</b> from cell division to expansion to determine RM cell number. We propose that HDT 1 / 2 function {{as part of a}} mechanism that modulates root growth in response to environmental factors...|$|R

40|$|Hebbian {{forms of}} {{synaptic}} plasticity {{are required for}} the orderly development of sensory cir-cuits {{in the brain and}} are powerful modulators of learning and memory in adulthood. During development, emergence of Hebbian plasticity leads to formation of functional circuits. By modeling the dynamics of neurotransmitter release during early postnatal cortical develop-ment we show that a developmentally <b>regulated</b> <b>switch</b> in vesicle exocytosis mode triggers associative (i. e. Hebbian) plasticity. Early in development spontaneous vesicle exocytosis (SVE), often considered as 'synaptic noise', is important for homogenization of synaptic weights and maintenance of synaptic weights in the appropriate dynamic range. Our results demonstrate that SVE has a permissive, whereas subsequent evoked vesicle exocytosis (EVE) has an instructive role in the expression of Hebbian plasticity. A timed onset for Heb-bian plasticity can be achieved by switching from SVE to EVE and the balance between SVE and EVE can control the effective rate of Hebbian plasticity. We further show that this developmental switch in neurotransmitter release mode enables maturation of spike-timing dependent plasticity. A mis-timed or inadequate SVE to EVE switch may lead to malforma...|$|R
40|$|<b>Regulated</b> <b>switching</b> of the {{mutually}} exclusive exons 2 and 3 of alpha-tropomyosin (TM) involves repression of exon 3 in smooth muscle cells. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is necessary but not sufficient for regulation of TM splicing. Raver 1 was identified in two-hybrid screens by its {{interactions with the}} cytoskeletal proteins actinin and vinculin, and was also found to interact with PTB. Consistent with these interactions raver 1 can be localized in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. Here we show that raver 1 is able to promote the smooth muscle-specific alternative splicing of TM by enhancing PTB-mediated repression of exon 3. This activity of raver 1 is dependent upon characterized PTB-binding regulatory elements and upon a region of raver 1 necessary for interaction with PTB. Heterologous recruitment of raver 1, or just its C-terminus, induced very high levels of exon 3 skipping, bypassing the usual need for PTB binding sites downstream of exon 3. This suggests a novel mechanism for PTB-mediated splicing repression involving recruitment of raver 1 as a potent splicing co-repressor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Coordinated {{motion of}} {{multiple}} agents raises fundamental and novel problems in control theory and robotics. In particular, in {{applications such as}} consensus seeking or flocking {{by a group of}} mobile agents, a great new challenge is the development of robust distributed motion algorithms that can always achieve the desired coordination. In this paper, we address this challenge by embedding the requirement for connectivity of the underlying communication network in the controller specifications. We employ double integrator models for the agents and design nearest neighbor control laws, based on potential fields, that serve a twofold objective. First, they contribute to velocity alignment in the system and second, they <b>regulate</b> <b>switching</b> among different network topologies so that the connectivity requirement is always met. Collision avoidance among neighboring agents is also ensured and under the assumption that the initial network is connected, the overall system is shown to asymptotically flock for all initial conditions. In particular, it is shown that flocking is achieved even in sparse communication networks where connectivity is more prone to failure. We conclude by illustrating a class of interesting problems that can be achieved while preserving connectivity. I...|$|R
