40|$|Within the BMBF project 'Unround Wheels', the unroundness, the {{mechanical}} properties and the microstructure of several wheel sets {{of different types}} have been analysed. The unroundness of <b>rubber</b> <b>cushioned</b> wheels is mainly influenced by the well-known threefold polygons which remain constant in shape and location during service-caused wear. No changes of {{the mechanical}} and microstructural properties of the tyres of the wheels in circumferencial direction have been found. Single wheels developed a more pronounced unroundness during service compared to <b>rubber</b> <b>cushioned</b> ones. The analyses of the single wheels showed a modification of the microstructure at the positions of several radius minima. It {{has been found that}} this modified structure differs only slightly from the surrounding perlitic matrix and is moreover strongly confined to the regions close to the running surface. This structure can therefore not be detected by the test methods used for quality control according to the UIC requirements. The state of service-caused hardening below the running surface of the tyres and single wheels revealed no relations to the measured unroundnesses. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} fork-lift truck vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of fork-lift truck in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the overhead guard is connected with the frame by the <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> blocks (shock mount) in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved fork-lift truck and vibration energy are lower.

40|$|Abstract. Ship {{anti-collision}} device with flexible box structure {{is a new}} protection to pier device. By simplifying the <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> dual-box pier ship {{anti-collision device}} as elliptic physical model and by simplifying the elliptic <b>rubber</b> cylindrical air <b>cushion</b> as linear elastic spring element, this paper can build the relationships between torque equation, elliptic structure parameters and equivalent elastic coefficient under different loading force. When outer steel ring takes a small displacement translation, the reverse force is only related to parallel direction of displacement and has a linear relationship with displacement. Making an analysis on elastic response of translational-rotational device, it can be approximated as a pure rotation curve under certain conditions. And the equivalent elasticity coefficient is only related to translational-rotational joint effect. The results will help the flexible dual-box ship anti-collision device to apply...|$|R

These criticisms were addressed in the Mark I model helmet of 1916, which had a separate folded rim, a two-part liner and matte khaki paint finished with sand, sawdust, or crushed cork to give a dull, non-reflective appearance. In 1917, the liner was modified to include a <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> to make it more comfortable, although this was not adopted for the M1917.
