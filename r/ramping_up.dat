At {{the time it was}} rapidly <b>ramping</b> <b>up</b> its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E

Disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow <b>ramping</b> <b>up</b> and down rates, high cost and short lifetime. Also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium.|$|E

With this inspiration and model, Edith Rogers introduced a bill to the 76th Congress in early 1941 to establish a Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) during World War II. The bill was intended to free men for combat duty by creating a cadre of 25,000 noncombatant clerical workers. The bill languished in the face of strong opposition to women in the army, and indifference in the face of higher priorities like the lend-lease bill, price controls, and <b>ramping</b> <b>up</b> war production.|$|E

As it transpired, Clarke had the stronger finish, and ultimately took his first professional victory on the line. Bazayev finished third, while the peloton came in over a minute behind Clarke; Valverde lost almost a minute beyond that, and surrendered the overall lead to 's Joaquim Rodríguez, who held a one-second advantage over Flecha's team-mate Chris Froome.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{a fight between}} Fighter Command and Bomber Command was brewing.

They began pressing for permission to use chaff, known in the UK under the code-name window, which in testing had demonstrated its ability to blind radar systems. Air Chief Charles Frederick Algenon Porter ordered Bomber Command to begin using window on 4 April 1942, but he rescinded that command on 5 May under pressure from Sholto Douglas. Douglas pointed out that the Germans would be able to copy window the first time they saw it, and it was unwise to use it until its effect on the UK's own radars was better understood.|$|E

25|$|However, by {{the late}} 1970s, the M1911A1 was {{acknowledged}} to be showing its age. Under political pressure from Congress to standardize on a single modern pistol design, the U.S. Air Force ran a Joint Service Small Arms Program to select a new semi-automatic pistol using the NATO-standard 9mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. After trials, the Beretta 92S-1 was chosen. The Army contested this result and subsequently ran its own competition in 1981, the XM9 trials, eventually leading to the official adoption of the Beretta 92F on January 14, 1985. By the late 1980s production was <b>ramping</b> <b>up</b> despite a controversial XM9 retrial and a separate XM10 reconfirmation that was boycotted by some entrants of the original trials, cracks in the frames of some pre-M9 Beretta-produced pistols, and despite a problem with slide separation using higher-than-specified-pressure rounds that resulted in injuries to some U.S. Navy special operations operatives. This last issue resulted in an updated model that includes additional protection for the user, the 92FS, and updates to the ammunition used.|$|E
25|$|Income Tax Authorities in India in 2006 {{unearthed}} the 1.6million dollar {{penny stock}} scam in Bangalore. The scam is the fallout of nationwide income tax raids {{on the premises}} of businessmen in April 2006, suspecting large scale money laundering and tax evasion through <b>ramping</b> <b>up</b> shares of small firms. Around 25 premises were raided in Mumbai and 10 in Bangalore. After the raids, the Additional Commissioner set up a team and investigated this scam.

The team found that the traders had ramped up penny stocks to launder money an organised crime and a serious economic offence that has misused provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and Registrar of Co-operatives. This route is chosen to use capital gains tax and legalise the unaccounted money. On April 28, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Ministry of Finance billed the case as the best investigation and assessment order of the year.

[...] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market.
