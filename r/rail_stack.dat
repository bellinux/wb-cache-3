50|$|The older {{terminal}} {{is operated}} by International Port Services (IPS), {{a subsidiary of}} Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH). The container terminal is {{a joint venture between}} HPH and the Saudi company Maritime Company for Navigation (MACNA). The IPS Terminal has three rail tracks and rail stacking area parallel to the tracks. All containers bound for the Riyadh Dry Port are directly shifted to the <b>rail</b> <b>stack,</b> where they are loaded on to freight trains.|$|E
50|$|Some timber fences {{have the}} <b>rails</b> <b>stacked</b> {{directly}} {{on top of}} each other and secured with double fence posts (one on either side of the rails). This made a more permanent and compact fence but remained easy to repair.|$|R

50|$|Split rail fences {{were made}} of easy to split, rot-resistant wood. Traditionally American {{chestnut}} was the timber of choice until chestnut blight eliminated this tree. Currently, most split rails are made from cedar. Whether of chestnut or cedar, these logs were cut to a length of 10 to 12 ft and split {{down the length of}} the log. Each half was then split into quarters, then eighths and so on until the rails were of a usable size. A log may produce from four rails from an 8 in log to over a dozen from larger logs. The <b>rails</b> are <b>stacked</b> on top of one another. Most split rail fences have the <b>rails</b> <b>stacked</b> in an interlocking zig-zag fashion that is self-supporting, easy to create, easy to repair, and easy to disassemble.|$|R

50|$|The Yanke Group of Companies is a {{transportation}} business, headquartered in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, that provides transportation. Their services have North America and global reach. Yanke has five division that cover freight forwarding, air cargo, international steamship line containers, inland <b>rail,</b> domestic double <b>stack</b> <b>rail,</b> full truckload dry van services, temperature controlled services and local warehousing. Yanke was bought out by Celadon Canada.|$|R

50|$|The 1902 OS {{map shows}} a narrow gauge mineral railway running from Laigh Dalmore quarry to Dalmore Mill; {{a number of}} the old <b>rails</b> are <b>stacked</b> (2010) in the old quarry. The Victorian {{photograph}} of Enterkine shows the track in situ, although no railway sleepers are visible. Sidings may have been present. The gauge was 20 inch, the same as the tracks in the mine and the line was worked by horses until about 1945 when it was taken up and a horse and cart were used instead; later a lorry was employed.|$|R
5000|$|Merb {{began as}} a [...] "clean-room" [...] {{implementation}} of the <b>Rails</b> controller <b>stack,</b> but grew to incorporate several ideas that deviated from Rails's spirit and methodology at the time, most notably component modularity, extensible API design, and vertical scalability. It was developed by Ezra Zygmuntowicz & Yehuda Katz. Most of these capabilities were added to Rails during the Rails 3/Merb merger. Merb was first released at the 2008 RubyConf and development has since stopped; Rails 3 therefore serves as both the successor to Rails 2 and the successor to Merb.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} {{choice of}} [...] height for ISO containers {{was made in}} part to suit {{a large proportion of}} railway tunnels, though some had to be modified. [...] The current standard is [...] high. With the arrival of even taller hi-cube containers at [...] and double <b>stacking</b> <b>rail</b> cars, further enlargement of the rail loading gauge is proving necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Netherlands - The Betuweroute, {{a freight}} rail between Rotterdam to the German border built 2007 is {{prepared}} for double-stacking insofar that tunnels are being built to accommodate double stack trains {{to reduce the cost}} and time of any future upgrade to the network. The current catenary wire is too low for double <b>stack</b> <b>rail</b> transport and the upgrade is dependent on the German section of the railway connection.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest city}} in Lambton County is Sarnia, which {{is located at the}} mouth of the St. Clair River. The two Blue Water Bridges cross the river at Sarnia, {{connecting}} it to Port Huron, Michigan. The bridges are one of the busiest border crossings between the two countries. The river is also traversed by two passenger ferries further south, and a rail tunnel, also at Sarnia, runs underneath it. The CN rail tunnel accommodates double <b>stacked</b> <b>rail</b> cars.|$|R
500|$|The Victorian {{loading gauge}} for {{vehicles}} is sized between that of British and American practices. Wagons may {{be up to}} [...] long, [...] wide, and carry loads up to 4.27 metres above the <b>rail</b> height. Double <b>stacking</b> of container wagons is not possible under these limits, with [...] high containers the largest permitted, {{with the exception of}} [...] high containers on some routes. Trials were made with the 4D double deck passenger train on some suburban lines, requiring alterations to overhead bridges and structures, but no double deck trains are used today.|$|R
50|$|A pin rail, {{originally}} a wood beam, is typically a large-diameter round steel tube with vertical through-holes that accept belaying pins {{used in a}} hemp rigging system. Depending on the pin rail design, the pins may be removable or permanently fixed to the rail. Pin rails are typically installed permanently at the onstage edge of the fly gallery(ies), extending from the proscenium wall to upstage wall, sometimes in a <b>stacked</b> (<b>rail</b> over rail) arrangement. Mobile pin rails may also be used and are bolted down to the stage deck where needed.|$|R

50|$|Containers have weight limits {{designed}} to fit road trucks, which have clearly smaller weight limits than trains. A common limit for railways is 8 t per meter train length and 22.5 t per axle. A four axle container car can take 90 t. Since a container is limited to 30.5 t (plus a <b>rail</b> car), single <b>stacking</b> clearly does not use the load capacity of the railway. A 20 ft container is limited to 24 t and two such can fit into a car for a 40 ft container, or even three if double-stacking, but not four unless very high axle load is permitted. The North American railways permit two 53 ft or four 20 ft containers {{as shown in the}} images on this page.|$|R

50|$|Shin Yurigaoka Station {{opened on}} June 1, 1974. The {{greenfield}} station {{was developed by}} Odakyu Railway in 1974 as a purpose built station to hold trains for expresses to overtake local trains, and as a temporary holding spot for large amounts of passengers as the closer stations and rails towards central Tokyo were a chokepoint and had land acquisition issues and protracted legal filings with residents for decades, particularly in Setagaya ward. There {{was no room for}} six parallel platforms closer to Tokyo. Due to these lawsuits, the congested Odakyu Odawara Line was even unable to acquire land by year 2000 for quad tracking on the Odawara line north of the station (in/out of Tokyo), finally resorting to phased expensive fixes to lack of land such as <b>stacking</b> <b>rails</b> vertically using tunnels and grade separation, finishing phases still ongoing as of 2017. Along with the station, an attached masterplanned community was coordinated by Odakyu to support the railway. The station had been planned to connect to the Yokohama subway and proposed Kawasaki Municipal Subway lines, but those plans have been shelved or postponed, leaving the station as merely an Odakyu junction.|$|R
