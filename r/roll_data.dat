40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a systematic {{study of the}} parametric identification and probability description of ship roll motion. A new method for parametric identification using modulating function technique is proposed. The method provides an easier way of solving {{a wide range of}} ship roll parametric identification problems including parametric identification from free roll decay data, forced <b>roll</b> <b>data</b> and randomly excited <b>roll</b> <b>data.</b> Another advantage is that it can he used to estimate the parameters of nonlinear damping moment, nonlinear-time-dependent restoring moment and the strength of excitation from measured roll response without necessarily knowing the excitation. This makes the prediction of ship dynamic stability possible because the ship roll parameters can be obtained from only the roll response of a ship. Furthermore, the new method avoids a main source of computational error which results from the numerical differentiation of the measured data which is used by many current parametric identification methods, and therefore it can produce more accurate results. [...] The second part of the work deals with the probability description of roll motion. From estimated roll parameters, the joint probability distribution of roll angle and velocity as well as probability distribution of peaks of roll motion are derived using the Markov approximation. [...] The method has been validated by applying it to analyse several ship <b>roll</b> <b>data</b> including the following, (1) experimental <b>roll</b> <b>data</b> of four ship models; (2) numerically simulated roll data; (3) measured <b>roll</b> <b>data</b> of a full scale ship at sea. In all the above applications, the proposed method has been found to produce more satisfying results. [...] The probability distributions of the roll angle, roll velocity and peaks of roll motion obtained by a numerical approximation also show a good agreement with the relevant histograms of the experimental data. All these results suggest that the proposed method is a successful approach for the ship roll motion study...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{bring to bear}} some new tools from {{statistical}} learning on the analysis of <b>roll</b> call <b>data.</b> We present a new data-driven model for roll call voting that is geometric in nature. We construct the model by adapting the "Partition Decoupling Method," an unsupervised learning technique originally developed {{for the analysis of}} families of time series, to produce a multiscale geometric description of a weighted network associated to a set of roll call votes. Central to this approach is the quantitative notion of a "motivation," a cluster-based and learned basis element that serves as a building block in the representation of <b>roll</b> call <b>data.</b> Motivations enable the formulation of a quantitative description of ideology and their data-dependent nature makes possible a quantitative analysis of the evolution of ideological factors. This approach is generally applicable to <b>roll</b> call <b>data</b> and we apply it in particular to the historical roll call voting of the U. S. House and Senate. This methodology provides a mechanism for estimating the dimension of the underlying action space. We determine that the dominant factors form a low- (one- or two-) dimensional representation with secondary factors adding higher-dimensional features. In this way our work supports and extends the findings of both Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder concerning the dimensionality of the action space. We give a detailed analysis of several individual Senates and use the AdaBoost technique from statistical learning to determine those votes with the most powerful discriminatory value. When used as a predictive model, this geometric view significantly outperforms spatial models such as the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE model and the Heckman-Snyder 6 -factor model, both in raw accuracy as well as Aggregate Proportional Reduced Error (APRE).

Our model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of <b>roll</b> call <b>data,</b> such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, or the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e. g., logrolling). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with <b>roll</b> call <b>data</b> that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models.

40|$|Rayleigh wave {{or ground}} roll is a noise in seismic body waves. However, {{how to use}} this noise for soil {{characterization}} is very interesting since Rayleigh wave phase velocity {{is a function of}} compression-wave velocity, shear-wave velocity, density and layer thickness. In layered-medium Rayleigh wave velocity also depends on wavelength or frequency, and this phenomenon is called dispersion. Inversion procedure to get shear-wave velocity profile needs a priori information about the solution of the problem to limit the unknown parameters. The Lagrange multiplier method was used to solve the constrained optimization problems or well known as a smoothing parameter in inversion problems. The advantage of our inversion procedure is that it can guarantee the convergence of solution even though the field data is incomplete, insufficient, and inconsistent. The addition of smoothing parameter can reduce the time to converge. Beside numerical stability, the statistical stability is also involved in inversion procedure. In field experiment we extracted ground <b>roll</b> <b>data</b> from seismic refraction record. The dispersion curves had been constructed by applying f-k analysis and f-k dip filtering.

The aim of {{this report}} is to study the two {{nonlinear}} manifold learning techniques recently proposed (Isomap [12] and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [8]) and suggest directions for further research. First the Isomap and the LLE algorithm are discussed in detail. Some of the areas that need further work are pointed out. A few novel applications which could use these two algorithms have been discussed. 1.

Let f: Y → R D be a smooth embedding for some D> d. The goal is to recover Y and f given N points in R D. Isomap [12] and LLE [8] provide implicit description of the mapping f.

Methods: We identified 14 counties in North Carolina that had the majority of American Indians belonging to the seven state-recognized, non-federally recognized tribes. We collaborated with the tribe in each county and matched the cases of cancer in the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (CCR) to the tribal <b>rolls.</b> <b>Data</b> were analyzed to calculate what percentage of matching names were not correctly identified as American Indian in the CCR.

Higher income earners face fewer financial barriers to dental care, while dental insurance provides partial reimbursement. The aim was to explore whether household income {{has an effect on}} the relationship between {{insurance and}} visiting. METHODS A random sample of adults aged 30 – 61 years living in Australia was drawn from the Electoral <b>Roll.</b> <b>Data</b> were collected by mailed survey in 2009 – 10, including age, sex, dental insurance status and household income. RESULTS Responses were collected from n[*]=[*] 1, 096 persons (response rate[*]=[*] 39. 1 %). Dental insurance was positively associated with regular visiting (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) [*]=[*] 1. 18; 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 36). Individuals in the lowest income tertile had a lower prevalence of regular visiting than those in the highest income group (PR[*]=[*] 0. 78; 95 % CI: 0. 65 - 0. 93). Visiting for a check-up was less prevalent among lower income earners (PR[*]=[*] 0. 65; 95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 83). Significant interaction terms indicated that the associations between insurance and visiting varied across income tertiles showing that income modified the effect. CONCLUSIONS Household income modified the relationships between insurance and regular visiting and visiting for a check-up, with dental insurance having a greater impact on visiting among lower income groups.

The study was commissioned by Cambridgeshire County Council on behalf of a consortium of these public authorities. It also provides an assessment of the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers ‘residing in or resorting to their district’ (GTAA), as required under the Housing Act 2004 and following ODPM guidance (2006). 2. The main quantitative data sources were the findings of an interview survey of 313 Gypsies/Travellers within the study area (on sites of all types and in housing) undertaken in 2005, the official six-monthly counts of caravans since 1980, and local school <b>rolls</b> <b>data.</b> 3. The Gypsy/Traveller population of the study area (including those in housing) was estimated at 6500 - 7000, making them one of its largest ethnic minority groups. Survey respondents were asked to self-identify within six categories: English Gypsies/Romanies, Irish Travellers, new Traveller, Scottish Traveller-Gypsy, Showman and Other. Most English Gypsies in the study area were ‘born and bred’ within the region, and the survey found a quarter of the Gypsy/Traveller population to be Irish Travellers.
