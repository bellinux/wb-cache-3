40|$|Immune {{disorders}} in chronic liver disease may re ¯ ect common host propensitie s or disease-speci ® c factors. Our {{aim was to}} determine the principal base s for these expre ssions. Four hundre d ® fty-one patients with various chronic live <b>r</b> <b>diseases</b> were assessed prospectively for concurrent immune disorders. Individuals with immune diseases were more frequently women (73 % vs 60 %, P 5 0. 02) and they had HLA DR 4 more often than counterparts with other HLA (46 % vs 23 %, P 5 0. 000008). The association between HLA DR 4 and immune disease was apparent within individual live <b>r</b> <b>diseases</b> and within different categorie s of liver disease. Women with HLA DR 4 had a highe r frequency of immune disease than women without HLA DR 4 (52 % vs 22 %, P # 0. 000001), and they also had immune diseases more commonly than DR 4 -positive men (52 % vs 31 %, P 5 0. 03). DR 4 -positive men, however, had highe r frequencie s of immune disease than DR 4 -negative men, especially in the nonimmune types of liver disease (26 % vs 4 %, P 5 0. 002). We conclude that HLA DR 4 and female gender constitute an immune phenotype that is an important basis for autoimmune expre s-sion in chronic liver disease.

40|$|International audienceThe Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, is an economically-important, {{commercial}} shellfish; harvests are {{diminished in}} some European waters by a pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio tapetis, that causes Brown <b>Ring</b> <b>disease.</b> To identify molecular characteristics associated with susceptibility or resistance to Brown <b>Ring</b> <b>disease,</b> Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) analyzes {{were performed to}} construct cDNA libraries enriched in up- or down-regulated transcripts from clam immune cells, hemocytes, after a 3 -h in vitro challenge with cultured V. tapetis. Nine hundred and ninety eight sequences from the two libraries were sequenced, and an in silico analysis identified 235 unique genes. BLAST and "Gene ontology" classification analyzes revealed that 60. 4 % of the Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) have high similarities with genes involved in various physiological functions, such as immunity, apoptosis and cytoskeleton organization; whereas, 39. 6 % remain unidentified. From the 235 unique genes, we selected 22 candidates based upon physiological function and redundancy in the libraries.

This disease, caused by the bacteria Vibrio tapetis, is characterized by specific symptoms on the inner face of the shell. Diseased animals develop conchiolin deposit to enrobe bacteria and form new calcified layers on the shell. Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify genes differentially expressed during the early interaction of V. tapetis and Ruditapes philippinarum. Results revealed 301 unique genes differentially expressed during V. tapetis challenge. Several candidates involved in immune and biomineralization processes were selected from libraries. Transcriptional expression of selected candidates was determined in hemolymph and mantle tissues and revealed spatial and temporal variations.

40|$|International audienceA {{bioenergetics}} {{model of}} the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) was built to simulate growth, reproduction and spawning in culture and fishery field sites in Marennes–Oléron Bay (French Atlantic coast). The model is driven by two environmental variables: temperature and food supply. Food supply and the clam's filtration rate determine soft tissue condition index, which in turn drives clam growth and reproduction. The model was calibrated and then validated using two independent data sets. This paper discusses the difficulty of comparing experimental data and individual model outputs when asynchronous spawning events occur in the studied population. In spite of this difficulty, the simulations reproduce the typical pattern of growth and reproduction of the Manila clam. Simulations showed that water column chlorophyll a concentration is not a perfect estimator of food resources for a near bottom suspension feeder such as the Manila clam and emphasize the {{lack of knowledge about}} Ruditapes philippinarum nutrition.

40|$|International audienceBrown <b>Ring</b> <b>Disease</b> (BRD) {{is used as}} a {{case study}} to {{describe}} an ecological approach to understanding host-pathogen interactions. BRD is caused by a bacterial microparasite, Vibrio tapetis, which elicits the inhibition of the calcification process. Epidemiological studies of BRD are facilitated by the use of characteristic clinic signs on the inner surface of the valves. The phenology and dynamics of BRD are then described by coupling epidemiological, ecological and physiological data. Spatial distribution of BRD prevalence in natural clam populations and V. tapetis load in the sediment allows the investigation of the transmission mode of this pathogen. Experimental testing of different transmission modes has demonstrated the predominant role of feces and pseudofeces in V. tapetis transmission and diffusion processes. Some other hosts can harbor V. tapetis, including reservoir species such as cockles but also vertebrate predators such as fishes, and cross-species transmission could potentially {{play a major role in}} dispersion of the pathogen during its life cycle.

40|$|International audienceShell {{disease in}} the abalone Haliotis tuberculata L. is {{characterized}} by a conchiolin deposit on the inner surface of the shell. The gross clinical signs appear similar to the Brown <b>Ring</b> <b>Disease</b> (BRD) of clams. BRD has been extensively described in clams and is known to be responsible for severe mortalities and the collapse of the clam aquaculture industry in western France. In the clam, it was found to be caused by the infection of the mantle by Vibrio tapetis. Brown protein deposits have been observed in various abalone species around the world; some of these have been associated with a fungal infection in New Zealand, but the ones described here are similar to bacterial infections observed in clams. Larger animals appeared to be more affected by the disease, and a positive correlation of the number of successive infections found in the shells with the level of infestation of the shell by borers suggests that boring polychaetes and sponges may be vectors of the disease, or that the parasite infestation may increase the susceptibility of the animal to this infection.

40|$|International audienceAn individual-based {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} investigate the biological and environmental interactions that influence the prevalence and intensity of Brown <b>Ring</b> <b>Disease</b> (BRD), a disease, caused by the bacterial pathogen, Vibrio tapetis, in the Manila clam (Venerupis (=Tapes, =Ruditapes) philippinarum). V. tapetis acts as an external microparasite, adhering at {{the surface of the}} mantle edge and its secretion, the periostracal lamina, causing the symptomatic brown deposit. Brown <b>Ring</b> <b>Disease</b> is atypical in that it leaves a shell scar that provides a unique tool for diagnosis of either live or dead clams. The model was formulated using laboratory and field measurements of BRD development in Manila clams, physiological responses of the clam to the pathogen, and the physiology of V. tapetis, as well as theoretical understanding of bacterial disease progression in marine shellfish. The simulation results obtained for an individual Manila clam were expanded to cohorts and populations using a probability distribution that prescribed a range of variability for parameters in a three dimensional framework; assimilation rate, clam hemocyte activity rate (the number of bacteria ingested per hemocyte per day), and clam calcification rate (a measure of the ability to recover by covering over the symptomatic brown ring deposit), which sensitivity studies indicated to be processes important in determining BRD prevalence and intensity. This approach allows concurrent simulation of individuals with a variety of different physiological capabilities (phenotypes) and hence by implication differing genotypic composition. Different combinations of the three variables provide robust estimates for the fate of individuals with particular characteristics in a population that consists of mixtures of all possible combinations. The BRD model was implemented using environmental observations from sites in Brittany, France, where Manila clams routinely exhibit BRD signs. The simulated annual cycle of BRD prevalence and intensity agrees with observed disease cycles in cultured clam populations from this region, with maximum disease prevalence and intensity occurring from December to April. Sensitivity analyses of modeled physiological processes showed that the level of hemocyte activity is the primary intrinsic determinant of recovery of infected clams. Simulations designed to investigate environmental effects on BRD suggested that the outcome of the host-parasite interaction is dependent on food supply (high values being favorable for the host) and temperature. Results of simulations illustrate the complex interaction of temperature effects on propagation and viability of the bacterium, on the phagocytic activity of the hemocytes, and on other physiological processes of the host clam. Simulations using 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C increases in temperature generally favored disease development, indicating that climate warming might favor the spread of BRD...|$|R

Changes in phenoloxidase (PO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), two major enzymes involved in immunity, were studied in two tissues, the mantle and hemolymph for 30 days after {{infection in the}} extrapallial cavity. Bacterial infection in V. philippinarum resulted in modulation of PO and SOD activities that was both tissue- and time-dependent. A response at early times was detected in the mantle and was associated with significant increases in PO and SOD activities in LP 2 - and CECT 4600 T-challenged clams 36 h post injection. This first response in the mantle {{could be explained by}} the proximity to the injection region (extrapallial cavity). In the hemolymph the response occurred at later times and was associated with an increase in PO activity and a decrease in SOD activity. As hemolymph is a circulating fluid, this response delay could be due to an "integration time" needed by the organism to counteract the infection. Injections also impacted PO and SOD activities in both tissues and confirmed a difference in pathogenicity between the two V. tapetis strains...|$|R

High-sensitivity diagnostic methods, capable of full scanning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, are needed to enhance the significance of these genetic assays. A method for extensive sequencing of the CFTR gene was optimized. This method was applied to subjects clinically positive for CF and to controls from the general population of central Italy as well as to a single subject heterozygous for a mild mutation and with an uncertain diagnosis. Some points that are crucial for the optimization of the method emerged: a 96 -well format, primer project and purification, and amplicon purification. The optimized method displayed a high degree of diagnostic sensitivity; we identified a subset of 13 CFTR mutations that greatly enhanced the diagnostic sensitivity of common methods of mutational analysis.

Although BRD infection is often lethal, some clams recover by mineralizing a new repair shell layer, which covers the brown deposit and fully isolates it from living tissues. In order to understand this specific shell repair process, the microstructures of repaired zones were compared to those of shells unaffected by BRD. In addition, the organic matrix associated with unaffected shells and to repair patches were extracted and compared by biochemical and immunological techniques. Our results show that the repaired zones exhibit microstructures that resemble the so-called homogeneous microstructure of the internal layer, with some marked differences, like the development of crossed-acicular crystals, which form chevron-like patterns. In the three tested batches of repaired layers, the matrices exhibit certain heterogeneity, i. e., they are partially to widely different from the ones of shells unaffected by BRD, as illustrated by SOS-PAGE and by serological comparisons. Our results strongly suggest a modification of the secretory regime of calcifying mantle cells during the shell repair process. Polyclonal antibodies, which were developed against specific protein fractions of the shell, represent relevant tools for localizing by immunohistology the cells responsible for the repair...|$|R
