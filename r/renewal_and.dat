5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, <b>renewal,</b> <b>and</b> existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

5|$|After the crisis, Unicamp saw {{a period}} of <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> restructuring. In 1983 the bylaws were rewritten, {{ensuring}} {{the autonomy of the}} academic community, and the new management structure for the campus was implemented. In 1986 the newly created University Council replaces the previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. The last years of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} {{a process of}} urban <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Baird held ministerial {{responsibilities}} for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation.

Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird {{as a champion of}} waterfront <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> Miller described him as an ally of the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Min had {{negotiated}} {{a contract that}} partially tied her compensation {{to the number of}} magazines sold. As distribution increased, her salary peaked at $2 million a year.

For her work at Us Weekly, Min was named AdWeek magazine's Editor of the Year. While in-between jobs, Min received job offers from women's magazines, but was not interested. She spent ten months with her family.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{abandoned}} the abstract folk jazz compositions of Astral Weeks {{in favor of}} more formally composed songs on Moondance, which he wrote and produced entirely himself. Its lively rhythm and blues/rock music was the style he would become most known for in his career. The music incorporated soul, jazz, pop, and Irish folk sounds into songs about finding spiritual <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> redemption in worldly matters such as nature, music, romantic love, and self-affirmation.|$|E

Further alterations were made in 1887, including the extension of the minister's vestry, replacement of the windows and <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> restoration of the pews.|$|E
5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human physiology, <b>renewal,</b> <b>and</b> fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Construction on {{the first}} {{segments}} of the Chrysler Freeway started on January 30, 1959. The area where the freeway was built was called Black Bottom, a historic district that received {{its name from the}} soil found there by French explorers. In the 1940s and 1950s, the area was the home to a community of African-American entrepreneurs and businesses that rivaled Harlem in New York City. Black Bottom was one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, and at the time of freeway construction, it had wooden sewers and dilapidated buildings. The area, like Corktown to the west of downtown, was targeted for urban <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> infrastructure improvements in the 1950s and 1960s, which included the Chrysler Freeway and public housing projects.|$|E

5|$|Since December 2013, a {{plan has}} been {{underway}} for the Halifax Regional School Board to close and demolish {{at least two of}} the three DMHS feeder schools, as well as DMHS itself, and replace them with a larger, more modern school in Sheet Harbour, that will serve grades primary-12. This new school will teach about 300 students and will serve the large area around Sheet Harbour. On 26 April 2016, the site for the project was chosen; the site that Duncan MacMillan High School currently occupies. A school steering team was established thereafter and cooperates with the design team for the new school, the Halifax Regional School Board and two government departments; the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure <b>Renewal</b> <b>and</b> the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development for the design and planning phases.|$|E
5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
5|$|Illia was deposed {{by a new}} {{military}} coup in June 1966, the Argentine Revolution. Alfonsín was detained while trying to hold a political rally in La Plata, and a second time {{when he tried to}} re-open the UCRP committee. He was forced to resign as deputy in November 1966. He was detained a third time in 1968 after a political rally in La Plata. He also wrote opinion articles in newspapers, under the pseudonyms Alfonso Carrido Lura and Serafín Feijó. The Dirty War began during this time, as many guerrilla groups rejected both the right-wing military dictatorship and the civil governments, preferring instead a left-wing dictatorship aligned with the Soviet Union, as in the Cuban Revolution. Alfonsín clarified in his articles that he rejected both the military dictatorship and the guerrillas, asking instead for free elections. The UCRP became the UCR once more; and the UCRI was turned into the Intransigent Party. Alfonsín created the Movement for <b>Renewal</b> <b>and</b> Change within the UCR, to challenge Balbín's leadership of the party. The military dictatorship finally called for free elections, allowing Peronism (which had been banned since 1955) to take part in them. Balbín defeated Alfonsín in the primary elections, but lost in the main ones. Alfonsín was elected deputy once more.|$|E
