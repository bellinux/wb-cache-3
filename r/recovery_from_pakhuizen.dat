40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{extensive}} literature examining {{perceptions of}} <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> severe mental illness, literature focusing on <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression in adults is limited. AIM: Systematically review {{the existing literature}} investigating patients' and clinicians' perceptions of, and factors associated with, <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression. METHOD: Studies investigating perceptions of, and factors associated with, <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression in adults were identified through database searches. Studies were assessed against inclusion criteria and quality rating checklists. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. <b>Recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression {{is perceived as a}} complex, personal journey. The concept of normalised, biomedical definitions of recovery is not supported, with the construction of self and societal gender expectations identified by women as central to <b>recovery.</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression was associated with higher levels of perceived social support and group memberships. A range of factors are identified as influencing recovery. However, physicians and patients prioritise different factors assessing what is important in being "cured" <b>from</b> depression. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression is perceived by patients as a complex, personal process, influenced by a range of factors. However, greater understanding of clinicians' perceptions of client <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression is essential to inform clinical practice and influence future research...|$|R

All these plants operate essentially based on grate boilers with flue gas treatment at the highest technical level. The article also lists other technologies which can be used for energy <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> municipal waste – these are gasification and pyrolysis units and plasma technology. The conclusion of this contribution is devoted to the current and future situation in the area of energy <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> municipal waste in the Czech Republic with regard to the applicable legal standards...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Anaemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} haematological complications seen in people with HIV/AIDS. Understanding factors associated with <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaemia during Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) is vital since anaemia is a strong predictor of disease progression and mortality. However to our knowledge, predictors of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaemia in HIV infected patients are not well documented. Methods The study was a retrospective analysis of data prospectively collected from Themba-Lethu Clinic HIV cohort. A total of 12, 441 adult patients initiating HAART between 1 st April 2004 and 30 th June 2010 were analyzed. A further 2, 489 patients with anaemia at HAART initiation were examined to determine incidence and predictors of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaemia. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate time to <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaemia and Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to investigate predictors of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaemia. Results Among these 12, 441 participants at HAART initiation, 7, 645 (61. 5...|$|R
40|$|The present {{longitudinal}} study aimed to determine rate of natural <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> DSM-IV social phobia {{in the community}} and to examine predictors of recovery. Data were derived from the Dresden Predictor Study of a representative sample of 1396 young German women. The participants completed a diagnostic interview and self-report questionnaires at two survey points approximately 1. 5 years apart. Of the 91 women with social phobia at baseline 64 % were at least partially recovered and 36 % showed full <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> social phobia at follow-up, deﬁned as absence of any of the DSM-IV criteria of social phobia. Predictors of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> social phobia were: being employed, no lifetime depression, fewer than three lifetime psychiatric disorders, less psychopathology, less anxiety sensitivity, fewer daily hassles, and better mental health. These results show that rates of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> social phobia are relatively high in community and that less stress and internal psychological problems {{play an important role in}} <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> social phobia...|$|R

40|$|Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK 1) and SphK 2 are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} generate sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), a ligand {{for a family}} of G protein–coupled receptors (S 1 PR 1 –S 1 PR 5) with important functions in the vascular and immune systems. Here we explore the role of these kinases and receptors in <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis in mice. We found that Sphk 2 –/– mice had a rapid <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis. In contrast, Sphk 1 –/– mice showed poor <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis and delayed histamine clearance. Injection of S 1 P into Sphk 1 –/– mice increased histamine clearance and promoted <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis. Adoptive cell transfer experiments demonstrated that SphK 1 activity was required in both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments for <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis. Mice lacking the S 1 P receptor S 1 PR 2 also showed a delay in plasma histamine clearance and a poor <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis. However, S 1 P did not promote the recovery of S 1 pr 2 –/– mice from anaphylaxis, whereas S 1 pr 2 +/– mice showed partial recovery. Unlike Sphk 2 –/– mice, Sphk 1 –/– and S 1 pr 2 –/– mice had severe hypotension during anaphylaxis. Thus, SphK 1 -produced S 1 P regulates blood pressure, histamine clearance, and <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> anaphylaxis in a manner that involves S 1 PR 2. This suggests that specific S 1 PR 2 agonists may serve to counteract the vasodilation associated with anaphylactic shock...|$|R

In H- 2 a/a mice, the Rfv- 3 gene apparently influenced <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> viremia in the presence of persistent leukemia because these mice lacked the appropriate H- 2 genotype for <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> leukemia.

40|$|Short-term {{depression}} {{is a widespread}} form of use-dependent plasticity found in the peripheral and central nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates.

We studied the mechanism and dynamics of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression at the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, where marked presynaptic depression has been described previously. Climbing fibers are well suited to studies of <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression because they display little, if any, facilitation (even under conditions of low-release probability), which can obscure rapid <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> depression for hundreds of milliseconds after release.
