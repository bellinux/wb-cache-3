5|$|Stability of the ylide {{with higher}} {{stability}} similarly leading to greater <b>reversibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Solvation {{of charges}} in the betaine by counterions such as lithium with greater {{solvation}} allowing more facile rotation in the betaine intermediate, lowering the amount of <b>reversibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stability of the {{substrate}} with higher stability leading to greater <b>reversibility</b> by favoring the starting material over the betaine.|$|E
5|$|Steric {{hindrance}} in the betaine {{with greater}} hindrance leading to greater <b>reversibility</b> by disfavoring {{formation of the}} intermediate and slowing the rate-limiting rotation of the central bond.|$|E
5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing <b>reversibility</b> is also easy: the automaton is reversible if {{and only}} if the transition function on the blocks of the automaton is invertible, and in this case the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E
5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the <b>reversibility</b> of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the <b>reversibility</b> of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|The trans diastereoselectivity {{observed}} {{results from}} the <b>reversibility</b> of the initial addition, allowing equilibration to the favored anti betaine over the syn betaine. Initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges; density functional theory calculations {{have shown that the}} rate-limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the conformer necessary for backside attack on the sulfonium.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of <b>reversibility.</b> This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The <b>reversibility</b> of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reversibility</b> – Whether {{or not the}} {{original}} can be restored from the converted text. Some reversible systems allow for an irreversible simplified version.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{stationary}} {{processes are}} reversible, however, {{most commonly used}} DNA evolution models assume time <b>reversibility,</b> which {{is considered to be}} a reasonable assumption.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{reaction}} operation, {{and firing}} sequence <b>reversibility.</b> Unlike some missiles, such as Stinger, with gas-cooled IR sensors or one-shot thermal batteries, MMP may be locked-on to potential targets repeatedly without consuming resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of detailed balance was explicitly introduced for collisions by Ludwig Boltzmann. In 1872, he proved his H-theorem using this principle. The arguments {{in favor of}} this property are founded upon microscopic <b>reversibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|The recent {{discovery}} of the <b>reversibility</b> of many reactions catalyzed by inverting glycosyltransferases served as a paradigm shift {{in the field and}} raises questions regarding the designation of sugar nucleotides as 'activated' donors.|$|E
25|$|In {{physical}} and chemical kinetics, T-symmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws: the principle of detailed balance and the Onsager reciprocal relations. T-symmetry of the microscopic description together with its kinetic consequences are called microscopic <b>reversibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is within}} the spectrum of non-alcoholic liver disease (NALD), which ranges in severity and <b>reversibility</b> from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis to liver cancer, similar to the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
25|$|The Curies, however, did {{not predict}} the {{converse}} piezoelectric effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. The Curies immediately confirmed {{the existence of}} the converse effect, and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete <b>reversibility</b> of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in piezoelectric crystals.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} {{rechargeable}} batteries supercapacitors feature higher peak currents, low cost per cycle, {{no danger of}} overcharging, good <b>reversibility,</b> non-corrosive electrolyte and low material toxicity, while batteries offer, lower purchase cost, stable voltage under discharge, but they require complex electronic control and switching equipment, with consequent energy loss and spark hazard given a short.|$|E
25|$|Some {{flexibility}} in orientation of graphs (rotation and <b>reversibility)</b> {{continues in the}} Western Zhou, but this becomes increasingly scarce throughout the Zhou dynasty. The graphs start to become slightly more uniform in structure, size and arrangement {{by the time of}} the third Zhou sovereign, King Kāng, and after the ninth, King Yì, this trend becomes more obvious.|$|E
25|$|Charge/discharge {{takes place}} over {{a window of}} about 1.2V per electrode. This pseudo{{capacitance}} of about 720F/g is roughly 100 times higher than for double-layer capacitance using activated carbon electrodes. These transition metal electrodes offer excellent <b>reversibility,</b> with several hundred-thousand cycles. However, ruthenium is expensive and the 2.4V voltage window for this capacitor limits their applications to military and space applications.|$|E
25|$|For {{one-dimensional}} cellular automata {{there are}} known algorithms for deciding whether a rule is reversible or irreversible. However, for cellular automata {{of two or}} more dimensions <b>reversibility</b> is undecidable; that is, there is no algorithm that takes as input an automaton rule and is guaranteed to determine correctly whether the automaton is reversible. The proof by Jarkko Kari is related to the tiling problem by Wang tiles.|$|E
25|$|This kind of evidence, of {{independence}} of sequence of stages, {{combined with the}} above-mentioned evidence, {{of independence}} of qualitative kind of work, would show {{the existence of an}} important state variable that corresponds with adiabatic work, but not that such a state variable represented a conserved quantity. For the latter, another step of evidence is needed, which {{may be related to the}} concept of <b>reversibility,</b> as mentioned below.|$|E
25|$|Museum collections, {{especially}} those of the natural history variety, often contain osteological specimens derived from humans. These can include individual bones, bone fragments, entire skeletons, and teeth from both ancient and contemporary sources. Reconstruction of bone fragments should be conducted with great care and consideration. Due to the porous nature of bones, few adhering substances {{can be used on}} bone with an adequate level of <b>reversibility,</b> which is a key component of all conservation treatments.|$|E
25|$|For many sensing techniques, {{the sensor}} {{can act as}} both a sensor and an actuator– often the term {{transducer}} is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of <b>reversibility</b> whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.|$|E
25|$|To tackle this issue, one {{approach}} is the mean field or Ehrenfest method, where the molecular dynamics is run on the average potential energy surface given by a linear combination of the adiabatic states. This was applied successfully for some applications, but has some important limitations. When {{the difference between the}} adiabatic states is large, then the dynamics must be primarily driven by only one surface, and not an average potential. In addition, this method also violates the principle of microscopic <b>reversibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{cellular}} automaton is reversible if, for every current {{configuration of the}} {{cellular automaton}}, there is exactly one past configuration (preimage). If one thinks of a cellular automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, <b>reversibility</b> implies that this function is bijective. If a cellular automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also {{be described as a}} cellular automaton; this fact is a consequence of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata. For cellular automata in which not every configuration has a preimage, the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns.|$|E
25|$|Appeals to {{simplicity}} {{were used}} to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, ball lightning, continental drift, and reverse transcriptase. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed <b>reversibility</b> of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the atomic theory was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles {{that had not been}} directly detected. Ernst Mach and the logical positivists rejected John Dalton's atomic theory until the reality of atoms was more evident in Brownian motion, as shown by Albert Einstein.|$|E
25|$|Detailed balance {{states that}} in {{equilibrium}} each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process and requires <b>reversibility</b> of all elementary processes. For many real physico-chemical complex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic oxidation, most enzyme reactions etc.), detailed mechanisms include both reversible and irreversible reactions. If one represents irreversible reactions as limits of reversible steps, then it become obvious {{that not all}} reaction mechanisms with irreversible reactions can be obtained as limits of systems or reversible reactions with detailed balance. For example, the irreversible cycle A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1 cannot be obtained as such a limit but the reaction mechanism A1 -> A2 -> A3 <- A1 can.|$|E
25|$|At a {{symptomatic}} level, {{sleep is}} characterized by lack of reactivity to sensory inputs, low motor output, diminished conscious awareness and rapid <b>reversibility</b> to wakefulness. However, to translate these into a biological definition is difficult because no single pathway in the brain {{is responsible for the}} generation and regulation of sleep. One of the earliest proposals was to define sleep as the deactivation of the cerebral cortex and the thalamus because of near lack of response to sensory inputs during sleep. However, this was invalidated because both regions are active in some phases of sleep. In fact, it appears that the thalamus is only deactivated in the sense of transmitting sensory information to the cortex.|$|E
25|$|Steel, {{carbon fiber}} and glass among others are usually {{considered}} linear materials, while other {{materials such as}} rubber and soils are non-linear. However, {{this is not an}} absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very high stress or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory will not be enough. For example, as the linear theory implies <b>reversibility,</b> it would be absurd to use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of {{heritable}} changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence, often a result of environmental or dietary damage to the histone receptors within the cell. Current research has shown that epigenetic pharmaceuticals could be a putative replacement or adjuvant therapy for currently accepted treatment methods such as radiation and chemotherapy, or could enhance the effects of these current treatments. It has been shown that the epigenetic control of the proto-onco regions and the tumor suppressor sequences by conformational changes in histones directly affects the formation and progression of cancer. Epigenetics also has the factor of <b>reversibility,</b> a characteristic that other cancer treatments do not offer.|$|E
25|$|The {{trans effect}} in square {{complexes}} {{can be explained}} in terms of an addition/elimination mechanism that goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate. Ligands with a high trans effect are in general those with high π acidity (as in the case of phosphines) or low-ligand lone-pair–dπ repulsions (as in the case of hydride), which prefer the more π-basic equatorial sites in the intermediate. The second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand; due to the principle of microscopic <b>reversibility,</b> the departing ligand must also leave from an equatorial position. The third and final equatorial site is occupied by the trans ligand, so the net result is that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest trans effect is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|During {{emergencies}} where {{evacuation of}} a heavily populated area is required, local authorities may institute contraflow lane reversal, {{in which all}} lanes of a road lead away from a danger zone regardless of their original flow. Aside from emergencies, contraflow may {{also be used to}} ease traffic congestion during rush hour or {{at the end of a}} sports event (where a large number of cars are leaving the venue at the same time). For example, the six lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel can be changed from three inbound and three outbound to a two/four configuration depending on traffic volume. The Brazilian highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes and Rodovia Anchieta connect São Paulo to the Atlantic coast. Almost all lanes of both highways are usually reversed during weekends to allow for heavy seaside traffic. The <b>reversibility</b> of the highways requires many additional highway ramps and complicated interchanges.|$|E
25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and <b>reversibility</b> from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.|$|E
500|$|The {{degree of}} <b>reversibility</b> {{in the initial}} step (and {{therefore}} the diastereoselectivity) depends on four factors, with greater <b>reversibility</b> corresponding to higher selectivity: ...|$|E
