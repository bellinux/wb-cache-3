40|$|This {{program was}} to develop a <b>ruggedized</b> <b>transistor</b> capable of meeting the {{following}} CW objectives at 2. 3 gigahertz: a power output of 20 watts, a power gain of 6 db, and an efficiency of 40 percent. Devices developed produced the following CW performance at 2. 3 gigahertz: a power output of 23 watts, a power gain of 7. 7 db, and an efficiently of 40. 0 percent. This performance was achieved with an eight-cell TA 8407 transistor design having the following modifications: a thin pellet, high-frequency diffusion, high-level emitter ballasting, an optimized emitter-bonding configuration for uniform power sharing, and a package that provides for some internal matching through the use of distributed line techniques...|$|E
