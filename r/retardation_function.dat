To be able to make such a prediction the Chair of the Technology of Soil Movement and the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory both of Delft University of Technology, together with Delft Hydraulics developed the computer program DREDMO in the early 80 ’s. The behaviour of a seagoing cutter dredge can be described by the Cummins equations, a set of 7 non-linear coupled equations of motion. Because these equations are non-linear, they have to be solved numerically in the time domain.

In other flight regimes the second Pejsa reference drag curve model uses slope constant factors of 0.0 or -4.0. These deceleration constant factors can be verified by backing out Pejsa's formulas (the drag curve segments fits the form V(2 - N) / C and the retardation coefficient curve segments fits the form V2 / (V(2 - N) / C) = C * VN where C is a fitting coefficient). The empirical test data Pejsa used to determine the exact shape of his chosen reference drag curve and pre-defined mathematical function that returns the retardation coefficient at a given Mach number was provided by the US military for the Cartridge, Ball, Caliber [...]30 M2 bullet. The calculation of the <b>retardation</b> coefficient <b>function</b> also involves air density, which Pejsa did not mention explicitly. The Siacci/Mayevski G1 model uses the following deceleration parametrization (60 °F, 30 inHg and 67% humidity, air density ρ = 1.2209 kg/m3). Dr. Pejsa suggests using the second drag curve because the Siacci/Mayevski G1 drag curve does not provide a good fit for modern spitzer bullets. To obtain relevant retardation coefficients for optimal long range modeling Dr. Pejsa suggested using accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurement data for a particular projectile to empirically derive the average retardation coefficient rather than using a reference drag curve derived average retardation coefficient. Further he suggested using ammunition with reduced propellant loads to empirically test actual projectile flight behavior at lower velocities. When working with reduced propellant loads utmost care must be taken to avoid dangerous or catastrophic conditions (detonations) with can occur when firing experimental loads in firearms.|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and fate of particles including microorganisms during physico-chemical filtration in natural and engineered aquatic environments remains essential for effective and sustainable drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation, {{as well as}} understanding and assessing the risk of environmental contamination of water supplies. The development of models to predict particle deposition by physico-chemical filtration has been ongoing since the 1960 ’s. What is now considered classical colloid filtration theory (CFT) {{was developed in the}} 1970 ’s to predict particle removal during granular media filtration used for drinking water treatment. More recently, CFT has been applied to various applications related to subsurface particle and microbial {{transport and}} fate, including riverbank filtration, aquifer storage and recovery, bioremediation, and assessment of contaminant transport and fate. Significant discrepancies between predictions of particle deposition from current CFT models and experimental observations have been reported. While several model variations of CFT have been reported, models focusing on integration of impacts of collector surface geometry and physically-based mechanisms such as hydrodynamics have been rarely reported. The overall goal of this work was to describe and evaluate the contribution of media grain (collector) surface roughness on particle removal by physico-chemical filtration. Four phases of experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of surface roughness on particle deposition in porous media and parallel plate systems. Bench scale “proof of concept” experiments (Phase I) were conducted using small filtration columns, two sizes of colloidal particles (1. 0 and 4. 5 μm diameter polystyrene microspheres), two sizes of glass beads (0. 71 to 0. 85 mm and 0. 5 to 0. 595 mm), and three different levels of surface roughness. The experiments demonstrated that surface roughness not only enhanced particle deposition, but also decreased it. Classic colloid filtration theory, chemical heterogeneity, and hydrophobicity fail to explain this non-linear, non-monotonic impact of surface roughness on particle deposition; particularly decreased deposition resulting from increased surface roughness. The results indicated the existence of a minimum particle deposition efficiency that is unique to each combination of sizes of colloidal particle, collector, and collector roughness. To verify this research finding, particle deposition experiments were conducted using a parallel plate chamber (Phase II) to further confirm and characterize the contribution of surface roughness to particle deposition. The impacts of different nano-scale quartz surface roughness sizes (10, 20, 50, 200 and 400 nm) on deposition kinetics of three sizes (0. 55, 0. 985 and 1. 765 μm) of polystyrene microspheres suspended in 100 mM KCl were examined. A non-linear, non-monotonic relationship between surface roughness and particle deposition flux was again observed. A critical roughness size associated with a minimum deposition flux was identified for the experimental conditions investigated. A numerical model approach incorporating the effect of surface roughness on flow field profile, hydrodynamic <b>retardation</b> <b>functions,</b> and DLVO interaction energy was developed for a parallel plate chamber system (Phase III). Key physical and chemical properties of the flow field, colloids and the modified rough surface were precisely measured and utilized in the simulation. Changes to the flow field, the hydrodynamic <b>retardation</b> <b>functions,</b> and the DLVO interaction energy due to the presence of nano-scale collector surface roughness were implemented in the developed model. The numerical solutions obtained using the developed model had excellent agreement with the experimental results obtained in research Phase II. This work provided a mathematical framework that was more applicable to real practice by including the effect of the collector surface roughness on particle deposition. The importance of the gravity effect was identified, underscoring the importance of precise measurements of particle size and density for model development. The verified model framework developed for a parallel plat chamber in Phase III was extended to spherical geometry and utilized to simulate particle deposition behavior in porous media in Phase IV. Functions that were validated in Phase III for the flow field profile, the hydrodynamic <b>retardation</b> <b>functions,</b> and the DLVO interaction energy were utilized. Various operational scenarios including particle size, loading rate and ionic strength were investigated. The Phase IV results could also be used to explain experimental results observed in the porous media experiments (Phase I). It was found that the presence of nano-scale surface roughness was able to improve the particle deposition on spherical collectors; the enhancement became more significant when roughness element height increased. Overall, this work demonstrated that nano-scale surface roughness and associated hydrodynamics can impact on particle deposition. These impacts can and should be incorporated into predictive mathematical models of clean bed colloidal particle deposition. 1 yea...|$|R

To explore the role of experience in everyday functioning, a study was designed comparing the everyday function of adults with mental retardation with children of comparable mental age (MA-matched). Adults with mild and moderate mental retardation were found to function significantly better than MA-matched children on all aspects of daily living {{as measured by the}} Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. These findings provide experimental support to the little explored claim that people with mental <b>retardation</b> <b>function</b> better than MA-matched younger persons on tasks where experience is crucial. Moreover, they demonstrate the limitations of using the MA-match methodology in a domain that is so clearly dependent upon experience. ^ The current definition of mental retardation requires a significantly subaverage IQ score, existing concurrently with related limitations in adaptive skills. However, the definition and measurement of adaptive skills is not satisfactory partly due to mixing of intellectual and behavioral components. The study of practical intelligence, which refers to the cognitive underpinning of everyday function, may serve to clarify the definition of adaptive skills as it promotes clear differentiation between doing and understanding. However, measures of practical intelligence for people with mental retardation are not available. To further explore the role of practical intelligence in the everyday function of people with mental retardation an experimental video instrument was developed to assess practical intelligence as represented by the ability to identify, explain, and solve practical problems. Even after controlling for initial differences in mental level, a strong correlation was found between practical intelligence, as well as experience, and level of activities of daily living among adults with mild and moderate mental retardation. This suggests that everyday functioning of people with mental retardation is explained better by practical intelligence than with academic intelligence and that practical intelligence, within a general model of human competence, may indeed promote a more natural and ecologically-valid definition of mental retardation as a condition marked by deficits in both academic and everyday intelligence. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} on the motion responses of a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel moored in irregular waves {{has been carried}} out based on both frequency- and time-domain approaches. In the frequency-domain approach a three-dimensional panel method was employed in order to calculate the first-order hydrodynamic forces and moments such as added masses, potential damping and wave excitation forces and moments and of the resulting the first-order motions and mean second-order forces and moments on the vessel in six degrees of freedom behaviour. A spectral analysis was carried out in order to estimate both the significant and the extreme values of the first-order motions. Additionally Pinkster’s approximation was used to find the mean-square values of slow drift motions, in order to calculate wave-induced extreme excursions and the resulting tensions on the mooring lines of the vessel. Two different methods were used in the time-domain approach for undertaking a mooring analysis. One method used a fast practical time-domain technique that calculates the first-order motion responses in random waves based on the frequency-domain response amplitudes and simulated seas, and also solves the uncoupled second-order motion responses of the FPSO induced by second-order forces, based on Newman’s approximation in irregular seas. The other method is by solving six coupled equations of motion based <b>retardation</b> <b>functions</b> transformed from potential damping for the FPSO and induced by the first-order and second-order wave excitations in random seas. The results of the wave-induced extreme excursions and the mooring line tensions obtained by means of the frequency- and time-domain methods are compared and discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer effective nonlinear time-domain strip theory formulation for dynamic positioning (DP) and low-speed manoeuvring. Strip theory or 2 D potential theory, where {{the ship is}} divided in 20 to 30 cross sections, {{can be used to}} compute the potential coefficients (added mass and potential damping) and the exciting wave loads (Froude-Krylov and diffraction forces). Commercially available programs are ShipX (VERES) by Marintek (Fathi, 2004) and SEAWAY by Amarcon (Journée & Adegeest, 2003), for instance. The proposed method can easily be extended to utilize other strip theory formulations or 3 -D potential programs like WAMIT (2004). The frequency dependent potential damping, which in classic theory results in a convolution integral not suited for real-time simulation, is compactly represented by using the state-space formulation of Kristiansen & Egeland (2003). The separation of the vessel model into a low-frequency model (represented by zerofrequency added mass and damping) and a wave-frequency model (represented by motion transfer functions or RAOs), which is commonly used for simulation, is hence made superfluous. Transformations of motions and coefficients between different coordinate systems and origins, i. e. data frame, hydrodynamic frame, body frame, inertial frame etc., are put into the rigid framework of Fossen (1994, 2002). The kinematic equations of motion are formulated in a compact nonlinear vector representation and the classical kinematic assumption that the Euler angles are small is removed. This is important for computation of accurate control forces at higher roll and pitch angles. The hydrodynamic forces in the steadily translating hydrodynamic reference frame (equilibrium axes) are, however, assumed tobe linear.

Furthermore, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7 (Bmp 7) is upregulated in Tcf 4 -deficient neurons. In vivo gain of function and rescue experiments demonstrated that Bmp 7 is the major downstream effector of Tcf 4 required for neuronal migration. Conclusion: Thus, we have uncovered a new Tcf 4 /Bmp 7 -dependent mechanism underlying neuronal migration, and provide insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders...|$|R
40|$|Wound {{care is a}} major {{healthcare}} expenditure. Treatment of burns, surgical {{and trauma}} wounds, diabetic lower limb ulcers and skin wounds is a major medical challenge with current therapies largely focused on supportive care measures. Successful wound repair requires a series of tightly coordinated steps including coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, new tissue formation and extracellular matrix remodelling. Zinc is an essential trace element (micronutrient) which plays important roles in human physiology. Zinc is a cofactor for many metalloenzymes required for cell membrane repair, cell proliferation, growth and immune system function. The pathological effects of zinc deficiency include the occurrence of skin lesions, growth <b>retardation,</b> impaired immune <b>function</b> and compromised would healing. Here, we discuss investigations on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of zinc in modulating the wound healing process. Knowledge gained from this body of research will help to translate these findings into future clinical management of wound healing...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} four gelatin fractions in mixture with sucrose and glucose syrup {{have been investigated}} extensively using small deformation dynamic oscillation. The total level of solids was 80 %, the {{number average molecular weight}} of the protein ranged from 29. 2 to 68 kD, and the temperatures were between 60 and - 60 °C. Remarkably, the nature of the time and temperature dependence on the viscoelastic functions of all samples could be reduced to master curves using horizontal shift factors. The construction of master curves indicates a common mechanism of structure formation, which, in accordance with the synthetic polymer literature, comprises the rubbery zone, glass transition region, and glassy state. Application of Ferry&# 039;s free-volume formalism and Rouse theory suggests that there is no change in the thermodynamic state of materials during vitrification, with changes in molecular weight simply introducing shifts in the time scale and temperature range of contributions to viscoelasticity. The thermorheological simplicity allowed development of the concept of &# 039;rheological&# 039;Tg. This was defined as the point between free-volume phenomena of the polymeric backbone occurring in the glass transition region and an energetic barrier to rotation required for local chain rearrangements in the glassy state. Mechanical relaxation and <b>retardation</b> distribution <b>functions</b> were calculated, thus obtaining values for the effective friction coefficient per monomer unit of the protein. It appears that the local friction coefficient is governed by a linear relationship between fractional free volume and the decreasing molecular weight of the protein, which introduces additional voids due to molecular ends.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Liquid crystal {{displays}} need reliable anchoring (such as planar, or homeotropic). To test a {{range of}} treatments applied under various conditions, or in an industrial environment, we need a quick and reliable method to measure the zenithal anchoring energy. The method described uses a simple experimental set-up {{that can be easily}} automated. Furthermore, because of the simple model used the data analysis is also straightforward, unlike other methods previously published. The experimental set-up is shown in Figure 1. The 2 set-up measures the <b>retardation</b> as a <b>function</b> of applied voltage (an AC voltage is applied and the RMS voltage is recorded). A typical set of experimental data, for the planar anchoring case, is shown in Figure 2. We first model how the director profile varies across the cell. This model is used to calculate the cell's retardation. By varying the model parameters to get a good fit to the experimental data we can obtain the anchoring strength. The experime...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Variable {{polarization}} compensation {{has been}} demonstrated at 100 GHz. The device consists of two interlocking V-groove artificial dielectric gratings that produce a birefringence that varies with the separation distance. A maximum retardance of 74 has been obtained experimentally in a silicon device, in good agreement with rigorous coupled-wave computer simulations. Further simulations predict that adding quarter wave dielectric antireflection (AR) coatings to the outer surfaces of the device can reduce the insertion loss to below 4 dB. The use of rectangular grooved gratings provides increased retardance and reduced loss. It is predicted that a coupled device with a rectangular grooved gratings will be capable of maximum retardance in excess of 180, with low insertion loss (0. 6 dB). The sensitivity of the wave <b>retardation</b> as a <b>function</b> of mechanical separation has a peak value of 485 /mm. The design and micromachining fabrication techniques scale for operation at submillimeter wavelengths. Index Terms—Anisotropic media, birefringence, compensation, micromachining, microwave measurements, millimeter wave de-vices, polarization, submillimeter wave devices. I...|$|R
40|$|We have {{synthesized}} {{a series}} of epoxy resins containing melamine phosphate (MP) and investigated their thermal and flame <b>retardation</b> properties. MP <b>functions</b> as a hardener and a flame retardant or as an additive of the cured epoxy resin to enhance flame retardation properties of epoxy resins. The reactions of DGEBA cured {{in the presence of}} MP were monitored by NMR and FTIR. Our results show that in both reactive and additive modes, MP is effective in increasing limiting oxide index (LOI) and the char yields of epoxy resins at lower phosphorous content. We observed that flame retardation by MP in its reactive mode is better than in its additive mode; the same phenomenon was found also for the glass-transition temperature (Tg). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that epoxy resins containing MP decompose at relatively lower temperatures than those lacking MP; this decomposition results in a protective layer forming that prevents the epoxy resins from decomposing further by combustion...|$|R
