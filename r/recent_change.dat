5|$|The five {{best known}} appellations in the Languedoc include Languedoc AOC (formerly {{known as the}} Coteaux du Languedoc), Corbières AOC, Faugères, Minervois AOC, and Saint-Chinian AOCs. The vast {{majority}} of Languedoc wines are produced by wine cooperatives which number more than 500. However, the appellation system {{in the region is}} undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing. One <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> is that the Coteaux du Languedoc has changed name to Languedoc and been extended to include also the Roussillon.|$|E

5000|$|Among the {{features}} of MediaWiki to assist in tracking edits is a <b>Recent</b> <b>Changes</b> feature that provides a list of recent edits to the wiki. This list contains basic information about those edits such as the editing user, the edit summary, the page edited, {{as well as any}} tags (e.g. [...] "possible malware link") added by customizable abuse filters and other extensions to aid in combating unhelpful edits. On more active wikis, so many edits occur {{that it is hard to}} track <b>Recent</b> <b>Changes</b> manually. Anti-vandal software, including user-assisted tools are sometimes employed on such wikis to process <b>Recent</b> <b>Changes</b> items. Server load can be reduced by sending a continuous feed of <b>Recent</b> <b>Changes</b> to an IRC channel that these tools can monitor, eliminating their need to send requests for a refreshed <b>Recent</b> <b>Changes</b> feed to the API.|$|R

5|$|When {{the highway}} was {{established}} in 1931, it ran from Lehi to Salt Lake City. The state subsequently extended it south into Elberta and north into Bountiful. The road was routed along its current alignment of Redwood Road in 1943. The road has been moved and extended multiple times, with the most <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> being in 2001 when SR-106 was deleted from the state highway system.|$|E
5|$|Highway89 was {{established}} in 1937 {{as a result of}} the rerouting of Highway9 between Orangeville and Highway27. In 1963, the route was extended west to Palmerston and east to Highway400. Plans were conceived during the late 1970s to push the highway further east to Highway12 via Ravenshoe Road, resulting in a brief extension to Highway11. However, environmental protest over the chosen route through the Holland Marsh resulted in the cancellation of plans in 1986. In 1997, the section between Highway400 and Highway11 was decommissioned. The most <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> to the route took place in 2003, when the section of Highway89 between Palmerston and Harriston was renumbered as part of Highway23, creating a shared terminus at a junction with Highway9.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another {{superspecies}} {{and replace}} each other geographically across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch sensu stricto, S. cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, S. (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|E

5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, Hawaii {{was plagued}} by a rash of thefts of Spam. Spam had long been a target of thieves in Hawaii, but the {{magnitude}} of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of Spam were stolen at once. Local retailers believe organized crime was involved. This came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as corned beef and liquor. The president of the retail merchants of Hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.|$|E

In a number of Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, movements have emerged advocating a republican government in place of constitutional monarchy; they were, and continue to be, countered by monarchist leagues that support the existing system and/or celebrate the historical and modern connections the common monarchy provides. Unsuccessful referenda on proposed models of republics {{have taken place in}} Australia, Tuvalu, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.|$|E

25|$|Among Carmoega's {{works are}} Mercado de las Carnes in Ponce. Carmoega also {{designed}} the Capitol Building, the University of Puerto Rico Main Campus at Rio Piedras, the School of Tropical Medicine, and the Mayaguez City Hall, all {{listed on the}} National Register. In his interest to preserve Hispanic traditions {{in the wake of}} the <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> of sovereignty of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, Carmoega utilized the Spanish Baroque and Neo-Mudejar vocabularies in his designs, emphasizing the use of glazed, mosaic tiles in many buildings. The Plaza de los Perros in Ponce is a fine example of this latter style, incorporating glazed mosaics, horseshoe arches, and galleries in a mosque-like space for commercial usage.|$|E
25|$|From 1894 to 1966 {{the town}} was an urban {{district}} (a form of local government) in its own right, before becoming part of Ludlow Rural District (the separate Church Stretton Rural District had already been abolished in 1934) and the contemporary civil parish was then established. The Urban District Council was based at offices on Beaumont Road, where Beaumont Court now is. In 1974 the system of urban and rural districts was replaced and the town came under South Shropshire non-metropolitan district and Shropshire non-metropolitan county. The most <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> in local government occurred in 2009 when Shropshire became a unitary area with Shropshire Council replacing South Shropshire District Council and Shropshire County Council.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 1818, a {{plan was}} passed by Congress at the {{suggestion}} of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most <b>recent</b> <b>change,</b> from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.|$|E

25|$|The most <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> to SR 49 {{occurred}} in the 1990s. Before 1999, SR 49 began in downtown Dayton at SR 4 and SR 48. It traveled west along First Street and Monument Avenue, crossing under I-75, and over the Great Miami River. The eastbound and westbound directions merged together {{at the intersection of}} Salem and Riverview avenues before it traveled northwest out of the city on Salem Avenue. A new four-lane highway through Trotwood was partially completed in 1994 between Free Pike and Salem Avenue with the new road being designated SR 49 Future. By 1999, the new highway between US 35 and Salem Avenue was complete and SR 49 was rerouted out of Dayton to run on this new road. The old route to Dayton was designated SR 49-J indicating that it was being prepared for abandonment. The old segment of SR 49 along Salem Avenue was finally deleted from the state highway system in the summer of 2004.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} {{is that the}} building's design bears the signature of Rafael Carmoega, {{one of the most}} established Puerto Rican architects of the 20th century. A graduate of the Cornell University School of Architecture and subsequent director of the Architectural division of Puerto Rico's Department of the Interior, Carmoega also designed the Capitol Building, the University of Puerto Rico Main Campus at Rio Piedras, the School of Tropical Medicine, and the Mayaguez City Hall, all listed on the National Register, in addition to other significant buildings. In his interest to preserve Hispanic traditions {{in the wake of the}} <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> of sovereignty from Spain to the United States, Carmoega utilized the Spanish Baroque and Neo-Mudejar vocabularies in his designs, emphasizing the use of glazed, mosaic tiles in many buildings.

25|$|The {{name and}} {{emblem of the}} club has changed several times over its history. At the club's {{foundation}} in 1935, it was known only as 'Canterbury-Bankstown', without an animal mascot. The nicknames 'Berries' and 'C-Bs' (or, derisively, 'Country Bumpkins') were often used informally, 'C-Bs' being used from the outset and 'Berries' coming into use by the mid-1940s. The club had {{been referred to as}} the 'Bulldogs' as early as 1977. In 1978, the Bulldog mascot and name was adopted, with the club becoming known as the 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs'. This was the name used throughout the team's 1980s glory era. In 1995 the club name was changed to 'Sydney Bulldogs', reflecting a similar change by Eastern Suburbs (to 'Sydney City Roosters'). The name changed again in 1996, returning to 'Canterbury Bulldogs' with 'Bankstown' omitted, and yet again in 2000, to the geographically indistinct 'Bulldogs'. Bob Hagan, the club boss {{at the time of the}} 2000 change, explained that the dropping of the name 'Canterbury' was intended to broaden the appeal of the club outside of its traditional supporter base, so that the club could attract a geographically diverse following like Manchester United or the Chicago Bulls. Despite the name change, some supporters, as well as many television and radio commentators, continued to refer to the club as 'Canterbury'. In the most <b>recent</b> <b>change,</b> board officials voted in late 2009 for the club to return to 'Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs' from the 2010 season onwards.|$|E
