5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> open verdict.|$|E
5|$|As Cannon—along {{with most}} of the {{defensive}} starters—returned, LSU was expected to compete for another title in 1959. The Tigers began the season as the top-ranked team, and the number of season-ticket holders tripled compared to the previous season. The team won its first six games without allowing a touchdown. Cannon showed his versatility in those games; he led the team in total yards on offense, <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception for a touchdown on defense, and averaged 40 yards per punt while also returning punts and kickoffs. This set up a highly anticipated match-up between LSU and rival Ole Miss Rebels, who were also undefeated.|$|E

5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E
5|$|In {{a rematch}} of the {{previous}} two SEC Championship Games, Alabama defeated the Florida Gators 31–6. Alabama opened the scoring with a 28-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal in the first, and then scored a trio of second-quarter touchdowns. Mark Ingram scored on runs of six and one—yard with the third coming on a 19-yard Marquis Maze touchdown pass to Michael Williams on a wide receiver pass. Florida got on the board late in the second with a 39-yard Chas Henry field goal to bring the halftime score to 24–3. After a second Henry field goal, C. J. Mosley <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception 35-yards for a touchdown to make the final score 31–6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter against Navy, Scarbath scored on a quarterback keeper. Before the half, he {{completed}} passes to ends Stan Karnash and Pete Augsburger for 44- and 59-yard touchdowns. In the third quarter, the Midshipmen responded with a score of their own. In the final period, Maryland end Elmer Wingate <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception 34 yards for another touchdown. Then, 54 seconds later, end Lew Weidensaul recovered a Midshipmen fumble, which allowed Ed Modzelewski to rush five yards for the final score by the Terrapins. Navy scored twice more, but Maryland held on to win, 35–21.|$|E

5|$|Jim Youngblood, who {{had been}} in on the sack that broke Doug Williams' jaw the {{previous}} season, <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> early interception for a touchdown and a 6–0 lead. Shortly thereafter, Bill Kollar recovered a Lawrence McCutcheon fumble at the Rams 27-yard line, leading to a 15-yard touchdown reception by Larry Mucker. Neil O'Donoghue's extra point gave the Buccaneers the lead for good. The Buccaneers further added a 5-yard touchdown run by Ricky Bell and a 29-yard scoring pass to Jimmie Giles, all {{before the end of the}} second quarter. The Rams failed to cross midfield at all in the second half, and were held to only 97 yards passing on 35 attempts. McKay, familiar with Rams quarterback Pat Haden from having coached him at USC, tailored the defensive gameplan towards him.|$|E

Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. His lawyers prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid {{in the days before}} the trial.|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh {{took their}} first {{lead of the}} game on their first drive of the second half, after Reed's second field goal put them up by three points. On the ensuing kickoff the Steelers {{recovered}} a Patriots' fumble and Roethlisberger connected with Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown pass. James Harrison forced his first of two fumbles on the Patriots' next drive and the Steelers recovered as Reed added his third field goal of the game—putting the Steelers up 23–10.

5|$|Tech led 6–3 when Strupper {{broke the}} game {{open in the}} second half. After a fumble by Strupper, Hill caught a pass from the 22-yard line and ran in for a {{touchdown}}. Strupper made the next touchdown after Tech ran through Davidson's right guard. Strupper then recovered a punt fumbled by Flowers on Davidson's 30-yard line, leading to a score by Hill from 18 yards out on a criss-cross run. Davidson scored its only touchdown on a forward pass. From midfield, quarterback Henry Spann hit end Georgie King on a 50-yard touchdown pass that went 30 yards in the air, catching Tech by surprise. For Tech's last score, Judy Harlan <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception 40 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
5|$|The Bulldogs {{opened the}} 1920 season against the Pitcairn Quakers. The team {{got out to}} a quick lead and was never in danger, scoring 34 {{points in the first}} quarter as back Joe Guyon rushed for three {{touchdown}}s, tackle Pete Henry caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from back Tex Grigg, and back Johnny Hendren <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception for a touchdown. The Bulldogs were only forced to punt once in the game, and did not attempt to score {{in the second and third}} quarters because of the large lead. In the fourth quarter, however, end Bunny Corcoran caught a 35-yard touchdown pass from Guyon, and back Ike Martin ran for a one-yard touchdown. The final score was 48–0, and Guyon was the offensive star.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing to}} the New England Patriots in the American Football Conference Championship Game and losing Marcus Washington who joined the Washington Redskins, the Colts shuffled their linebacker lineup and June was listed as a starter when the Colts arrived at mini-camp. At the 2004 Colts {{training}} camp, June competed with Keyon Whiteside for the starting weakside linebacker position. By the end of training camp, June was the starter, and 2004 rookie Gilbert Gardner was the backup. June made his debut as a starter in the opening game against the 2004 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. That season, the Colts used a 4-3 defense with a fourth linebacker on passing downs. In week 5, June had a team-high ten tackles and his first interception in a 3514 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In week 15, June <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception 71yards to the four-yard-line where {{he stepped out of}} bounds with 59seconds remaining in the game at the RCA Dome, the Colts' home stadium. This prompted the fans to chant for Peyton Manning to enter the game to attempt to tie Dan Marino's single-season touchdown pass record. Since the Colts led the game 2010 and had clinched the AFC South division, Manning took a knee instead. Coach Dungy's scheme is designed so that the weakside linebacker is supposed to make the most tackles, and June was the Colts' leading tackler by a wide margin that season. June started every game that season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the game, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech would run away with an overwhelming victory. Tech received the ball to begin the game, and on the game's second play, Virginia Tech's Ken Edwards ran 58 yards on a trick play for the game's first touchdown. Mississippi fumbled the ball on its first offensive play and Virginia Tech recovered the turnover. Three plays later, Tech scored another touchdown on a seven-yard run by Terry Smoot. After stopping the Rebels with their defense, Tech appeared to have another chance to score when the Hokies' Ron Davidson <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> Ole Miss punt to the Rebels' 42-yard line. Despite the excellent field position, Tech was unable to score after Hokie quarterback Al Kinkaid was sacked for a 19-yard loss. Despite the setback, Tech was able to keep Ole Miss from scoring in {{the first quarter}} and tacked on a 29-yard field goal by kicker Jack Simcsak before time came to an end in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, Tech led 170.|$|E
5|$|On the {{defensive}} line, Georgia Tech featured defensive tackle Joe Anoa'i and defensive end Adamm Oliver. Anoa'i, a first-team All-ACC selection, {{headed into the}} ACC Championship having earned six tackles and 2.5 tackles for loss in Tech's previous game against Georgia. Anoa'i also forced and recovered a Georgia fumble that eventually led to a Tech field goal. Adamm Oliver was a second-team All-ACC selection who was fourth on the team in total tackles and second on the team in tackles for loss. Oliver created the game-winning play for the Yellow Jackets against Miami when he forced a fumble that set up the game-clinching touchdown. Georgia Tech also had several important defensive backs. Safety Jamal Lewis was a first-team All-ACC selection and the team's leading tackler. During the Yellow Jackets' game against Samford University, Lewis <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception 97 yards for a touchdown. The return was the fourth-longest in Georgia Tech history and was the longest since a 102-yard return in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{had won a}} {{significant}} victory, but now had 23 wounded and was very low on ammunition. Frazier landed on the newly captured airstrip in his Piper Cub at 12:30. He rejected the airstrip as unsuitable for Dakotas, and oversaw the preparation of a new airstrip on better ground near Mission Hill. This was still a difficult approach, as aircraft had to land upwind while avoiding Mission Hill. Although it was not known if the airstrip would be ready, Hutchison flew in for a test landing there the next day, 21 September, at 15:30. He collected the wounded and flew them to Nadzab, and <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> hour later with a load of rations and ammunition. He also brought with him Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, {{the commander of the}} 21st Infantry Brigade, and his headquarters, who took charge of the area. Around 18:00, six more transports arrived.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{started the}} season strong, winning their first five games. The Huskies easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) {{opponent}} Hofstra. The second game, at Temple, was played as {{the remnants of}} Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. Baylor was next on the schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against Louisville. The game was not decided until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson <b>returned</b> <b>an</b> interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No.24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris polls and No.23 in the Coaches' poll. However, starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville game; the Huskies {{would be forced to}} rely on backup Zach Frazer for the next few games.|$|E
