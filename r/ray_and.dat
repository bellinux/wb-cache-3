Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del Ray followed with a moonsault. Del <b>Ray</b> <b>and</b> Morton fought back and forth, with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this <b>ray,</b> <b>and</b> possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the <b>ray</b> <b>and</b> uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E

40|$|In aprevious study special <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> structures, {{including}} nodal, principal <b>and</b> focal <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> structures, {{were defined}} in terms of generalized magnification of reduced inclination of rays across thesystem.   The mathematical structure of the transference, however, suggests that there are another three possible approaches.   These involve generalized magnification of transverse position of rays across the system and two cross-magnifications, one of reduced inclination to transverse position and the other of transverse position to reduced inclination. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop these otherapproaches.   Nodal, principal <b>and</b> focal <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> structures, and, indeed, all special <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> structures, are defined in each of these approaches.   Equations relating the four types of generalized magnification are derived.   The approaches described here may have application in contexts where transverse position is of interest.   In an appendix the generalized magnifications are calculated for nodal rays across a particular model eye.

In the book, the protagonist chooses a proper name. For the game's re-release on GOG.com a second, more accurate, novelization produced by Rhyss Hess was bundled with the game, based on the game script by Chris Avellone and Colin McComb.|$|E

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} event {{began with}} a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba <b>Ray</b> <b>and</b> D-Von). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a 3D on Duprée. As D-Von covered Duprée, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|After this match, Neil {{was called}} into the Australian Test team, so only <b>Ray</b> <b>and</b> Merv played in Victoria's next match against New South Wales.

After this, <b>Ray</b> <b>and</b> Neil played together for Victoria on two occasions in the second half of the season when the latter did not have a match for Australia. In the first match, against New South Wales, the two batted in partnership for the first time for their state. Ray came in at 5/53 to join Neil and he fell for 9 to leave the score at 6/64 as Victoria collapsed to be all out for 130. In the second innings, Ray joined Neil with the score at 5/266 and the latter fell at 6/292, ending a 26-run partnership. The pair did not bat together in the second match against South Australia as Neil was out before Ray came in on both occasions. The 1947-48 was the most productive for the Harveys as a combination for Victoria until Ray played a full season in 1953-54 together with Neil.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the four}} {{brothers}} all played for Victoria, {{there was not}} a great deal of overlap in their careers at first-class level, due to a combination of age, interstate moves, international duty and omissions from the team.
