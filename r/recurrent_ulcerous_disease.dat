40|$|Objectives To review {{some aspects}} of the {{etiopathogenesis}} of peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease</b> especially on the basis of studies on its correlation with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Methods A search was made in the data bases MEDLINE, LILACS and PubMed, and in Brazilian and foreign books, referring to the incidence and prevalence of infection by H. pylori and of peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease</b> in various populations of different countries. Results It was observed that the prevalence of H. pylori infection is similar in individuals with peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease</b> and the general population. There are differences between countries with respect to the prevalence of infection and of gastric or duodenal peptic ulcers. In many countries the prevalence of infection by H. pylori shows stability while the prevalence of peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease</b> is declining. The prevalence of peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease</b> without H. pylori infection varies between 20 % and 56 % in occidental countries. Discussion The observations might be suggestive of H. pylori being only one more factor to be summed together with other aggressive components in the genesis of peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease.</b> We would therewith be returning to the classic concept that peptic gastric and duodenal ulcers have multifactorial etiology and would result from imbalance between aggressive and defensive factors. The focus of studies should be enriched with the identification of the defensive factors and of other aggressive factors besides the well known H. pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, since these two aggressors do not exhaust the full causal spectrum...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the Bachelor Thesis is "Patients with <b>Ulcerous</b> Stomach <b>Disease</b> and Duodena and their Observance of the Regime Precautions". In the Czech Republic the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> occurs with 3 to 10 % of the {{population}} and it afflicts patients particularly in their active age. The theoretical part describes the disease history, its classification, aetiopathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnostics, compilation, treatment, regime precautions, patient´s education {{and the role of the}} nurse in the nursing process. The practical part deals with three aims which were set at the beginning of the research. The first aim was to find out if the patients with the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena observe the regime precautions. The second aim was focused on the role of the nurse in the education of patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena. The last aim supposed to use the research results and elaborate information material concerning the regime precautions for patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena. Four hypotheses were made. The first hypothesis presumed that patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena know the regime precautions. The second hypothesis claimed that patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena follow the regime precautions. The third hypothesis said that patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena are aware of the importance of following the regime precautions. The fourth hypothesis supposed that nurses play an important role in the educational process of patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena. There was used the quantitative method of the research inquiry. The chosen technique for data collecting was the anonymous questionnaire. The research set formed patients with the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena from the Internal Department of the Hospital in Písek, from a General Practitioner Surgery in Písek, from the Internal and Surgery Department of the Hospital in Strakonice, from the Gastroenterology Department of the Hospital in České Budějovice and from the Internal Outpatients´ Department of the Clinic in Milevsko. On the basis of the evaluation of the anonymous questionnaire the first, the second and the third hypothesis was not proved. On the other hand the fourth hypothesis was proved. On the basis of the research inquiry there was elaborated information material concerning the regime precautions of the patients suffering from the <b>ulcerous</b> stomach <b>disease</b> and duodena.

5000|$|Wuzong's {{successor}} Emperor Xuānzong (r. 846-849) astonishingly {{also died}} of elixir poisoning. Xuānzong made himself the patron of some Daoists who concocted immortality elixirs of vegetable origin, possibly {{because his father}} Wuzong had died from metallic and mineral elixir poisoning (Needham et al. 1976: 146). The New Book of Tang records that the emperor received a wine tincture of ivy (常春藤, Hedera helix) that the Daoist adept Jiang Lu 姜攎 claimed would turn white hair black and provide longevity. However, when the emperor heard that many people died a violent death after drinking ivy tincture, he stopped taking it. Jiang was publicly shamed and the emperor granted his request to search in the mountains for the right plant, but he never appeared again (Needham et al. 1976: 147). According to the 890 Dongguan zuoji (Record of Memorials from the Eastern Library), [...] "A medical official, Li Xuanbo, presented to the emperor Xuanzong cinnabar which had been heated and subdued by fire, {{in order to gain}} favour from him.

40|$|Background: Candida albicans {{is a human}} {{commensal}} that is {{also responsible}} for chronic gastritis and peptic <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease.</b> Little {{is known about the}} genetic profiles of the C. albicans strains in the digestive tract of dyspeptic patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence, diversity, and genetic profiles among C. albicans isolates recovered from natural colonization of the digestive tract in the dyspeptic patients. Methods and Findings: Oral swab samples (n = 111) and gastric mucosa samples (n = 102) were obtained from a group of patients who presented dyspeptic symptoms or ulcer complaints. Oral swab samples (n = 162) were also obtained from healthy volunteers. C. albicans isolates were characterized and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. The prevalence of Candida spp. in the oral samples was not significantly different between the dyspeptic group and the healthy group (36. 0 %, 40 / 111 vs. 29. 6 %, 48 / 162; P. 0. 05). However, there were significant differences between the groups in the distribution of species isolated and the genotypes of the C. albicans isolates. C. albicans was isolated from 97. 8 % of the Candida-positive subjects in the dyspeptic group, but from only 56. 3 % in the healthy group (P, 0. 001). DST 1593 was the dominant C. albicans genotype from the digestive tract of the dyspeptic group (60 %, 27 / 45), but not the healthy group (14. 8 %, 4 / 27) (P, 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction. Today {{during the}} study of the {{development}} mechanisms of any somatic disease possible participation of the microorganism as trigger factor or its influence on the course of the disease or development of complications is considered. Microflora participation in the etiopathogenesis of noninfectious diseases allows to divide the latest into the following groups: Naturally, the first aspects of {{the study of the}} role of microorganisms in the development of noninfectious diseases are pathological processes developing in the organs and systems of the body, which are natural biotope, particularly gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance in the functioning of the macroorganism (stress, poor diet) causes changes in the composition of endogenous microcenosis and therefore dysbiosis. Thus changes in the hormonal homeostasis, immunoreactivity, in the hypothalamic-adrenal system, speed of peristalsis of the intestines are observed, the overgrowth syndrome in the small intestine developes. A classic disease of a group of diseases that are accompanied by the development of erosive conditions are Helicobacter pylori - associated <b>ulcerous</b> <b>disease</b> of 12 duodenal ulcer. Diseases of the colon digestive canal can be divided into 2 groups - ulcerative colitis and tumors. Escherichia are the main representatives of facultative anaerobic microflora of the colon and are involved in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis and cancer. Material and methods. A study in order to compare the inducing impact of Escherichia lipopolysaccharide isolated from patients with nonspecific ulcerative colitis (NUC, N = 38), Crohn's disease (CD, N = 30) and colon cancer (CC, N = 38), on the humoral and cellular (cytokine) links of immunity in ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. From the patients in both study groups and individuals from the control group E. coli were isolated from fecal for obtainining LPS. Synthesis induction of TNFα, IL. - 8 and IL. - 10 was conducted by lipopolysaccharide of own and intact E. coli and isolates from control persons. Results and discussion. LPS isolated from E. coli strains isolated from patients with different clinical groups showed varying effects on the immune response. It was established that cytokines are produced to stimulation by antigens of own microflora more active than by the intact lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, it is typical for both proinflammatory and problastomic cytokines. The highest activity was found in lipopolysaccharide bacteria isolated in patients with Crohn's disease, for the pathogenesis of which immunopathological component was proved and which can accordingly cause certain features of the disease. Trigger factors for developing reactive arthritis (ReA) microorganisms with obligate (Chlamydia, some viruses) or optional (Yersinia, Shigella, mycoplasma, Campylobacteria, salmonella) parasitism are considered to be. Research of subpopulation spectrum of blood lymphocytes of 20 persons with ReA was conducted. Slight decrease in absolute quantity of natural killers was registered. Thus, the relative index CD 16 + 56 + in patients with ReA was 11, 8 ± 1, 21...|$|R
