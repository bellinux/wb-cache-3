5|$|During World War II, Connecticut Wing {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in coastal patrol and anti-submarine missions along its section of the Atlantic coast. For this, it received two air medals from the U.S. government. Connecticut Wing also flew <b>recovery</b> <b>operations</b> to rescue American pilots who had lost their aircraft domestically.

5|$|<b>Recovery</b> <b>operations</b> began {{immediately}} {{when the}} grounding was first {{reported by the}} ship's crew. Several factors combined to severely complicate the operation. A Unified Command for the operation, consisting of representatives from the Coast Guard, the State of Oregon, and rescue party operations, was quickly established.|$|E

5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold <b>recovery</b> <b>operations</b> continued. The {{final stage}} to recover loose gold was to {{prospect}} for gold that had slowly washed {{down into the}} flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, and {{it is estimated that}} more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{reported}} as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1. The major {{concern with the}} weather was a major tropical storm in the Atlantic, though there were also worries over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which could pose a problem for <b>recovery</b> <b>operations.</b> On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|E

40|$|Quantum error {{correction}} (QEC) {{is an essential}} element of physical quantum information processing systems. Most QEC efforts focus on extending classical {{error correction}} schemes to the quantum regime. The input to a noisy system is embedded in a coded subspace, and error recovery is performed via an operation designed to perfectly correct for a set of errors, presumably a large subset of the physical noise process. In this paper, we examine the choice of <b>recovery</b> <b>operation.</b> Rather than seeking perfect correction on a subset of errors, we seek a <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> to maximize the entanglement fidelity for a given input state and noise model. In this way, the <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> is optimum for the given encoding and noise process. This optimization is shown to be calculable via a semidefinite program (SDP), a well-established form of convex optimization with efficient algorithms for its solution. The error <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> may also be interpreted as a combining operation following a quantum spreading channel, thus providing a quantum analogy to the classical diversity combining operation.

5|$|The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) is an Australian {{government}} agency {{which was established}} on 30 March 2014 to coordinate search and <b>recovery</b> <b>operations</b> for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on 8 March 2014 and was soon thereafter determined to have ended in the Southern Indian Ocean, within Australia's concurrent aeronautical and maritime search and rescue regions. The JACC is an agency within Australia's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, headed by Judith Zielke. It does not perform any search, recovery, or investigation activities, but coordinates the search effort {{and serves as a}} primary point of contact for information about the search for media and families of Flight 370 passengers.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, the Royal Navy {{conducted}} <b>recovery</b> <b>operations.</b> The first {{pieces of}} wreckage were discovered on 12 February 1954 {{and the search}} continued until September 1954, by which time 70 percent by weight of the main structure, 80 percent of the power section, and 50 percent of the aircraft's systems and equipment had been recovered. The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March, Australia {{took control}} for {{co-ordinating}} search, rescue, and <b>recovery</b> <b>operations.</b> For the following six weeks, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and ATSB worked {{to determine the}} search area, correlating information with the JIT and other government and academic sources, while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) coordinated the search efforts. Following the fourth phase of the search, the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area. In May, the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00:19 UTC (08:19 MYT) satellite transmission. The group included aircraft and satellite experts from: Air Accidents Investigation Branch (UK), Boeing (US), Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia), Department of Civil Aviation (Malaysia), Inmarsat (UK), National Transportation Safety Board (US), and Thales (UK).|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and <b>recovery</b> <b>operations.</b> The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in United States history.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for <b>recovery</b> <b>operations.</b> Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E
