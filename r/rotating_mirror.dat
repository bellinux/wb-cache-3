5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror,</b> but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror.</b> Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> R {{will have}} moved {{slightly}} {{in the time it}} takes for the light to bounce from R to M and back, the light will be deflected away from the original source by a small angle.|$|E

25|$|Léon Foucault {{carried out}} an {{experiment}} which used <b>rotating</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{to obtain a}} value of 298,000,000m/s in 1862. Albert A. Michelson conducted experiments on {{the speed of light}} from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved <b>rotating</b> <b>mirrors</b> to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from Mount Wilson to Mount San Antonio in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000m/s.|$|R

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> R as close as {{possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
50|$|As well {{as having}} {{important}} applications for scientific research, the earliest inventions received immediate popular success as methods for producing moving pictures, and the principle {{was used for}} numerous toys. Other early pioneers employed <b>rotating</b> <b>mirrors,</b> or vibrating mirrors known as mirror galvanometers.|$|R
500|$|In 1887, Vogel and Scheiner {{discovered}} the annual Doppler effect, the yearly {{change in the}} Doppler shift of stars located near the ecliptic due to the orbital velocity of the Earth.

40|$|Dr. Jesse W. Beams {{developed}} the first practical magnetic suspension for high speed rotating devices. The devices included high speed <b>rotating</b> <b>mirrors,</b> ultracentrifuges, and high speed centrifugal field rotors. A brief biography of Dr. Beams is presented, {{and the following}} topics are discussed: (1) early axial magnetic suspension for ultracentrifuges; and (2) magnetic suspension for high centrifugal fields...|$|R
5|$|Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made {{multiple}} {{measurements of}} the speed of light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring the speed of light. Michelson's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault's original arrangement. As seen in Figure5, Michelson placed the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> R near the principal focus of lens L (i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> R were exactly at the principal focus, the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens (150feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115mm. His 1879 figure for the speed of light, 299944±51km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements {{such as the use of}} polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4km/s was only about 4km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson's final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F.G.Pease and F.Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement.|$|E
25|$|This IFV variant is {{essentially}} a Fahd 240, fitted with a dual-weapon turret that has a 12.7mm machine gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. The addition of a turret requires a third crewman, the gunner, {{but it does not}} affect the Fahd 240's passenger capacity. The turret is the French BTM-208 turret, produced under license from the French SAMM company. It is air-tight, and provides NBC protection. It incorporates and aiming telescopic periscope, forward–observation, <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> periscope in co-axial alignment with weapons, and five or six bullet-proof glass ports insuring all-round vision and ballistic protection. 200 rounds are provided for the 7.62mm machine gun, and another 100 for the 12.7mm machine gun. Elevation limits are -8 and +45, the turret provides 360 degrees of traversion for the weapons. The vehicle has a rotating seat, and an armored hatch for the turret. The machine guns can be fired by means of a foot pedal, freeing the gunner's hands. A central console groups control switches and warning lights governing weapon selection. The addition of a turret increases the vehicle height to 2.85 meters.|$|E
500|$|Guided {{by similar}} motivations as his former partner, Foucault in 1850 was more {{interested}} in settling the particle-versus-wave debate than in determining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light. Foucault measured the differential speed of light through air versus water by inserting a tube filled with water between the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> and the distant mirror. His experimental results, announced shortly before Fizeau announced his results on the same topic, were viewed as [...] "driving the last nail in the coffin" [...] of Newton's corpuscle theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air. Newton had explained refraction as a pull of the medium upon the light, implying an increased speed of light in the medium. The corpuscular theory of light went into abeyance, completely overshadowed by wave theory. This state of affairs lasted until 1905, when Einstein presented heuristic arguments that under various circumstances, such as when considering the photoelectric effect, light exhibits behaviors indicative of a particle nature.|$|E

5000|$|Commercial {{availability}} of {{both types of}} <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> cameras began in the 1950s with Beckman & Whitley, and Cordin Company.

50|$|<b>Rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> camera {{technology}} has more recently {{been applied to}} electronic imaging, where instead of film, an array of single shot CCD or CMOS cameras is arrayed around the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror.</b> This adaptation enables all {{of the advantages of}} electronic imaging in combination with the speed and resolution of the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> approach. Speeds up to 25 million frames per second are achievable, with typical speeds in the millions of fps.|$|E
50|$|In pure <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> cameras, film is held {{stationary}} {{in an arc}} centered about a <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror.</b> The image {{formed by}} the objective lens is relayed back to the <b>rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> from a primary lens or lens group, and then through a secondary relay lens (or more typically lens group) which relays the image from the mirror to the film. For each frame formed on the film, one secondary lens group is required. As such, these cameras typically do not record {{more than one hundred}} frames. This means they record for only a very short time - typically less than a millisecond. Therefore, they require specialized timing and illumination equipment. <b>Rotating</b> <b>mirror</b> cameras are capable of up to 25 million frames per second, with typical speed in the millions of fps.|$|E
