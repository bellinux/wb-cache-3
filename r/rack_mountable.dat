5000|$|The CMX-5000, {{released}} in March 2000, was Pioneer's {{first attempt to}} enter the 19" [...] <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> dual CD player-market (though, with an optional installation bracket, it had previously been possible to install two CDJ-500S-players side by side into an industry standard rack) {{that had previously been}} dominated by Denon.|$|E
5000|$|... 9000 Professional Series: A {{series of}} stack-able, or <b>rack</b> <b>mountable,</b> units {{included}} the SE-9060 Amp, SU-9070 Pre-Amp, SH-9010 Equalizer, SH-9020 Meter Unit and ST-9030 Tuner. These [...] "Pro Series" [...] components replaced the earlier SE-9600 Amp, SU-9700 Pre-Amp and ST-9300/9600/9700 Tuner that were deemed too large. The 9000 Pro Series was introduced because {{of demand for}} smaller, quality components. The European version of the Pro Series had a different faceplate than the US version: 18" [...] vs. 19". Because of the narrower faceplate, the European version required special rack brackets to be <b>rack</b> <b>mountable.</b> The brackets came with the European version of the SH-905ST Professional Series rack. The only difference between this rack and the US version was inclusion of those brackets. As a result, the brackets are ultra rare and even the rack was sold in limited numbers in the USA.|$|E
5000|$|The A9home was {{the retail}} {{version of the}} A9, for OEM {{customers}} was the A9 also available in a half-width single rack unit (1U) <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> ruggedised case, [...] "A9RM" [...] and as a wall/bulkhead-mountable unit with integral 8.4" [...] TFT touchscreen, GPS and GSM/GPRS, [...] "A9Loc".

50|$|Equipment {{designed}} {{to be placed in}} a rack is typically described as rack-mount, rack-mount instrument, a rack mounted system, a rack mount chassis, subrack, <b>rack</b> <b>mountable,</b> or occasionally simply shelf. The height of the electronic modules is also standardized as multiples of 1.752 in or one rack unit or U (less commonly RU). The industry standard rack cabinet is 42U tall.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>mountable</b> power {{amplifiers}} were {{the genesis of}} the company. Early customers such as Metallica, Steve Lukather, Alice In Chains, Anthrax (American band) and Megadeth, helped solidify the company as one of the pioneers of the rack revolution. Fryette power amps constantly evolve and their success continues with two current models, the EL34 powered Two/Fifty/Two & the KT88 powered Two/Ninety/Two.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{brain was}} {{introduced}} in 1986 called the SDS-1000, and was, in effect, the same sounds as the SDS-9 (without the ability to change the EPROMS) in a slim 1U, MIDI-enabled, <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> unit. The snare sounds, however, are more realistic and clear than the SDS-9. The SDS-1000 also includes a [...] "second skin" [...] feature, which simulates the sound of dual-headed drums.|$|E
5000|$|This server {{family has}} {{undergone}} several model revisions in its lifetime since 1999. Initially, the servers were standalone—physically the configuration resembled a rack {{and took up}} a somewhat larger footprint than a rack (Models 100, 130, 200, 230, 550, 400). Second and third generation ES7000s were <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> cells 4U or 3U high that fit in standard 19" [...] racks.|$|E

The DNxcel card also adds real-time SD down-convert and HD cross-convert.|$|E
50|$|Rack-mountable {{equipment}} is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack. Within the IT industry, {{it is common}} for network/communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions, including table-top and wall mounting, so <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> equipment will often feature L-brackets that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a 19-inch rack. With the prevalence of 23-inch racks in the Telecoms industry, the same practice is also common, but with equipment having 19-inch and 23-inch brackets available, enabling them to be mounted in existing racks.|$|E
50|$|The NetLinx {{controllers}} are <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> devices which run {{a version}} of VxWorks and integrate both a processor and device controllers and are typically utilized for audio-visual control systems. An example is the mid-range NetLinx Integrated NI-2100 controller which has 3 RS-232/RS-485 serial ports, 4 relays, 4 infrared/serial ports and 4 input/outputs. Serial ports can send and receive strings, typically ASCII instructions and replies. Relays permit switching of modest currents. IR ports can send infrared signals which emulate typical remote control devices that control (for instance) televisions and video recorders. Input/output ports detect contact closures.|$|E
5000|$|The MEP-7000 is Pioneer's {{addition}} to their product range for professional DJs released in late 2007. At The 2008 NAMM Show The MEP-7000 was featured along with Pioneer's DJM-3000 19" [...] rackmount DJ mixer. In Australia, the DJM-3000 had been discontinued for sale in late 2006 but was re-released in June 2008 just for the MEP-7000. The player is a 19" [...] <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> twin player type capable of playing media formats ranging from normal audio CD/CD-R/CD-RW to digital data files in MP3- and AAC-formats written on DVD's as well as USB-connected memorysticks and/or portable hard drives.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 {{he started}} working for McCune Sound Service. McCune was {{interested}} in building reliable transportable sound systems. While at McCune John first realized his idea of a fully integrated loudspeaker system. The system was built for Creedence Clearwater Revival's last tour. It was a fully integrated tri-amped, horn-loaded system with processing electronics. Three amps were built into a <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> enclosure that would drive two speakers. The enclosure also included preset cross-overs and equalization. The outside of the enclosure was simple: an AC cord, input connectors, and 4-pin connectors that plugged into the loudspeakers. The original model did not have level controls or a power switch.|$|E
5000|$|The Juniper EX2200-C is a compact, affordable, {{and energy}} {{efficient}} switch in a 1 U high and 10.8 inch wide formfactor. The EX2200-C {{does not have}} dual redundant power supplies nor does it have fans and instead the small unit stays cool with a heat sink that sits {{on the back of}} the unit. Even the PoE version is fanless. The EX2200-C is a small 19" [...] <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> (using optional brackets) or desktop switch with 12 gigabit ports with a choice of PoE or non-PoE. The switch also has 2 SFP uplink ports for virtual chassis (stacking), link aggregation or as uplinks to aggregation switches. The EX2200-C has a data rate of 28 Gbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The SNC {{software}} {{requires a}} computer processor {{to execute the}} code. This would usually be Personal Computer (PC) type hardware, either running Windows XP or Linux operating systems. The SNC software is written in Ada 95 and is easily portable to other platforms {{as long as there}} is an Ada 95 compliant compiler available on the platform. The computer does not require significant processor power and any available current technology processor is sufficient. As a guide, a 1 GHz processor with one GByte of memory is more than adequate. The processor needs to support at least one Ethernet connection (preferably 100 Mbit/s) but, depending on the configuration, two may be required. The processor requires some storage for the operating system, the SNC executable and the TOD interface software. Possible configurations include a VME backplane enclosure with power supply and a VME processor card, or a <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> industrial PC.|$|E
50|$|An SPC is {{required}} for each network/media that the unit {{is required}} to operate on. A single SPC may be configured to use different media. An SPC hardware unit may contain more than one SPC. At the time this book was written, there were three manufacturers of SPCs, which all supported HF and UHF Fixed Frequency media. In 2015 one SPC manufacturer discontinued its product, so two SPC manufacturers remained. Frequency hopping media is also supported either within a separate SPC or embedded within a frequency hopping radio. The fixed frequency HF and UHF SPCs were available in 19” <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> chassis, with two of them containing VME cards which could be mounted in a suitably configured VME backplane.Radio frequency and power control by the SPC is optional. Refer to the SPC manufacturers’ specifications to determine the options that are available with the supported radios.|$|E
50|$|A single LLC {{can handle}} {{multiple}} networks {{depending on the}} type of media. The system can use a maximum of four LLCs which would be one LLC per network, but this would be an unusual configuration. A typical system will employ one LLC when up to four HF, or two UHF or one UHF and three HF networks are deployed. If more than two UHF Networks are deployed, two LLCs are needed. Associated with the LLC and its key loading, a Data Terminal Device (DTD), which is used to load the keys into the LLC, would need to be acquired from the national crypto agency. Depending on the method of key distribution employed, a paper tape reader KOI-18 may also be required. It is possible to distribute encrypted keys as PC files, in which case a special serial cable would be required to load the file from a PC into the DTD.The current LLC is a 19” <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> unit. The manufacturer refers to the LLC as the KIV-21/LLC.|$|E
5000|$|The CMX-3000 was Pioneer's second {{attempt to}} enter the market of {{rack-mountable}} dual deck CD-players. Released {{in the wake of}} the CDJ-1000, the player was - and still is - often mistakenly advertised as a 19" [...] inch <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> equivalent of dual CDJ-1000's even though the intended target audiences for the products, as well as their comparative pricing, were entirely in different leagues. The misconception is possibly caused by the fact that while Pioneer's earlier dual deck CD-player, the CMX-5000, only had a jog wheel comparable to earlier single deck CD-players for doing pitch bending, the CMX-3000 also allowed distinct jog mode that enabled the user to use the jog wheel for scratching, a feature that thus far was only available on the top-of-the line CDJ-1000. The jog wheel however relies upon the movement of the wheel itself and is not touch sensitive as it is on the CDJ-1000, CDJ-800 and CDJ-400. Therefore, the scratch is intended as an effect or for cueing a track, and is not appropriate for stopping the track by touch as it is on the other CDJ models.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Corelatus is a startup {{founded by}} Thomas Lange, Matthias L ang and Ulf Svarte Bagge {{approximately}} one year ago. We build hardware {{for use in}} telecommunications networks. This paper looks at our experiences using Erlang in a stand-alone system which terminates SS 7 MTP 2 and passes packets to a general-purpose server for further processing. Erlang was used throughout the project: from when {{it was just an}} idea to when it became a certified, tested, approved and mass-produced product suitable for placement in the core of an operator's SS 7 network. 2 The Concept Our concept was to build a stand-alone box to handle the parts of a telecommunications system which are difficult or expensive to implement using general-purpose computers. This would enable software developers to build complete systems by combining our hardware with ordinary server hardware. The most important features are: Carrier-grade hardware: a <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> chassis, dua...|$|E
40|$|Spellman’s CZE 1000 R {{is a full}} feature <b>rack</b> <b>mountable</b> {{high voltage}} power supply ideal for {{laboratory}} usage. It’s designed {{to meet the needs of}} applications requiring a hot switched reversible output voltage. The output polarity can be quickly and safely reversed via a front panel switch. Both the output voltage and current are fully adjustable from 0 to 30 kV and 0 to 300 uA via front panel ten turn locking counting dials. Remote control operation is done by 0 to + 10 Vdc programming signals; either user generated or using the provided + 10 Vdc reference and external potentiometers. Front panel voltage and current meters provide local monitoring. Voltage and current test points are provided such that 0 to 10 Vdc corresponds to 0 to 100 % rated output. A two position, normally closed, external interlock is provided for protection of external high voltage accessible areas. If the interlock is opened the high voltage will shut off and fall to zero in less than one second and not be able to be re-energized until the interlock is closed. Excellent load and line regulation specifications along with outstanding stability and low ripple of the CZE 1000 R assure a stable high voltage output for consistent process results...|$|E
