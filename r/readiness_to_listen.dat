6000|$|The {{conscience}} of the young soldier reproached him, {{when he saw the}} whole tribe accompanying his party to the margin of the stream, with unarmed hands and sorrowful countenances. They gathered in a circle around the strangers and their chief, and became not only peaceful, but highly interested observers of what was passing. As it was evident that Hard-Heart intended to speak, the former stopped, and manifested their <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> the trapper performing the office of interpreter. Then the young chief addressed his people, in the usual metaphorical language of an Indian. He commenced by alluding to the antiquity and renown of his own nation. He spoke of their successes in the hunts and on the war-path; of {{the manner in which they}} had always known how to defend their rights and to chastise their enemies. After he had said enough to manifest his respect for the greatness of the Loups, and to satisfy the pride of the listeners, he made a sudden transition to the race of whom the strangers were members. He compared their countless numbers to the flights of migratory birds in the season of blossoms, or in the fall of the year. With a delicacy, that none know better how to practise than an Indian warrior, he made no direct mention of the rapacious temper, that so many of them had betrayed, in their dealings with the Red-men. Feeling that the sentiment of distrust was strongly engrafted in the tempers of his tribe, he rather endeavoured to soothe any just resentment they might entertain, by indirect excuses and apologies. He reminded the listeners that even the Pawnee Loups had been obliged to chase many unworthy individuals from their villages. The Wahcondah sometimes veiled his countenance from a Red-man. No doubt the Great Spirit of the Pale-faces often looked darkly on his children. Such as were abandoned to the worker of evil could never be brave or virtuous, let the colour of the skin be what it might. He bade his young men look at the hands of the Big-knives. They were not empty, like those of hungry beggars. Neither were they filled with goods, like those of knavish traders. They were, like themselves, warriors, and they carried arms which they knew well how to use--they were worthy to be called brothers! ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Using cohort data nested in a {{randomized}} trial conducted in Cameroon, this study aimed to investigate time trends and predictors of the susceptibility to transmitting HIV {{during the first}} 24 months of treatment. Methods: The outcome, susceptibility to transmitting HIV, was defined as reporting inconsistent condom use and experiencing incomplete virological suppression. Mixed logistic regressions were performed to identify predictors of this outcome among 250 patients reporting to have had sexual relationships either with HIV-negative or unknown HIV status partner(s). Results: Despite an initial decrease from 76 % at M 0 to 50 % at M 6, the rate of inconsistent condom use significantly increased from M 12 (59 %) to M 24 (66 %) (p = 0. 017). However, the proportion of patients susceptible to transmitting HIV significantly decreased over follow-up from 76 % at M 0, to 50 % at M 6, 31 % at M 12 and 27 % at M 24 (p, 0. 001).

40|$|Travelling {{away from}} the “artsy post-modern lefty-pinko university”. Noor's transcultural {{experience}} and {{the duties of the}} intellectual. The volume Qur'an and cricket consists of several travelogues produced by a Malay intellectual, Farish A. Noor, during his trips to the most problematic places of the world, marked by the contemporary “battles of God”. This book is interpreted in terms of a quest for transcultural condition understood as a dimension of experience transcending the multiplicity of cultural orders in dissent. Noor sketches his own definition of the intellectual, contrasted in this article with the visions given by Gramsci, Adorno and Said. The subject of the transcultural condition is defined as “itinerant scholar” transgressing the limitations of the academia by his nomadic immersion in the world. The attitude of the traveller is marked by openness and <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> even if he is confronted to irrational mumbling. Precisely the mumbling of anger and hate becomes the most difficult challenge to the intellectual unable to deal with it rationally. The only remaining answer is a sheer presence and love, emotional attachment to the world, as the scholar rejects the temptation of the ivory tower that would isolate him from the otherness. The modality of speech that opposes the hateful mumbling isn't based on clear, persuasive argumentation, but on ironic ambivalence conjugated with directness and the rejection of euphemism. Most importantly, the “itinerant scholar” is not a preacher. In opposition to the leftist tradition of defining the intellectual as a secular figure, the “itinerant scholar” remains deeply immersed in religion. The challenge of building up the transcultural dimension is connected to the necessity of finding a place for the authentic religious experience in times of “battles of God”.

40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Listening</b> <b>to</b> {{music can}} have {{powerful}} physiological and therapeutic effects. Some essential {{features of the}} mental mechanism underlying beneficial effects of music are probably strong physiological and emotional associations with music created during the act of music making. Here we tested this hypothesis in a clinical population of polydrug abusers in rehabilitation <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a previously performed act of physiologically and emotionally intense music making. Methods: Psychological effects of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> self-made music that was created in a previous musical feedback intervention were assessed. In this procedure, participants produced music with exercise machines (Jymmin) which modulate musical sounds. Results: The data showed a positive effect of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the recording of joint music making on self-efficacy, mood, and a <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> engage socially. Furthermore, the data showed the powerful influence of context on how the recording evoked psychological benefits. The effects of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the self-made music were only observable when participants <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> their own performance first; <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a control music piece first caused effects to deteriorate. We observed {{a positive correlation between}} participants' mood and their desire to engage in social activities with their former training partners after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the self-made music. This shows that the observed effects of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the recording of the single musical feedback intervention are influenced by participants recapitulating intense pleasant social interactions during the Jymmin intervention. Conclusions: <b>Listening</b> <b>to</b> music that was the outcome of a previous musical feedback (Jymmin) intervention has beneficial psychological and probably social effects in patients that had suffered from polydrug addiction, increasing self-efficacy, mood, and a <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> engage socially.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to increase understanding of child and parent <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change in obese youth by examining how these constructs are related to demographic variables, as well as to psychosocial functioning, in a sample of obese youth presenting for weight- management treatment. A secondary aim was to examine consistency between parent and child <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. Two hundred twenty-eight 7 - to 17 -year-old children and their parents participated during the child’s initial assessment at a multidisciplinary weight-management clinic. Demographic variables included in analyses were child Body Mass Index, parent Body Mass Index, child age, child gender, child race, and family income. Children completed measures of quality of life, depression, social anxiety, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. Parents completed assessments of children’s quality of life, children’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and parents’ own <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. The child’s Body Mass Index was significantly related to both parent and child <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change.

In an underserved population, the readiness scores were analyzed in relationship to the patient's interest in communicating with healthcare providers about health behavior change. Healthcare providers are important contributors in promoting behavior change in community health centers. Methods Patients completed questionnaires about communicating with healthcare providers and <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change physical activity, intake of fruits and vegetables, dietary fat, calories and weight management.

40|$|In {{any given}} year, {{approximately}} 25 million Canadians aged 15 {{years and older}} {{are at risk for}} developing an eating disorder (ED). Eating disorders (EDs) have the highest mortality rate among all mental disorders and patients {{have been found to be}} ambivalent to change. Thus, recent attention has been given to interventions focusing on enhancing patients’ <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. To that end, the two-fold purpose of this scoping review was to: (1) ascertain if MI and/or adapted MI improved ED patients’ <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change, and (2) examine the effectiveness of MI and adapted MI on improving eating pathology. Ten studies were included in this review based on the inclusion criteria.

A secondary purpose was to further investigate {{the construct validity of}} the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA; McConnaughy, Prochaska, & Velicer, 1983), a frequently used measure of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. A sample of 63 male alcoholics and their female partners received up to 20 sessions of cognitive-behavioral or family-systems therapy for alcoholism {{as part of a larger}} treatment project. The three main construct variables were assessed at baseline (T 1) and after the first 12 sessions of therapy (T 2) by observational ratings (DWI) and self-report questionnaires (disease-model beliefs and <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change). Due to a high rate of attrition from measurement at T 2, analyses involving data, collected at this point must be interpreted with caution. As predicted, T 1 ratings of DWI were negatively associated with alcoholics' <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change measured concurrently at T 1 and also longitudinally at T 2. Also as predicted, this relationship was found primarily with the wife-demand/husband-withdraw DWI role pattern; the opposite husband-demand/wife-withdraw role pattern was largely unrelated <b>to</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. Multiple regression analyses in a panel design indicated no clear causal direction in the lagged correlations between DWI and <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. Although female partners believed more strongly in the disease model of alcoholism than did alcoholics both at T 1 and at T 2, neither partners' nor alcoholics' disease-model beliefs were related <b>to</b> <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change or to DWI. Finally, regarding the construct validity of the URICA, while mean levels of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change increased significantly over the course of treatment, T 1 and T 2 measures of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change were only mildly [...] -and somewhat inconsistently [...] -associated with treatment outcome.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: <b>Readiness</b> <b>to</b> {{quit smoking}} - {{a pattern of}} attitudes, intentions, and {{behaviors}} that reflect a likelihood of engaging in cessation activities—is a useful heuristic for understanding smoking disparities based on sexual orientation. This study examined demographic, tobacco-use patterns, psychosocial and cognitive factors associated with <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> quit among gay and bisexual male smokers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted {{as part of a}} larger Tobacco Elimination and Control Collaboration (Q-TECC) initiative in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. <b>Readiness</b> <b>to</b> quit was measured by a composite score created from four variables (motivation to quit, importance of quitting, plan to quit, and confidence in quitting) (alpha=. 87, M= 3. 42, SD=. 96, range 1 - 5). Results: The sexual minority smokers in the sample (N= 208; M= 33 years) were racially/ethnically diverse. Latino men had significantly lower levels of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> quit compared to African American and White men. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to explore the relative contributions of sociodemographic, tobacco-use patterns, psychosocial and cognitive factors on <b>Readiness</b> <b>to</b> Quit. In the final model, the following variables were associated with <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> quit scores: Latino ethnicity, fewer quit attempts, positive expectancies for the beneficial effects of smoking, and lower perceived importance of smoking as an important LGBT health issue. None of the psychosocial factors were associated with <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> quit.

There is growing literature on possible ways of reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol -related harm among university students (Larimer and Cronce, 2002; Siegers and Carey, 2010). However, interventions with this aim {{might be made}} more effective by information on students' <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change their drinking behaviour (Carey et al., 2007 a), where an assessment of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change might influence the kind of approach that is thought {{most likely to be}} successful. For example, it has been found that <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change moderated the effects of a brief intervention among heavy-drinking students (either brief motivational intervention or alcohol expectancy challenge) such that high <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change made an expectancy challenge relatively more effective in reducing drinking (Capone and Wood, 2009). This study also reported an association between higher <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change and greater reductions in alcohol consumption in the overall sample, thus supporting previous findings (Fromme and Corbin, 2004; Carey et al., 2007 b). Although high <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change may increase the chances of successful brief intervention among heavy-drinking students, it has been found that, even among individuals referred to a university-based alcohol intervention programme, there was limited acknowledgement of a drinking problem or interest in changing behaviour (Caldwell, 2002; Vik et al., 2000). Such research has been conducted mainly in the USA and, {{with the exception of one}} study (Hosier, 2001), it is unknown whether a comparable lack of concern about heavy drinking is true of students in England. Moreover, there is limited understanding of the different factors associated with, and predictive of, <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change in heavy-drinking students.

40|$|Early Development Instrument (EDI) is a {{relatively}} new tool, developed at the Canadian Centre for Studies of Children at Risk at McMaster University <b>to</b> assess <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> learn at school among 5 -year-old children, prior to their entry to Grade 1 (Janus & Offord 2000). <b>Readiness</b> <b>to</b> learn at school is defined as a child’s ability to meet the task demands of school, such as being cooperative, sitting quietly and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the teacher, and to benefit from the educational activities that are offered by the school (Doherty 1996). The key domains included in the measure are: physical health and well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive development, and communications skills/general knowledge. Teachers are the only informants and therefore it is imperative to establish the inter-rater reliability of the instrument. Moreover, additional data from other informants (child-care providers, parents, and children themselves) allow to identify correlates of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> learn outcomes. This study was carried out in six child care centres in Calgary, with the total of 51 families. Kindergarten teacher, child-care teacher, and parent completed the EDI. Parents were als...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} expand our {{understanding}} of individual <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change and its antecedents. Individual <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change is explored and measured as a three dimensional attitudinal construct. Antecedents to change are explored including both the objective and subjective context of change. ^ Participants were faculty members at a university in the northeast part of the U. S. who were scheduled to use E-Campus, an internet-based portal application designed {{to assist them in}} managing their courses including grade submission, class rosters and access to student specific information. Data were collected using a mailed questionnaire. ^ The results indicated no relationship between objective and subjective contexts as posited, but it did identify positive relationships between perceived work setting for change and both perceived organizational support and organizational membership <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. Furthermore, the research results also indicated a positive relationship between perceived organizational support and both the cognitive and behavioral intention dimensions of individual readiness, while perceived organizational membership <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change had a positive relationship with the affective dimension of individual <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. A post hoc analysis indicated a direct relationship between perceived work settings for change and the three dimensions of individual readiness. Results emphasize the complexity of individual <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change. Implications for future research and managerial implications are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies show}} a {{positive}} relationship between attitudes towards reconciliation and mental health problems following trauma in victims of violent conflicts. However, these results are limited {{due to a lack of}} validated questionnaires <b>to</b> assess <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconciliation as well as longitudinal studies. Furthermore, preliminary evidence indicates that a participation in a transitional justice mechanism is rather associated with increased psychological distress and less openness for reconciliation, which is contrary to previous assumptions. However, longitudinal studies to allow drawing reliable conclusions about the effects of such mechanisms are still missing. The aim of the present work was therefore to develop and psychometrically test a questionnaire for measuring <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconciliation. A further aim was to examine the relationship between <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconciliation and mental health. In addition, the course and potential predictors of changes in <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile and posttraumatic stress disorder in the context of participation in a transitional justice mechanism were investigated. In a first step, the new developed <b>Readiness</b> <b>to</b> Reconcile Inventory (RRI) was pilot-tested in a sample of Kurdish refugees (N = 60; Article 2). In a follow-up study, the RRI was psychometrically tested among survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime, who applied to become civil parties at the Khmer Rouge tribunal (N = 247), and 830 survivors who did not participate in the tribunal using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (Article 3). As a last step, 215 civil party applicants were interviewed in a longitudinal study assessing changes in <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconciliation and PTSD-symptoms during the tribunal’s first case (Article 4). In both samples (Kurdish refugees and survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime), the RRI showed a 3 -factorial structure (1. openness to interactions, 2. absence of feelings of revenge, 3. differentiation ability), which was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. In all studies, the RRI showed good internal consistencies. Correlational and regression analysis revealed positive relationships regarding <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile and mental health in the different studies, however most of them did not reach significance. In the longitudinal study (Article 4), multilevel analysis revealed that <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile increased slightly in the course of the tribunal, whereas PTSD did not change over time. Intraindividual changes in <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile were significantly positively associated with intraindividual changes in PTSD. Predictors of increased <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile were female gender, higher levels of education and knowledge of the sentence passed in the tribunal’s first case. Merely a higher number of traumatic event types experienced between the two assessments predicted increased PTSD. The results indicate that the RRI is a reliable instrument <b>to</b> assess <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile in victims of violent conflicts, also demonstrating evidence for its construct validity. The results regarding the assumed positive association between <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile and mental health are ambiguous. Moreover, the results underpin existing doubts on the positive effects of transitional justice mechanisms on coping with the traumatic experiences and <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reconcile on the participants. The results also indicate the importance of keeping the participants informed about the process...|$|R

40|$|Objective: <b>To</b> {{determine}} <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change {{dietary intake}} of fat, physical exercise and smoking, using a classification {{based on the}} stages of change model, among patients in a primary care population selected to have greater than normal risk of coronary heart disease. Methods: We recruited 883 patients from general practices {{in the south of}} England who had {{one or more of the}} following cardiovascular risk factors: Current cigarette smoking, total cholesterol level 6. 5 - 9. 0 mmol/l and a body mass index of 25 - 35 kg/m 2 coupled with a lack of regular physical exercise. Measures of cardiovascular risk factors were obtained, together with questionnaire measures of stage of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change smoking behaviour, dietary intake of fat and level of physical exercise. Results: Patients with high cholesterol levels had a different degree of <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> reduce dietary fat from that of those with low cholesterol levels. Patients who were overweight and inactive reported a greater <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> increase their physical activity than did those who were not overweight and not inactive. <b>Readiness</b> <b>to</b> change any of the three behaviours was not affected by the presence of more than one modifiable risk factor. However, patients who were contemplating or preparing to stop smoking were also more ready to increase physical activity than were those who were not considering stopping smoking. Conclusions: Risk classification has an impact upon patients' <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change modifiable cardiovascular risk behaviours. The relationships between <b>readiness</b> <b>to</b> change various behaviours suggest that there are synergies in counselling strategies and methods of identifying patients who might be especially responsive...|$|R
