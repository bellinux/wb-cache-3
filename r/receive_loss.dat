40|$|On {{behalf of}} the ADDITION Cambridge study group A {{randomized}} controlled trial in two general practices in Cambridgeshire compared the effect of loss and gain framed messages in an invitation to screening for type 2 diabetes on uptake and subsequent anxiety and self-rated health. High risk individuals aged 40 – 6 years were randomized to <b>receive</b> <b>loss</b> (n = 57) or gain (n = 5) framed screening invitations. A postal questionnaire was sent to all participants, including non-attenders, after six weeks. There {{were no significant differences}} in attendance, mean state anxiety, self-rated health or illness representation between the loss and gain frame arms. Framing of information in diabetes screening invitations does not influence uptake...|$|E
40|$|The Bayesian {{framework}} is ideally suited for induction problems. The probability of observing x_k at time k, given past observations x_ 1 [...] . x_k- 1 can be computed with Bayes' rule if the true distribution μ of the sequences x_ 1 x_ 2 x_ 3 [...] . is known. The problem, however, {{is that in}} many cases one does not even have a reasonable estimate of the true distribution. In order to overcome this problem a universal distribution ξ is defined as a weighted sum of distributions μ_i∈ M, where M is any countable set of distributions including μ. This is a generalization of Solomonoff induction, in which M is the set of all enumerable semi-measures. Systems which predict y_k, given x_ 1 [...] . x_k- 1 and which <b>receive</b> <b>loss</b> l_x_k y_k if x_k is the true next symbol of the sequence are considered. It is proven that using the universal ξ as a prior is nearly as good as using the unknown true distribution μ. Furthermore, games of chance, defined as a sequence of bets, observations, and rewards are studied. The time needed to reach the winning zone is estimated. Extensions to arbitrary alphabets, partial and delayed prediction, and more active systems are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the neural and behavioural correlates of learning from rewards and losses in children. Greater blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in the ventral striatum (VS) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) were found when participants received rewards compared to when they missed out on an opportunity to receive rewards. In contrast, greater BOLD responses in the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were found when participants <b>received</b> <b>losses</b> compared to when they avoided losing. The BOLD response to rewards in the VS and VMPFC correlated positively with the tendency to select rewards. Greater incidence of early life adversity was associated with greater likelihood to select rewarding stimuli and a larger BOLD response in the VS and VMPFC to rewards.
