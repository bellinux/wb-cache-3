The first organized, but illegal, opposition party was MORENA, the Movement for National Restoration (Mouvement de <b>redressement</b> national). This moderate opposition group sponsored demonstrations by students and academic staff at the Universite Omar Bongo in Libreville in December 1981, when the university was temporarily closed. MORENA accused Bongo of corruption and personal extravagance and of favoring his own Bateke tribe; the group demanded that a multi-party system be restored. Arrests were made in February 1982, when the opposition distributed leaflets criticizing the Bongo regime during a visit by Pope John Paul II. In November [...] 1982, 37 MORENA members were tried and convicted of offenses against state security.

5000|$|Mercier {{was one of}} many wealthy industrialists, {{during the}} latter part of the French Third Republic (1870-1940), who viewed the {{parliamentary}} model of democratic government as a hindrance to the growth of industry, and began to turn his thinking [...] "to the Fascist [...] "experiment" [...] in Italy and to the growing success of the Nazi Party in Germany" [...] (Shirer, William L., The Collapse of the Third Republic, 1969, p. 157). In December 1925, Mercier founded the <b>Redressement</b> Français (literally the [...] "French Resurgence"), a movement under the patronage of Marshal Ferdinand Foch with the goal of [...] "gathering the elite and raising up the masses" [...] (Kuisel 1967, p. 49). This movement had two main objectives: the adoption by France of a [...] "Henry Ford" [...] economic model (high productivity, high salaries, and mass consumption) and the modernization of political life and institutions. Despite his ambitious economic and political ideas, he failed to convince other business leaders (too Malthusian) or politicians to join him. His technocratic, elitist vision - a product of his education at the Polytechnique and influenced by Marshal Lyautey - had some aspects that could then and still can elicit hesitation even though it has now become dominant. The lack of success of his business, his involvement in the events of February 6, 1934, which he described as the victory of the [...] "fighting spirit", and the fall of the national union government of Gaston Doumergue (November 1934) all certainly drove Mercier to dissolve the <b>Redressement</b> Français in 1935. He then ceased to be the spokesman of the Polytechnique modernisers, and that role was passed on to Louis Marlio and to Auguste Detœuf, author of the magazine Nouveaux Cahiers.|$|E

5000|$|The Political Bureau of {{the ruling}} Guinea Democratic Party was due to name its choice as Touré's {{successor}} on 3 April 1984.

Zerbo - {{a military}} veteran, former Minister of Foreign Affairs 1974-1976, commander of the army regiment in the capital Ouagadougou, and head of military intelligence - suspended the constitution, and established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress (Comité Militaire de <b>Redressement</b> pour le Progrès National, CMPRN), a 31-member junta. Several members of the junta were young and radical, among them future presidents Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaoré.

5000|$|In Drieu's {{political}} writings, {{he argued}} that the parliamentary system (the gouvernement d'assemblée of the French Third Republic) was responsible for what he saw as the [...] "decadence" [...] of France (economic crisis, declining birth rates, etc.). In [...] "Le Jeune Européen" [...] ("European Youth", 1927) and [...] "Genève ou Moscou" [...] ("Geneva or Moscow", 1928), Drieu La Rochelle advocated a strong Europe and denounced the [...] "decadent materialism" [...] of democracy. He believed that a federal Europe could bolster a strong economic and political union isolated from the imperialist Russians and Americans; in 1939 he came to believe that only Nazi Germany could deliver such an autarkian promise. His pro-European views expressed in 1928 were soon followed by closer contacts with employers' organizations, among them Ernest Mercier's <b>Redressement</b> Français, and then, {{at the end of the}} 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s, with some currents of the Radical Party.|$|E
50|$|Fearing that defeatism and {{the effects}} of the Nazi {{propaganda}} would lead the federal government to submit to the Germans and give up the traditional democratic values of Switzerland, a group of young people led by Denis de Rougemont and Professor Theophil Spoerri founded the Gotthard League on 30 June 1940 in order to defend both these values and the independence of Switzerland.On 22 July an “Appeal to the Swiss People” written by de Rougemont was published in the Swiss press to rally support for the movement. Signatories were, besides de Rougemont and Spoerri, , who was at the time a military instructor and later became a politician within the Radical-Democratic Party (PRD); , from the conservative-liberal movement <b>Redressement</b> national; Christian Gasser, from the liberal “Ligue des Non-Subventionnés”; , a social-democrat Christian trade-unionist; Philippe Mottu, from Moral Rearmament; Paul Schäfer, also from Moral Rearmament; Heinrich Schnyder, a manager from the Migros groceries firm. Charles-F. Ducommun, a trade-unionist, and Julien Lescaze, communication officer at the ICRC soon joined the signatories and worked efficiently to spread the League's message. Among the most notable supporters of the Gotthard League are Gottlieb Duttweiler, founder of the Migros chain of grocery stores, Protestant theologian Emil Brunner, conservative historian Gonzague de Reynold and socialist philosopher and psychologist Philippe Müller.It must be added that the opinion differences between Denis de Rougemont and Gonzague de Reynold did create serious difficulties which prevented the Gotthard League to communicate consistently and that the hurried departure of de Rougemont for a 5-year exile in the USA under pressure of the Germans probably helped tilt the balance towards the more conservative side of the Gotthard League.However the launching of the Gotthard League, facilitated by a personal gift of 50’000 Swiss francs, was a major event. The League’s manifesto was carried by no less than 74 Swiss newspapers and was followed by more publications in the following ten days, including one appeal signed by the respected Zurich professor Theo Spoerri, regarded as the leader of Moral Rearmament in Switzerland, who had been elected to lead the governing body of the Gotthard League.|$|E

40|$|The French {{government}} under Philippe Petain, based at Vichy, simultaneously {{collaborated with the}} Germans and promoted French patriotism.

" Although Christian symbols were common, fascist symbols among the mass-produced images support the idea that the Vichy regime was not merely authoritarian, but parafascist. The fine arts were purged of "foreign" influences, yet the German Arno Breker was invited to exhibit his sculptures in Paris. In the spirit of national <b>redressement,</b> traditional French art was promoted; however, Modern art, which Hitler condemned as cultural Bolshevism, continued to be produced. With reference to the words of Petain, Hitler, French artists and art critics, and a variety of artworks, this thesis shows how art was used to propagate the ideology of the Vichy regime...|$|E
30|$|The Spanish {{bankruptcy}} system (Ley Concursal), which {{entered into}} force in 2004, 50 applied to consumers and {{all types of}} firms, including both limited liability companies and personally owned businesses with no limit to personal liability. In September 2013 the Spanish Parliament approved some legal reforms in this regard that are summarised in Appendix A. 6. By contrast, there are specific procedures for personal debtors both in France and the UK, which may be used by consumers, self-employed individuals and owners of small firms that used personal guarantees to fund their businesses. France has two procedures, the plan de <b>redressement</b> and the procedure de rétablissement personnel, while bankruptcy is the main insolvency procedure for individuals in the UK. 51 It is necessary to remark that, in the UK, the term “bankruptcy” only applies to individuals, while insolvency is the term that is used for companies. Once taken into account this legal notice, we must note that the term bankruptcy is used in this paper as a general term to denote formal insolvency procedures in general (as used in American Standard English).|$|E
3000|$|In all cases, {{we define}} “insolvency” as a {{situation}} in which the debtor is unable to pay debts when they are due (cash-flow insolvency). 46 This situation is known in French law as cessationdepaiements or faillite and in Spanish Law as quiebra or bancarrota. In this appendix we focus on the analysis of insolvency once that insolvency situation has been formally recognized. Previously, the debtor could have tried to reach an out-of-court arrangement or private workout with its creditors by which the creditors could accept less than the full amount (or in some cases, the full amount, if it can be determined without the aid of any legal proceeding) they are owed. If those arrangements fail or they are not even attempted, in Spain there is a formal procedure to resolve an insolvency situation called concursodeacreedores. In this paper the Spanish procedure is compared with the main procedures for corporate insolvency in France (the <b>redressement</b> judiciare 47 —a reorganisation procedure- and the liquidationjudiciare—a liquidation one 48) and in the UK (administration and, before 2003, administrative receivership). 49 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Founded in June 1940 {{under the}} Militaerverwaltung, the German occupying forces, the Commissariat-General pour la Reconstruction du Pays {{seems to be}} the {{continuation}} of pre-war structures. These had been set up in Belgium by modernist circles inside the Ministry of Public Works, involving for instance the Institut Superieur des Arts Decoratifs of La Cambre in Brussels and the Office de <b>Redressement</b> Economique. Inside the Commissariat-General, the Office for Reconstruction was created next to the offices for Employment and for War Damage. Raphael Verwilghen, who had also been the director of the Service des Regions Devastees for the reconstruction after World War I, stood as one of Belgium's most prominent members of the Modern Movement, {{at the head of the}} Commissariat. In this administration for national reconstruction one finds many other of the leading modern architects and urbanists who [...] before the war and even during and after the First World War [...] belonged to the most progressive circles, among whom Stan Leurs, Max Winders, Joseph Vierin, Valentijn Vaerwijck, and also Henry Van de Velde. Verwilghen's administration covered architecture, urbanism, regional planning and national heritage. The Commissariat's intention was to proceed to much more rigorous planning of infrastructures and urban development, and proposed in the main time a very rigid catalogue of new typologies for agricultural settlements and new villages. Planning for the metropolitan areas, started before the war, was continued and emphasized. Regional planning for dynamic new industrial areas like Limbourg and the new coal mining areas in the east of the country near Germany received special attention. Setting up a new urbanistic legislation, the Commissariat aimed to a total planning of the Belgian built environment within a clear and well-defined social vision. The strong voluntary opposition to the pre-war lack of economic and administrative policies could not avoid that the Commissariat’s policy stood in an ambiguous relationship with the German military government. Secret German reports to Berlin mention the Militaerverwaltung's high interest for the infrastructural development of rail- and highways in the Belgium region, and especially in Flanders, culturally spoken closer to Germany and considered as one of the regions to be 'annexed'. In spite of the Commissariat's ambiguous concepts existing on the background of the war and the fact that many of its administrators were considered and treated as 'collaborators' after the war, during this period were laid the foundations for the spatial planning after the war in Belgium.

40|$|International audienceAnalyzing {{the place}} of {{negotiation}} in international insolvency may seem surprising. Many observers would challenge the fact that negotiation may have a place at all considering the force of public policy in the rationality of bankruptcy. However, negotiation has enjoyed a remarkable growth in this field as it attempts to reconcile security and freedom. The {{purpose of this study}} is to reveal the current trends of negotiation in international insolvency but also to formulate some thoughts on what we may expect in the future. In this perspective, the study excludes the specific phenomenon of sovereign debt restructuring. Conversely, it focuses on situations covered by the (EC) Regulation N° 1346 / 2000 on insolvency proceedings and the UNCITRAL Model Law on cross-border insolvency. Negotiation presents a dual advantage in the elaboration of the solutions of international insolvency : creditors and main partners of the debtor are involved in the success of the proceeding and negotiation allows the implementation of more acceptable solutions. However, individual negotiation conducted with a creditor or a partner has its limitations and dangers. Such negotiation violates the collective discipline of insolvency proceedings and can hardly achieve a global settlement of the difficulties of the debtor. Similarly, it may lead to acts detrimental to the interests of the proceeding. Thus, without being totally excluded, individual negotiation is discouraged. Conversely, while the financing techniques of international trade increase discrimination between creditors and the difficulties to be addressed in insolvency proceedings are increasingly heterogeneous, collective negotiation becomes a strategic tool - through the practice of pre-packin' - and an adaptation technique in order to achieve the recovery of the insolvens and maximize the value of its assets. However international insolvency is essentially a risk normalization method that economic operators want to determine according to their specific needs. Doctrine envisages this choice to be made initially, a priori. But this possibility remains highly theoretical. Conversely, international insolvency regime is determined by the lex fori concursus in practice and depends therefore on the competent authority. Thus, the criterion of center of main interests (COMI) to determine jurisdiction and, indirectly, the law applicable to the insolvency proceeding opens the possibility of a choice made by the transfer of COMI. Negotiation becomes a way of reconciling the collective interests protected by the insolvency proceeding with this aspiration to a free choice of international insolvency regime. Eventually, assuming a plurality of proceedings, negotiation between the authorities of bankruptcy reduces conflicts between systems and coordinate efforts for the construction of a solution. The insolvency protocol negotiated in the Lehman Brothers case is an illustration. The scope of insolvency protocols are varied : the exchange of information, the coordination of the effects of bankruptcy, the organization of a sole administration / jurisdiction governing the respective case unless considerations of comity otherwise require. Therefore, negotiation allows international insolvency proceedings to achieve their goals in a post-modern world. La faillite internationale ne paraît pas a priori propice à la négociation. Pourtant, la négociation connaît un essor remarquable dans cette matière. Alors que les techniques de financement du commerce international multiplient les discrimi- nations entre créanciers et que les difficultés à traiter dans le cadre de la procédure sont de plus en plus hétéroclites, la négociation constitue un outil d'adaptation des solutions en vue du <b>redressement</b> de l'entreprise et de la maximisation de sa valeur. Mais la faillite internationale est avant tout une méthode de normalisation du risque que les opérateurs économiques souhaitent pouvoir déterminer en fonction de leurs besoins. La négociation devient alors le moyen de concilier les intérêts collectifs protégés par la procédure avec cette aspiration à un libre choix du régime de l'insol- vabilité internationale. Enfin, dans l'hypothèse d'une pluralité de procédures, la négociation permet de réduire les oppositions entre systèmes et de coordonner les efforts déployés en vue de la construction de la solution...|$|E
