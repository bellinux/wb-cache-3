5|$|Two years later, four {{units of}} vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays (VFD) were {{mounted on the}} ceiling. Eight units of dynamic route maps were mounted above every door in each car in trainset 053/054 for a two-month trial. This new SMRT Active <b>Route</b> <b>Map</b> Information System (STARiS) was then progressively introduced to all C151 trainsets, and subsequently to C651 and C751B trains for a cost of S$12 million—S$20,000 per car. It became standard equipment on all new rolling stocks subsequently introduced on the East-West Line and North-South Line.|$|E

The active <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> indicate the line of travel, direction of travel, side of doors opening, current station, next station, terminal station, interchange station and the corresponding line for interchange. All STARiS 2.0 active <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> are based upon Android.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{maps are}} very easily applied as <b>route</b> guide <b>maps.</b> <b>Route</b> guide <b>maps</b> are {{provided}} through Web or a mobile phone services, {{and demand for}} such services is increasing. However, {{the production of a}} <b>route</b> guide <b>map</b> requires a great deal of time. Therefore, it is difficult for general users to make <b>route</b> guide <b>maps.</b> The purpose of the present research is the development of a system that can generate a <b>route</b> guide <b>map</b> using the Digital Map 2500 (Spatial Data Framework) published by the Geographical Survey Institute. This system will not require advanced equipment or expert knowledge. Therefore, anyone can produce <b>route</b> guide <b>maps</b> easily and quickly. By using the Digital Map 2500, the time and cost required in order to generate a map are reduced. Moreover, a useful <b>route</b> guide <b>map</b> can be created by simplifying the map form based on the human cognitive map. ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>route</b> <b>map</b> {{continued}} to be developed and was issued in various formats and artistic styles until 1920, when, for the first time, the geographic background detail was omitted in a map designed by MacDonald Gill. This freed the design to enable greater flexibility in the positioning of lines and stations. The routes became more stylised but the arrangement remained, largely, geographic in nature. The 1932 edition was the last geographic map to be published, before Beck's diagrammatic map was introduced.|$|E

25|$|The SP1900 EMU / SP1950 EMU or IKK Train (formerly KCR EMU SP1900 / SP1950 EMU; , {{also known}} as the Millennium Train during the public promotion) is the second model of {{electric}} multiple unit rolling stock of Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), preceded by the Metro Cammell EMU. The trains of this model are currently in service on the East Rail Line, West Rail Line and Ma On Shan Line in Hong Kong. After the MTR Corporation merger, all SP1900 trains replaced their KCR logos with the MTR logos and added a revised <b>route</b> <b>map</b> in the interior without other major alteration to the stock.|$|E
25|$|Refurbishment works {{has begun}} since early 2016, {{beginning}} with train set 217/218. It will also include STARIS version 2.0, {{of which it}} will consist of the dynamic <b>route</b> <b>map</b> displays. The first refurbished train set is expected to undergo dynamic tests and commence revenue service in late 2017. As of late August 2016, 2 prototype train cars have been built by SRE for evaluation, signalling that the project is unaffected by termination of the End-of Life Refurbishments for the 66 C151 train sets. It will also be {{the third and final}} rolling stock to be painted in SMRT's unique pixel livery while newer rolling stock starting from the upcoming C151C trains will bear LTA corporate's livery.|$|E
25|$|In 24 January 2014, the MTRC, now {{operating}} the West Rail Line on KCRC's behalf, ordered another 36 new cars (under contract number 1151) {{to convert the}} SP1900 sets on all three lines to 8-car configurations for the future East West Corridor. The newly converted SP1900 trains are also retrofitted with dynamic <b>route</b> <b>map</b> displays that replace the existing plastic maps above the doorways, and will receive larger 22-inch LCD TVs in the near future. They retain the KCR livery with blue bodies and red doors, and will operate solely on the East West Corridor. Until {{the opening of the}} East West Corridor in 2019, the converted trains continue to serve separately on the West Rail and Ma On Shan Lines, but will be withdrawn from the East Rail Line and be replaced with new Hyundai Rotem EMUs.|$|E

25|$|The {{rolling stock}} {{is based on}} the Siemens Modular Metro design {{manufactured}} by Siemens Mobility. Trains run in 3 car sets (though platforms are designed to be able to accommodate up to 6 car sets, with the exception of Kaohsiung Main Station of only 3 car accommodations) and are powered by third rail. Seats are arranged parallel to the windows, unlike their Taipei Metro counterparts. LED displays are installed above every alternate door (other doors show the <b>route</b> <b>map),</b> showing the name of the current station and next station in Chinese and English. Automated announcements are made in Mandarin, Taiwanese (with the exception of Kaohsiung Arena Station since the Taiwanese translation for the name is not available), Hakka, and English, with Japanese announcements at the major stations. The train uses IGBT-VVVF traction motors powered by Siemens.|$|E
