25|$|In 2014 the WSPs recovered, on average, 100% of {{operation}} and maintenance costs. However, all but four utilities fell short of the target to cover 150% {{of operation}} and maintenance costs in order to service debt and to develop their infrastructure. Water Services Boards should be cover their administrative costs through the <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Levy</b> they collect from WSPs in their service area. In fact, only Athi WSB was able to meet 115% of operational costs in 2006/2007. The other WSBs were still heavily reliant on government subsidies.|$|E
50|$|The Athi Water Services Board {{is under}} the {{authority}} of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation and covers its costs through a <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Levy</b> collected from the Water Service Providers. The Minister of Water and Irrigation, a position held by Charity Ngilu since 2008, appoints the Board of AWSB. The 8-member supervisory Board is chaired by Reuben Ndolo, a member of parliament from the Orange Democratic Movement of Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Since July 2011 the CEO is Malakwen Milgo, an engineer who has previously worked for the German technical advisory agency GTZ. The company is ISO 9001 certified.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{increases}} in livestock {{production in the}} Netherlands have changed manure from a valuable input into a mere waste product. This {{is especially true for}} the southern and eastern parts of the country, where specialized pig and poultry farms have concentrated on sandy soils. As these farms generally own very little land, they largely depend on imported feedstuffs. As a consequence, manure is applied to the land in such large quantities that serious environmental problems have resulted: (1) eutrophication of surface water by phosphate emissions; (2) pollution of groundwater by nitrate emissions; and (3) acidification by ammonia emissions. In the last few years the Dutch government has developed a manure policy to counteract these effects. Our analysis of that policy has revealed at least three fundamental defects, which render the manure policy ineffective and inefficient. In this paper proposals are made to remove the defects in current manure policy. Much attention is paid to the problem of designing a mixture of policy instruments which is both effective as well as efficient in limiting the environmental problems caused by manure. It is shown that the use of financial incentives in regulation can substantially improve the efficiency of the manure policy. Finally, the main economic consequences of the proposed policy are examined for the public sector {{as well as for the}} agricultural sector.

50|$|Hunter was {{the target}} of a $30 million fine to be levied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in {{connection}} with the alleged manipulation of natural gas prices in 2006. In December 2007, Hunter sought to prevent the FERC from taking any action against him for his participation in trading in the natural gas futures market. A federal judge denied his request. In April 2011, the Federal Energy <b>Regulatory</b> Commission <b>levied</b> the expected $30 million penalty against Hunter, who has challenged the case in court.|$|R
50|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2015-2016 DPR was budgeted for {{approximately}} $90.9 million, almost 98% {{of the funding}} coming from <b>regulatory</b> fees, primarily <b>levied</b> on pesticide sales {{at the point of}} first sale into the state, and penalties and the remaining 2% coming from federal funds from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Agriculture.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the many}} <b>regulatory</b> {{requirements}} <b>levied</b> on businesses, the modern payment processor is usually partnered with merchants through a concept known as software-as-a-service (SaaS). SaaS payment processors offer a single, regulatory-compliant electronic portal that enables a merchant to scan checks (often called remote deposit capture or RDC), process single and recurring credit card payments (without the merchant storing the card data at the merchant site), process single and recurring ACH and cash transactions, process remittances and Web payments. These cloud-based features occur regardless of origination through the payment processor's integrated receivables management platform. This results in cost reductions, accelerated time-to-market, and improved transaction processing quality.|$|R

For example, legislation that would authorize local governments to levy taxes on businesses (especially big wealthy businesses) to finance stormwater projects and programs. Another example, legislation authorizing local governments to <b>levy</b> <b>regulatory</b> fees on water polluting businesses requiring businesses that pollute the water to {{pay their fair share}} to clean polluted water resulting from their business activities. This can be done without local voter approval. Another example, requiring developers to pay their fair share of developer fees intended to fully mitigate stormwater project costs associated with their development projects. This can also be done without local voter approval.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has highlighted once more that interconnectedness {{in the financial}} system is {{a major source of}} systemic risk. I suggest a practical way to <b>levy</b> <b>regulatory</b> capital charges based on the degree of interconnectedness among financial institutions. Namely, the charges are based on the institution’s incremental contribution to systemic risk. The imposition of such capital charges could go a long way towards internalizing the negative externalities associated with too-connected-to-fail institutions and providing managerial incentives to strengthen an institution’s solvency position, and avoid too much homogeneity and excessive reliance on the same counterparties in the financial industry.
