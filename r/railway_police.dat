25|$|The Staten Island Railway {{traverses}} {{the island}} 24/7 from its northeastern tip to its southwestern tip. The Staten Island Railway opened on April 23, 1860 and was {{owned and operated}} by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) until July 1, 1971 when the line was bought by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Staten Island Railway continued to have its own <b>railway</b> <b>police,</b> the Staten Island Rapid Transit Police until 2005 when the 25 officer police force was consolidated into the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police. MTA Police officers patrol the Island's only passenger railway. Staten Island is the only borough not served by the New York City Subway, as the Staten Island Tunnel was abandoned in the middle of construction in the 1920s. It lies dormant beneath Owl's Head Park in Brooklyn. As such, express bus service is provided by NYC Transit throughout Staten Island to Lower and Midtown Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Cricket League's ongoing {{tournament in}} Ahmedabad was canceled. The two {{remaining}} One Day Internationals {{of the seven}} match series between the visiting England cricket team and India were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the test series. However, the venue of the second India-England test match, scheduled on 19–23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai. The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai {{being one of the}} host cities, was postponed. The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of confidence building measures with India. There were threats to blow up ITC Fortune Hotel in Navi Mumbai, after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were doing the rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels. The <b>Railway</b> <b>Police</b> denied these rumours, but stopped trains approaching CST.|$|E
25|$|Only in the 1980s did an $18 billion {{financing}} {{program for}} the rehabilitation of the subway start. Between 1985 and 1991 over 3,000 subway cars were overhauled and fitted with air conditioning. In this way, comfort, reliability and durability would be increased in order to postpone new purchases. The TA only replaced the oldest cars each division, so that {{despite the fact that}} the fleet was overaged, the TA bought only 1,350 new vehicles. Increased patrols and fences around the train yards offered better protection against graffiti and vandalism. At the same time, the TA began an extensive renovation of the routes. Within ten years the tracks were thereby renewed almost systemwide. The Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, which had strong corrosion damage, were refurbished over the years. The renovation of the stations was initially limited to security measures, fresh paint, new lighting and signs, but the TA also tried to improve the service that had been neglected. This ranged from new uniforms and training for the staff to correct destination signs on the rolling stock. Some subway services were also adapted to the changing needs of customers. Another stated goal was to reduce crime or at least an improvement in the subjective sense of security. At night, the <b>railway</b> <b>police</b> and members of the citizens' initiative Guardian Angels, formed in 1979, patrolled in the subway trains. It was not until the 1990s that the crime in the city and its subway declined significantly. Nevertheless, the reputation as a slow, dilapidated, dirty and unsafe means of transportation remains associated with the subway.|$|E
5000|$|In 1952, to {{mark the}} 300th anniversary of European settlement, the South African {{government}} established its own honours system. It consisted of the existing civil, <b>police,</b> <b>railways</b> <b>police</b> and prisons medals, and {{a new series of}} military decorations. They were given precedence over British honours.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time as the civic and {{national}} memorials were being erected factories, banks, golf clubs, boys clubs, schools, universities [...] churches, <b>railways,</b> <b>police,</b> post offices [...] and even a prison [...] erected war memorials to those men and women who had gone to war.|$|R
50|$|The honours {{system was}} {{enlarged}} during the 1960s, after South African {{had become a}} republic. New decorations were instituted for the police in 1963, for the <b>railways</b> <b>police</b> in 1966, for sports stars in 1967, for the prisons service in 1968, and for civilians in 1970.|$|R
500|$|On 1 July 1938, Himmler {{appointed}} Berger {{as chief}} of the recruiting department of the SS-Hauptamt (SS Main Office, or SS-HA), which he quickly developed into {{a powerful tool for}} Himmler's ambitions. According to Berger, the German Army was initially dismissive of the idea of SS combat troops. He quoted the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Generaloberst Werner von Fritsch as saying, [...] "If the Reich Transport Minister has his militarily-trained <b>Railway</b> <b>Police,</b> why shouldn't Himmler also play at soldiers?" ...|$|E
500|$|Denning was {{admitted}} to Lincoln's Inn on 4 November 1921, choosing it because the Under Treasurer {{was a graduate of}} Magdalen College. On the advice of his brother's friend Frank Merriman he applied to 4 Brick Court, Middle Temple Lane, a small set of chambers run by Henry O'Hagan. He was accepted and began work there in September 1922, before he had taken his final bar exam. He finished his final exam in May 1923 and came top in the bar examination, with the Inn awarding him a 100guineas a year studentship of three years. He was called to the Bar on 13 June 1923, and was offered a tenancy by O'Hagan. His first few years were spent receiving small briefs from a variety of clients, including work prosecuting those who failed to pay rail tickets and fines. During this time he also wrote a manual for the <b>railway</b> <b>police</b> giving guidance on incidents such as taxi drivers who refused to take a customer to a destination within the area specified by the Public Carriage Office (which they were legally obliged to do). He wrote his first article in 1924 titled [...] "Quantum Meruit and the Statute of Frauds" [...] on the decision in Scott v Pattison [...] 2 KB 723; it was accepted by the Law Quarterly Review and published in January 1925.|$|E
