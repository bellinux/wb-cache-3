5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether <b>retrospective</b> <b>awards</b> were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E

2500|$|From around 2006, campaigners {{including}} the then Northampton South MP, Brian Binley, and Phil Vasili, a biographer of Tull, {{called for a}} statue to be erected in his honour at Dover {{and for him to}} be posthumously awarded the Military Cross. However, as the Military Cross was not authorised to be awarded posthumously until 1979, and the change did not include any provision for <b>retrospective</b> <b>awards,</b> this would not be possible without a complete change in the rules. The campaigners felt this would be justified given that the army broke the rules in their favour in allowing Tull a commission at a time when, {{after the end of the}} Battle of the Somme in November 1916, the army was desperately short of officers. It therefore suited the needs of the army for Tull to be commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant. Unfortunately, when the recommendation for his Military Cross was considered at elite level, his 'illegal' [...] status as an officer of non-European descent meant to award him the honour would validate his status, leading to more mixed-heritage officers being commissioned, something the Army Council continued to resist to the end of the war.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} of Final Fantasy VII and the Compilation have remained highly popular, often being cited {{as some of}} the best characters in both the Final Fantasy series and video games in general by both critics and fans. Reader and critic lists on gaming site IGN have all placed them high, with one reader poll in 2014 having multiple VII characters dominating a list of the top ten characters in the series as a whole. Sephiroth {{remains one of the most}} popular villains in video game history, unanimously voted number one by the staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly in their [...] "Top 10 Video Game Bosses" [...] list in October 2005. In late 2007, Dengeki PlayStation named Cloud Strife the best character of all time in their <b>retrospective</b> <b>awards</b> feature about the original PlayStation. Aerith placed fifth, Tifa placed eighth and three other characters placed in the top 50; Sephiroth at fourteenth, Reno at fifteenth, and Yuffie at forty-second. Cloud placed second in a Famitsu reader poll for Japan's favorite video game character. In a list of the best Final Fantasy characters made by Complex, characters from Final Fantasy VII occupied seven out of the twenty places, with Sephiroth and Cloud coming third and first respectively. The character of Cloud has also influenced character design in the series, having had a profound influence on the design and portrayal of Lightning, the central protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels.|$|E
