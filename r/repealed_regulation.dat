2500|$|Regulation 17 was a {{regulation}} of the Conservative government designed to shut down French-language schools {{at a time that}} Francophones from Quebec were moving into eastern Ontario. [...] In July 1912, the Conservative government of Sir James P. Whitney issued Regulation 17, which severely limited the provision of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French could only be used {{in the first two years}} of schooling, and after that students and teachers were required to use English in classrooms. Few of the teachers at the French-language schools were fluent in English, so the schools had to close. The French-Canadian population, which was growing rapidly in eastern Ontario from migration, reacted with outrage; journalist Henri Bourassa denounced the [...] "Prussians of Ontario". With the Great War raging, Anglophones were insulted by the comparison. The restriction on French- language schools contributed to the Francophones turning away from the war effort in 1915 and refusing to enlist. But, most of Ontario's Catholics were Irish, led by Irish Bishop Fallon, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools. The government <b>repealed</b> <b>Regulation</b> 17 in 1927.|$|E

5000|$|Heading {{into the}} convention, Ontario Premier Howard Ferguson was {{considered}} the favourite as he enjoyed popularity in Quebec as well as Ontario as his government had <b>repealed</b> <b>Regulation</b> 17 which had restricted French-language school instruction. Other Conservatives wanted Meighen to stand as a candidate and succeed himself. Meighen and Ferguson clashed on the convention floor after Meighen, who had attempted to make overtures to Quebec where the Conservatives and Meighen were unpopular due to the Conscription crisis of 1917, proposed that Canada {{not be able to}} go to war in future without there first being a referendum or federal election on the issue. Meighen raised the issue on the floor of the convention but Ferguson, echoing the views of many English-Canadian Conservatives, loudly denounced Meighen's position saying: [...] "I, as a Liberal-Conservative, entirely disagree with him and repudiate that view; and if this convention chooses to endorse him, I will dissociate myself entirely from the convention." [...] Ferguson's comments were received with a round of boos taking him out of consideration for leadership while also making Meighen succeeding himself untenable.|$|E
