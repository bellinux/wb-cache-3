50|$|Before 2014, the {{consensus}} in America {{was that there}} was enough security measures to avoid credit card theft and that the <b>smart</b> <b>chip</b> was not necessary. The cost of the <b>smart</b> <b>chip</b> technology was significant, which was why most of the corporations did not want to pay for it in the United States. The debate came when online credit theft was insecure enough for the United States to invest in the technology.

5000|$|Reverse image technology: The {{standard}} for high-security card applications that use contact and contactless <b>smart</b> <b>chip</b> cards. The technology prints images onto {{the underside of}} a special film that fuses {{to the surface of}} a card through heat and pressure. Since this process transfers dyes and resins directly onto a smooth, flexible film, the print-head never comes in contact with the card surface itself. As such, card surface interruptions such as <b>smart</b> <b>chips,</b> ridges caused by internal RFID antennae and debris do not affect print quality. Even printing over the edge is possible.|$|R

50|$|Level 2 Security (L2S) EMBEDDED Data—Level 2 Security {{improves}} {{upon the}} physical security mechanisms of Level 1 Security by taking information protection to a covert and embedded level.

Technologies at this level include <b>smart</b> <b>chips,</b> magnetic strips, Radio Frequency Identification (<b>RFID),</b> contactless <b>chips</b> or <b>smart</b> <b>chips</b> with embedded identity and biometric data. With the right tools, L2S schemes allows the capability to capture, register and authenticate document holders' identity information and, of late, biometric identity information.

5000|$|Similar to inkjet printers, toner {{cartridges}} may contain <b>smart</b> <b>chips</b> that {{reduce the number}} of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%), in an effort to increase sales of the {{toner cartridges}}. Besides being more expensive to the consumer, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the <b>smart</b> <b>chip.</b> Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. [...] These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer—all laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.|$|R
