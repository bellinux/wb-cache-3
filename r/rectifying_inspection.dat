40|$|Two {{optimization}} algorithms for the <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> are presented. They minimize either ATI (Average Total Inspection) or AOQ (Average Outgoing Quality) and {{use another}} as a constraint. The definitions for ATI and AOQ are also generalized {{in order to}} handle the varying fraction defective of the incoming lots. A comprehensive study is conducted for comparing the performance characteristics of several different <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> plans. The {{results show that the}} optimum algorithms developed in this article can usually produce the best outputs and always satisfy the design constraint. Finally, a manufacturing example is used to show the applications of the optimum <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> plans...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} issues in quality control is finding the optimal target value for a process under various inspection policies. Researchers have considered various aspects of this problem with 100 % inspection and with quality sampling plans. In this paper we consider the problem of targeting the set point when <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> is used. We develop a model for this problem and propose a scheme for solving it. We also provide a numerical example. acceptance sampling optimal target value process optimization <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pulak and Al-Sultan {{presented}} a <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> plan applying in {{the determination of}} optimum process mean. However, they did not point out whether the non-conforming items in the sample of accepted lot are replaced or eliminated from the lot and neglected the quality loss within specification limits. In this paper, we further propose the modified Pulak and Al-Sultan model with quadratic quality loss function. There are four cases considered in the modified model: (1) the non-conforming items in the sample of accepted lot are neither replaced nor eliminated from the lot; (2) the non-conforming items in the sample of accepted lot are not replaced but are eliminated from the lot;�(3) the non-conforming items in the sample of accepted lot are replaced by conforming ones; (4) the non-conforming items in the sample of accepted lot are replaced by non-inspected items. The numerical results and sensitivity analysis of parameters show that their solutions are slightly different. <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> plan, process mean, quadratic quality loss function, specification limits,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a problem often met in practice. A production process {{may be subject}} to two types of deteriorations. The first is a shift in product quality caused by minor process defects that may be identified and <b>rectified</b> by routine <b>inspections</b> and repairs. The second is a major defect caused by a major mechanical or electrical problem that can be observed only when the defect has led to a breakdown of the process or the defect is revealed by a major inspection followed by an appropriate major repair action {{at the time of the}} inspection. We formulated an inspection model for the above problem and aimed at optimising the inspection intervals for both types of inspections. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the applicability and solution procedure of the model...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{practitioners}} guide on how to apply a new inspection framework that evaluates search interfaces for their support of different searcher types. Vast amounts of money are being invested into search, {{and so it is}} becoming increasingly important to identify problems in design early, while it is relatively cheap to <b>rectify</b> them. The <b>inspection</b> method presented here can be applied quickly to early prototypes, as well as existing systems, and goes beyond other inspection methods, like Cognitive Walkthroughs, to produces rich analyses, including the support provided for different search tactics and user types. The guide is presented as a detailed example, assessing a previously unevaluated search interface: the Tabulator, and so also provides design recommendations for improving it. We conclude with a summary of the benefits of the evaluation framework, and discuss our plans for future enhancements...|$|R
40|$|A three-level {{satellite}} to ground monitoring scheme for conservation easement monitoring has been implemented in which high-resolution imagery {{serves as an}} intermediate step for inspecting high priority sites. A digital vertical aerial camera system was developed to fulfill {{the need for an}} economical source of imagery for this intermediate step. A method for attaching the camera system to small aircraft was designed, and the camera system was calibrated and tested. To ensure that the images obtained were of suitable quality for use in Level 2 <b>inspections,</b> <b>rectified</b> imagery was required to provide positional accuracy of 5 meters or less to be comparable to current commercially available high-resolution satellite imagery. Focal length calibration was performed to discover the infinity focal length at two lens settings (24 mm and 35 mm) with a precision of O. 1 mm. Known focal length is required for creation of navigation points representing locations to be photographed (waypoints). Photographing an object of known size at distances on a test range allowedestimates of focal lengths of 25. lmm and 35. 4 mm for the 24 mm and 35 mm lens settings, respectively. Constants required for distortion removal procedures were obtained usin...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a great {{interest}} in the economics of quality control. Process mean targeting is one of the quality control problems which has attracted many researchers. Many papers have been written on finding the optimal mean setting of the process, but very few papers have considered the value of variance reduction. In this paper, we consider a single filling operation with <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection.</b> We study the effect of the variance on the process performance. We analyse the cost saving which results from reduction in the process variance. We also provide a numerical example...|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{modification}} of Chen and Liu&# 039;s (2008) model with a k-stage serial production system. Assume that the retailer&# 039;s order quantity {{is based on the}} manufacturer&# 039;s product quality, and that the quality characteristic of the product is normally distributed. The quality of a product lot for the manufacturer is determined by adopting a k-stage single sampling <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> plan. The used cost of customer for the product can be obtained by adopting Taguchi&# 039;s symmetric quadratic quality loss function. The modified economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) model will be proposed for the manufacturer&# 039;s profit model. The optimal retailer&# 039;s order quantity and the manufacturer&# 039;s production run length and process mean will be jointly determined by maximizing the total expected profit of society including that of the retailer and manufacturer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> sampling plan for single specification limit products under a Bayesian framework {{with the objective}} of minimizing the expected total cost due to imperfect items introduced to the manufacturer’s production and sales systems. The model involves a two-stage decision: (1) determining the optimal sample size, and (2) after obtaining sampling information, taking an action that is between no more inspection and 100 percent inspection. The model assumes that the quality characteristic of the key component is exponentially distributed with an unknown mean. Using gamma distribution as the conjugate prior, a closed form decision criterion for the second stage can be derived, and the computational complexity will be greatly reduced. The attribute sampling model under the same probability distribution and cost structure is also derived and analyzed. Applications and numerical results using an LED electronic component for both sampling models are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} proposes {{an inspection}} policy aiming {{to improve the}} application of C 2 F 6 in semiconductor manufacturing. For the gas product C 2 F 6, total inspection is commonly employed by the producers before it is sent to downstream manufacturers. The study develops a Bayesian <b>rectifying</b> <b>inspection</b> sampling model {{with the objective of}} minimizing expected total cost from the producers ’ standpoint. The factors that influence the total cost include gas product quality, inspection cost, sampling information, product failure cost, inspection accuracy, and decision on the remaining units. Influence diagram is used to represent the problem and derive the total objective function. The application of the model is presented via a real world company using the last four years of data. The proposed inspection policy yields an average of 15 % cost savings using a cost reduction estimation method based on hyper-geometric distribution...|$|E
