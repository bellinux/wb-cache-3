Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive.

5|$|The {{dominance}} of Northern Mannerism in the mid-16th century {{was built on}} a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; Mary of Hungary and Philip II of Spain both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of <b>repute</b> was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended {{to be on the}} Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht Dürer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. Giorgio Vasari in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c.1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region's painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{often used}} Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland—commonly known as Holinshed's Chronicles—as {{a source for}} his plays, and in Macbeth he borrows from several of the tales in that work. Holinshed portrays Banquo as a {{historical}} figure: he is an accomplice in Mac Bethad mac Findlaích's (Macbeth's) murder of Donnchad mac Crínáin (King Duncan) and plays {{an important part in}} ensuring that Macbeth, not Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm), takes the throne in the coup that follows. Holinshed in turn used an earlier work, the Scotorum Historiae (1526–7) by Hector Boece, as his source. Boece's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son Fleance; and scholars such as David Bevington generally consider them fictional characters invented by Boece. In Shakespeare's day, however, they were considered historical figures of great <b>repute,</b> and the king, James I, based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo. The House of Stuart was descended from Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland, and he was believed to have been the grandson of Fleance and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's daughter, Nesta ferch Gruffydd. In reality Walter fitz Alan was the son of Alan fitz Flaad, a Breton knight.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the history of the <b>reputed</b> {{ownership}} clause, a bankruptcy provision that included goods in the estate of the bankrupt that were in the 'apparent' possession of the bankrupt, rather than in his ownership. The <b>reputed</b> ownership clause was enacted in 1624 in order to protect creditors from delusive credit, caused by chattel mortgages that generally took the form of a secret bill of sale. This thesis, after considering the present state of the academic literature on the topic, explores the origin of the <b>reputed</b> ownership clause and the first two centuries of its judicial interpretation. The value of this research is that it establishes that the early interpretation of the <b>reputed</b> ownership clause was more sophisticated than modern scholarship suggests. It shows that from the 18 th century onwards the courts were already acting on commercial needs, balancing the prevention of fraud against the encouragement of trade and credit. After the leading case Ryall v Rolle (1749) the <b>reputed</b> ownership clause was interpreted more extensively, but at the same time, various general exceptions emerged that limited the <b>reputed</b> ownership clause. This resulted in a more sophisticated, and in some respects narrowing, application. This thesis aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a doctrinal general legal narrative of the <b>reputed</b> ownership clause, from its enactment until the point at which it came under attack in the mid 19 th century. Case-law and treatises from between the late 16 th and the early 19 th century have been used to conduct this research. The research outcomes of the thesis show that certain assumptions in modern scholarship based on 19 th century sources {{on the development of the}} <b>reputed</b> ownership clause and the floating charge are questionable. </p...|$|R
