After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts.

25|$|Container deposit {{legislation}} involves {{offering a}} refund {{for the return}} of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent <b>recycling</b> <b>rate.</b> Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas. A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.|$|E

The principal aim {{of the project was}} to investigate the socio-economic factors that determine <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> across local authorities in the UK and why <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> vary. To achieve this, the project objectives were to: (i) provide a theoretical framework for economic determinants of the proportion of waste recycled as an aggregate quantity and differentiated by material type; (ii) construct a panel dataset covering all local authorities; (iii) establish the statistical significance of all the variables expected to have explanatory power through panel data econometric analysis; (iv) carry out sensitivity tests to validate the model; (v) draw implications for recycling policy both at local and national level. The data deposited at the UK Data Archive comprise the panel dataset described above. Source data used to construct the dataset were taken from the WasteDataFlow website, a web-based system for municipal waste data reporting by UK local authorities to government, where they are used by the Department for Environmental and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and other departments to produce statistics. Office for National Statistics data on regional socio-economic characteristics were also used.

40|$|According to the 2008 data, <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> in 60 {{municipalities}} in Bologna Province vary in a {{very wide}} range from 15 % to over 60 %. In order to promote sustainable practices of resource (in this case, materials) recovery, {{it is important to}} identify factors that influence the attitudes and behaviour of citizens in this regard and clarify the differences among these municipalities. Starting from the findings of similar studies that have been carried out elsewhere, this research study is undertaken to investigate these factors in Bologna Province. Particular attention is paid to the role of information and awareness raising campaigns implemented in the municipalities under investigation. Stratified sampling is used to select 17 municipalities that are representative of the Bologna Province according to relevant characteristics. Research methodology includes interviews with formal stakeholders such as municipal authorities and waste service providers, as well as a survey among residents.

25|$|Waste {{management}} is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority. Unlike other waste disposal authorities in Greater London, Croydon's rubbish is collected independently and isn't part of a waste authority unit. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill {{in the south of}} Croydon. There have recently been calls by the ODPM to bring waste management powers to the Greater London Authority, giving it a waste function. The Mayor of London has made repeated attempts to bring the different waste authorities together, to form a single waste authority in London. This has faced significant opposition from existing authorities. However, it has had significant support from all other sectors and the surrounding regions managing most of London's waste. Croydon has the joint best <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> in London, at 36%, but the refuse collectors have been criticised for their rushed performance lacking quality. Croydon's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is EDF Energy Networks; there are no power stations in the borough. Thames Water manages Croydon's drinking and waste water; water supplies being sourced from several local reservoirs, including Beckton and King George VI. Before 1971, Croydon Corporation was responsible for water treatment in the borough.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{mechanisms}} influencing <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> around the system maximum are deliberated. On the one hand, Policies, System design and how Citizens understand the two aforementioned are pitted against each other. This {{is done in}} a setting where individual rewards from action are in turn set against {{the values of the}} community and the compliance measures/social marketing of recycling companies and policy makers. This is the dynamic setting of this dissertation. In the past much research into recycling has been focused on how to get recycling started. Sweden is {{in a bit of a}} different position with recycling levels often being very high in an international comparison. This means other challenges face citizens and policy makers alike. The determinants influencing <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> are studied and compared to contemporary research. Policy makers and social marketers that wish to see a system used to its fullest need to understand the determinants that remain to be influenced near the system optimum. The studied recycling system points to a trichotomy of determinants influencing <b>recycling</b> <b>rates.</b> Social or public marketing being one part; the community's understanding of recycling being a second part, and individual knowledge and understanding forming the third. Successive elimination of potential determinants in a Zwicky box, using statistical analysis, indicates that strengthening individual autonomy and ability to participate efficiently remains as the key to further and sustainable development in the field. The study suggests compliance rates can still be improved upon, even when <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> are in excess of 80 %, although methods might have to change. Instead of an oft used emphasis on coercive compliance and "scare tactics", a careful study and propagation of the recycling techniques developed by the many efficient citizens is pivotal. In addition, further improvements in terms of recycling facilitation may offer policy makers a sustainable path to near system optimal <b>recycling</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
