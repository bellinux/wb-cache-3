5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 a new fish counter was {{commissioned}} for the Shimna {{river and the}} initial <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009. However, in 2014 concerns about salmon levels in the river were raised again after {{it was observed that}} the number of eggs being laid was still below conservation limits.|$|E
5|$|The major {{excavation}} {{of the site}} {{in the winter of}} 2004–05 concentrated on the building and a 10m (33ft) zone surrounding it.

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> that the juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge {{that they were not}} deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to unfeather propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E

Twenty stroke patients were assessed {{at home by}} the same physiotherapist on two occasions. There was good consistency overtime on most items. Twenty patients in hospital were assessed by two physiotherapists. The <b>results</b> <b>indicate</b> poor agreement between assessors. Twenty-five patients were assessed by a physiotherapist and a doctor. <b>Results</b> <b>indicate</b> low agreement between these assessors. <b>Results</b> <b>indicate</b> poor inter-rater reliability on a standardized assessment.

5|$|In a {{different}} study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. <b>Results</b> <b>indicated</b> that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, West Africa, eastern Sahel, south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa. Results of another phylogeographic {{study indicate that}} southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern part}} of Central Africa are genetically closer to lions in North and West Africa, and those in the southern part closer to lions in Southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} idea he {{surveyed}} hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E

In his speech following the loss, Martin stated he would not lead the Liberal Party of Canada in another election.

25|$|The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> {{that when}} the {{decision}} is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E
