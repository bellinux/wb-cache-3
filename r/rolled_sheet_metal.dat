40|$|AbstractLaser cutting {{has started}} {{to be used as}} an {{effective}} method for cutting out blanks from <b>rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> because of its high flexibility for cutting line and high productivity. However, residual stresses, which are generated by laser cutting, have been the greatest obstacle for the popularization of laser cutting.

The authors present a light indentation method for reducing residual stress generated by laser cutting. The method is to give light indentation on the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> edge and to reduce tensile residual stress generated near the laser cutting surface.

Furthermore, the mechanism of transition of stress and effective strain in light indentation was examined.

40|$|Abstract The {{assignment}} {{were assigned}} by Camatec Industriteknik AB. Camatec is a Karlstadlocated consulting company, they make everything from pilot studies to complete projects in mechanical design and calculation. They even {{have their own}} patented product, Camcoil. It is a winder for steel strips and is used for example with hardening of the steel strip. The assignment has been {{to solve the problems}} encountered by some customers within this product. The product which is relatively simple consists of a mantle which can vary in diameter by means of hydraulic cylinders The problem was that it had concurred indentations on the striped steel next to the Camcoil. This destroys the further handling of the coil. The goal has been to develop three kinds of solutions that take into account different customer requirements. These solutions have been divided into price ranges, thus low-cost, mid-cost, and high-cost. The high-cost solution has been a combination of the mid-cost-solution and a bandgrip. One wish was to simplify the existing bandgrip. The functional requirements those are set depending on the customer: • Must be able to prevent sagging, then some form of support should be available to the band at reeling. • Not allowed to weld in the mantle beneath the welded ears. • Must be able to take a band-pull at max 1 ton. • The space at the clearance on the reel should be free at the use of lifting hook (midcost, high-cost) • Steel strip with thickness 0. 2 - 1 mm is to be pinched to the reel (High-cost). • A stop for the band at pinching must exist (high-cost). The non-functional requirements that have applied for all price ranges: • Develop the simplest solution as possible. • Standard components recommend being used to reduce costs. • The solution should be user friendly and easy to maintain. The major problem has been the lack of space in the reel with the requirements of midcost solution. Due to a lifting hook to be used it has been very difficult {{to come up with a}} mechanism that would work as a support. A comprehensive concept generation has been done with a number of different concepts for each price ranges solution. The concepts have been evaluated and compared and with the help of elimination- and decision matrix has a concept selection for each price range been developed. The result for the low-cost solution is a <b>rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> that is overstrung on the outside of the mantle, this means when the mantle will collapse the <b>rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> will follow along. Mid-cost solution resulted in a mechanical lid uses mantle movement with the help of parallel rods wander vertically down and account the space for the lifting hook. A simplification of the bandgrip were made with boomerang stays, this gave more space and fewer parts. The combination of the mid-cost solution and the simplified bandgrip were the high-cost solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensional}} {{instability of}} metallic materials, following machining (or any method of material removal), {{is a common}} problem in the aerospace industry. This is because large parts have to be manufactured to very close tolerances {{and as much as}} 95 % of the initial material may need to be removed. For machined, relatively complex, aerospace parts it would not be uncommon to see around 50 % difference in the simulated results from the actual results, with even simple geometries showing around 19 %- 40 % error. It is believed that a significant portion of these errors are due to a lack of: understanding of how the residual stresses redistribute following material removal; residual stress measuring capabilities; finite element (FE) modelling capabilities; knowledge of the additional residual stresses induced from the machining process (from varying cutting speeds, feed rates, tools, temperatures etc) and finally how the multiaxial residual stresses alter the shape of the part. This project improves the knowledge base of many of these topics. This work involved the development of an automated layer removal method for residual stress measurements in cold <b>rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal.</b> This was needed due to the number of residual stress measurements that were required for modelling purposes. The method can determine the residual stresses in the rolling direction for cold rolled sheet material using a single strain gauge. Moreover, it is simple to set up and the total cost of the test rig and subsequent measurements is relatively low. Furthermore, in this project, a number of sheet metal aluminium parts were formed to different radii. The parts were then subsequently chemically milled in stages; the dimensional changes following each material removal being measured. This process was simulated using a commercially available FE package called PAM-STAMP. The FE results for distortion did not show good agreement when compared to the measured results; however, the residual stress measurements provided an unexpected understanding into the cause of the error. The results of the project improve the understanding of how residual stress change the shape of components and give an insight into the modelling parameters needed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the {{characterization}} of material properties of interest in rolled aluminium and steel sheet, both popular materials used across a wide-range of applications. The forming processes involved in producing <b>rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> depend on plastic deformation, inducing elastic anisotropy as a consequence. These changes result in a variation from the simple isotropic and cubic symmetry systems possessed by steel and aluminium prior to cold-working. The most significant changes include the introduction of crystallographic texture and the morphology of the crystallographic grains in size and shape to accommodate the plastic deformation. It is desirable in industries that use rolled product for manufacturing components to quantify such changes. The literature has postulated links between plastic and elastic properties, and hence any quantification of the elasticity, crystallographic texture and grain morphology can aid in the prediction of future formability behaviour. This thesis presents non-destructive, rapid ultrasonic measurements to characterize some of the changes that are evident in rolled aluminium and steel sheet. These ultrasonic results have then been correlated to crystallographic orientation measurements generated from using a microscopic technique called electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The level of agreement between the two contrasting methods has been analysed and is presented here. The non-destructive ultrasonic measurements include quantifying crystallographic texture utilising theory linking the S 0 Lamb wave velocity and the direction of propagation in a rolled sheet with respect to the rolling direction. This leads to the determination of texture coefficients known as orientation distribution coefficients (ODC). Through-thickness linearly polarized SH waves have then been used to analyse grain morphology using attenuation data, and elasticity measurements from velocity data. EBSD datasets have been manipulated to produce predictions of the effective elastic stiffness constants, which in turn can be used to generate comparable S 0 Lamb wave velocity predictions to be directly compared to the ultrasonic measurements. This process has required a novel method to generate such ultrasonic velocity predictions as a function of angle, together with predictions for the nine effective elastic stiffness constants inherent to rolled orthorhombic sheet. The facility to measure grain size and shape accurately from EBSD data has been utilized. The thesis starts with a general introduction in non-destructive testing and microscopy, with focussed discussion on ultrasound, electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), EBSD and metallurgy in the subsequent chapters. Chapter 6 introduces the development of correlation methods between the ultrasound and EBSD results, with chapters 7 and 8 displaying the empirical ultrasound and EBSD data respectively. Chapter 9 compares the data from the two methods, with the final conclusions given in chapter 10.

40|$|The {{crystalline}} {{texture of}} a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> strongly affects its formability, so having {{knowledge of this}} texture is of great industrial relevance. The texture of <b>rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metals,</b> such as aluminium and steel, may be determined by ultrasonic measurement of the velocity of the zero order symmetric (S- 0) Lamb wave {{as a function of}} angle to the rolling direction. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) may perform this measurement without contacting the sample, therefore reducing perturbation to the plate wave system, as they are electromagnetically coupled to the sheet. The EMAT system measurements are non-destructive and may be made in real time, therefore offering advantages over the conventional techniques such as X-ray and neutron diffraction. It has been noticed that in the two EMAT pitch-catch system, the apparent arrival times of the ultrasonic waves change with variation in lift-off (distance between sample and transducer) due to impedance and aperture effects. For precise and accurate texture parameters to be obtained, accurate absolute ultrasonic velocity measurement is required and hence lift-off must be compensated for. This is of particular importance to online inspection systems where constant lift-off may be difficult to maintain. The impedance behaviour of various coil geometries has been investigated as a function of lift-off and frequency and compared to the received ultrasonic signal and the drive current pulse pro. le. Theoretical models have been used to explain the observed behaviour, and hence a scheme has been proposed for the compensation of lift-off effects in real time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
