2500|$|During the 18th and 19th centuries, Horta was a {{small town}} that {{extended}} along the shoreline. It was peppered by various convents and churches, but little commerce and almost no industry. [...] But, luckily due to its location, it prospered as a stopover on important commercial routes between Europe and the New World. For a time, Horta was a center of commerce and travel.

2500|$|During {{static and}} fatigue testing cracks were {{noticed in the}} wings of several aircraft, and as a {{consequence}} the C-5A fleet was restricted to 80% of maximum design loads. To reduce wing loading, load alleviation systems were added to the aircraft. By 1980, payloads were restricted to as low as [...] for general cargo during peacetime operations. A $1.5 billion program, known as H-Mod, to re-wing the 76 completed C-5As to restore full payload capability and service life began in 1976. After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987. During 1976, numerous cracks were also found in the fuselage along the upper fuselage on the centerline, aft of the <b>refueling</b> <b>port,</b> extending back to the wing. The cracks required a redesign to the hydraulic system for the visor, the front cargo entry point.|$|E

50|$|The KC-135Q variant was {{modified}} to carry JP-7 fuel {{necessary for the}} Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, segregating the JP-7 from the KC-135s own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the wing tanks carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM-56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T {{is the presence of}} a clear window {{on the underside of the}} empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground <b>refueling</b> <b>ports,</b> located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a certain}} amount of {{record-keeping}} in the system, with hits from combat being recorded against gunnery, hull or speed factors. Fuel is also tracked, with provisions for <b>refueling</b> in <b>port</b> as well as at sea. For combat, ships are primarily rated as having primary, secondary and tertiary gunnery factors, which have different ranges and ability to penetrate armor to do damage.|$|R
50|$|On October 12, 2000, the USS Cole - an American {{guided missile}} {{destroyer}} - {{was attacked by}} waterborne terrorists as the American ship was <b>refueling</b> in the <b>port</b> of Aden. Two suicide bombers approached the Cole in a small boat loaded with explosives. Once alongside the ship, the men detonated the explosives, killing themselves and 17 American sailors. It was later determined the bombers were part of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaida terrorist network.|$|R

50|$|Until the Panama Canal {{opened in}} 1914, the Strait of Magellan {{was the main}} route for steamships {{traveling}} from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It was often considered the only safe way to move between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the Drake Passage separating Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America) from Antarctica is notorious for turbulent and unpredictable weather, and is frequented by icebergs and sea ice. Ships in the strait, protected by Tierra del Fuego {{to the south and}} the coast of continental South America to the north crossed with relative ease, and Punta Arenas became a primary <b>refueling</b> <b>port</b> providing coal for steam ships in transit. Sailing ships, however, partly because of variable winds and currents in the strait, generally preferred the Drake Passage, as they had more room to maneuver there.|$|E

50|$|Relieved by Waddell (DDG-24) on 4 April {{after three}} months on station, the warship steamed toward home, passing into the Indian Ocean and {{stopping}} at Colombo on the 9th to <b>refuel.</b> Following <b>port</b> visits to Phuket, Thailand, between 13 and 16 April and at Hong Kong between 23 and 27 April, the guided-missile destroyer moored at Pearl Harbor on 9 May. After a four-week leave and upkeep standdown, Benjamin Stoddert resumed the familiar routine. This included various weapons and supply inspections, equipment alterations in the shipyard, and training ashore for crew members. In addition, the warship participated in a joint Navy-Coast Guard exercise in late June, took part in ASW drills in mid-August, and served as ready duty destroyer {{during the month of}} September. She then began a phased maintenance availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 26 October.|$|R

5000|$|Space {{needed to}} {{accommodate}} personnel and sets of special equipment {{was obtained by}} removing tank turret, cutting away section of hull roof plate and by refitting of superstructure consisting of armour plates and sheet metal that provides adequate ballistic protection of on-board crew and equipment. Armour plates are up to 25 mm thick and mounted so as to provide ballistic protection from 12.7 mm (.5in) bullets. Horizontal roof plate of superstructure is made of several sections to provide necessary hatches. Openings are provided for fitting of commander’s and gunner’s cupolas, two access and evacuation hatches for engineer section, holes for radio set antenna, rotating periscope, driver’s cover, <b>refueling</b> <b>port</b> and two lookout ports (for observation and for firing personal weapons). To perform engineering tasks, a tankgrade blade it fitted at the front, equipped with electric motor, pump and hydraulics. Blade assembly is an autonomous unit that can be quickly and easily attached to the hull. Vehicle firepower consists of one 30 mm automatic grenade launcher and one machine gun (M84, [...]3in/7.62 mm calibre). Vehicle concept permits fitting of weapons group station consisting of a 30 mm gun, 7.62 mm machine gun, antitank wire guided rockets and 30 mm automatic grenade launcher with appropriate optoelectronic fire control system. To protect the crew from nuclear and chemical agents a modified nuclear-chemical protection unit is built-in, consisting of anti radiation fan. This is automatically activated in case of nuclear shock wave. Protection from shaped charges consists of very effective skirts.|$|E
500|$|Almirante Latorre {{was sent}} to the United Kingdom for a {{modernization}} at the Devonport Dockyard in 1929. Departing Chile on 15 May, she traveled past Balboa before traversing the Panama Canal nine days later. After <b>refueling</b> at <b>Port</b> of Spain on 28 May, the dreadnought continued across the Atlantic, passing the Azores before arriving in Plymouth on 24 June. Major alterations included rebuilding the bridge, updating the main battery fire control to more modern standards and adding it for the secondary armament for the first time, and replacing her steam turbine engines. Also added were a new mast between the third and fourth turrets, anti-torpedo bulges similar to the British s, and new anti-aircraft guns. Nearly two years after the modernization began, Almirante Latorre sailed back to Valparaíso on 5 March 1931 and put in on 12 April. Two [...] tug boats which had been acquired for use in the harbors of Punta Arenas and Valparaíso were carried on the battleship's deck during her voyage back to Chile.|$|R

One of the watertight doors to the engine room may have been missing, though this issue was later determined to be moot. Much more importantly, however, crucial stability was lost by the earlier failure, during routine operations, to ballast the mostly empty fuel tanks as the builders had specified.

50|$|Through {{the final}} year of the war, Trippe and her sister ships slowly bested the enemy. Convoys of {{merchant}} ships carried troops and supplies to France, where the armies of the Allies grew steadily. By the fall of 1918, they reached a point of overwhelming superiority over those of the Central Powers. On 11 November, the day of the signing of the armistice, Trippe was in port at Queenstown. Just over a month later, she cleared that Irish <b>port,</b> <b>refueled</b> at the Azores and Bermuda, and returned to Boston on 3 January 1919. After six months of operations along the eastern seaboard, the destroyer entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 July for preinactivation overhaul. On 6 November 1919, Trippe was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|R

50|$|To further control traffic {{required}} by the war effort methods applied by the British were employed in which rates were adjusted and control was exercised through the division's Chartering Committee whose approval was necessary to obtain license to <b>refuel</b> in U.S. <b>ports.</b> With U.S. registered ships already under tight control these regulations were largely directed at neutrals. A specific example was the preferred trade by neutrals in manganese with eastern South America when the war effort required nitrates from the west coast countries so that the board's efforts were directed to shift the balance. Enforcement of rates was strict and at one point, before wide compliance, 136 steamers were held in U.S. ports. By December 1918 the USSB directly controlled such {{a large portion of}} U.S. shipping through ownership and charter that the USSB's prewar rate setting regulatory function had largely become a minor factor.|$|R

5000|$|The Nevadas {{were the}} Navys first battleships to have oil {{as their primary}} fuel and the last to use twin-screw {{propulsion}} (all subsequent battleships would use four screws). Oil boasted greater thermal efficiency, allowed greater range per ton of fuel carried (something that would come in handy for Pacific operations, with their logistical supply challenges), and could be taken on while underway (although the technique was not perfected until after World War I), while coal-burning ships could not be <b>refueled</b> except in <b>port,</b> or (with great difficulty) at a dead stop. Oil made it far easier to raise steam, eliminated waste caused by [...] "burning down fires" [...] in port after docking, and did not leave any solid waste {{that needed to be}} frequently manually cleared away as coal did. Smaller boilers could be used, while forced draft and sealed fire rooms, with their corresponding drain of auxiliary power through the use of numerous ventilators, could be eliminated entirely. The subsequent weight and space savings allowed the entire propulsion plant to be combined amidships in a compartment almost the entire inside width of the ship but only 24 m long. The reduced length presented a smaller target area for enemy gunners. Oil also allowed these ships to manage with only one funnel, and reduced the number of stokers by 50 percent. Also, the backbreaking work of constant manual coal shoveling was eliminated. The savings in weight were used for extra armor protection. Side bunkers were omitted completely; fuel was stored in tanks located in the double bottom. Flood control in the event of underwater hits was also improved since there were no coal scuttle doors to spring open and thus compromise watertight integrity.|$|R
