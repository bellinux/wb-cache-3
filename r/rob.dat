40|$|Social {{transmission}} of acquired foraging techniques is rarely considered {{outside of a}} vertebrate context. Here, however, we show that nectar <b>robbing</b> by bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris) —an invertebrate behaviour of considerable ecological significance—has the potential to spread through a population at the accelerated rates typical of social transmission. Nectar <b>robbing</b> occurs when individuals either bite through {{the base of a}} flower to ‘steal’ nectar (primary <b>robbing)</b> or use <b>robbing</b> holes that others have made (secondary <b>robbing).</b> We found that experience of foraging from <b>robbed</b> flowers significantly promoted the development of primary <b>robbing</b> in previously legitimate foragers, thus implying that the acquisition of nectar <b>robbing</b> by one individual will facilitate its adoption in others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback effects of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically important role in the relationship between plants and pollinators...|$|R
40|$|Robertsonian translocations (<b>ROBs)</b> are {{the most}} common {{chromosomal}} rearrangements in humans. <b>ROBs</b> are whole-arm rearrangements between the acrocentric chromosomes 13 – 15, 21, and 22. <b>ROBs</b> can be classified into two groups depending on their frequency of occurrence, common (rob(13 q 14 q) and rob(14 q 21 q)), and rare (all remaining possible nonhomologous combinations). Herein, we have studied 29 case subjects of common and rare de novo <b>ROBs</b> to determine their parental origins and timing of formation. We compared these case subjects to 35 published case subjects of common <b>ROBs</b> and found that most common <b>ROBs</b> apparently have the same breakpoints and arise mainly during oogenesis (50 / 54). These probably form through a common mechanism and have been termed “class 1. ” Collectively, rare <b>ROBs</b> also occur mostly during oogenesis (7 / 10) but probably arise through a more “random ” mechanism or a variety of mechanisms and have been termed “class 2. ” Thus, we demonstrate that although both classes of <b>ROBs</b> occur predominantly during meiosis, the common, class 1 <b>ROBs</b> occur primarily during oogenesis and likely form through a mechanism distinct from that forming class 2 <b>ROBs.</b> De novo chromosomal rearrangements provide excellent reagents for investigating the molecular mechanisms of their formation. The first step toward determining the mechanisms is to identify the “breakpoint. ” For man...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{southern}} England, Linaria vulgaris (common yellow toadflax) {{suffers from}} {{high rates of}} nectar robbery by bumblebees. In a wild population of L. vulgaris we found that 96 % of open flowers were <b>robbed.</b> Five species of bumblebee were observed foraging on these flowers, although short-tongued species (Bombus lapidarius, B. lucorum and B. terrestris) <b>robbed</b> nectar whilst longer-tongued ones behaved as legitimate pollinators (B. hortorum and B. pascuorum). Nectar rewards were highly variable; on average there was less nectar in <b>robbed</b> than in unrobbed flowers, but this difference was not statistically significant. The proportion of flowers containing no nectar was significantly higher for <b>robbed</b> flowers compared with unrobbed flowers. Secondary robbers and legitimate pollinators had similar handling times on flowers and, assuming they select flowers at random to forage on, received approximately the same nectar profit per minute, largely because most flowers had been <b>robbed.</b> There {{was no significant difference}} in the number of seeds in pods of <b>robbed</b> flowers and in pods of flowers that were artificially protected against <b>robbing.</b> However, more of the <b>robbed</b> flowers set at least some seed than the unrobbed flowers, possibly as a consequence of the experimental manipulation. We suggest that nectar <b>robbing</b> has little effect on plant fecundity because legitimate foragers are present in the population, and that seed predation and seed abortion after fertilization may be more important factors in limiting seed production in this species. © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R
