5|$|A {{scientific}} {{description of}} the silky shark was first published by the German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle under the name Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis, in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus. Because Müller and Henle's type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult silky sharks were historically not recognized as C.falciformis and were described as a separate species, Carcharhinus floridanus, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack Garrick, Richard Backus, and <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs,</b> Jr. synonymized C.floridanus with C.falciformis in 1964.|$|E

25|$|Obama {{opposes the}} idea of legally prosecuting CIA {{personnel}} who committed waterboarding based upon legal advice provided by superiors. The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized his stance.

On 23 April 2009, White House Press Secretary <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> stated that the administration had changed its position and now opposes such an idea. The topic has been subject to heated internal debate within the White House.|$|E

25|$|The United States Department of Homeland Security {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that the incident {{did not appear to be}} linked to organized international terrorist groups. White House spokesman <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> reaffirmed what Homeland Security said, and that President Barack Obama was briefed on the incident. The President expressed his concern and commended the courageous actions of the first responders. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) launched two F-16 fighter aircraft from Ellington Airport in Houston, Texas, to conduct an air patrol in response to the crash. That action was reported as standard operating procedure in this situation.|$|E
25|$|White House Press Secretary, <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> {{said the}} effort to get a team in place {{to respond to the}} health scare has not been {{hindered}} by the lack of a secretary of Health and Human Services or appointees in any of the department’s 19 key posts. The president's nominee, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, was still awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate until passing on April 28. The President has not yet made appointments to either the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the Surgeon General, or the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current acting Surgeon General, Steven K. Galson, is also currently serving as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Health.|$|E

500|$|The work surpasses Cimabue's c. 1268 Arezzo {{crucifix}} {{in several}} ways. It is more human and less reliant on idealised facial types, and the anatomy is more convincing. Christ's face is longer and narrower, and his nose less idealised. These features, according to art historian <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs,</b> give him [...] "a coarser but more personal expression".

500|$|Although <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs,</b> White House press secretary, {{indicated}} {{at first}} that President Obama did not plan to retake the oath, Chief Justice Roberts agreed to re-administer the oath {{at the request of}} White House counsel Greg Craig. The second oath ceremony took place on the evening of January 21, 2009 in the Map Room of the White House before a small audience of presidential aides, reporters and a White House photographer. Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re-administer the oath out of an abundance of caution. Craig added that [...] "the oath of office was administered effectively and... the President was sworn in appropriately... But the oath appears in the Constitution itself." [...] No Bible was present during the retake of the inauguration.|$|E

500|$|White House Press Secretary <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano {{said several}} times on Sunday talk shows that [...] "the system had worked", a {{statement}} that engendered some controversy.

[...] According to Napolitano, her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time, and new security requirements for the final hour of flight, rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen. Napolitano had originally stated on This Week that [...] "once this incident occurred, everything went according to clockwork" [...] and that [...] "once the incident occurred, the system worked".|$|E

He elaborated, [...] "To watch an umpire take responsibility and to watch a pitcher do what he did, the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there—I think that gives a lot of heart (...) I think it's tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that {{they made a mistake}} and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake.

500|$|During a February 2010 {{television}} interview, Sestak {{said that}} in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if {{he dropped out of}} the race.

In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if I got out." [...] Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, [...] "I was asked a direct question yesterday and I answered it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." [...] Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, White House Press Secretary <b>Robert</b> <b>Gibbs</b> said he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were [...] "not problematic." ...|$|E
