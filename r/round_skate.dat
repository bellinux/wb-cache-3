5|$|The thornback {{guitarfish}} was scientifically {{described by}} American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in an 1880 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum. They assigned it to the genus Platyrhina, and named it triseriata from the Latin tres ("three") and series ("row"), {{in reference to the}} three rows of thorns on its back. One year later in the same journal, Samuel Garman placed this species in a newly created genus, Platyrhinoidis. The type specimen is an adult male caught off Santa Barbara on February 8, 1880. Other common names for this species include banjo shark (not {{to be confused with the}} Australian banjo sharks, Trygonorrhina), California thornback, guitarfish, <b>round</b> <b>skate,</b> shovelnose, thornback, and thornback ray.|$|E
50|$|Irolita is a genus of softnose skates, family Rajidae, {{commonly}} known as the round skates. There are two species, both endemic to Australia, found over soft bottoms on the outer continental shelves and upper continental slopes, at depths of 50-200 m for the southern <b>round</b> <b>skate</b> and 142-209 m for the western <b>round</b> <b>skate.</b> The distributions of the two species do not overlap.|$|E

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} {{data were}} used to investigate spatial, seasonal and inter-annual patterns of feeding of the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) in the Barents Sea during 1994 – 2000. The diets and food consumption by the thorny skate of different size groups were analyzed and assessed with special reference to the consumption of commercial species of fishes and crustaceans. Less comprehensive data on food composition are presented for other less abundant Barents Sea skates: arctic skate (A. hyperborea), <b>round</b> <b>skate</b> (Rajella fyllae), blue skate (Dipturus batis), spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and sail ray (D. linteus) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of 5 061 stomach of five skate species- thorny (Amblyraja radiata), Arctic (A. hyperborea), spinytail (Bathyraja spinicauda), smooth (Malacoraja senta) and round skates (Rajella fyllae) obtained from Spanish Bottom Trawl Research Surveys in northwest and northeast Atlantic (NAFO, Divisions 3 NO and Div. 3 M; ICES, Div. IIb) {{in the period}} 1996 - 2005 were analyzed to study the feeding intensity and food habits. Feeding intensity was high in all skate species and areas, slightly higher in Div. IIb, showing a general trend to decrease according to the predator size increase. Importance of prey was based in weight percentage. The main prey groups for thorny and Arctic skates were Pisces and Crustacea, but the importance of each group and prey species changed with area. Pisces has {{turn out to be}} the dominant prey taxa for spinytail skate in Div. 3 NO and 3 M. Crustacea have been the dominant prey group for smooth skate. <b>Round</b> <b>skate</b> has changed its main prey group in each area, but polychaetes have been prominent in Div. 3 NO. Predation on fishing processed remnant was important for Arctic skate. Predation on several species of commercial importance was mainly relevant in Div. 3 M. Intra-specific diet overlap showed a different pattern varying with skate species and area. Inter-specific diet overlap reached its highest level in the Arctic area. Thorny skate showed a high diet overlap with the majority of the skate species studied in the NAFO Area, and <b>round</b> <b>skate</b> did not show diet overlap with other skate species in Div. 3 NO. Thorny skate appear as dominant predator in NAFO Div. 3 NO...|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of skates (Rajidae) in the by-catch of trawl and long-line fisheries in the Barents Sea are described. The dominant species captured were thorny skate or starry ray (Amblyraja radi-ate), arctic skate (A. hyperborea) and <b>round</b> <b>skate</b> (Rajella fyllae), whereas blue or big skate (Dipturus batis) and sail ray (D. linteus) were only caught occasionally. Information {{on the size}} distribution and sex ratio are provided. Larger skates were more often caught in long-line fisheries, with the mean and maximum length of fish greater in long-line catches, particularly for the larger-bodied species. Ratio of males to females was close to 1 : 1 in all species except for arctic skate where males dominated in the long-line fishery. Preliminary estimates of skate by-catch in these fisheries indicate that total annual by-catch of skate in the Barents Sea ranges from 723 – 1 891 tons. Thorny skate accounted for 90 – 95 % of the total skate catch...|$|E

60|$|The German {{officer said}} he was desolate. Steps would be taken--later in the week--the result of which would {{probably}} be to render that young hairdresser prematurely bald. But, meanwhile, beyond <b>skating</b> <b>round</b> and round them, for which they did not even feel they wanted to thank him, the German officer could do nothing for them. They tried being rude to the hairdresser: he mistook it for American chic. They tried joining hands and running away from him, {{but they were not}} good skaters, and he thought they were trying to show him the cake walk. They both fell down and hurt themselves, {{and it is difficult to}} be angry with a man, even a hairdresser, when he is doing his best to pick you up and comfort you.|$|R
50|$|The spotback skate {{is found}} across {{most of the}} {{continental}} shelf year <b>round.</b> The spotback <b>skate's</b> diet is a versatile and mainly piscivorous consumer. Their diet shifts with increasing body size and {{as a response to}} seasonal and regional changes in prey abundance and distribution. They prey mostly on teleost, cephalopods, elasmobranchs, and decapods. Smaller spotback skate tend to consume decapods and the larger skates ate elasmobranchs and cephalopods. The consumption of teleosts differed between seasons depending on whether the teleost were demersal- benthic or benthic. The more demersal- benthic teleosts were consumed during the cold season while the benthic teleosts were eaten during the warm season. The decapods, cephalopods and elasmobranchs were predominantly shrimps, octopuses, and skates. The main cephalopod consumed in the warm season was the octopus.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all animals}} have {{circular}} pupils. Some have slits or ovals {{which may be}} oriented vertically, as in crocodiles, vipers, cats and foxes, or horizontally as in some rays, flying frogs, mongooses and artiodactyls such as sheep, elk, red deer, reindeer and hippopotamus, {{as well as the}} domestic horse. Goats, toads and octopus pupils tend to be horizontal and rectangular with <b>rounded</b> corners. Some <b>skates</b> and rays have crescent shaped pupils, gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes, and the cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W shape. There are rare cases of humans with very unusually shaped pupils, such as peanut-shell-shaped pupils, as if the sides of the pupils are pinched together in the middle, like a vertical peanut shell, being wide at {{the top and bottom of}} the pupil, but narrow in the middle.|$|R
5|$|The SuperSkills {{competition}} {{began with}} the Fastest Skater competition, where the competitors skated one lap around the rink. The winner of each round earned a point for their team. The opening <b>round</b> was <b>skated</b> backwards, followed by each team's rookie representative. Then two goaltenders skated off {{before returning to the}} traditional form. Following preliminary rounds the two fastest competitors from each team faced off in a final round, where Michael Grabner defeated Taylor Hall earning two points for Team Staal. The Breakaway Challenge featured six players (three from each team) taking four shoot-out attempts. Fans voted for the winner via text message. The winner earned four points for his team. Second place was awarded three points and third received one point. Alexander Ovechkin won by a wide margin defeating second place P. K. Subban by over 17 percentage points, it was the third consecutive win in the competition by Ovechkin. Loui Eriksson finished third to round out the point earners from the competition. The Shooting Accuracy featured two players shooting targets in the four corners of the net. Winners were determined by the fastest player to hit all four targets. Daniel Sedin hit all four targets on four shots in his first round setting the overall fastest time hitting them all in just 7.3 seconds. He followed that up by hitting four in five shots during the final round to defeat the Blackhawks' Patrick Kane.|$|R

60|$|The impenetrability of this {{regulated}} life irritated him, and he {{strove to}} learn something of the human side of these people. He retired baffled, to be trained by his menials. In America, the native demoralises the English servant. In England, the servant educates the master. Wilton Sargent strove to learn all they taught as ardently as his father had striven to wreck, before capture, the railways of his native land; and {{it must have been}} some touch of the old bandit railway blood that bade him buy, for a song, Holt Hangars, whose forty-acre lawn, as every one knows, sweeps down in velvet to the quadruple tracks of the Great Buchonian Railway. Their trains flew by almost continuously, with a bee-like drone in the day and a flutter of strong wings at night. The son of Merton Sargent had good right to be interested in them. He owned controlling interests in several thousand miles of track,--not permanent way,--built on altogether different plans, where locomotives eternally whistled for grade-crossings, and parlor-cars of fabulous expense and unrestful design <b>skated</b> <b>round</b> curves that the Great Buchonian would have condemned as unsafe in a construction-line.
