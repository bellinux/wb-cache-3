40|$|Abstract—This study {{builds on}} the earlier work by Odedina and Afullo on Multipath fading in Durban. Their work was based on {{multipath}} measurements in Durban over a 6. 73 km Line-of-Sight (LOS) link. This submission uses the geoclimatic factor approach and ITU-R recommendations P 530 - 14 to obtain the multipath fading occurrence in five cities in South Africa, including Durban. Three-year radiosonde data is used in estimating the percentage of time that a certain fade depth is exceeded and hence outage probability due to atmospheric multipath propagation, assuming the given fade depth leads to the received signal falling below the squelch level. We employ the Inverse Distance Square technique to estimate point <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> not exceeded for 1 % {{of the time in}} the lowest 65 m above the ground for five locations within South Africa. Standard error of the mean and confidence interval for both annual averages and seasonal averages of point <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> is calculated to reflect possible deviation in the given readings. These values of point <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> obtained are used in determining the geoclimatic factor K. The results presented show monthly, seasonal and annual variation of both point <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> and geoclimatic factor K. The results confirm that the geoclimatic factor K is region based. The percentage of time a given fade depth is exceeded for a single frequency increases rapidly with increasing path length. This {{is due to the fact}} that as the path length increases so do the multiple reflections leading to multipath propagation, which can result in either signal enhancement or multipath fading.

40|$|Abstract—The {{availability}} of fixed radio links, especially at latitudes below 40 degrees, can be severely affected by sub-refractive events that {{may only be}} present {{for an hour or}} two each year, or around the 99. 98 % point of the <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> distribution. This tail point is beyond the highest per-centile currently available from world-wide meteorological model predictions. In many countries radiosonde data is too sparsely distributed for useful accuracy, so a more densely distributed data source is required. This suggests the use of surface meteorological data, which is generally available from many automatic weather stations at good time resolution.

40|$|The typical {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} (ABL) over the southeast (SE) Pacific Ocean is featured {{with a strong}} temperature inversion and a sharp moisture gradient across the ABL top. The strong moisture and temperature gradients result in a sharp <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> that can be precisely detected by the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) measurements. In this paper, the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere & Climate (COSMIC) GPS RO soundings, radiosondes and the high-resolution ECMWF analysis over the SE Pacific are analyzed. COSMIC RO is able to detect {{a wide range of}} ABL height variations (1 – 2 km) as observed from the radiosondes. However, the ECMWF analysis systematically underestimates the ABL heights. The sharp <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> at the ABL top frequently exceeds the critical refraction (e. g., − 157 N-unit km − 1) and becomes the so-called ducting condition, which results in a systematic RO refractivity bias (or called N -bias) inside the ABL. Simulation study based on radiosonde profiles reveals the magnitudes of the N -biases are vertical resolution dependent. The $N$-bias is also the primary cause of the systematically smaller <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> (rarely exceeding − 110 N-unit km − 1) at the ABL top from RO measurement. However, the N -bias seems not affect the ABL height detection. Instead, the very large RO bending angle and the sharp <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> due to ducting allow reliable detection of the ABL height from GPS RO. The seasonal mean climatology of ABL heights derived from a nine-month composite of COSMIC RO soundings over the SE Pacific reveals significant differences from the ECMWF analysis. Both show an increase of ABL height from the shallow stratocumulus near the coast to a much higher trade wind inversion further off the coast. However, COSMIC RO shows an overall deeper ABL and reveals different locations of the minimum and maximum ABL heights as compared to the ECMWF analysis. At low latitudes, despite the decreasing number of COSMIC RO soundings and the lower percentage of soundings that penetrate into the lowest 500 -m above the mean-sea-level, there are small sampling errors in the mean ABL height climatology. The difference of ABL height climatology between COSMIC RO and ECMWF analysis over SE Pacific is significant and requires further studies...|$|E

40|$|Horizontal <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradients</b> in the {{atmosphere}} introduce errors in retrieved profiles from radio oc-cultation measurements. These errors are introduced because the profiles are retrieved using the assump-tion of spherical symmetry and interpreted as verti-cal profiles. However, a more correct interpretation would be {{to think of them}} as a mapping of the two-dimensional structure of the refractivity into a one-dimensional profile. For data assimilation purposes this is an important realization, because error covari-ances may be significantly reduced if the retrieved profiles are interpreted in a way more closely related to {{the manner in which the}} data are obtained and processed. In this paper we assess close to worst-case errors in retrieved refractivity profiles by simulating the occultation measurements in cases where the sig-nals propagate through a model of a weather front, including moisture. The synthetic occultation data are inverted using the assumption of spherical sym-metry to obtain retrieved refractivity profiles. We compare the retrieved refractivity profiles with pro-files obtained from the frontal model in three differ-ent ways: i) refractivity values at the tangent points, ii) refractivity values averaged over 2 ◦ of longitude in the occultation plane, and iii) a mapping of the two-dimensional refractivity field in the occultation plane into a one-dimensional profile.

Propagation models are in existence, which cope with the varying environment and allow a performance prediction for sensors in different radar bands.

40|$|A self-consistent {{remote sensing}} {{physical}} method to retrieve atmospheric humidity high-resolution profiles by synergetic {{use of a}} microwave radiometer profiler (MWRP) and wind profiler radar (WPR) is illustrated. The proposed technique {{is based on the}} processing of WPR data for estimating the potential <b>refractivity</b> <b>gradient</b> profiles and their optimal combination with MWRP estimates of potential temperature profiles in order to fully retrieve humidity gradient profiles. The combined algorithm makes use of recent developments in WPR signal processing, computing the zeroth-, first-, and second-order moments of WPR Doppler spectra via a fuzzy logic method, which provides quality control of radar data in the spectral domain. On the other hand, the application of neural network to brightness temperatures, measured by a multichannel MWRP, can provide continuous estimates of tropospheric temperature and humidity profiles.

The derivation of the occultation light curve in terms of the atmosphere, the angular diameter of the occulted star, and the occultation geometry is outlined.

The worst month link availability is investigated for terrestrial microwave LOS/NLOS radio links operating in NATO Band 3 + (1350 - 2690 MHz) and NATO Band 4 (4400 - 5000 MHz) frequency bands. The calculation of Bullington model of diffraction loss is extended for LOS path case and determination of reflection points on the terrain profile is improved.

The measurements confirm the feasibility of open-loop signal tracking down to geometric elevation angles of − 1 to − 1. 5 ° extending the corresponding closed-loop tracking range by up to  1 °. The study {{is based on the}} premise that observations of low-elevation events by a ground-based receiver may serve as test cases for space-based radio occultation measurements, even if the latter proceed at a significantly faster temporal scale. The results support the conclusion that the open-loop Doppler model has negligible influence on the derived carrier frequency profile for strong signal-to-noise density ratios above about 30  dB Hz. At lower signal levels, however, the OpenGPS receiver's dual-channel design, which tracks the same signal using two Doppler models differing by 10  Hz, uncovers a notable bias.
