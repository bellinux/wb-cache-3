The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, <b>relapsing</b> fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (<b>relapsing</b> forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, {{despite a lack of}} evidence. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a <b>relapsing</b> course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to analyse}} risk of <b>relapse</b> {{phenotype}} recurrence in multiple sclerosis and to characterise the effect of demographic and clinical features on this phenotype. Methods: Information about <b>relapses</b> was collected using MSBase, an international observational registry. Associations between <b>relapse</b> phenotypes and history of similar <b>relapses</b> or patient characteristics were tested with multivariable logistic regression models. Tendency of <b>relapse</b> phenotypes to recur sequentially was assessed with principal component analysis. Results: Among 14, 969 eligible patients (89, 949 patient-years), 49, 279 phenotypically characterised <b>relapses</b> were recorded. Visual and brainstem <b>relapses</b> occurred more frequently in early disease and in younger patients. Sensory <b>relapses</b> were more frequent in early or non-progressive disease. Pyramidal, sphincter and cerebellar <b>relapses</b> were more common in older patients and in progressive disease. Women presented more often with sensory or visual symptoms. Men were more prone to pyramidal, brainstem and cerebellar <b>relapses.</b> Importantly, <b>relapse</b> phenotype was predicted by the phenotypes of previous <b>relapses.</b> (OR = 1. 8 - 5, p = 10 - 14 ⁻¹⁴). Sensory, visual and brainstem <b>relapses</b> showed better recovery than other <b>relapse</b> phenotypes. <b>Relapse</b> severity increased {{and the ability to}} recover decreased with age or more advanced disease.

40|$|Background: <b>Relapse</b> {{is common}} among {{recovered}} anorexia nervosa (AN) patients. Studies on <b>relapse</b> prevention {{with an average}} follow-up period of 18 months found <b>relapse</b> rates between 35 and 41 %. In leading guidelines there is general consensus that <b>relapse</b> prevention in patients treated for AN {{is a matter of}} essence. However, lack of methodological support hinders the practical implementation of <b>relapse</b> prevention strategies in clinical practice. For this reason we developed the Guideline <b>Relapse</b> Prevention Anorexia Nervosa. In this study we examine the rate, timing and predictors of <b>relapse</b> when using this guideline. Method: Cohort study with 83 AN patients who were enrolled in a <b>relapse</b> prevention program for anorexia nervosa with 18 months follow-up. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meijer survival analyses and Cox regression. Results: Eleven percent of the participants experienced a full <b>relapse,</b> 19 % a partial <b>relapse,</b> 70 % did not <b>relapse.</b> Survival analyses indicated that in the first four months of the program no full <b>relapses</b> occurred. The highest risk of full <b>relapse</b> was between months 4 and 16. None of the variables remained a significant predictor of <b>relapse</b> in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. Conclusion: The guideline offers structured procedures for <b>relapse</b> prevention. In this study the <b>relapse</b> rates were relatively low compared to <b>relapse</b> rates in previous studies. We recommend that all patients with AN set up a personalized <b>relapse</b> prevention plan {{at the end of their}} treatment and be monitored at least 18 months after discharge. It may significantly contribute to the reduction of <b>relapse</b> rates...|$|R

5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation.

The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin.

The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>relapses</b> on {{long-term}} disability in multiple sclerosis remains unclear; however some {{evidence suggests that}} <b>relapses</b> {{play an important role}} in determining subsequent prognosis. We report on outcome, prognostic factors for recovery and the contribution of <b>relapses</b> to the accumulation of fixed disability in a large series of patients with documented <b>relapses.</b> Two hundred and seventy-nine <b>relapses</b> in 182 patients were assessed before, during and after <b>relapse</b> by expanded disability status scale and data analysed to assess degree of recovery. Factors affecting outcome were considered including sex, age and site of <b>relapse.</b> Mean EDSS prior to <b>relapse</b> was 3. 73, during <b>relapse</b> 5. 18 and post <b>relapse</b> 4. 23. Mean interval to post <b>relapse</b> assessment was 127 days post <b>relapse.</b> Mean residual change in EDSS score (pre to post <b>relapse)</b> was 0. 50 points. Overall 49. 4 % of patients had a residual increase in disability post <b>relapse</b> of at least 0. 5 EDSS points and 32. 7 % had an increase of at least 1 point. No significant difference was observed in mean residual EDSS for sex, site of <b>relapse</b> or age at <b>relapse</b> or in the proportion of patients with a residual increase in disability of > or = 1 EDSS point post <b>relapse.</b> 14. 4 % of patients had no increase in EDSS score during <b>relapse</b> compared to pre <b>relapse.</b> These results suggest that acute <b>relapses</b> are commonly associated with an objective worsening of disability in the majority of patients with MS and that recovery is incomplete in approximately half and not influenced by gender, age or site of lesion. Therapies which reduce <b>relapse</b> frequency and/or severity might therefore be expected to slow or prevent worsening of disability if initiated prior to the onset of more permanent damage...|$|R

5|$|The {{condition}} {{begins in}} 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) {{over a number}} of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a <b>relapsing</b> and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAllogeneic {{hematopoietic cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) {{is considered a}} curative treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Extramedullary <b>relapse</b> after HSCT for AML is a rare event and is less well defined than systemic, hematologic <b>relapse.</b> We retrospectively studied all patients with AML (n = 436) who underwent HSCT at the University of Minnesota between 1996 and 2008 who developed either a bone marrow (BM) or extramedullary (EM) <b>relapse,</b> and examined the incidence and risk factors for BM and EM <b>relapse.</b> Of 128 patients who <b>relapsed</b> post-HSCT, 25 had <b>relapse</b> in EM sites, either isolated (n = 13) or with concurrent BM <b>relapse</b> (n = 12). <b>Relapse</b> sites included bone (n = 1), central nervous system (n = 6), gastrointestinal (n = 4), lymphatic (n = 4), skin (n = 5), genitourinary (n = 1), pulmonary (n = 1), and soft tissue (n = 3). The time to <b>relapse</b> was longer in the EM sites (median, 328 days vs 168 days).
