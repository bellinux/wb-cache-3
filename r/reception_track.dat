40|$|Recording a {{video call}} {{recording}} is beneficial {{in cases like}} job interviews and business meetings. Skype or Google Hangouts for example have no recording implemented without additional plugins. MP 4 file container is capable of containing different types of media tracks, is widely used and is supported by media players and has a feature called RTP/RTCP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Tracks.</b> Hint tracks contain media transmission instructions, which can be used, e. g., to record RTP stream into a file. Without this information the video call session cannot be replayed afterwards. The purpose of this Thesis is to implement and verify the usage of RTP and RTCP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Tracks</b> in video call recording. No open-source MP 4 multiplexing library or a media player with support for RTP/RTCP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Tracks</b> was found, so the support had to be implemented in both the library and the media player. The setup includes Linphone and L-SMASH for recording and VLC media player for playback. The created MP 4 file has two RTP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Tracks,</b> two RTCP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Tracks,</b> and two media tracks. The GSM audio is chosen because it is supported by Linphone, L-SMASH, and VLC media player. H. 264 /AVC is chosen for video, {{because it is the}} best available codec supported by the three software. Tests were carried out using two laptops with both having recording enabled. From the tests it is concluded that using the RTP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Track</b> increases the total CPU usage by less than 1 % {{and the size of the}} recorded video call by 4 % over the conventional media tracks. The implementation shows that RTP <b>Reception</b> Hint <b>Tracks</b> meet well the needs of implementations with choice of different codecs...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the keyhole {{problems}} associated with present antenna mounting systems and to meet the requirements of acquisition and tracking for high gain and narrow beamwidth antennas, a novel antenna mount system is developed. The antenna is mounted on a microprocessor controlled robotic platform with six degrees of freedom. The mechanism is based on the principles of Stewart platform, which employes six variable length actuators constrained between a fixed base and a movable platform. This antenna mount is especially suitable for high gain antennas using high frequency band widths for marine satellite communications. The kinematics and geometry of the parallel link mechanism has been studied in detail. The kinematic analysis for the parallel manipulator consists of developing a set of kinematic equations for the six linear actuators in terms of the "world coordinates" (–§,Œ∏,Œ±,x,y,z). These kinematic equations are then solved for the "machine coordinates'" (L 1,L 2,L 3,L 4,L 5,L 6), which are the six actuator lengths. A computer simulation has been done to model the motion of the platform. The simulation has simplified the task of examining various mechanism configurations, the range of motion and the mechanism mechanical constraints. A six motor controller board based on the motion controller microprocessors has been developed. Limited unipolar pulse width modulated servo drives are used to drive the permanent magnet DC motors of the linear actuators. A desktop computer is used as the host processor to generate the command data. The motion control microprocessors generate the velocity and acceleration profiles and drive the six axes simultaneously. The main control programme residing in the host processor schedules the overall operation. The orbital satellite bearings are calculated on a minicomputer and downloaded to the control desktop computer. A prototype antenna mount based on the descriptions above was designed, constructed and tested for tracking a high pass and low pass of an orbiting weather satellite, (the NOAA- 7). A microwave antenna mounted on the platform was found to be capable of tracking an orbital satellite throughout the visible hemisphere, although the <b>reception</b> <b>tracking</b> has not been inplemented. This antenna mount offers a light weight, structurally strong and fast dynamic response tracking system for land and marine applications. This parallel robotic mechanism has potential for further applications such as a prepackaged portable communications system which can be deployed rapidly at remote construction sites or during civil defence emergencies. In addition it may be employed as a stabilized platform which can be used for marine VTOL aircraft recovery during rough weather. The application of this antenna mount in a low cost marine satellite communications system is emphasized since the fast dynamic response of the system will eliminate the need for an expensive stabilized platform...|$|R

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîThis paper proposes an {{adaptive}} multiantenna transceiver for narrowband <b>reception.</b> Blind channel <b>tracking</b> algorithms are developed {{to track the}} eigen directions of the channel directly instead of the channel itself. Two algorithms are proposed to track the column space of the channel at the receiver, based on the received data. One of the algorithms is free of any division operation, which is more favorable in practice. For the row space of the channel, two approaches are proposed as well. The first approach requires periodic feedback of the demodulated signal from the receiver back to the transmitter where it can make use of its knowledge on the prior transmitted symbols to estimate the row space. In the second approach, the estimation is done at the receiver based on the detected symbols, and the estimated row space is sending back to the transmitter. Adaptive resource allocation is also incorporated into the design. Index Terms‚ÄîAdaptive array processing, blind channel tracking, multielement arrays, transceiver architecture. I...|$|R
