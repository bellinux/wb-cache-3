30|$|Spline {{functions}} and, all {{the more}} by and large, piecewise polynomial functions are the best approximating capacities being used today. A large {{number of studies have}} been conducted on the utilization of cubic, quadratic, and quintic splines at territorial and national levels (McAllister and <b>Roulie</b> 1978; Sakai and Usmani 1983; Siddiqi and Akram 2008; Wu and Zhang 2014; Rababah et al. 2017; Herriot and Reinsch 1976; Alayed et al. 2016; Yang and Wang 1994; Holnicki 1996 : Tariq and Akram 2016; Meshram et al. 2017 a, b, c; Meshram and Powar 2017). Use of spline function is expanding step by step in the areas of different sciences, medicine, farming, and engineering. The cubic spline is the most generally and broadly utilized by spline function; the quadratic spline is also well considered. Thusly, the target {{of this paper is to}} apply quadratic and quintic splines to soil erosion modeling and to compare with the cubic spline.|$|E
