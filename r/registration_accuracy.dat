40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} method to learn {{deformation}} parameters off-line for fast multimodal registration of ultrasound and magnetic resonance prostate images during ultrasound guided needle biopsy. The method {{is based on a}} learning phase where deformation models are built from the deformation parameters of a splinebased non-linear diffeomorphism between training ultrasound and magnetic resonance prostate images using spectral clustering. Deformation models comprising of the eigen-modes of each cluster in a Gaussian space are applied on a test magnetic resonance image to register with the test ultrasound prostate image. The deformation model with the least registration error is finally chosen as the optimal model for deformable registration. The rationale behind modeling deformations is to achieve fast multimodal registration of prostate images while maintaining <b>registration</b> <b>accuracies</b> which is otherwise computationally expensive.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} factors that affect the <b>accuracy</b> of intensity-based <b>registration</b> of {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) X-ray fluoroscopy to three-dimensional (3 D) CT data is the similarity measure, which is a criterion function that {{is used in the}} registration procedure for measuring the quality of image match. This pa-per presents a unifying framework for rationally deriving point similarity meas-ures based on Markov random field (MRF) modeling of difference images which are obtained by comparing the reference fluoroscopic images with their associated digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR’s). The optimal solution is defined as the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the MRF. Three novel point similarity measures derived from this framework are presented. They are evaluated using a phantom and a human cadaveric specimen. Combining any one of the newly proposed similarity measures with a previously introduced spline-based registration scheme, we develop a fast and accurate registration al-gorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the automatic registration of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds using panoramic reflectance images. The approach follows a two-step procedure that includes both pair-wise registration and global registration. The pair-wise registration consists of image matching (pixel-to-pixel correspondence) and point cloud registration (point-to-point correspondence), as the correspondence between the image and the point cloud (pixel-to-point) is inherent to the reflectance images. False correspondences are removed by a geometric invariance check. The pixel to-point correspondence and the computation of the rigid transformation parameters (RTPs) are integrated into an iterative process that allows for the pair-wise registration to be optimised. The global registration of all point clouds is obtained by a bundle adjustment using a circular self-closure constraint. Our approach is tested with both indoor and outdoor scenes acquired by a FARO LS 880 laser scanner with an angular resolution of 0. 036 º and 0. 045 º, respectively.

Hence, the aim of this study is to develop a robust image alignment method for medical images.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a novel method for non-rigid registration of transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance prostate images {{based on a}} non-linear regularized framework of point correspondences obtained from a statistical measure of shape-contexts. The segmented prostate shapes are represented by shape-contexts and the Bhattacharyya distance between the shape representations is used to find the point correspondences between the 2 D fixed and moving images. The registration method involves parametric estimation of the non-linear diffeomorphism between the multimodal images and has its basis in solving a set of non-linear equations of thin-plate splines. The solution is obtained as the least-squares solution of an over-determined system of non-linear equations constructed by integrating a set of non-linear functions over the fixed and moving images. However, this may not result in clinically acceptable transformations of the anatomical targets.

The detachment areas have typical depths of 5 to 12 mm and most frequent around 0. 6 – 0. 9 m above the ground.

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{problem in}} computer vision {{is that of}} image registration, which {{plays an important role}} in many vision-based recognition and motion analysis applications. Of particular interest among data registration problems are multimodal image registration problems, where the image data sets are acquired using different imaging modalities. There are several important issues that make real-world multimodal registration a difficult problem to solve. First, images are often characterized by illumination and contrast non-uniformities. Such image non-uniformities result in local minima along the convergence plane that make it difficult for local optimization schemes to converge to the correct solution. Second, real-world images are often contaminated with signal noise, making the extraction of meaningful features for comparison purposes difficult to accomplish. Third, feature space differences make performing direct comparisons between the different data sets with a reasonable level of accuracy a challenging problem. Finally, solving the multimodal registration problem can be computationally expensive for large images. This thesis presents a probabilistic complex phase representation (PCPR) objective function for registering images acquired using different imaging modalities. A probabilistic multi-scale approach is introduced to create image representations based on local phase relationships extracted using complex wavelets. An objective function is introduced for assessing the alignment between the images based on a Geman-McClure error distribution model between the probabilistic complex phase representations of the images. Experimental results show that the proposed PCPR objective function can provide improved <b>registration</b> <b>accuracies</b> when compared to existing objective functions...|$|R
