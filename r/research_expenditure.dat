25|$|There {{has been}} {{insufficient}} government funding for universities in recent years. University research in Israel is largely grounded in basic research, {{even though it}} also engages in applied research and partnerships with industry.

25|$|While US {{investment}} in R is high, {{it failed to}} reach President Obama’s target of 3% of GDP {{by the end of}} his presidency in 2016.

Between 2009 and 2012, the United States' world share of <b>research</b> <b>expenditure</b> receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%.

40|$|I {{relate the}} numbers of {{university}} licenses and options to both university research characteristics and <b>research</b> <b>expenditures</b> from federal government or the industry. I use the polynomial distributed lag model for unbalanced panel data to estimate the effects of <b>research</b> <b>expenditures</b> from different sources on licensing activity. I find evidences suggesting both federal and industrial funded <b>research</b> <b>expenditures</b> take 2 - 3 years from lab to licenses while federal expenditures have higher long-term dynamic effect on number of licenses. Breaking down licenses by different types of partners, I find that federal expenditures have highest effect with small companies while industrial-funded expenditures have higher effect in licenses with large companies and licenses yielding large income. Further research is necessary to analyze the reason for such differences between the effects of <b>research</b> <b>expenditures</b> on licensing activity.

2500|$|Brazil’s {{economic}} boom between 2004 and 2012 translated into higher {{government and business}} spending {{on research and development}} (R). Gross domestic expenditure on R (GERD) almost doubled to PPP$35.5 billion (in 2011 dollars). Most of this growth occurred between 2004 and 2010, when GERD climbed from 0.97% to 1.16% of GDP. In 2012, GERD stood at 1.15% of GDP. Since 2010, the government sector alone has been driving up R intensity, since the non-government contribution has actually declined from 0.57% to 0.52% of GDP (2012). Preliminary figures for 2013 indicate slight growth in government spending and a constant contribution from the business sector (relative to GDP). Business <b>research</b> <b>expenditure</b> is likely to contract from 2015 onwards until the economy shows signs of recovery. Even the most optimistic analysts do not expect this to happen before 2016. Fixed capital investment in Brazil is expected to decline further in 2015, especially in the manufacturing sector. This trend will certainly affect industrial research spending. The Petrobrás crisis is expected to {{have a major impact on}} investment in R, since it alone has accounted for about 10% of the country’s annual fixed capital investment in recent years. The cuts to the federal budget announced in 2015 and other austerity measures should also affect government spending on R ...|$|E
