40|$|The rapid {{increase}} of power consumption {{has become more}} intense nowadays due to the continuous economical and population growth. Consequently the demand for uninterrupted power supply or the minimization <b>of</b> the <b>down</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> such systems inevitably results into developing highly reliable and available energy plants. The <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>down</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the power plants {{can be achieved by}} scheduled maintenance activities and including stand-by components which will be activated to replace the corresponding component in a case of failure during its repair. In power plants the maintenance is performed to the stand-by components, hence in a case of malfunction of the main components, an extensive <b>down</b> <b>time</b> period is observed due to the unavailability of the reserved units is resulted. The power supply will be restored only after the repair of the damaged component or the completion of the maintenance procedure. Consequently, the starting time of the preventive maintenance and its duration might have a great affect on the uninterrupted energy supply.

40|$|Abstract: New digital {{detectors}} {{were developed}} for medical applications, {{which have the}} potential to substitute the X-ray film and revolutionise the radiological technique. Digital Detector Arrays (DDA: Flat Panel Detectors, Line Detectors) and Imaging Plates (Computed Radiography) allow a fast detection of radiographic images in a shorter time and with higher dynamic than film applications. Companies report about a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> exposure <b>time</b> <b>down</b> to 5 – 25 % in comparison to NDT film exposures. This provides together with the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> consumables economical (and also ecological) benefits and short amortisation periods. But this does not always provide the same image quality as NDT film. The requirements of the European and USA standards for film radiography are analysed to derive correct requirements for the digital image quality and procedures for prediction and measurement of image quality. Basically the USA standards seem to be more tolerant for these new innovative technologies. New standard proposals use signal/noise ratio and unsharpness as dominant parameters for image quality. Specialised measurement procedures are described. The properties of the new detectors can be controlled by electronics and exposure conditions. New names appear in literature like "direct radiography " and "film replacement techniques". The basic advantage of the new digital techniques is the possibility to use numeric procedures for image interpretation. Industrial radiology can be optimised for crack detection as well as for analysis of flaw depth and shape measurement. Automated flaw detection, measurement of part dimensions and detection o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Most {{prescribed}} fire plans {{focus on}} reducing wildfire hazards with little consideration given to effects on wildlife populations and their habitats. To evaluate effectiveness of prescribed burning in reducing fuels {{and to assess}} effects <b>of</b> fuels <b>reduction</b> on wildlife, we began a large-scale study known as the Birds and Burns Network in 2002. In this paper we analyze changes in downed wood and forest structure (trees and snags) measured within one year after prescribed fire treatments that were completed in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in Arizona and New Mexico (Southwest region), and Idaho and Washington (Northwest region). Apparent reductions in downed wood and trees were observed in both regions. However, statistically significant <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>downed</b> wood were found primarily in the Northwest (p < 0. 001), whereas significant <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> trees were reported only for the Southwest (p = 0. 03).

40|$|Two {{portions}} of the University of Texas Transportable Laser Ranging System (TLRS) are presented: the beam director and the burst mode single photon laser ranging system. The system, optimized for the Lageos target, has satellite track rates varying from approximately 1800 arcsec per sec on low targets to a few arcsec per sec on the highest. Using full aperture, approximately 3 millijoules of laser power per shot can be transmitted without exceeding the eye damage threshold, and a beam divergence of less than 30 arcsec is dictated by these parameters. Position loop response is optimized, and the instrument is capable of tracking the satellite from nearly any firm, flat position.
