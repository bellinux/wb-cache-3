5|$|As part {{of their}} , the Germans began <b>repatriating</b> Flemish prisoners of war in August 1940. By February 1941, 105,833 Flemish {{soldiers}} had been repatriated. Gradually, more prisoners were released, but 67,000 Belgian soldiers were still in captivity by 1945. Many prisoners of war were forced to work in quarries or in agriculture and around 2,000 died in captivity.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in September 1945, Arkansas was {{employed}} with Operation Magic Carpet, <b>repatriating</b> American soldiers in the Pacific. Wyoming remained in service briefly after the war, though she was decommissioned in August 1947. She was sold for scrap in October and subsequently broken up. Arkansas was instead retained for use as a target ship during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in mid-1946. She survived the first test, an air-burst code-named ABLE, though the second experiment, an underwater detonation code-named BAKER, sank the ship.|$|E
5|$|The Matoika {{had been}} {{in the service of the}} U.S. Army as a {{transport}} ship since September 1919, and, until the time of her selection, had been returning American soldiers from Europe and <b>repatriating</b> the remains of Americans killed during the war. Before World War I, the Matoika had been a passenger liner for North German Lloyd by the name of Princess Alice. After the United States joined the conflict in 1917, the liner had been pressed into service for the U.S. Navy carrying American troops to Europe; she was renamed Princess Matoika, after one of the given names for Pocahontas, as part of an order to replace Germanic names of seized ships with American names.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, the 3rd Division {{received}} {{orders to}} begin <b>repatriating</b> personnel back to New Zealand in April 1944 and shortly a {{first group of}} 1,800 soldiers from the division left the Pacific Theatre of Operations. However, the 37th Battalion remained on Nissan Island until 15 June 1944 at which time it boarded the American cargo ship Rotanin for New Caledonia. It remained in New Caledonia for several weeks and during this time, most of the battalion's long serving personnel returned to New Zealand with the rest following in August.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this exploratory, {{empirical}} study is to gain insight into repatriation experiences and <b>repatriate</b> turnover intention of employees from India and The Netherlands who either were or had been on international assignments in the respective countries. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 25 Dutch and 30 Indian international assignees (IAs) and <b>repatriates</b> in both India and The Netherlands. Thematic analysis resulted in four themes: met and unmet expectations of career advancement opportunities; knowledge transfer and labour marketability; economic growth versus economic recession and alternative employment opportunities; and boundaryless careers: adventure and entrepreneurship. Findings <b>Repatriate</b> expectations {{about the use of}} knowledge, skills and abilities gained in the host country moderate the relationship between the macro-economic situation of the home country and <b>repatriate</b> attrition/retention, such that met expectations of Indian respondents decreased their intention to leave the organisation, even in a conducive macro-economic context with ample alternative employment opportunities. Unmet expectations of Dutch respondents increased their intention to leave the organisation, even in an unfavourable macro-economic context with few alternative employment opportunities. Research limitations/implications The sample of Indian and Dutch IAs and <b>repatriates</b> may limit generalisation of the findings to samples from other countries with distinct cultural contexts and macro-economic conditions. Practical implications Global organisations that set realistic expectations about re-entry career opportunities for <b>repatriates,</b> facilitate knowledge transfer after repatriation, and adequately respond to boundaryless career ambitions of <b>repatriates,</b> can reduce <b>repatriate</b> turnover intention and attrition. Originality/value This study shows that <b>repatriate</b> attrition versus retention is embedded in the macro-economic context of the home country, leading to three types of career mobility upon completion of an international assignment: intra-organisational mobility; organisational boundary-crossing; and geographical boundary crossing.

5|$|In January 1919, {{she went}} to Cattaro, where she guarded the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. She {{assisted}} in <b>repatriating</b> Austrian naval personnel, and escorted former Austro-Hungarian warships to France and Italy; this duty lasted until March. The French Navy intended to send Lorraine and her sister Provence to the Black Sea to join operations against the Bolsheviks, but a major mutiny prevented the operation. The two ships went to Constantinople in October 1919, where they formed {{the core of the}} Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, which operated until July 1921. Lorraine underwent her first refit starting on 10 November 1921, which lasted until 4 December 1922. After emerging from refit, Lorraine was placed in reserve, due to fiscal limitations in the post-war French Navy. She returned to service the following year—1923—with the 1st Battleship Division of the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} okapi is Okapia johnstoni. It was first described as Equus johnstoni by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name Okapia derives from the Lese Karo name o'api, while the specific name (johnstoni) is {{in recognition of the}} British Governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the Ituri Forest while <b>repatriating</b> a group of Pygmies to the Belgian Congo. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887.

40|$|AbstractThis {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 2006 - 2010 to study the specifics of personal self-esteem during intercultural adaptation of the <b>repatriates</b> in the educational environment of high school. The subject of inquiry was the <b>repatriated</b> students from China and Mongolia. Sample volume – 106 people. The survey used a range of psychological methods and techniques: content analysis of documents, questioning, peer reviews (scaling), and specific psychodiagnostic techniques - incomplete sentences, sociometry, Budassi test, questionnaire on adaptation of individual to the new social and cultural environment (L. V. Yankovsky), and various statistical treatment methods. It was revealed that: 1) Self-esteem {{is one of the}} socio-psychological factors of successful intercultural adaptation of <b>repatriated</b> students in the educational environment of high school. 2) The dynamics of changing of self-esteem of the <b>repatriates</b> at different stages of learning depend on its initial level; people with high self-esteem experience less fluctuations of self-esteem than people with the average level of self-esteem. 3) Creation of a system of social and psychological support of the <b>repatriates</b> enhances the effectiveness of intercultural adaptation of <b>repatriated</b> students in high schools...|$|R
5|$|The wing's {{proposed}} move to New Britain was cancelled in May 1945, {{after the}} Netherlands government requested that its squadrons operate over the Dutch East Indies.

40|$|Due to {{the nature}} and {{increasing}} rate of globalization companies are continuing to send their employees abroad to gain experience and knowledge to maintain or develop a competitive advantage.
