The <b>regular</b> <b>grade</b> pieces are usually darker and more saturated in their green colour, and the surface is seen as closely spaced pitting or weathering. This type sometimes appears to have been broken apart from a larger chunk. Moldavite is also found to be compatible with borosilicate glass and can be fused to it with ease.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{placement}} decisions on a child's self-concept {{will be a}} growing concern as mainstreaming efforts increase. A child's feelings of self-worth may vary from setting to setting and from one aspect of life to another. This paper well illustrates that self-concept is a complex entity. As Ribner demonstrates, both research and practice must consider these complexities, especially when the child's self-concept is in question. — G. M. S. The self-concept of minimally brain damaged children in special classes was {{compared with that of}} children with similar disabilities who were in the <b>regular</b> <b>grades.</b> Those in <b>regular</b> <b>grades</b> had significantly lower self-concepts in school adequacy but not in general competence. When compared with normal children, both groups of minimally brain damaged children had significantly lower self-concepts in school adequacyy but only those in <b>regular</b> <b>grades</b> held significantly lower self-concepts than normal children in general competence. No relationship was found between self-concept and length of stay in special classes. In recent years there has been considerable controversy in the literature about the merits of special class placement (Dunn 1968, Jones 1972, Kolstoe 1972). The present emphasis on placing the child in the least restrictive environ-ment makes this issue particularly current. Primary considerations against special class placement are based on studies that show such placement is not more effective in improving academic functioning than placement in <b>regular</b> <b>grades</b> (Carroll 1967, Dunn 1968) and that special placement has a deleterious effect on the child'...|$|R

5000|$|... Iran has 3,200 gas {{stations}} for 15 million automobiles. Demand {{is supported by}} the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and premium <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively. The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of Iran per annum.|$|R

5000|$|LPG is {{prepared}} by refining petroleum or [...] "wet" [...] natural gas, and {{is almost entirely}} derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Dr. Walter Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very few sulfur emissions. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for premium <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline). However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5-0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71-0.77 kg/L for gasoline).|$|R
