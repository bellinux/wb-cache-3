40|$|Effects of sex, age and pre-slaughter {{conditioning}} on {{the characteristics}} of South African indigenous goat carcasses (weight, dimensions, and joint and tissue composition) and quality of chevon (pH and temperature profiles, histological, histochemical, metabolic, proteolytic and physical) were determined. Effects of post-mortem ageing and electrical stimulation on the quality of chevon were also investigated. The nutritional quality of chevon in terms of fatty acid and amino acid content was assessed. The acceptability of chevon compared to mutton was tested by a panel of South African consumers. The goats were large with live weight, carcass weight and carcass dimensions in the range of the large breeds of southern Africa. They had a high lean and low fat content that is typical of most goat breeds. Intact males were suited for high chevon yield because they were heavy, had a high lean and low fat content, and losses during dressing and chilling were reduced by improved nutrition. Goats between two and six teeth yielded heavy carcasses that were comparable to goats in the eight teeth group, and had proportionately more lean. The hind limb appeared to be ideal for high lean and low fat high value cuts but the dorsal trunk was bony and yielded less lean. Pre-slaughter conditioning improved the overall size of the goats and reduced the losses during slaughter and chilling. It also improved the lean/bone and lean and fat/bone indices. The M. longissimus thoracis (LT) had a low glycolytic potential (GP), high initial lactate concentration, low initial pH and high ultimate pH (pHu) values, all of which indicated that peri-mortem handling of goats was a potent stressor. Chevon from carcasses with pHu< 5. 8 had higher initial GP, glycogen and ATP content. It had longer sarcomeres, low 96 -hour shear force values and better colour quality than higher pH meat. Similarly, chevon from the 2 -teeth group tended to have lower pHu values than contemporary groups and hence lower 96 -hour shear force values and better colour quality. Conversely, mature does tended to have high pHu and hence a high mean 96 -hour shear force value and a low mean a* value associated with dark cutting meat. Only up to 20 % of the muscle samples had a pHu< 5. 8. Pre-slaughter conditioning had no effect on GP and pHu but enhanced the rate of pH and temperature decline and resulted in more tender meat with higher a* values. Generally carcasses with a 3 -hour pH (pH 3) of less than 6. 1 were heavier, had more carcass fat, maintained a high temperature early post-mortem, had longer sarcomeres, better colour quality and lower 24 -hour shear force values than those with a pH 3 of 6. 3 or greater. M. longissimus thoracis and M semimembranosus (SM) samples with pH 3 < 6. 1 constituted less than 22 % of the samples. The LT and SM had different myofibre proportions. Myofibre types were not useful indices of meat quality. The level of immediate post-slaughter calpastatin activity suggests that the proteolytic potential of chevon is not essentially different from that of other meat types. Ageing and electrical stimulation improved tenderness and colour quality of chevon. Electrical stimulation increased the rate of pH decline to levels outside the risk of cold shortening as well as the ageing potential of chevon such that the meat attained tenderness that was within the acceptable limits for four days of ageing. Chevon had high levels of PUFA, particularly C 18 : 2, which were similar to values reported for ostrich. The high C 18 : 2 /C 18 : 3 ratio suggested that the n- 6 /n- 3 fatty acid ratio would be much higher than the recommended ratio of less than four. Most of the fatty acid proportions fell within the ranges that have been reported for chevon and other <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> <b>species.</b> Age and sex of the goats had no significant effect on the fatty acid profile but pre-slaughter conditioning resulted in lower levels of C 14 : 0 and total SFA, and increased levels of C 18 : 1 and hence MUFA. The amino acid proportions suggest that there is no variation in the amino acid profile between M. longissimus lumborum muscles from goats of different age or sex classes. Level of education of the consumers was most important in determining consumer acceptance of the sensory attributes as well as the intended frequency of consumption for chevon and mutton. Population group was a significant factor only when the meats were of more variable acceptability. Sensory evaluations indicated that chevon and mutton were highly acceptable to the consumers, who were willing to eat any of the meats at least once a week. The study indicated that chevon is acceptable to South African consumers and may be as acceptable as mutton if the meat is from goats of about two years old or younger. South African indigenous goats may yield high quality chevon, with a low pHu and acceptable colour provided that the meat is from large carcasses (~ 15 kg) with a high fat content (at least 7 %) and is not from mature does.

40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a product using {{alternative}} <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> <b>species,</b> aquatic and terrestrial mammals, which would be acceptable to the consumer and suitable from a food safety aspect. Many of these alternative species are harvested seasonally. A product which is shelf stable needs to be developed to provide a supply of this meat all year round. The species used in this investigation were the Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), the Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) from the northern hemisphere, the Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), horse, beef, mutton, blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi) and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). Muscle (m. pectoralis) of Cape fur seal pups has a higher percentage fat (4. 2 g/ 100 g) than the bulls (2. 4 g/ 100 g), but similar levels of protein (23. 2 g/ 100 g). Bull blubber samples have a higher percentage protein (26. 6 g/ 100 g) than the pups (14. 6 g/ 100 g), but a lower fat percentage (67. 1 g/ 100 g) compared with the pups (77. 2 g/ 100 g). In the Cape fur seal bull meat, saturated fatty acids (SFA) contribute 33 mg/ 100 g, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) 29 mg/ 100 g and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 38 mg/ 100 g of the total fatty acid content. In pups, the three fractions are 39, 30 and 31 mg/ 100 g for SFA, MUFA and PUFA, respectively. Salami,prepared using exclusively seal meat, or seal meat with beef and pork, was produced in a pilot study, using two commercially available starter cultures. The pH values of all three batches started off at ca. 5. 6, and dropped to 4. 3. Water activity readings started off at 0. 96 and dropped to 0. 91 after 21 days. Salami produced from the meat of the Grey (Havert) seal and Minke whale, using three starter cultures, had recorded pH values (in both species), which started off between 5. 68 and 5. 92, and dropped to between 4. 5 and 4. 8 over the 21 days. Water activity showed an initial value of 0. 96, which dropped to 0. 90 after 21 days. The final force (N/cm 2) that was needed to compress the salami samples was double that of the initial force required for the same species and starter culture combination. The raw seal meat contained 349. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) SFA, 271. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) MUFA and 175. 8 (mg/ 100 g sample) PUFA, whilst the raw whale meat contained 312. 3, 251. 9 and 179. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) SFA, MUFA and PUFA respectively. Fifteen batches of salami were made from horse, beef, mutton, blesbok and springbok, respectively, and starter cultures of Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38 (batch I), active bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus plantarum 423 (batch II) and then a mutant variation of Lactobacillus plantarum 423 m, which did not produce the bacteriocin (batch III). Batch I had a higher final pH value (4. 66), after 23 days, whereas the values for batches II and III were similar (4. 42 and 4. 46 respectively). On day 23 the water activity value was 0. 90 for all starter cultures. Horse salami, in batch I, was the leanest in terms of fat content (34. 34 g/ 100 g salami), with mutton salami having the highest fat content (37. 52 g/ 100 g salami). Blesbok salami had the highest fat content in batch II (42. 77 g/ 100 g meat), with beef the leanest (35. 71 g/ 100 g meat). Salami made from horse and springbok proved to be the most desirable in terms of chemical composition, especially fatty acid profiles, with regard to P: S and n- 6 : n- 3 ratios. Similar growth patterns in colony forming units (cfu) were recorded for L. plantarum 423, L. plantarum 423 m and L. curvatus DF 38 in MRS broth (Merck) at 30 oC, although batch I reached asymptotic growth earlier. The percentage of L. plantarum 423 compared with the total population of microflora in mutton salami remained almost the same (80 - 95 % variety) during the entire fermentation and maturation process. In horse salami, L. plantarum 423 was present at relatively low cell numbers (55 - 50 % on day 1 and before smoking), but increased to 70 % after smoking and stabilized to 70 - 80 % for the remaining fermentation period. In beef salami, cell numbers in batch II decreased slightly during the first five days (from 95 to 70 %), followed by an increase to 90 %. In springbok salami, cell numbers in batch II remained fairly stable at 80 - 90 %. In blesbok salami, batch II slowly decreased during the first three days, from 88 % to 70 %, then increased to 92 % after 12 days and stabilized for the rest of the fermentation period. Similar results were recorded for batch I. Analytical sensory evaluation concluded that the salami prepared using starter culture I resulted in end products with lower sensory qualities. Salami prepared using blesbok and mutton also resulted in end products with lower sensory qualities and was perceived as significantly lower in salami flavour (P≤ 0. 05) and higher in venison-like and mutton-like flavour respectively. The blesbok samples were rated significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) in sour meat aroma, sour meat flavour and venison-like flavour than the rest of the samples. The blesbok salami was rated significantly lowest for colour compared with the rest of the samples. The tastes of the springbok and horse salami were significantly (P≤ 0. 05) more acceptable than those of the beef and blesbok salami...|$|E

40|$|Background: Food-based dietary {{guidelines}} often recommend increased {{consumption of}} fish and reduced intake of <b>red</b> and processed <b>meat.</b> However, {{little is known about}} how changing the main protein source from <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> to fish may influence the choice of side dishes. Objective: To investigate whether side dish choices differed between <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and fish dinners. Moreover, to compare intakes of macronutrients and selected micronutrients in <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and fish dinners and to see whether whole-day intakes of these nutrients differed between days with <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners and days with fish dinners. Design: Data were collected in a cross-sectional nationwide Norwegian dietary survey using two non-consecutive telephone-administered 24 -h recalls. The recalls were conducted approximately 4 weeks apart. In total, 2, 277 dinners from 1, 517 participants aged 18 – 70 were included in the analyses. Results: Fish dinners were more likely to include potatoes and carrots than <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners, whereas <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners more often contained bread, tomato sauce, and cheese. Red meat dinners contained more energy and iron; had higher percentages of energy (E%) from fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat; and a lower E% from protein and polyunsaturated fat than fish dinners. Fish dinners contained more vitamin D, β-carotene, and folate than <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners. Similar differences were found when comparing whole-day intakes of the same nutrients on days with <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> versus fish dinners. Conclusion: Fish dinners were accompanied by different side dishes than <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners. With regard to nutrient content, fish dinners generally had a healthier profile than <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners. However, iron intake was higher for <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dinners.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to summarize available date on the relation between meat intake and risk of glioma. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search of relevant reports published until May 2014 of the PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Excerpta Medica database, Ovid database, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases was conducted. From 723 articles yielded in the preliminary literature search, data from eighteen publications (14 case-control, three cohort, and one nested case-control study) on unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> processed <b>meat,</b> and/or total <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption in relation to glioma in adults {{were included in the}} analysis. Quality assessment of studies was performed. Random effects model was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Results: We found a positive significant association between unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> intake and risk of glioma (relative risk [RR] = 1. 30; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 08 - 1. 58) after excluding three studies with uncertain type of brain cancer. This analysis included only one cohort study which revealed no relation between unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> intake and glioma (RR = 1. 75; 95 % CI: 0. 35 - 8. 77). Consumption of processed meats was not related to increased risk of glioma in population-based case-control studies (RR = 1. 26; 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 1. 51) and reduced risk in hospital-based case-controls (RR = 0. 79; 95 % CI: 0. 65 - 0. 97).

In 21 volunteers, there was a consistent and significant (P < 0. 0001) increase in endogenous formation of NOC with the <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> diet compared with the vegetarian diet as measured by apparent total NOC (ATNC) in feces. In colonic exfoliated cells, the percentage staining positive for the NOC-specific DNA adduct, O 6 -carboxymethyl guanine (O 6 CMG) was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher on the high <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> diet. In 13 volunteers, levels were intermediate on the high-fiber, high <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> diet.

Random-effects models were used to pool study results and to assess dose-response relationships. We identified 15 prospective studies on <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> (involving 7, 367 cases) and 14 prospective studies on processed meat consumption (7, 903 cases). The summary relative risks (RRs) of colorectal can-cer for the highest vs. the lowest intake categories were 1. 28 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 5 1. 15 – 1. 42) for <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and 1. 20 (95 % CI 5 1. 11 – 1. 31) for processed meat. The estimated summary RRs were 1. 28 (95 % CI 5 1. 18 – 1. 39) for an increase of 120 g/day of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and 1. 09 (95 % CI 5 1. 05 – 1. 13) for an increase of 30 g/day o...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although meat {{constitutes}} {{an important part}} of many consumers′ diet, its consumption has become a quiet controversial issue. Several factors are effective on tendency to <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption. The 2007 ′s report of the world Cancer Research Fund makes the recommendation to limit the consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> to less than 500 g per week. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine meat and meat products consumption and causes of tendency to <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> among people of Khorramabad city, Iran. Methods: This cross- sectional study was carried out on 300 adults (178 women and 122 men; aged 19 - 70 years) of Khorramabad city, Iran. Red meat and processed meat intake (from a FFQ), demographic and causes of tendencies to <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption (from a self-reported questionnaire) were evaluated. Statistical methods included independent t- test and one-way ANOVA. Results: Consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and meat products was 531. 8 ± 543. 5 g/w and 132. 5 ± 251. 1 g/w, respectively. The most important factors of tendencies toward <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption were delectability, palatability, accessibility, cultural and traditional beliefs, and lack of food diversity in Lorestan province, animal husbandry, nomadic life, and hospitality. Red meat consumption was more common among men and lower in the income levels of $ 300. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption in adult people of the west of Iran was high. Since consumption of meat and meat products may create health concerns for people, it is necessary for policymakers to adopt effective strategies to advocate the use of fish and poultry...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with cognitive dissonance theory, individuals generally avoid {{information that is}} not consistent with their cognitions, to avoid psychological discomfort associated with tensions arising from contradictory beliefs. Information avoidance may thus make risk communication less successful. To address this, we presented information on <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> risks to <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumers. To explore information exposure effects, attitudes toward <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and perceived knowledge of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> risks were measured before, immediately after, and two weeks after exposure. We expected information avoidance of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> risks to be: positively related to (1) study discontentment; and (2) positive attitudes toward red meat; and negatively related to (3) information seeking on <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> risks; and (4) systematic and heuristic processing of information. In addition, following exposure to the risk information, we expected that (5) individuals who scored high in avoidance of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> risks information to change their attitudes and perceived risk knowledge less than individuals who scored low in avoidance. Results were {{in line with the}} first three expectations. Support for the fourth was partial insofar as this was only confirmed regarding systematic processing. The final prediction was not confirmed; individuals who scored high in avoidance decreased the positivity of their attitudes and increased their perceived knowledge in a similar fashion to those who scored low in avoidance. These changes stood over the two-week follow-up period. Results are discussed in {{accordance with}} cognitive dissonance theory, with the possible use of suppression strategies, and with the corresponding implications for risk communication practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> particularly that produced from grass-fed animals, {{to contribute to}} dietary intakes of long chain (LC) n- 3 PUF A has {{become the focus of}} recent research. However, there remains little information on precise quantities of these fatty acids found in commercially produced <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> the use of grass finishing diets by producers, or the ability of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> produced from grass feeding regimes to contribute to LCn- 3 PUF A intakes or status in consumers, especially in the UK and Ireland. Extensive fatty acid data were measured for beef and lamb produced in Northern Ireland over a 12 month period and the frequency of a grass diet being offered to animals before slaughter was determined by a survey carried out among a sample of beef and lamb producers. To investigate the effect of consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> produced from grass-fed animals on LCn- 3 PUF A status, a human intervention study was carried out among healthy subjects. In addition, the potential for <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> produced from grass-fed animals to contribute to LCn- 3 PUF A intakes in the Irish population was hypothetically assessed based on current intakes of meat. Beef and lamb were reported to contain concentrations ofLCn- 3 PUFA similar to levels achieved with grass feeding by other studies. The season of slaughter and, to a lesser extent, the reported finishing diet of the animal were found to cause variation in concentrations ofLCn- 3 PUFA and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) found in beef and lamb. The survey revealed that grass finishing diets are commonly offered to animals by producers of beef and lamb, but the frequency of these diets also varied by season. In the human intervention study, consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> from grass-fed animals was associated with significantly increased plasma and platelet LCn- 3 PUF A status among healthy subjects. Based on <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumed in the Irish diet being from grass-fed animals, the provision of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> to LCn- 3 PUF A intakes would be modestly increased than if meat consumed were from concentrate-fed animals. In conclusion, the production of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> from grass-fed animals will contribute to increased LCn- 3 PUF A intakes and status among Irish consumers, where <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> is habitually consumed. Further research is warranted to investigate the opportunity to further enhance concentrations ofLCn- 3 PUF A within <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> by increased use of grass feeding regimes in beef and lamb production.

40|$|The {{general health}} {{message to the}} public about meat {{consumption}} is both confusing and misleading. It is stated that meat {{is not good for}} health because meat is rich in fat and cholesterol and high intakes are associated with increased blood cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease (CHD). This paper reviewed 54 studies from the literature in relation to <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption and CHD risk factors. Substantial evidence from recent studies shows that lean <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> trimmed of visible fat does not raise total blood cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. Dietary intake of total and saturated fat mainly comes from fast foods, snack foods, oils, spreads, other processed foods and the visible fat of meat, rather than lean meat. In fact, lean <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> is low in saturated fat, and if consumed in a diet low in SFA is associated with reductions in LDL-cholesterol in both healthy and hypercholesterolemia subjects. Lean <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption has no effect on in vivo and ex vivo production of thromboxane and prostacyclin or the activity of haemostatic factors. Lean <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> is also a good source of protein, omega- 3 fatty acids, vitamin B- 12, niacin, zinc and iron. In conclusion, lean <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> trimmed of visible fat, which is consumed in a diet low in saturated fat does not increase cardiovascular risk factors (plasma cholesterol levels or thrombotic risk factors) ...|$|R
40|$|Sporadic {{colon cancer}} is a multifactorial aging disease {{affected}} by long-term exposure to environmental risk factors. Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} risk for colon {{cancer is a}}ssociated with diets high in <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and/or animal fat. The mechanisms by which colonic tumors arise are, however, poorly understood (see General Introduction, chapter 1). The general hypothesis purports that animal saturated fat increases soluble secondary bile acids and fatty acids in the colonic lumen. These cytolytic surfactants solubilize in the fecal water, damage the colonic epithelium and thus induce a compensatory hyperproliferation, which may increase risk for colon cancer. Previous studies from our laboratory and studies from the literature have indicated, however, that increasing amounts of saturated fat in the diet do not unequivocally increase soluble bile acids and fatty acids in colon. Furthermore, saturated fatty acids may not explain the risk-enhancing effect of <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> because the contribution of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> to the total intake of dietary saturated fatty acids is limited. So there may be other factors in <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> that are involved in the association between <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption and colon cancer. Consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> supplies heme (a tetrapyrrole ring structure with iron), which can also be metabolized to bilirubin. In literature, cytolytic effects of both heme and bilirubin have been described. [...] . Zie: Hoofdstuk 7...|$|R

50|$|Several {{studies have}} found a {{correlation}} between unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> and the occurrence of CHD and certain types of stroke and have controlled for various confounding risk factors. A study of 84,000 women, {{over a period of}} 26 years, finds that those with the highest intake of unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> have a 13% increased risk of CHD. Likewise a Harvard study published in 2012, studying mortality as a result of processed and unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> consumption finds that one serving of either type of meat a day results in an increased risk of mortality of 13%, while this ratio is indicative of cancer and cardiovascular (CVD) disease, the study indicates that of the 23,926 deaths investigated {{during the course of the}} study, 5910 of them were related to CVD and there was no statistical significance between the risk of unprocessed and processed <b>red</b> <b>meats</b> factors in the occurrence of CVD. The disparity between metadata studies definitely need to be addressed, because while one points toward unprocessed <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> being insignificant in certain health risks, there are still correlations to be found in focused large cohort studies.|$|R
