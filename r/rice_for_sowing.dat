They desired some dry goat-skins for beds and covering, which were given them; and upon their giving their words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they could spare; some peas, barley, and <b>rice,</b> <b>for</b> <b>sowing,</b> and, in a word, any thing they wanted but arms and ammunition.|$|E

"About {{five days}} after, {{they came to}} those limits appointed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by one of my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched their tents; and marked {{themselves}} out an habitation and plantation, at the N.E. and most remote part of the island. And, indeed, there they built themselves two very handsome cottages, resembling our little castle, being under {{the side of a}} mountain, with some trees already growing on three sides of it; so that planting a few more, it would be obscured from sight, unless particularly sought for. When these huts were finished, we gave them some dry goat-skins for bedding and covering; & upon their giving us fuller assurances of their good behaviour for the future, we gave them some pease, barley, and <b>rice</b> <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> and whatever tools we could spare.|$|E

40|$|Currently, swine {{building}} ventilation {{design is}} based on heat and moisture rates measured in the 1950 s and 1970 s. Advancements in genetics, nutrition and management practices to increase productivity and pork quality during this period likely have led to considerable changes in heat and moisture production rates of the animals and their housing systems. This study quantifies total heat production rate (THP), house-level moisture production rate (MP) and house-level sensible heat production rate (SHP) of a 4300 -sow breeding, gestation, and farrowing facility in Iowa for 17 consecutive months. THP was determined using indirect animal calorimetry, MP was determined from mass balance, and SHP was calculated as the difference between THP and latent heat production (LHP). A Mobile Air Emission Monitoring Unit (MAEMU) was installed to monitor the deep-pit breeding-early gestation barn (1800 head), the deep-pit late gestation barn (1800 head), and two shallow-pit (pull-plug) farrowing rooms (40 head per room). This paper reports on data collected from February 2012 through {{the completion of the}} study in June 2013. Preliminary results from the study show that THP averages 373 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 376 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 1191 W/sow+litter <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. The house-level MP averages 198 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 192 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, 818 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. Finally the house-level SHP averages 223 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 230 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 572 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. Compared with the ASABE standards, values from the current study <b>for</b> gestation <b>sows</b> showed increases of 55 % in THP, 20 % in MP, and 58 % in SHP. Similarly, values <b>for</b> farrowing <b>sow</b> and litter showed increases of 85 % in THP, 64 % in MP, and 80 % in SHP relative to the ASABE standards...|$|R

40|$|Compared Pedological Characteristics of Termite Mounds under Primary Forests of Yangambi Platform in Congolese Central Basin. Some pedological {{characteristics}} of five identified termite mounds under primary forests of Yangambi platform in congolese central basin are {{compared with those}} of host soil series. Five termite mounds are conical shaped (tcn) of Noditermes cristifrons Sjöst., hat-shaped (tch) of Cubitermes speciosus Sjöst., semi-arboricolous (tsa) of Apilitermes longiceps Sjöst., dome-shaped (tdo) of Thoracotermes macrothorax Sjöst. and hill-shaped (tco) of Macrotermes muellai Sjöst. Four host soil series are Yambaw (Y 0), Yangambi (Y 1), Yakonde (Y 2) and Yambeli (YL); they are more colonized by termite mounds and more farmed by peasants of Yangambi region. The achieved results show that termite mounds are more fertile than host soil series. Among five identified termite mounds, three are interesting as sources of fertilizers: tsa, tch and tdo. Particularly for the tco, analytical values are comparable to those of the host soil series. For practical applications, tsa is identified as better source of soil fertility <b>for</b> <b>rice</b> <b>sown</b> to vegetables and tdo for amaranth. Combined with dried peanut straw, tcn obtained best results on amaranth. Termite mounds are abundant in rainforest of Yangambi platform and their fertility is high compared to that of host soil series. They may be of interest as sources of soil fertility at small scale vegetables growing...|$|R

The bachelor dissertation results in low share of areas of reproduction in comparision with the total area of arable soil in ecological agriculture. It is related to insufficient proposal of bioquality seeds in the Czech Republic, for example in comparison with neighbouring Austria. Ecological farmers establish vegetations in practice and they mostly use farmer seeds (58 %), conventional unimpregnate seeds (37 %) and minimum of bioquality seeds (5 %) ...|$|R
