40|$|The {{ability of}} the private car to provide flexible, {{attractive}} and cost-effective personal travel is gradually being eroded, particularly in urban areas. Contributing factors are the increasing levels of congestion and enforcement, limited and increasingly expensive parking, and controls / charging on road use. Also, local authority targets such as those relating {{to the environment and}} road traffic reduction are constraining the use of cars in urban areas. In this context, the role of the car in future mobility may change and <b>lift</b> <b>sharing</b> offers the prospect of enabling more efficient usage by reducing single occupant car trips. This paper discusses research undertaken through the FUTURES project (Future Urban Technologies: Undertaking Research to Enhance Sustainability) to enhance understanding of the current practice and future potential of <b>lift</b> <b>sharing</b> in the UK. Current evidence relating to the benefits and impacts of <b>lift</b> <b>sharing</b> is limited. However, the presence of the UK’s principal <b>lift</b> <b>sharing</b> service provider, Liftshare. com Ltd, amongst the project’s stakeholders has enabled the research team to access previously unavailable data on the practice of <b>lift</b> <b>sharing</b> in the UK. In 2006, some 37, 000 new subscribers joined Liftshare. com and this paper reports on the analysis of this 2006 membership database to identify common characteristics amongst lift sharers. The main variables analysed were journey purpose, type, distance and frequency, as well as age and gender of the subscriber. The paper then summarises key findings to emerge from this analysis before identifying some future research options...|$|R

This paper reports the findings of a study which designed, built and tested a collaborative travel app in the tourism domain. Data derived from exploratory interviews, post-trial interviews and a questionnaire reveal that user age and extent of mobile engagement play a less significant role than expected, while other aspects of the social exchange, notably social tie strength, trust and obligations play a more marked role. A conceptual framework and discussion of strategies to address these barriers provides insight into appropriate contexts and routes for implementation of collaborative travel apps...|$|R

50|$|Between 1955 and 1979, Dover {{acquired}} fourteen companies. A {{great deal}} of this acquisition activity served to build the Dover Elevator business. This elevator growth began in 1955, as Dover Elevator split from <b>Rotary</b> <b>Lift</b> and became an independent operating company within Dover. Dover's purchase of the Shepard Warner Elevator Company in 1958 {{marked the beginning of}} an effort to grow the elevator business. In 1963, Dover acquired Acme Elevator, and then Elevator Service, Reddy Elevator Company in 1964, and Hunter-Hayes Elevator Company in 1970. With these purchases, Dover soon became the third largest elevator company in the U.S. and remained so for many years. Dover continued to expand its elevator division throughout the 1960s and 1970s with the purchases of Moody & Rowe, Burch, Turnbull, Burlington, Hammond & Champness, Louisiana Elevator, and W.W. Moore. Ultimately, Dover sold its elevator business in 1998 to Thyssen AG for $1.1 billion. Dover Elevator had a pretax operating profit of $93 million in 1997 and the sale was mutually beneficial: it allowed Dover to focus on building its other businesses and moved ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas to the number three spot worldwide in the elevator and escalator industry.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of lift offset {{on the performance}} of several rotorcraft configurations is explored. A lift-offset rotor, or advancing blade concept, is a hingeless rotor that can attain good efficiency at high speed by operating with more lift on the advancing side than on the retreating side of the rotor disk. The calculated performance capability of modern-technology coaxial rotors utilizing a lift offset is examined, including rotor performance optimized for hover and high-speed cruise. The ideal induced power loss of coaxial rotors in hover and twin rotors in forward flight is presented. The aerodynamic modeling requirements for performance calculations are evaluated, including wake and drag models for the high-speed flight condition. The {{influence of}} configuration {{on the performance of}} rotorcraft with lift-offset rotors is explored, considering tandem and side-by-side rotorcraft as well as wing-rotor <b>lift</b> <b>share...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe growing {{capabilities}} of smartphones {{have opened up}} new opportunities for travel coordination and transport is a fertile area for app development. One stream of development is apps that enable collaborative travel, either {{in the form of}} <b>lift</b> <b>sharing</b> or collaborative shopping, but despite growing interest from governmental agencies, there is little evidence of the efficacy of such apps. Based on trials of purpose built travel collaboration apps, deployed in tourism, urban and rural residential communities, and logistics, this paper analyses the fundamental challenges facing users adopting such travel apps. The findings suggest that transport practitioners, policy makers and app developers need to better understand the challenges associated with attracting users, the use of incentives and the types of communities most appropriate to implement collaborative travel concepts using such approaches. Also, how the users’ sense of time pressure and the issues around reciprocal exchange can impact on their long-term success and wider adoption...|$|R

40|$|Carpooling (also {{known as}} car-sharing, ride-sharingand <b>lift</b> <b>sharing),</b> is {{the sharing of}} car {{journeys}} so that more thanone person travels in a single car [5]. Carpooling consists ofsharing one’s personal vehicles with one or several passengers inwhich the related passengers shares the related costs but also helpto reduce the traffic as well as pollution. One major issue incarpooling is the prior agreement between the car owner and theride seekers. Dynamic carpooling uses an IT system to removethis limitation and provide ways to react to events such as a trafficjam as well as {{improving the quality of}} life benefits of participatingpeople.

40|$|Flight {{acoustic}} and vehicle state {{data from}} an XV- 15 acoustic flight test are examined. Flight predictions using TiltRotor Aeroacoustic Code (TRAC) are performed for a level flight (repeated) and four descent conditions (including a blade vortex interaction (BVI)). The assumptions and procedures used for TRAC flight predictions {{as well as}} the variability in flight measurements, which are used for input and comparison to predictions, are investigated in detail. Differences were found in the measured vehicle airspeed, altitude, glideslope, and vehicle orientation (yaw, pitch, and roll angle) between each of the repeat runs. These differences violate some of the prediction assumptions and significantly impacted the resulting acoustic predictions. Multiple acoustic pulses, with a variable time between the pulses, were found in the measured acoustic time histories for the repeat runs. These differences could be attributed in part to the variability in vehicle orientation. Acoustic predictions that used the measured vehicle orientation for the repeat runs captured this multiple pulse variability. Thickness noise was found to be dominant on approach for all the cases, except the BVI condition. After the aircraft passed overhead, broadband noise and low frequency loading noise were dominant. The predicted LowSPL time histories compared well with measurement on approach to the array for the non-BVI conditions and poorly for the BVI condition. Accurate prediction of the <b>lift</b> <b>share</b> between the rotor and fuselage must be known in order to improve predictions. At a minimum, measurements of the rotor thrust and tip-path-plane angle are critical to further develop accurate flight acoustic prediction capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a mechanism called <b>lifting</b> to <b>share</b> predicates {{between the two}} components of a dl-program, integrating them in a tighter way. Using lifting, one can reason about the predicates being shared both via the description logic knowledge base and via Datalog-style rules, and the deductions one makes are automatically reflected globally on both components. This is a capability not directly present in dl-programs, since changes to the knowledge base only affect the queries where they occur. We show that lifting has nice theoretical properties, making it suitable for modular design of dl-programs. Furthermore, dl-program processors can easily incorporate lifting as a new operator, and we have extended dlvhex to work with dl-programs with lifting. ...|$|R

40|$|As cities become {{increasingly}} connected, both people and objects can {{connect to the}} Internet to transmit and receive information. This is the Internet of Things. Smartphone technology can help identify current and anticipate future patterns of behaviour and, with its social networking capabilities, allow users to imagine collaborative opportunities. This {{has led to the}} development of collaborative travel apps designed to enable activities like <b>lift</b> <b>sharing.</b> However, two projects working with community based travel collaboration apps identify significant challenges to people accessing forms of travel assistance due to the imperative of reciprocity. Collaborative travel apps depend on users to offer help, but they also need users to ask for or accept help. This paper analyses the fundamental challenges of reciprocity as facilitated by these apps and considers how the near future Internet of Things might alter practices. Trials of purpose built collaborative travel apps were conducted across four communities (a campsite, two rural villages and an urban fringe estate) during 2013 and 2014 involving 66 participants. Data were collected by in-depth interviews and all app activities (messages and transactions) were recorded through a linked database. Offers of help dominated in contrast to requests for and acceptance of help. Feelings of indebtedness inhibit app use since they threa ten a user’s status, power and freedom of action with respect to the donor of help. Other transport issues of flexibility and control were also apparent. The paper discusses how indebtedness might be addressed during the design and implementation of such apps. Also, the emergence of the Internet of Things, with its more anticipatory systems, prompts a reappraisal of current Internet based collaborative communities which raises questions about the human regulation of reciprocal arrangements and presents opportunities for parties who are less able to reciprocate such as the ageing population...|$|R
40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that tourists have {{an awareness of}} the environmental impacts of their tourism mobility but are unwilling to change their behaviour. At the same time it is suggested that policy makers are not providing sufficient incentives or barriers to instigate behaviour change. This study explores the outcomes of providing tourists with a tool to enable them to utilise available transport resources within a localised network in order to travel more sustainability. The study context is camping tourism which is heavily reliant on car use with many visitors making the same journeys at the same time. A smartphone app was developed to enable visitors to join a social network in which users could combine resources and undertake collaborative car travel (e. g. <b>lift</b> <b>sharing,</b> shopping for one another or information exchange). A trial during 2013 asked campsite visitors to use the app for the duration of their stay (ranging from 3 - 10 days). All app users were issued a feedback questionnaire and approximately half of the users were interviewed. This study found that tourists were willing to share relevant local information within their network. In addition, they were eager to use the app to offer lifts or collect shopping. However, these offers were rarely taken up and there were very few instances of help requests being placed. This suggests that despite a viable mechanism being in place, barriers to behaviour change remain. These barriers include a desire to build up ‘credit’ in the exchange system and to retain the flexibility that personal car travel allows. While this study has revealed some capacity for changing travel behaviour from the bottom-up, aside from the tourists’ good will, the policy direction does little to encourage collaborative travel...|$|R
