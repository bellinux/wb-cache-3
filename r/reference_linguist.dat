50|$|Another {{linguist}} to {{whom the}} error is attributed is Grierson. Grierson's work on the languages of India: The Linguistic Survey of India was regarded as an important <b>reference</b> by other <b>linguists.</b> In his book, Grierson had distinguished between the Konkani spoken in coastal Maharashtra (then, part of Bombay) and the Konkani spoken in Goa as two different languages. He regarded the Konkani spoken in coastal Maharashtra as a dialect of Marathi {{and not as a}} dialect of Goan Konkani itself. In his opinion, Goan Konkani was also considered a dialect of Marathi because the religious literature used by the Hindus in Goa was not in Konkani itself, but in Marathi. Grierson's opinion about Goan Konkani was not based on its linguistics but on the diglossic situation in Goa.|$|R
40|$|Benefactives are {{construction}}s used {{to express}} that a state of affairs holds to someone’s advantage. The same construction sometimes {{also serves as a}} malefactive, whose meanings are generally not a simple mirror image of the benefactive. Benefactive constructions cover a wide range of phenomena: malefactive passives, general and specialized benefactive cases and adpositions, serial verb constructions and converbal constructions (including e. g. verbs of giving and taking), benefactive applicatives, and other morphosyntactic strategies. The present book is the first collection of its kind to be published on this topic. It includes both typological surveys and in-depth descriptive studies, exploring both the morphosyntactic properties and the semantic nuances of phenomena ranging from the familiar English double-object construction and the Japanese adversative passive to comparable phenomena found in lesser-known languages of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The book will appeal to typologists and linguists interested in linguistic diversity and it will also be a useful <b>reference</b> work for <b>linguists</b> working on language description...|$|R
40|$|Statements {{about the}} future are central in {{everyday}} conversation and reasoning. How should we understand their meaning? The received view among philosophers treats will as a tense: in “Cynthia will pass her exam”, will shifts the <b>reference</b> time forward. <b>Linguists,</b> however, have produced substantial evidence for the view that will is a modal, {{on a par with}} must and would. The different accounts are designed to satisfy different theoretical constraints, apparently pulling in opposite directions. We show that these constraints are jointly satisfied by a novel modal account of will. On this account, will is a modal but doesn’t work as a quantifier over worlds. Rather, the meaning of will involves a selection function similar to the one used by Stalnaker in his semantics for conditionals. The resulting theory yields a plausible semantics and logic for will and vindicates our intuitive views about the attitudes that rational agents should have towards future-directed contents...|$|R

The Germanic languages are, as the phrase suggests, a group of languages that trace their origin to a common ancestor and constitute a branch of the Indo-European language family. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} present era, Germanic is presumed to have been “a fairly homogenous linguistic and cultural unit” (Prokosch 1939 : 26). Proto-Germanic (in German Urgermanisch) is the hypothetical “parent” language existing at a given point in time: “We assume a single Germanic language, with a common core of speakers, on the basis of elements common to all its dialects” (Lehmann 2007 : Preface). Lehmann (1977 : 287), who does not take account of possible pre-Germanic linguistic encounters, asserts further that “we … have good evidence to conclude that Germanic was little influenced in structure by external contacts leading to interference until approximately the middle of the first millennium B. C. ” After the formation of Proto-Germanic at the turn of the fifth century BCE, external influences come to be considerable. Over the course of approximately a millennium and a half, the ancestral language fragmented into dialects, which ultimately gave rise to the universally recognized independent languages of the European metropole, in all their varieties: English, German, Dutch, and Frisian comprise the West Germanic group; Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish – together with the insular Scandinavian [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} <b>reference</b> {{recognized}} by <b>linguists</b> include indefinite {{as opposed to}} definite reference, and collective and distributive reference. Definite referring expressions refer to an identifiable individual or class (The Dalai Lama; The Coldstream Guards; the student with the highest marks), whilst indefinite referring expressions allow latitude in identifying the referent (a corrupt Member of Parliament; a cat with black ears—where a is to be interpreted as any or some actual but unspecified). Collective reference is the picking out {{of the members of}} a set as a set, whilst distributive reference is the picking out of the members of a set individually. The difference may not be marked linguistically, but arrived at by interpretation in context. Compare Manchester United won again today (where the reference of Manchester United is to members of the team as a unit), with Manchester United wear red shirts and black shorts (where the reference of Manchester United is to the team members as individuals). English allows such expressions to be ambiguous: compare Manchester United are rich beyond my wildest dreams.|$|R
2500|$|Interwar Romanian intellectuals, {{primarily}} George Călinescu and Eugen Lovinescu, {{played a}} part in reevaluating and bringing to attention Șăineanu's contribution within its Romanian and international context. Șăineanu's correspondence was itself a topic of controversy between the two rival critics: after Lovinescu showed himself impressed by a letter in which Șăineanu stated E. Lovinescu m'impose ("E. Lovinescu impresses me"), Călinescu noted that his competitor had a tendency to quote [...] "all things flattering him, no matter how cheap." [...] During the same decade, the maverick writer Panait Istrati, himself a voluntary exile to France, explained that Dicționarul universal was [...] "the holy book" [...] of his Romanian adolescence. However, Lucian Nastasă notes, the antisemitic background beyond Șăineanu's rejection (as well as the similar affair involving Solomon Schechter) continued to make itself felt throughout those years, with other Jewish scholars (Leon Feraru or Alexandru Graur) being actively prevented from seeking employment in their field. Braving the violently antisemitic and authoritarian regime of Conducător Ion Antonescu, in place during most of World War II, Călinescu commented favorably on the contributions of Jewish figures to Romanian cultural life in his main synthesis, the 1941 History of Romanian Literature. It included a <b>reference</b> to Jewish <b>linguists</b> Șăineanu, Gaster, Ion Aurel Candrea, as scholars whose merits would be [...] "regrettable to deny".|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} for {{economically}} oriented transnational legal theorists to think and communicate mainly in maximizing terms. It is less common for them to notice that each time we speak explicitly of maximizing one thing, we speak implicitly of distributing another thing and equalizing yet another thing. Moreover, we effectively define ourselves and our fellow humans by reference to that which we equalize. For it is in virtue of the latter that our global welfare formulations treat us as 2 ̆ 2 counting 2 ̆ 2 for purposes of globally aggregating and maximizing. To analyze maximization language on the one hand, and equalization and identification language on the other, is to 2 ̆ 2 take distribution seriously 2 ̆ 2 in legal and policy analysis. It is to recognize that law and policy are as distributive and person-defining as they are aggregative. It is also to recognize that law and policy treat us as equals in some respects-those by which they identify and 2 ̆ 2 count 2 ̆ 2 us as politically relevant-and as non-equals in other respects. Explicitly attending to these 2 ̆ 2 respects 2 ̆ 2 brings transparency about the degrees to which our laws and policies identify, 2 ̆ 2 count, 2 ̆ 2 and treat us as equals in the right respects. This Article addresses how to take distribution seriously in transnational legal and policy analysis.

What is less common {{is for them to}} notice that each time we speak explicitly of socially maximizing one thing, we speak implicitly of distributing another thing and equalizing yet another thing. We also, moreover, effectively define ourselves and our fellow citizens by reference to that which we equalize; for it is in virtue of the latter that our social welfare formulations treat us as “counting” for purposes of socially aggregating and maximizing. To attend systematically to the inter-translatability of maximization language on the one hand, equalization and identification language on the other, is to “take distribution seriously. ” It is to recognize explicitly, and to trace the important normative consequences that stem from, the fact that all law and policy are as distributive and citizen-defining as they are aggregative. It is also to recognize therefore that all law and policy treat us as equals in some respects – respects in terms of which they identify and “count” us as politically relevant – and as non-equals in other respects. Attending explicitly to these “respects” brings transparency about the degrees to which our laws and policies identify, “count,” and treat us as equals in the right respects. This Article accordingly seeks to lay out with care how to take distribution seriously in legal and policy analysis. It does so by two means, keyed to the principal guises in which distribution is typically implicated in legal and policy analysis: First, by careful attention to the internal structures of the social welfare functions favored by most present-day legal theorists and policy analysts. And second, by systematic <b>reference</b> to what <b>linguists</b> call the “cognitive grammar” of non-formal distributive language, a structure that mirrors the structure of distribution itself.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between connections to country and wellbeing and between First Nation language and wellbeing {{have been described}} in the Australian Indigenous context (Ganesharajah 2009, Biddle & Swee 2012, Trzepacz, Guerin & Thomas 2014). This paper considers the role {{of art in the}} creative transmission of cultural and linguistic knowledge. Based on case studies from Queensland, Australia, it explores the potential for combining art therapy and language documentation methods in reconnecting community, country and language in First Nation language revival work. Aurukun is a remote community on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, Australia, where the majority of Wik-Ngathan, Wik-Ngatharr/Wik-Alken and Wik-Mungkan speakers reside. The Paman dialect group consisting of Wik-Ngathan and Wik- Ngatharr/Wik-Alken is highly endangered by language shift to another First Nation language Wik-Mungkan, as well as English. Wik-Mungkan is the first language of children at Aurukun, but is coming under increasing pressure from English. Notions of wellbeing and the relationship with country, language and creative practices will be explored through two case studies. The projects were developed in response to the concerns of community members that a lack of access to country had resulted in disruption in the inter-generational transmission of linguistic and cultural knowledge in terms of specific vocabulary, mythological narratives, land management and traditional knowledge systems. Younger people referred to unease at visiting country without this knowledge. The first case-study outlines a recovery project at a crucial stage of language loss with the aim of reinvigorating traditional language use in domains at risk of language shift through an on-country immersion camp program and the digital repatriation of archival linguistic and cultural records. This involved groups of speakers, community language workers, rangers, artists and linguists working together to foster creative opportunities for intergenerational transmission of linguistic and cultural knowledge, on country and at Aurukun, to support important cultural, social and health goals. The second case study, the Painted Stories project, explores the benefits of using similar methods when return to country is not possible, by creating a quiet and therapeutic space for people to develop their language and painting skills together, to creatively record and transmit their cultural and linguistic knowledge about country and stories between generations through innovative expression (painting, digital story-telling, collaborative work). The paper will be presented by members of the endangered language community (Wik-Ngathan and Wik-Alken), the art therapist and the <b>linguist.</b> <b>References</b> Biddle, N., & Swee, H. (2012).
