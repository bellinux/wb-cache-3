Originally numbered as 145/146, it departed Madras Beach at 06:00 on Tuesdays and arrived Ahmedabad Junction {{the next day at}} 17:30. On its <b>return</b> <b>lap,</b> it departed Ahmedabad Junction on Thursdays at 06:50, and reached Madras Beach the next evening at 19:50.|$|E

Since then, UTL has undergone a major restructuring to revive its fortunes.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of the reality show Survivor influenced Winston to make changes to the format in 2002, adding a new elimination format ("Survival of the Fastest"), and the final segment <b>returns</b> to 20 <b>laps</b> to make tire wear an issue.|$|R
25|$|The first lap saw {{the first}} of eight retirements, that being Austrian Alexander Wurz as he was caught unaware by Toyota driver Ralf Schumacher braking {{suddenly}} to avoid Giancarlo Fisichella, as the Italian returned to the track after a minor off. Six laps later, as Massa was building a lead over Hamilton, Australian Red Bull driver Mark Webber retired when the hydraulic problems that plagued him during qualifying <b>returned.</b> A <b>lap</b> later, Trulli, who had started from the pit lane after stalling on the grid, also pulled into the pits and retired due to a failing fuel line.|$|R
50|$|Rain <b>returned</b> on <b>lap</b> 77. The second {{retirement}} was World Superbike champion Troy Bayliss who spun {{into the}} at the Dipper {{bringing out the}} safety car with the running order Davison, Murphy, Todd Kelly, Cameron McConville, Lowndes, Alex Davison and Courtney. Rain came again at the restart and Owen Kelly speared into the sand at Murrays Corner. Warren Luff hit the wall at the Dipper and limped back to the pits to retire. Rick Kelly was given the 'meatball' flag for dragging the car's rear undertray, loosened after contact with Warren Luff. Steven Johnson pitted with an engine problem but rejoined and the rash of lap 84 incidents concluded with Sam Walter crashing at Griffins Bend, the same point he had crashed in practice avoiding Mark Winterbottom.|$|R
5000|$|Forced {{out of his}} {{mansion and}} desperate {{for a place to}} stay, he shacks up with another gigolo Rick's (Rob Lowe) older girlfriend's granddaughter's upscale playhouse, and {{eventually}} moves in with his estranged sister, Sara (Salma Hayek) and her nerdy son, Hugo (Raphael Alejandro) in their small apartment. Anxious to <b>return</b> to the <b>lap</b> of luxury, Maximo uses his nephew’s crush on classmate Arden (Mckenna Grace), to get to his new target—her grandmother, Celeste (Raquel Welch), a widowed billionaire.|$|R
50|$|On lap 52, Matt Kenseth made a pit stop, as Ku. Busch passed Sadler for 2nd. Sadler fell to 4th on {{the next}} lap while Gordon and Juan Pablo Montoya moved into the 5th and 2nd positions. On lap 56, Montoya became the new leader, and J.J. Yeley had a flat tire, as drivers began to pit. As Montoya made a pit stop, debris from Yeley's race car brought out a caution {{on the next}} lap. The green flag <b>returned</b> on <b>lap</b> 63, as Gordon passed Montoya for first. On the {{following}} lap, A. J. Allmendinger collided with Ky. Busch, turned backwards, and collided with the wall. Gordon led the driver to the green flag on lap 69, but Keselowski led lap 70 after passing Gordon. Gordon reclaimed the lead after passing Keselowski. Then, Montoya reclaimed the lead from Gordon on lap 74.|$|R

50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 45 with Johnson, Busch, Martin, Kurt Busch, and Denny Hamlin {{rounding out}} the Top 5. On lap 51, Ky. Busch {{took the lead}} away from Johnson with Martin still in 2nd. By lap 55, Johnson, with a loose car, had fallen to the 6th place. Rain <b>returned</b> by <b>lap</b> 71, resulting in yet another caution. After pit stops that followed, Carl Edwards gained 10 positions, Jamie McMurray gained 16, Reutiman gained 7, and Martin Truex, Jr. gained 13. Vickers lost 6. Martin's crew lost a tire from their pit, resulting in a penalty for him. Robby Gordon stayed out and led a lap. Waltrip and Scott Riggs also stayed out. Approximately 55 minutes {{after the start of}} the race, the red flag was waved on lap 74 for rain. R. Gordon, Waltrip, Riggs, KY. Busch, Edwards, Reutimann, McMurray, Joey Logano, Kahne, and Juan Pablo Montoya made up the Top 10 at that time.|$|R
50|$|Late in the afternoon, Cliff Woodbury {{took to the}} track, and {{tentatively}} put his car on the top spot. His four-lap {{average of}} 120.599 mph, however, was not near a track record. After Woodbury's run, Leon Duray took his Packard Cable Special to the bricks. He took one warm-up <b>lap,</b> <b>returned</b> to the pits for adjustments, then took two more warm-up laps. The next time around he started his run. His first lap was turned at only 120.289 mph, slower than Woodbury's average. Duray was unable to muster any more speed, and settled for second {{at an average of}} 119.087 mph.|$|R
50|$|The green flag {{came out}} again on lap 104. Hélio Castroneves led {{for the opening}} few laps after the restart, but soon fell behind Ryan Hunter-Reay, Townsend Bell, and Tony Kanaan. These three would fight for the lead {{for the next several}} laps, {{swapping}} positions regularly. On lap 115, the 4th caution period of the race occurred when the rear suspension on the car of Mikhail Aleshin broke, sending him spinning into the turn one wall. Conor Daly was also collected in the incident after spinning in an attempt to avoid Aleshin's car. Daly retired from the race due to the incident, while Aleshin would eventually <b>return</b> after many <b>laps</b> of repair.|$|R
50|$|On lap 94, Tony Kanaan charged {{into the}} lead. He {{set a new}} all-time record by leading a lap in seven {{consecutive}} Indy 500 races. He broke Rick Mears' record of six straight races led (1979-1984). His continuing bad luck at Indy <b>returned</b> however 11 <b>laps</b> later. Scott Dixon took the lead back on lap 105. Marco Andretti, Kanaan's AGR teammate, dove low in turn three to overtake, which was followed by Kanaan going high and into the marbles. Kanaan lost control of his car, brushing the wall, then collecting the lapped car of Sarah Fisher. Both cars were heavily damaged. The caution was then extended when Jeff Simmons car suddenly veered and hit the inside wall on the frontstretch.|$|R
50|$|David Stremme {{took over}} for the team at Bristol with Air Guard as a donated sponsor. For the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 500, the team picked up {{sponsorship}} from GlobeTrack Wireless. At Sonoma, Said <b>returned,</b> led eight <b>laps</b> and finished eighth. Boris Said left the team because he said Jenkins wasn't being fair with his employees, {{and ended up in}} the 83 Red Bull Toyota for 1 race, wishing Stremme good luck. Patrick Carpentier ran at Watkins Glen and Michigan after Stremme left on similarly unfriendly terms. Carpentier and Jeff Green split the ride {{for the remainder of the}} 2010 season. Ken Schrader drove the car at Martinsville, Bill Elliott ran at Talladega, and J.J. Yeley at Phoenix. The team failed to qualify for nine events and finished 37th in owner's points.|$|R
50|$|The most {{well known}} story is of Slhx̱i7lsh or Siwash Rock. The story passed down {{tells of a}} men {{committed}} to his marriage, trained for the coming of his future child by taking morning swims in the water near Ambleside Park {{in what is now}} West Vancouver. During his <b>lap</b> <b>returning,</b> the Transformers in their canoe blocked his passage. They told him he had to move and that he could not pass, but his determination told him he would do what he must for his wife and future child. The Transformers were amazed at his defiance of them as the emissaries of the Great Spirit, and decided upon his fate. He would be transformed into the rock outcropping for all future generations to remember his sacrifice for cleanliness and fatherhood. His wife was also transformed into a rock, which is nearby Siwash Rock.|$|R
50|$|As {{the season}} progressed, the teams began to suffer. After Helsinki was the 24 Hours of Le Mans, {{in which only}} a lone GT1 was entered due to concern over the car's ability to last 24 hours. The car had an oil pump failure after 121 <b>laps.</b> <b>Returning</b> to FIA at the Nürburgring, the full team (five cars) managed to muster only 11th place, while at Spa they {{achieved}} 8th, but at Zeltweg all five cars failed to finish again. The teams did not attempt the Suzuka round, and again could only earn 12th place at Donington and 11th at Mugello when the series returned to Europe. The final two races in the United States saw only the factory team bring two cars, in which they managed a 13th and 9th-place finish. The factory squad ended the season without any points, while GBF's points finish at Helsinki earned them 8th place in the championship.|$|R
5000|$|The actual {{gameplay}} {{is quite}} simple. Players need {{to finish in}} the top ten positions in each race {{to qualify for the}} next one. There is a map that shows the course layout, the position of the players, and the position of the car in first place. The player is given 6 [...] "nitro boosts" [...] at the start which dramatically increase the car's speed {{for a short period of}} time. On certain courses, there are pickups along the road ranging from a [...] "$" [...] which is $1,000 cash, a [...] "N" [...] which is an extra [...] "nitro boost", and a [...] "S" [...] which is an automatic nitro administered right when picked up and <b>returns</b> each <b>lap.</b> The other pickups can only be collected once per race. Players must take care to avoid too much damage to any area of the armor. If a section of armor is destroyed and the player takes damage in the area that the destroyed section of the armor used to protect, the car will spin out. Racers will be disqualified if they run out of fuel and coast to a stop before finishing the race. Since there are no pits for cars to refuel in unlike the first game, upgrading the transmission becomes mandatory in order to get the fuel economy needed to survive the longer races in the later portions of the game. Since the Genesis port of this game does not implement a fuel gauge, fuel economy is not a problem in that port.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the safety car came in, Hamilton was leading from Ricciardo and Verstappen, who had {{made a series of}} overtakes in the {{slippery}} conditions, with the Ferraris fourth and fifth. Verstappen overtook Ricciardo on lap 11 for second place, having started 16th, again demonstrating his skill in difficult conditions (similar to the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix). With the Ferraris unable to overtake Ricciardo, Hamilton and Verstappen pull out a significant lead, with Hamilton four seconds ahead of Verstappen and nine seconds ahead of Ricciardo by lap 20 - the lap Vettel overtook Räikkönen. Two laps later, Vettel overtook Ricciardo and rapidly closed in on Verstappen. By lap 27, Hamilton had built a lead of 8.5 s over Verstappen with Vettel about 1.5 s further back, and Ricciardo and Räikkönen about 2 s apart and 4 s behind Vettel. Verstappen made a mistake on lap 29, locking up and allowing Vettel to pass for second, 10.6 s behind Hamilton with 27 laps remaining. Verstappen stopped for fresh super-soft tyres the following <b>lap,</b> <b>returning</b> to the track 6th behind Bottas.|$|R
50|$|On lap 35, Johnson {{continued}} to lead over Martin and Kenseth, while Bowyer {{was placed in}} fourth. Johnson {{continued to}} expand his lead over Martin to over a second by the 43rd lap in the race. Less than ten laps later, Johnson passed Kurt Busch, who started ninth, to place him a lap behind the leaders. On the 56th lap, Gordon overtook Kyle Busch for the fifth position, as Newman fell to tenth after Hamlin and Edwards passed him. Thirteen laps later, David Stremme retired from the race as green flag pit stops began after McMurray, Biffle, Hamlin and Harvick came to pit road. Kenseth and ten other drivers pitted on the following lap, as Martin, Johnson, Bowyer, Earnhardt, Jr., and Gordon pitted on the 71st lap. Two laps later, Stewart, {{who was involved in}} the accident during the ninth <b>lap,</b> <b>returned</b> to the race after repairs to the car. At lap 75, Kurt Busch was given a drive-through penalty after entering pit road too fast, as Martin reclaimed the lead.|$|R
50|$|With the new 2010 NASCAR {{start time}} rule change that starts races only at 1:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m., and 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time, track {{officials}} {{were concerned that}} the new start time (45 minutes earlier than in the past) would put {{the majority of the}} race in the day instead of the planned night. At that time of year in Phoenix, sunset takes place at roughly 7:00 p.m. MST (because Arizona does not observe daylight saving time, this is the same as Pacific Daylight Time). As a result, the race was stretched to 600 kilometers (375 miles) so that the extra 100 kilometers (63 miles) would take place during the day, and most of the race would still take place at night as planned. However, in 2011, the race moved one week after the Daytona 500 in February. The race <b>returned</b> to 312 <b>laps</b> (500 kilometers) and was run on Sunday in the daytime for the first time. In 2015, Phoenix moved from the second to the fourth race of the season in mid-March.|$|R
50|$|Since the 2012 premiership, Johnson has {{suffered}} repeated knee injuries, {{and as of}} July 2017 he is yet to make another senior appearance for Sydney. He tore his left anterior cruciate ligament in Sydney's 2013 NAB Cup match against the Gold Coast Suns, and underwent two knee reconstructions during 2013 - a traditional reconstruction in April and a LARS reconstruction in July. He returned to {{the field for the}} Sydney reserves in early 2014, but tore the ligament again in his first game back. It was not until September 2016 that Johnson was even able to <b>return</b> to running <b>laps</b> after this second injury, as it took a further three reconstruction surgeries between 2014 and 2016 before his knee successfully healed due to various complications and infections. Johnson remained on the Sydney playing list through this time, and performed an assistant coaching role with the Sydney reserves. He finally returned to the field for the Sydney reserves in July 2017, more than three years after his previous game.|$|R
25|$|For 2007, Hughes {{moved to}} Embassy Racing, who were {{entering}} a LMP2-class Radical SR9-Judd in the Le Mans Series (the team having initially entered with a Pilbeam MP93.) Despite the move, however, his season {{started in the}} same way as the previous one had; with two retirements in the first two rounds for Hughes and his teammate Neil Cunningham. Hughes returned to Team ASM for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, partnering the same drivers as he had in 2006, but once more failed to finish, due to an accident after 137 <b>laps.</b> <b>Returning</b> to the LMS after the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Hughes took fifth place in class at the 1000km of Nürburgring, before finishing sixth in class at the 1000km of Spa, partnered by Darren Manning for the first time. An eighth place at the 1000km of Silverstone was followed by a second place at the final round of the season, the Mil Milhas Brasil, where Manning and Hughes were joined by Mario Haberfield. Hughes finished seventh in class at the end of the season, with Embassy Racing finishing seventh as well.|$|R
40|$|Background. Airway {{pressure}} release ventilation (APRV) is {{a mode of}} mechanical ventilation that theoretically believed to improve cardiac output by lowering right atrial pressure.

50|$|Daniel Ricciardo beat pole-sitter Nico Rosberg {{into the}} first corner for the lead. Behind the pair Sebastian Vettel {{collided}} with his teammate Kimi Räikkönen while trying to avoid Red Bull Racing's Daniil Kvyat. Both Ferraris were able to continue the race. Further down the pack Romain Grosjean picked up some damage as well, while Lewis Hamilton collided with Felipe Nasr and got his front wing caught under his car. Räikkönen, Grosjean, Hamilton and Nasr all made a pit-stop {{at the end of}} the first lap. Ricciardo kept the lead until his left-rear tyre failed during lap 3 on the long straight between turns 13 and 14. Rosberg overtook him and he swiftly went to the pit lane for a new set of tyres, dropping him down the field. One lap later the Safety Car was deployed to allow the stewards to clear debris from the track. Kvyat, Pérez, Vettel, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button, Bottas, Verstappen, Ericsson and Magnussen all elected to make a pit-stop during this safety car period to pick up fresh tyres. Vettel had his damaged front wing changed as well. Rosberg elected to stay out, however. Hamilton came to the pit lane as well, but <b>returned</b> just one <b>lap</b> later to change his set of red-banded supersoft tyres for a set of yellow-banded soft ones.|$|R
5000|$|Alterman was not {{the only}} person to speak out against the Canaanites. Among the {{important}} critics of the movement was Baruch Kurzweil, who published The Roots and Quintessence of the 'Young Hebrews' Movement in 1953, which analyzed and sharply criticized Canaanite ideas. Kurzweil argued that the Canaanite ambition to motivate the variegated ethnography of the region in a single direction was not as easy as the Canaanites believed. Kurzweil believed the Canaanites replaced logos with mythos, producing a religious delusion:Since it itself neglects the historical continuity of its people, introduces obscure concepts into their political vision in its declarations of a 'Hebrew Land on the Euphrates', and relies on increasingly irrational argumentation, the movement is liable to find itself an escape into the realm of myth.The Young Hebrews are not the first to launch themselves into the task of mythic renewal. Their original contribution is rather stale. For over a hundred years, the world has pined for a <b>return</b> to the <b>lap</b> of myth. The escapes into various myths have hitherto inflicted disasters upon humanity. In the spirit of good faith, it is best to assume that the whole chapter of mythic renewal in European thought is unclear to them. For the moment, we shall content ourselves with this quotation from Huizinga: [...] "Barbarization sets in when, in an old culture… the vapors of the magic and fantastic rise up again from the seething brew of passions to cloud the understanding: when the mythos supplants the logos." ...|$|R

5000|$|The first ninety-minute {{practice}} session {{began with the}} drivers performing installation <b>laps,</b> <b>returning</b> to pit lane before setting a lap time so as {{to work on the}} car setup. The majority of drivers completed the session using the harder [...] "prime" [...] tyres, while several teams — including Ferrari and Lotus — used the session to test new aerodynamic configurations to their front and rear wings. The surface of the circuit was visibly sandy, owing to a lack of use in the two years prior to the event. Force India's Nico Hülkenberg was the first driver to record a lap time, twenty minutes into the session. Romain Grosjean moved {{to the top of the}} timing sheets as the majority of drivers began to emerge from the pit lane for timed runs, though the difference between Grosjean's time and Hülkenberg's was negligible. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel both improved upon the fastest times, but by the time every driver had recorded a timed lap, it was Lewis Hamilton who posted the fastest time. Hamilton's time of 1:33.572 went unchallenged for the remainder of the session. Vettel was second-fastest, three tenths behind the McLaren driver, while Paul di Resta in the second Force India was third, having switched to the softer [...] "option" [...] tyres in the last ten minutes.With Force India electing not to take part in the second session over security concerns, twenty-two cars took to the circuit for Friday's second ninety-minute {{practice session}}. A GP2 practice session between the first and second Formula One sessions meant that some of the sand on the surface of the circuit was cleaned up, and teams began their first runs on the softer option compound of tyres. Narain Karthikeyan was the first driver out, setting a lap time of 1:41.710 almost straight away. Several other drivers, including Jean-Éric Vergne, Vitaly Petrov, Pastor Maldonado, Timo Glock and Daniel Ricciardo also emerged, setting lap times within the first five minutes of the session starting. After the initial rush of the first fifteen minutes, Jenson Button emerged as the fastest man on the circuit before being surpassed by Mark Webber moments later. Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel, Nico Rosberg all led the field by the halfway point, but it was Rosberg who led the way into the final ten minutes of the session when all twenty-two cars were out on the circuit together. Rosberg's time of 1:32.816 was enough to see him through to the end of the session in front, four-tenths of a second faster than Webber, with Vettel third. After finishing in front in the first session, Lewis Hamilton was fourth, while Bruno Senna — back in his car after being replaced by Bottas in the first session — ended the session in eighteenth, behind the Caterham of Heikki Kovalainen and narrowly ahead of Marussia driver Timo Glock.|$|R
