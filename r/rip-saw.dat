50|$|Quarter sawing also quarter-cut {{is a type}} of cut in the <b>rip-sawing</b> of logs into lumber. The {{resulting}} lumber {{is called}} quartersawn (quarter-sawn), quartered, and radially-sawn. There is widespread confusion between the terms quartersawn and riftsawn with both words defined with opposite meanings and as synonyms.|$|R
40|$|In the {{production}} of sawn hardwood a critical processing step is the quality grading. The grading has normally been handled manually in the hardwood sawmills. The process has been labour intensive and a problematic working environment. With the help from existing scanning technology {{it is possible to}} automate the process with several benefits as a result. These are e. g. a decreased need of labour, a better working environment and the possibility to use more complicated grading rules. Thereby the wood could be used in a more optimal way with both cost and environmental benefits. One problem when grading hardwood is that camera and laser based scanning technology has mainly been used on planed surfaces. Normally the quality grading in hardwood sawmills is performed before planing. The wood may then be cross-cutted to components before planing in order to minimise the volume losses because of deformations of the wood pieces. In order to investigate the possibilities to scan the sawn wood before planing <b>rip-sawn</b> birch boards (Betula pubescens Ehrh., Betula pendula Roth.) was scanned before and after planing the wood. The used scanner was a commercial system for automatic sorting of wood. Before the scanning it was estimated that the sawn surfaces exposed to the surrounding environment during drying would not generate any usable results from the scanning. Therefore only the two <b>rip-sawn</b> surfaces were used for evaluation before and after planing. The evaluation was made by comparing the results from the quality grading before and after the planing based on grading rules used by Swedish hardwood sawmill. The results show that there are possibilities to grade the birch wood before planing. The study, however, shows that the scanner has difficulties in detecting small colour variations as brown streaks and fresh knots. It is also difficult to detect fibre angle deviations because of loose fibres on the sawn surface. The possibilities to scan the birch wood are thereby related to the grading rules, i. e. if the mentioned quality parameters are allowed or not. Upprättat; 2010; 20130911 (ysko) </p...|$|R

5000|$|Around 1911, {{he began}} {{contributing}} occasional poems to The National <b>Rip-Saw,</b> “America’s Greatest Socialist Monthly,” edited by Phil Wagner and based in St. Louis, Missouri. By {{the end of}} 1912 Tichenor had also published under Wagner at least five pamphlets including; [...] "A Wave of Horror," [...] "The Evils of Capitalism," [...] "The <b>Rip-Saw</b> Mother Goose," [...] "Woman Under Capitalism," [...] and [...] "Rip-Saw Socialism Songs."In January 1913, while continuing to write for the <b>Rip-Saw,</b> Tichenor joined forces with Wagner’s publishing company to launch his own socialist journal, The Melting Pot, a publication whose mission proclaimed in the inaugural issue was to subject to fiery scrutiny society's lies of class, privilege, war and most especially organized religion. The cover of the magazine carried an illustration of a metal worker with the tools of his trade and the motto, “If it won’t stand {{the heat of the}} Melting Pot, its no good.” Tichenor served as its editor until it ceased publication with his retirement in 1920.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1914 Wagner and Tichenor visited Socialist {{party leader}} and former U.S. presidential {{candidate}} Eugene V. Debs and {{persuaded him to}} write editorials and to speak for The National <b>Rip-Saw.</b> [...] Later that same year, the <b>Rip-Saw</b> issued a collection of Tichenor’s poems titled “Rhymes of the Revolution,” including an introduction by Debs in which the prominent socialist heaped breathless praise upon the author: “He hates with a hate that is holy the brazen shams and superstitions inculcated by a mamonized church {{in the name of}} religion and scourges without mercy the pious perverts who under the cloak of the Carpenter betray their followers into bondage.” ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the pages}} of the National <b>Rip-Saw,</b> a St. Louis-based socialist journal in the 1910s, O'Hare championed reforms in favor of the working class and toured the country as an orator. In 1916 the Socialist Party of Missouri named O'Hare its {{candidate}} for U.S. Senate, heading the Socialist ticket in the state.|$|E
50|$|Another {{publication}} {{to which}} Tichenor contributed for The National <b>Rip-Saw</b> in 1914 {{was a series}} of articles later republished as a 63-page pamphlet titled “Barnhill-Tichenor Debate on Socialism.” The publication included a handful of editorial-style cartoons. One of them depicted an evil, dark-faced Christian minister standing at a dollar-sign pulpit and exhorting a pious yet poor working-class family with “Slaves, be obedient to your masters!” as a fat, rich member of the “master class” looks on smugly.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{joined the}} Socialist Party of America in 1912. Johnson later {{recalled}} {{that he came}} to the socialist movement through his participation in school debates — assigned to argue a position of the Democratic Party, Johnson had prepared by reading the perspectives of other organizations, including the Socialists. Soon he was immersed in Marxist literature and subscribing to the major socialist periodicals of the day, including the Appeal to Reason, the National <b>Rip-Saw,</b> and the International Socialist Review.|$|E
50|$|In 1915, Tichenor {{published}} {{his first full}} book-length work, The Life and Exploits of Jehovah, in which he brutally satirized the God of the Old Testament. This was followed the next year with The Creed of Constantine; or the World Needs a New Religion in which Tichenor turned his acid pen upon Christianity. Eugene Debs again wrote in support of Tichenor by producing a review of this book in the January 1917 issue of The National <b>Rip-Saw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Francis Peter O'Hare, {{best known}} as Frank P. O'Hare (1877-1960), was an American socialist {{political}} activist, journalist, and newspaper editor. O'Hare is best remembered as the husband and helpmate of Kate Richards O'Hare, one of the preeminent female socialists {{of the first quarter}} of the 20th Century, and as co-editor with her of The National <b>Rip-Saw,</b> a St. Louis socialist weekly. Following the couple's 1928 divorce, Frank O'Hare made a career as a writer and columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} saw was invented {{around the end}} of the 18th century as a <b>rip-saw</b> to convert logs into lumber (timber) in sawmills and various claims have been made as to who invented the {{circular saw}}. Before the design was invented logs were sawn by hand using a pit saw or using powered saws in a sawmill using an up-and-down saw with a reciprocating motion. The rotary nature of the circular saw requires more power to operate but cuts faster because the teeth are in constant motion. The sound of the circular saw is different from the sound of an up-and-down saw and earned it the nickname buzz-saw.|$|E
50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm saw, band saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first <b>rip-saw</b> a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller portable sawmills and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, timber {{would have}} been cut down and {{prepared}} using axes, with wedges used for splitting and adzes for finishing surfaces. The ability to produce wrought iron enabled the production of metal that could be shaped, toothed and sharpened to form saw blades. Prior to the 1840 s {{and the introduction of}} rotating “circular” saws, saw mills exclusively used a vertical movement for converting the trees into timber. Saw mills were traditionally powered by water, with the rotary motion of the wheel being transferred via a crank shaft to a <b>rip-saw</b> blade mounted in a vertical wooden frame known as a sash...|$|E
40|$|Despite much of {{the forests}} being cleared in advance of {{agricultural}} expansion, areas of oak woodland have been managed as a valuable resource passed on {{from one generation to}} the next. The longevity of oak trees has required long term planning and an ability to forecast the demand of great grandchildren and beyond. Depending on circumstances, this management would have happened historically within family groups, or perhaps on a communal basis as part of the feudal system. Prior to the 1840 s and the introduction of rotating “circular” saws, saw mills exclusively used a vertical movement for converting the trees into timber. Saw mills were traditionally powered by water, with the rotary motion of the wheel being transferred via a crank shaft to a <b>rip-saw</b> blade mounted in a vertical wooden frame known as a sash. The introduction of steam power would have also contributed to the demise of water power for timber conversion in the UK...|$|E
