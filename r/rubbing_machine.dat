On the morning of August 9, 1945, the 16 year old Taniguchi was 1800 m from the hypocenter, {{delivering}} mail on his bicycle without a shirt on due to the warm summer weather, when [...] "Fat Man" [...] exploded in the sky over Urakami. The bomb's heat flash heavily injured Taniguchi with near instant burns resulting, but the blast that arrived afterwards did not cause any severe injuries {{to him as he}} clung to the ground while buildings were blown down around him. Heavy burns melted skin from his back and left arm, but Taniguchi states that he did not bleed or feel any pain due to the nerve endings being burned away. Tired and disoriented, he walked over to a nearby munitions plant, where a female survivor assisted in cutting off loose portions of skin and <b>rubbed</b> <b>machine</b> oil on his damaged arm.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMechanical {{friction}} and impacts is still today a {{main cause of}} ignition of explosive atmospheres (ATEX) in the industry and this trend seems to be stable in time. This situation certainly results from a significant gap of knowledge in the underlying mechanisms so that the parameters to play on are not precisely identified. In this programme of European dimensions, the process of degradation of the mechanical energy into heat during {{friction and}} impacts have been studied. An extensive experimental programme is presented to this end. The mechanisms of dissipation of the mechanical energy into heat during friction has been studied with <b>rubbing</b> <b>machines</b> in which a slider equipped with temperature sensors rubs against a rotating wheel. For impacts, a new device has been developed using a special "air driven cannon" to propel a projectile accurately up to 50 m/s onto an inclined target. A very significant effort has been reserved to {{the investigation of the}} ignition mechanisms, not only for ATEX but also for dust accumulations. Some "simple" modelling is proposed on purpose of practical applications. For frictional situations, a critical rubbing power is calculated without any limitations about any lower boundary concerning the rubbing velocity. For "impacts", the relevant parameter for ignition is not the kinetic energy of the projectile but its velocity {{and the nature of the}} materials...|$|R
30|$|Three {{tests were}} done, {{one for each}} print {{property}} (adhesion, rub resistance, and gloss). The tests done were standard test methods used by the local industry for evaluating print properties of water-based inks. For adhesion, the adhesion tape test method was done, using a standard 3 M tape, 1 – 1.5 in. long, and manually pulling off the tape to determine the degree of ink adhesion or ink removal from the substrate. The results were interpreted as either percent ink adhesion or percent ink removal. For the rub resistance test, a <b>rub</b> tester <b>machine</b> was used. A 2 -lb weight was placed {{on top of the}} substrate and then rubbed back and forth for a set of 20 cycles, which corresponds to 40 rubs in total. The resulting degree of rubbing was recorded, as it is considered as inversely related to the rub resistance. For the gloss measurement method, a glossmeter set at 60 ° angle of light reflection was used to measure the gloss of the ink substrate in terms of gloss units.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 49 - 58 A {{critical}} multistage {{steam turbine}} {{in a large}} chemical plant experienced high vibration levels and frequent repairs. Numerous failures occurred while passing through the rotor's first critical speed including heavy rubs. An analysis of the rotor/ bearing system dynamics revealed that the rotor was highly sensitive to unbalance. Several different solutions were modelled and evaluated. Modifications to the shaft were rejected and modifications to the machine case were too costly and too time consuming. A combination tilting pad journal bearing encased in a squeeze film damper was proposed along {{with the addition of}} two nonfunctional "dummy" wheels that lowered the first critical speed, improving the separation margin. The damper is supplied with normal oil pressure that then feeds the journal bearing. This solution was implemented, resulting in a significant reduction in rotor amplification factor from 14. 8 to 4. 2 and greatly reduced vibration amplitudes throughout the operating speed range eliminating the rotor <b>rubs.</b> This <b>machine</b> is now operating well and has survived many startups and shutdowns without incident...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{analytical}} and experimental research on rotor-to-stationary element <b>rubbing</b> in rotating <b>machines</b> are presented. A characterization of physical phenomena associated with rubbing, {{as well as}} a literature survey on the subject of rub is given. The experimental results were obtained from two rubbing rotor rigs: one, which dynamically simulates the space shuttle main engine high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP), and the second one, much simpler, a two-mode rotor rig, designed for more generic studies on rotor-to-stator rubbing. Two areas were studied: generic rotor-to-stator rub-related dynamic phenomena affecting rotating machine behavior and applications to the space shuttle HPFTP. An outline of application of dynamic stiffness methodology for identification of rotor/bearing system modal parameters is given. The mathematical model of rotor/bearing/seal system under rub condition is given. The computer program was developed to calculate rotor responses.

40|$|Physical {{contact between}} the rotor and stationaryelements is a main topic {{in the field of}} rotordynamics. In the last decades, many studies have {{investigated}} the causes and the consequences of this phenomenon; the so-called ‘rub’, resulting in several theories and mathematical models. Muszynska characterized the rub from a phenomenological point of view in different conditions, both steady-state and transient; her studies laid the foundations and inspired research in the following years in many universities and research centers. State-of-the-Art methods permit to recognize, in a simple way, the <b>rub</b> during <b>machine</b> operating condition but in spite of the amount of studies, it is still difficult to prevent the occurrence of rubbing. This paper focuses on identifying what are the forerunner symptoms of rubbing without attach specific attention to the rub and even to the consequences on the machine behavior. The authors investigate how to prevent the occurrence of rub by detecting its symptoms by means of analysis of the vibration and of the diagnostic data. For this purpose, the conventional graphic tools are used: Bode plot, polar plot, cascade plot, waterfall plot, centerline plot, time-based plot etc. The dynamic behavior of two high-pressure steam turbines, which have been damaged by a physical {{contact between the}} rotor and a stationary part, is analyzed. In order to investigate the evolutionary trend of the vibration for possible rub detection, a new graphic tool was developed by the authors. This work is born thanks to an industrial interest about the identification of evidences in the dynamic behavior of the forthcoming rub. The data are available in three different sets of measurements, for both the high-pressure turbines. The data cover a quite long period but they are not available during the rubbing. It must be noticed that the rub has occurred, for both turbines, immediately after a trip of the machine, so it is not excludable, a priori, that the cause of the trip has not been the same cause of the rubbing...|$|R
40|$|Not dyed wool yarns and fabrics {{were treated}} by {{ultraviolet}} radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to}} obtain a modification onto fibre surface. As consequence, UV treated wool showed increase in metal ions absorption and hydrophilicity, together with improved kinetics of dye absorption under the same dyeing conditions as untreated wool. The surface modification of wool due to UV radiations was confirmed by FTIR-ATR analysis, nevertheless the fibre morphology by SEM analysis was unaffected. Experimental results showed that different kind of dyes are able to give differential dyeing after irradiation, but not all members of the same dyeing class have similar behaviour. Then, a selection of 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes was chosen to evidence the maximum of difference between irradiated and not irradiated areas. The main interests on wool fabrics were focused on two effects: a) one shade, double face with different depth, higher on treated side; b) two shades, double face with different colour and depth. Moreover it was found that UV pretreatment can be useful to obtain the same dyeing with lower temperature conditions (85 °C). Fastness evaluations towards dry <b>rubbing</b> and <b>machine</b> washing at 50 °C were also carried out to confirm the feasibility of this alternative dyeing technique; in all experiments carried out with selected 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes the same score of conventional premetallized 1 : 1 dyeings was obtained. Dyed cotton yarns and fabrics were treated by ultraviolet radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to obtain}} a fading of coloured fibre surface. As consequence, UV-treated dyed cotton showed different resistances to discoloration {{as a function of the}} selections of reactive dyes used; a selection of cold-reactive dyes (applicable at 60 ° C on cellulosic fibers), having good contrast between UV treated part and untreated, was presented. Industrial applications for discontinuous and continuous treatments (yarns or fabrics) and new proposal are also presented, with an economical evaluation of the processes (feasibility, reliability and effective costs...|$|R
40|$|Aim: {{to compare}} the repair process of DNA double-strand breaks in {{mammalian}} cells after acute versus prolonged exposure to X-ray irradiation with different dose rates. Material and methods. Studies were performed on primary human fibroblasts isolated from skin biopsies of healthy volunteers (women, 29 and 30 years). Cells were irradiated using an X-ray <b>machine</b> <b>RUB</b> RUST-M 1 (JSC "Ruselectronics", Moscow, Russia) at 37 °C temperature with a dose rate of 400 mGy/min (200 kV, 2 * 2. 4 mA, a filter of 1. 5 mm AI) or 4 mGy/min (50 kV, 2 * 0. 4 mA, a filter of 1. 5 mm AI). Immuno-cytochemical protein staining was utilized for yH 2 AX and Rad 51 foci analysis. Results. Phosphorylated histone H 2 AX (yH 2 AX) and the key protein of homologous recombination Rad 51 foci formation and disappearance kinetics were investigated simultaneously in primary human dermal fibroblasts after acute and prolonged exposure to X-ray radiation at a same dose. It was shown that the relative yield of yH 2 AX foci per dose reduces with decrease in dose rate, while the relative yield of Rad 51 foci conversely increases. Conclusion. Our findings suggest the fundamental differences in the ratio of non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination DNA repair in acute versus prolonged irradiated cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{friction}} forces due to light rotor-to-stator <b>rubs</b> in rotating <b>machines</b> {{can cause a}} time-varying thermal bow of the shafts. Owing to this, stable partial arc rubs and full-annular rubs can induce mainly progressive changes in the synchronous vibrations of the rotor-trains. Sometimes, stable or unstable synchronous spiral vibrations can occur. The equivalent bending moments that cause the shaft bow can be estimated with model based identification methods developed in the frequency domain: these techniques minimise the error between the machine experimental vibrations and the system response provided by the model. In this paper, the results obtained by {{the analysis of the}} experimental response of a turbine-generator unit that was subjected to rotor-to-stator contacts are shown together with the strategy used to identify the causes of the rubs. The rate of the increase of the time dependent bending moments induced by the rubs, estimated in this investigation with an identification technique, provided useful information about the thermal characteristics of the system which should be modelled by means of equivalent parameters in more complex and accurate methods in which the motion and thermal equations of the fully assembled machine are integrated in the time domain.

40|$|Turbine {{shaft seals}} are {{vulnerable}} to rubs caused by thermal distortion, mis-alignment and rotor dynamic vibration that are often not well understood. When seals <b>rub</b> as a <b>machine</b> is brought up to operating conditions performance is compromised due to increased seal leakage. Much effort has been extended {{in recent years to}} develop seals that mitigate those losses. This paper presents a seal design with segmented film riding runners capable of non-contacting seal operation during rotor transients. Operating differential seal pressure displaces seal leaves and attached runners toward the rotor surface until balanced by hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift. Sufficient radial range of operation is provided to follow the rotor seal surface during transients while maintaining a small seal clearance. Seal design features and function will be described and illustrated along with analysis of forces and motions for a sample application. Planned modeling and testing will also be presented. This concept promises enhanced shaft sealing by combining a leaf seal structure that provides a large range of motion to avoid rubs during startup and shutdown with runner elements capable of generating hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift forces to maintain shaft- seal separation during all rotor displacement transients. Improved turbine performance from small operating seal clearance and extended seal life without rubs are expected benefits of the Film Riding Pressure Actuated Leaf Seal (FRPALS) ...|$|R
