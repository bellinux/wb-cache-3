50|$|The 1987 Allanté {{featured}} a removable aluminum hardtop, the industry's first power retractable AM/FM/Cellular Telephone antenna and a multi-port fuel injected variant of GM's aluminum 4.1 L HT-Cadillac 4100 V8, along with <b>roller</b> <b>valve</b> lifters, high-flow cylinder heads, and a tuned intake manifold. The roadster {{featured a}}n independent strut-based suspension system front and rear, Bosch ABS III four-wheel disc brakes and a complex lamp-out module that substituted a burned-out bulb in the exterior lighting system with an adjacent lamp until correction of the problem. The Delco-GM/Bose Symphony Sound System - a $905 option on other Cadillacs - was standard on Allanté. The only option was a cellular telephone, {{installed in a}} lockable center console.|$|E
40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} robots that require {{some sort of}} safety measures in operation, compliant robots capable of interacting with the environment in a gentle way and perform self-adjustment according to the surroundings are of greater need nowadays. To achieve compliance, robots with variable stiffness are highly desirable. Principles of stiffness control for conventional actuators and rigid robots, such as spring-based variable stiffness and impedance mechanisms, have been thoroughly studied. In this thesis, {{the focus is on}} the novel principles of variable stiffness, in particular, on geometry-based and jamming-based methods, and their innovative applications in robotics. The utilization of 3 D printing technology in this research brings new insight into robotic research. At first, a non-assembly design of a compliant pneumatic stepper motor based on the ratchet and pawl mechanism is proposed for robotic drives. The proposed stepper motor can generate rotary stepping motion in response to a train of pulse air pressure. In addition, the pawl is designed as a compliant mechanism instead of conventional rigid component. As a result, the whole mechanism can be fabricated by 3 D printing without any post-assembly or installation of other components. However, the ratchet and pawl mechanism based stepper motor has speed limitation and velocity discontinuity problems. An updated design of non-assembly pneumatic stepper motor allows velocity control, and the switch between continuous motion and stepping motion. The key element to realize the dual motion pattern is an innovative design of a <b>roller</b> <b>valve</b> inspired by the cam-follower mechanism. The <b>roller</b> <b>valve</b> can also modulate the stiffness of robots by air pressure control. The proposed concept of non-assembly robotic design and fabrication based on 3 D printing and the proposed stepper motor designs can bring design innovation to various robots, such as household robots, industrial robots and so on. The geometry-based principle is applicable for compliant robots with rigid parts. For better compliance, jamming technique is applied to a proposed soft robotic spine design. The soft robotic spine is proposed based on the integration of particle jamming and ball joint. The combined mechanism effectively overcomes the unpredictable behavior of jamming due to particle rearrangement and deformation which severely affects its repeatability and stability. The experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13 times. The compliant spine mechanism can be coupled with an actuation method such as wires/tendons, or soft actuators for robotic applications. The research also finds that the particle jamming technology can bring unexpected effects into biomimetic robotic hand design. The proposed robotic finger design based on the integration of particle jamming and fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator provides an instructive model for robotic gripper applications. The prototype robotic hand demonstrates great performance of reliable grasping. Based on similar jamming interface, a bioinspired robotic palm is designed for the hand. The property of controllable stiffness of the palm allows a full contact of the palm with the object being grasped, thus providing a stable support for object grasping. The proposed palm design demonstrates a close emulation of human palm functions. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
50|$|Stoddard's {{original}} calliope {{was attached}} to a metal roller set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork music box.

A common example of this is, in overhead valve engines, replacing the production rocker arms with replacements incorporating roller bearings in the <b>roller</b> contacting the <b>valve</b> stem.|$|R
40|$|Grinding is {{the main}} {{manufacturing}} process used in finishing operations. Center-less grinding is widely used {{in the production of}} auto parts e. g. <b>roller</b> bearings, <b>valve</b> stem and stem of shock absorbers. Center-less grinding is used in large-scale production due to shorter time and higher flexibility. However, the set-up of the grinder is complex and slow, and depends on the operators’ ability. The choice of the best parameters in the process is important to define exactly the cutting strategy and to optimize the process. Current study analyzes the input parameters: feed rate and type of materials on the responses G-ratio, surface roughness, and roundness. Thus, stems of shock absorbers were used as work pieces on the shop floor. Cutting speed and grinding wheel type were constant. The input parameters comprised feed rate and type of materials (1025 and 1045). Responses were surface roughness, roundness error and G-ratio. Results demonstrated that the kinds of tested material was the parameter that most influenced G-ratio and surface roughness. Moreover, feed rate had little influence {{on the quality of the}} work pieces, mainly on roundness error...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Silicon nitride ceramic {{has been}} used in various {{engineering}} applications such as bearings, <b>rollers,</b> and exhaust <b>valves</b> for automobiles because of its corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength and low density. LAM (Laser assisted machining) has recently been considered as an alternative and effective process for machining ceramic materials. The laser heat sources in laser assisted milling processes are irregularly varied according to shapes of workpieces. Therefore, prediction and analysis of preheating temperature is difficult. In this study, the thermal analysis and experiment were performed to evaluate the surface temperature distribution of silicon nitride according to laser power. In addition, the preheating temperature was predicted by analyzing the results of the thermal analysis...|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the <b>roller</b> member, <b>valve</b> lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R
50|$|In service, {{some trouble}} was {{experienced}} with transmission shaft joints and with worn cams and <b>rollers.</b> If the <b>valves</b> were set {{with the engine}} cold, {{there appeared to be}} some distortion under working conditions due to the high temperature of superheated steam which caused deterioration of the valve events. Drivers also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to reverse since the cam rollers were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the cam boxes where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the cam boxes. This was overcome by serrating the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the cam boxes.|$|R
