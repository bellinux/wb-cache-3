40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the <b>roll</b> <b>gap,</b> i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit cross-sectional area by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit cross-sectional area variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i. e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece while the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> changed. To predict the amount of <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> adjustment that compensates wear, a model for <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> adjustment is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> adjustment, which reduces the increased exit cross-sectional area owing to wear up to a base exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit cross-sectional area calculated by the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> adjustment model is in good agreement with the exit cross-sectional area measured. It has been found from the pilot hot rolling test that variation in exit cross-sectional area is almost linearly proportional to <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> change while the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> decreases from a datum <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> to about half of the datum one...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{influence}} of roller mill gap and single kernel properties of wheat {{on the energy}} requirements of first–break grinding was studied. Multiple linear regression models for energy per unit mass (EM), new specific surface area (ANSS, in log scale), and specific energy (EA = EM /ANSS) were developed based on milling data from six wheat classes ground at five roll gaps with an experimental roller mill. The models, which were functions of <b>roll</b> <b>gap,</b> single kernel properties, and wheat class as a classification variable, explained most of the variability in the experimental data. <b>Roll</b> <b>gap</b> and single kernel hardness had the greatest influence on EM, ANSS, and EA. Milling ratio, a variable that combined single kernel size and <b>roll</b> <b>gap,</b> reduced some collinearities among single kernel properties and isolated the effect of single kernel mass from that of single kernel size. The effect of single kernel mass became significant in the models based on milling ratio. Good agreement between predicted and measured values was observed from 100 validation samples.

40|$|Extended {{breakage}} functions incorporating both single kernel {{size and}} moisture content were determined for First Break milling of hard and soft wheats under a sharp-to-sharp disposition. A moisture correction function was constructed by milling narrow size fractions of wheat tempered to different moisture contents, and subtracting the breakage function at a base moisture content of 16 % from that at other moisture contents. The effect of adding moisture was to change an initially inverted U-shaped distribution at low moisture contents to a linear distribution at 16 % moisture, {{then to a}} U-shaped distribution at higher moisture contents, reminiscent of the particle size distributions produced by dull-to-dull milling. The extended breakage functions were used to predict milling of unseparated feed samples at different <b>roll</b> <b>gaps</b> and moisture contents. In addition, mixtures of hard wheat at 14 % moisture and soft wheat at 20 % moisture, mixed in different proportions, were milled and the resulting particle size distributions compared with predictions.

40|$|Debranning {{of wheat}} affects flour quality, {{initially}} by altering the breakage of wheat kernels during first break. The double normalized Kumaraswamy breakage function {{was applied to}} model the effect of debranning on wheat breakage during first break milling, in which type 1 breakage describes a relatively narrow distribution of midsized particles, whereas type 2 breakage describes a wide size range of predominantly small particles extending to very large particles. Mallacca (hard) and Consort (soft) wheats were debranned and milled at three <b>roll</b> <b>gaps</b> under sharp-to-sharp and dull-to-dull dispositions. Type 1 breakage increased at longer debranning times, whereas type 2 breakage decreased, for both wheat varieties under both dispositions. Sharp-to-sharp milling tended to produce more type 1 breakage than dull-to-dull. A mechanism of wheat breakage is proposed to explain the coproduction of very large and small particles via type 2 breakage and, hence, the effect of debranning. The proposed mechanism is that small particles of endosperm arise from scraping of large flat particles of wheat bran under the differential action of the rolls, such that removal of the bran reduces {{the production of the}} large bran particles and thus reduces the opportunity for the scraping mechanism that produces the very small particles...|$|R

40|$|The Normalised Kumaraswamy Breakage Function (NKBF), {{developed}} previously {{to describe}} First Break milling of wheat kernels, was applied here {{to describe the}} breakage of the stocks produced by First Break that then pass to Second Break milling. The breakage equation for roller milling assumes independent breakage of particles as they pass through the mill; that assumption was tested for Second Break milling and found to be appropriate. A single NKBF was not adequate to describe the full particle size distribution (PSD) created by Second Break milling, as the PSD is bimodal, and the NKBF is unimodal. Instead, the PSD was divided into the fraction of particles larger than 2000 μm, and those smaller than 2000 μm, and separate NKBF functions were applied to each fraction. In this way, it was demonstrated that the size distribution of particles larger than 2000 μm produced after Second Break milling depended strongly on the input particle size, but was essentially independent of the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> used for Second Break. By contrast, the PSD of particles smaller than 2000 μm depended strongly on the <b>roll</b> <b>gap,</b> but was essentially independent of the input particle size. This finding reflects the nature of Second Break milling, that it involves scraping endosperm material off bran particles, such that the endosperm material (which is produced as small particles) depends strongly {{on the size of}} the gap through which the bran particle passes, but the bran particle itself remains essentially intact, irrespective of <b>roll</b> <b>gap.</b> This scraping of endosperm particles, although strongly dependent on the <b>roll</b> <b>gap,</b> is independent of the size of the bran particles, because the bran particles pass through the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> oriented along their longest dimensions. Second Break milling of the entire output from First Break, as practised in double high systems, could be described adequately by a single NKBF. Extending the breakage equation via the NKBF to Second Break facilitates the application of simulation and optimisation to flour milling for both food and non-food processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} wheat {{properties}} on breakage during First Break roller milling, {{as described by}} the Double Normalised Kumaraswamy Breakage Function (DNKBF), were investigated. A set of 45 wheats from nine varieties representing the range of commercial varieties grown in the UK, and grown over three harvest years at several nitrogen fertiliser levels, were milled at five <b>roll</b> <b>gaps</b> under Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull dispositions. The resulting particle size distributions were fitted with a DNKBF {{in order to understand}} the physical significance of the DNKBF parameters and to relate them to shape and hardness. The DNKBF parameters related strongly to hardness as measured using either the Single Kernel Characterisation System or Particle Size Index, allowing the particle size distribution over the range 0 – 4000 μm to be predicted solely from wheat hardness. A residual analysis showed that the remaining variation was correlated with kernel mass, and that more elongated kernels break to give slightly larger particles than more spherical kernels of equivalent hardness. Two types of breakage are identified, one of which principally produces many small endosperm particles along with large bran particles, while the other tends to produce mid-sized particles. The former dominates under Dull-to-Dull milling and for soft wheats, while the latter becomes more prominent under Sharp-to-Sharp milling and for harder wheat...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Magnesium alloy AZ 31 B was used to investigate the appropriate manufacturing conditions for use in twin-roll strip casting. Temperatures of the molten materials and roll speeds were varied to find the appropriate manufacturing conditions. The effects of manufacturing conditions on possible forming were clarified in terms of roll speeds and <b>roll</b> <b>gaps</b> between upper and lower rolls. Findings: In the hot-rolling process, a temperature exceeding 200 °C was chosen to keep cast products from cracking. An appropriate annealing temperature was effective for homogenizing the microstructure of the rolled cast sheets after the strip casting process. The grain size of the manufactured wrought magnesium alloys sheet was less than 10 micrometers. The obtained magnesium alloy sheet exhibited an equivalent limiting drawing ratio in a warm-drawing test. Research limitations/implications: AZ 31 were used to investigate the appropriate manufacturing conditions for use in twin-roll strip casting. Casting temperatures were varied from 630 °C to 670 °C to find the best casting conditions. Roll casting speeds were varied from 5 m/min to 30 m/min in order to examine which roll speed was appropriate for solidifying the molten magnesium.

A new {{analytical}} model for cold and hot bond rolling of clad sheet unbounded before rolling is derived {{to investigate the}} stress field of the clad sheet at the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> by using the direct formulation without the Runge Kutta numerical method.

50|$|The pack mill {{process begins}} with a tin bar, which is a drawn flat bar that was usually {{purchased}} from an ironworks or steel works. The tin bar could be wrought iron or mild steel. The cross-section of the bar needed to be accurate in size as this dictates the length and thickness of the final plates. The bar was cut to the correct length to make the desired size plate; for instance, if a 14 x 20 in plate is desired the tin bar is cut to a length and width that is divisible by 14 and 20. The bar is then rolled and doubled over, {{with the number of}} times being doubled over dependent on how large the tin bar is and what the final thickness is. Continuing the example, if the starting tin bar is 20 x 56 in then it must be at least finished on the fours, or doubled over twice, and if a thin gauge is required then it may be finished on the eights, or doubled over three times. The tin bar is then heated to a dull red heat and passed five or six times through the roughing rolls.

In the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> we can observe the following: changes of rolling pressure, changes of relative velocity, influences of oxides and lubrication, etc. When taking into account all conditions mentioned above the determination of the boundary conditions is not trivial and extensive measurements are necessary.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was on the {{layering}} of fine paper with a 3 -layer headbox and <b>roll</b> blade <b>gap</b> former. It consisted of methodological development and laboratory scale studies, as well as layering studies on the pilot paper machine scale. The potential of layered structures in papermaking and the phenomena affecting layer mixing were also studied. Filler distributions were characterized by two parameters – filler distribution shape and symmetry factors. The method developed made it possible to apply a statistical approach to experiments when studying the impact of typical wet end control parameters on the control of filler distributions and the contribution of filler distributions to paper quality parameters. A method by which the center layer fiber distribution may be characterized from the final paper is also presented. The method is based on the use of dyed fibers and a spectrofotometer. In addition, a laboratory device, a multilayer handsheet former for making layered structures, is presented. The process closely resembles a real continuous multilayer process by providing water phase interactions between layers during forming and two-sided dewatering characteristics. In a case study, retention chemical and filler layering with WFC base paper was performed by the multilayer handsheet former. Surface roughness decreased and brightness increased when the filler content in paper surfaces was increased. At constant filler content, paper strength increased as the filler concentration in the paper surfaces increased. The distinction between roll dewatering and blade dewatering in terms of layer mixing as well as differences in the mixing behavior of fibers and fillers in different dewatering phases was studied. Major fiber mixing takes place during the free jet and roll dewatering phase. In blade dewatering, fiber movements are related to formation improvements. The greatest mobility differences between fibers and fillers were found in the blade dewatering phase in roll and blade dewatering. Filler distributions were significantly affected during blade dewatering, with the mobility of the fibers remaining insignificant. The relationship between typical fine paper quality parameters and filler distributions was studied. Formation improvement and densification of the paper were achievable at the same running conditions. Low porosity was achieved by evenly distributed constituents (good formation) and a local rich filler concentration somewhere in the paper structure in the paper thickness direction. Oil absorption two-sidedness was minimized by symmetrical filler distributions. The combination of all these quality factors required the filler distribution to be symmetrical and as u- or turned u-shaped as possible. The use of additives layering as a part of paper quality control was also studied. Multilayering was found to be an effective tool for the control of filler distributions. On the other hand it was shown that, in order to get optimized impact of the multilayering on quality properties, the other process variables also need to be controlled. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Roll bonding is a joining-by-forming operation, {{in which}} two or more {{metallic}} strips or plates are bonded permanently through the pressure and plastic deformation in the <b>roll</b> <b>gap.</b> Although roll bonding has been successfully used in industrial production over many years, difficulties occur especially when materials of largely different yield strength are roll-bonded, e. g. when hard aluminum alloys are clad with soft commercially pure aluminum. Examples are AA 2024 sheets used in wing and fuselage structures of aircrafts, which are clad with AA 1050 to improve the corrosion resistance. Likewise, aluminum sheets for heat exchangers consist of a hard base material that is clad with a soft solderable aluminum alloy. In these cases, the strength difference may influence the bonding behavior since the softer face sheet has to transmit the deformation to the harder core material. To analyze and optimize such cases, a bonding model integrated into a numerical framework for the simulation of the roll bonding process is required. In this paper, a finite element model is presented, in which the development of bond strength is simulated using a cohesive contact formulation. The model is used to study the bonding behavior of laboratory-scale roll bonding trials of two aluminum alloys with a large difference in yield strength. It is found that shear stresses are generated {{towards the end of}} the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> that may exceed the shear bond strength created earlier in the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> such that no firm bond is obtained. The conditions under which bonding is successful are analyzed using a finite element simulation study with varying yield stress differences and pass reductions and summarized in a map...|$|E

However, since the melt {{flow in the}} <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> is asymmetric due to the gravity, microstructure distributions become asymmetric resulting in uneven mechanical properties. In the present investigation, the nozzle for ejecting the melt of Al- 1100 was designed and improved for the melt flow to be symmetric by finite element analysis...|$|E

Through analytic geometry method, an equation is established among the tail <b>roll</b> <b>gap,</b> roll distance and the plug protrusion distance. 3 D drawing software CATIA-V 5 is applied to build 3 d models of steel tube and rolling tools. The rolling process is simulated by MSC. Marc FEA (finite element analysis) software. Marc’s second development function and FORTRAN software’s extracting finite element node coordinates function are applied to calculate the wall thickness uniformity. A novel method to calculate the wall thickness uniformity after finite element analysis is proposed. The wall thickness uniformity of steel tube after rolling is well simulated and compared by MSC. Marc FEA software, which can help the technologist to predict and choose the best rolling parameter. For gas cylinder rolling, the tail <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> should be set to 17 mm. The roller distance and the plug protrusion distance should be set as 342 mm and 78 mm separately...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to adjust the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> for the dimension accuracy of bar in hot bar rolling process considering roll wear. In this study hot bar rolling processes for round and oval passes have been investigated. In order to predict the roll wear, the wear model is reformulated as an incremental form and then wear depth of roll is calculated at each deformation step on contact area using the results of finite element analysis, such as relative sliding velocity and normal pressure at contact area. Archard’s wear model was applied to predict the roll wear. To know the effects of thermal softening of DCI (Ductile Cast Iron) roll material according to operating conditions, high temperature micro hardness test is executed and a new wear model has been proposed by considering the thermal softening of DCI roll expressed in terms of the main tempering curve. The new technique developed in this study for adjusting <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> can give more systematically and economically feasible means to improve the dimension accuracy of bar with full usefulness and generality...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{method of}} {{reflected}} caustics {{was employed to}} investigate the variation of the coefficient of friction in the <b>roll</b> <b>gap</b> during strip rolling. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on an experimental rolling mill, using lead at room temperature, to obtain quantitative information about pressure distribution and friction, relevant to hot rolling, i. e. when frictional effects are pronounced. The rolls were made of Plexiglas. The normal and tangential pressure distribution and thence the coefficient of friction along the arc of contact at {{the outer edge of the}} strip were calculated from the caustic curves formed due to elastic deformation of the rolls, although the rolled strip was deformed plastically. An almost linear decrease of the friction coefficient from a maximum value, at the entry plane to the <b>roll</b> <b>gap.</b> to zero at the neutral plane and then a parabolic, tending to linear, increase of it, towards the exit plane, were predicted, in contradiction to what is up-to-now accepted in the praxis, that the friction coefficient remains constant during hot rolling. © 1983...|$|E
