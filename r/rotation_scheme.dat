500|$|On April 5, 1967, {{the same}} day the Apollo1 {{investigation}} released its report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, [...] "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room." [...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew <b>rotation</b> <b>scheme,</b> Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E

40|$|In stockless organic farming, crop {{rotation}} {{is one of}} the most important factors that determine the success of crop cultivation. Six crop <b>rotation</b> <b>schemes</b> in a long-term experiment of the Bavarian State Research Center of Agriculture at Viehhausen allow the estimation of the effect of {{crop rotation}}s on grain yield and baking quality of winter wheat. The three and five years crop rotations differed in the utilization of grass clover swards (cutting or mulching), in the following crops (potatoes or barley), in the portion of grass clover swards and in the type of legume (grass clover or grain legume). The lowest grain yield as well as the most inferior baking quality was shown after grain legume. The highest yield was obtained after the two-year grass-clover ley and potato. The significant best baking quality showed wheat in a stockless crop rotation direct after mulched grass-clover ley. Different availability and mineralization rates of nitrogen seem to be the major reasons behind the differences observed among the crop <b>rotation</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper tests three {{possible}} explanations for why firms adopt job rotation: employee learning (rotation makes employees more versatile), employer learning (through rotation, employers learn more about individual workers' strengths), and employee motivation (rotation mitigates boredom). Whereas previous studies have examined either establishment characteristics or a single firm's personnel records, this study merges information from a detailed survey of Danish private sector firms with linked employer-employee panel data, allowing firm characteristics, work force characteristics, and firms' human resource management practices to be included as explanatory variables. The results reject the employee motivation hypothesis, but support the employee learning and, especially, the employer learning hypotheses. Firms allocating more resources to training {{were more likely to}} rotate workers; <b>rotation</b> <b>schemes</b> were more common in less hierarchical firms and in firms with shorter average employee tenure; and both firm growth rates and firms' use of nation-wide recruitment were positively associated with <b>rotation</b> <b>schemes.</b> Job rotation;...|$|R

The principal’s only incentive device is a reallocation of budgets and tasks across agents depending {{on the extent of}} productivity improvements revealed by each agent. We first show that as long as agents do not collude, the principal can use <b>rotation</b> and tournament <b>schemes</b> to eliminate all slack in the organization. Second, to break collusion between agents, the principal must use discriminatory tournament schemes.

40|$|Efficiently {{maintaining}} molecular conformations {{is important}} for molecular modeling and protein engineering. This paper reviews the widely used simple <b>rotations</b> <b>scheme,</b> simple local frames method, and introduces a new atom group local frames method for maintaining the molecular conformation changes due to the changes of torsional angles. The simple <b>rotations</b> <b>scheme</b> applies a sequence of rotations to update all atom positions. The order of the updates is important and some bookkeeping of the atom positions is necessary. Numeric errors can accumulate as rotations around the bonds are repeated. The simple local frames method builds local frames at the bonds, and relational matrices {{between parents and children}} frames are constructed. The atom positions are computed by chaining series of such matrices. No bookkeeping is necessary and numeric errors do not accumulate upon rotations. Multiple local frames are needed at a bond if it has more than one child. This paper introduces a new atom group local frames method to efficiently maintain molecular conformations. A single local frame is attached to each atom group. Bookkeeping is not necessary and numeric errors do not accumulate upon rotations. This method also provides lazy evaluations for atom positions. Thus, the conformational maintenance cost is greatly reduced, especially when many conformations are generated and updated such as in a minimization process...|$|R
50|$|A backup <b>rotation</b> <b>scheme</b> is {{a system}} of backing up data to {{computer}} media (such as tapes) that minimizes, by re-use, the number of media used. The scheme determines how and when each piece of removable storage is used for a backup job {{and how long it}} is retained once it has backup data stored on it. Different techniques have evolved over time to balance data retention and restoration needs with the cost of extra data storage media. Such a scheme can be quite complicated if it takes incremental backups, multiple retention periods, and off-site storage into consideration.|$|E

Conversely, any embedding of a connected multigraph G on an oriented closed surface defines a unique rotation system having G as its underlying multigraph. This fundamental equivalence between rotation systems and 2-cell-embeddings was first settled in a dual form by Heffter and extensively used by Ringel during the 1950s. Independently, Edmonds gave the primal {{form of the}} theorem and {{the details of his}} study have been popularized by Youngs.

40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) {{inertial}} {{measurement unit}} (IMU) outputs are corrupted by significant sensor errors. The navigation errors of a MEMS-based inertial navigation system will therefore accumulate very quickly over time. This requires aiding from other sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, it will still remain a significant challenge {{in the presence of}} GNSS outages, which are typically in urban canopies. This paper proposed a rotary inertial navigation system (INS) to mitigate navigation errors caused by MEMS inertial sensor errors when external aiding information is not available. A rotary INS is an inertial navigator in which the IMU is installed on a rotation platform. Application of proper <b>rotation</b> <b>schemes</b> can effectively cancel and reduce sensor errors. A rotary INS has the potential to significantly increase the time period that INS can bridge GNSS outages and make MEMS IMU possible to maintain longer autonomous navigation performance when there is no external aiding. In this research, several IMU <b>rotation</b> <b>schemes</b> (<b>rotation</b> about X-, Y- and Z-axes) are analyzed to mitigate the navigation errors caused by MEMS IMU sensor errors. As the IMU rotation induces additional sensor errors, a calibration process is proposed to remove the induced errors. Tests are further conducted with two MEMS IMUs installed on a tri-axial rotation table to verify the error mitigation by IMU rotations...|$|R
