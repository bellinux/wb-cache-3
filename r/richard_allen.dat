25|$|The first {{blacks in}} Philadelphia were slaves; with at most 1,500 people living as {{slaves in the}} city during the period slavery was legal. Slaves in Philadelphia usually {{lived in the same}} house of their owners and worked as {{servants}} or in their owners' shops. An abolition law in 1780 did not free any existing slaves, but banned the slave trade in Pennsylvania and freed the children of slaves born after the law was passed once they reached a certain age. By the time the law was passed, about 400 slaves and 800 free blacks lived in Philadelphia. Many newly freed slaves and escaped slaves from the South moved to the city, and by 1820 the city's African American population was nearly eleven percent. During this time one former slave, <b>Richard</b> <b>Allen,</b> founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. As the African American population grew, so did white hostility towards them. African Americans were attacked and killed in the street and in their houses during a race riot in 1834, and four years later a state law was passed that prevented African Americans from voting. Abolitionists were also targets; they were prevented from spreading their message, and one of their meeting houses was burned.|$|E
25|$|In 1787 <b>Richard</b> <b>Allen</b> and Absalom Jones black {{ministers of}} Pennsylvania and formed the Free African Society of Pennsylvania. The {{goal of this}} {{organization}} {{was to create a}} church that was free of restrictions of only one form of religion, and {{to pave the way for}} the creation of a house of worship exclusive to their community (which in 1793 they were successful in doing, creating the St. Thomas African Episcopal Church). The community included many members who were notably abolitionist men and former slaves. Allen following his own beliefs that worship should be out loud and outspoken left the organization two years later. With the re an opportunity to become the pastor to the church but rejected the offer leaving it to Jones. The society itself was a memorable charitable organization that allowed its members to socialize and network with other business partners, in attempt to better their community. Its activity and open doors served as a motivational growth for the city as many other black mutual aid societies in the city began to pop up. Additionally the society is well known for their aid during the yellow fever epidemic in 1793 known to have taken the life of many of the city.|$|E
