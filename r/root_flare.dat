50|$|Better {{results can}} be {{obtained}} using subjectively assigned factors to incorporate the taper of the trunk and characterize the basal flare. Trees with major <b>root</b> <b>flare</b> or pronounced taper skew the formula. Extreme <b>root</b> <b>flare</b> produces noticeable overestimates of volume. Conversely, a rapid trunk taper leads to an estimated volume that is too low. This can be addressed if we create multipliers for the averaged volume: one for flare and one for taper. If, by visual inspection, we see a large flare, we could use a flare multiplier of 0.90, otherwise 1.00. If we saw a very slow taper, we could use a taper multiplier of 1.11.By using separate factors for flare and taper and multiplying them {{together to create a}} composite factor.|$|E
5000|$|As an {{extension}} of this approach, the neiloid form is one whose sides are concave, so its volume is {{less than that of}} a cone. The neiloid form often applies near the base of tree trunks exhibiting <b>root</b> <b>flare,</b> and just below limb bulges. The formula for the volume of a frustum of a neiloid:V = (h/4)+ (Ab2Au)1/3, where Ab is the area of the base and Au is the area of the top of the frustum. This volume may also be expressed in terms of radii: ...|$|E
5000|$|... where C1 = {{circumference}} at <b>root</b> <b>flare,</b> C2= circumference at 4.5 feet, H = full tree height, F1 = flare factor, F2= taper factor, and V = volume. Any {{objection to}} equation rests primarily with the subjective nature of F1and F2. The value 75.4 = 24 π, where 24π substitutes for factor of 12π in {{the formula for}} a volume of frustum of a cone encompassing a full tree using one base circumference, converting it to a volume formula that uses a basal circumference that is the average of circumferences C1 and C2. By using separate factors for flare and taper and multiplying them together, we create a composite factor. It is suggested that these flare and taper could be extended {{in some cases to}} values in the range of 0.80 and 1.25 to allow extreme forms to be characterized by the formula. Similarly a model of overall trunk volume could potentially be predicted by using height, girth above basal flare, and the percent cylinder occupation for that species and age class. However at this time there is insufficient data available to test this concept.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the fracture strength and mode of endodontically treated teeth with structurally weakened roots reconstructed with woven polyethylene fiber posts and biological posts. Methods: After removing the crowns, 60 endodontically treated maxillary canines were distributed into 4 groups: 1) conventional root canal preparation and reconstruction with polyethylene fiber posts; 2) conventional root canal preparation and reconstruction with biological posts; 3) moderately <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals and reconstruction with biological posts; 4) widely <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals and reconstruction with biological posts. The posts were cemented with resin cement Enforce (Dentsply Ind. e Com., Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil) and the core was constructed with Ti-Core (EssentialDental Systems, S. Hackensack, NJ, USA) resin composite. The specimens were tested under compression in a universal testing machine. Results: The following fracture strength values were obtained: Group 1 – 45. 46 kgf; Group 2 – 53. 30 kgf; Group 3 – 58. 67 kgf; Group 4 – 47. 91 kgf, with {{statistically significant differences}} between Groups 1 and 3 (p< 0. 05). The following fracture modes were observed: Group 1 – predominance of fracture of the coronal portion of the post; Groups 2 and 3 – various fracture patterns; Group 4 – all roots fractured. Conclusion: Both posts were shown to be promising (adequate fracture strength and favorable pattern of fracture). Biological posts appear to be capable of reinforcing the root to some extent; however, fracture occured in all <b>roots</b> with widely <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals...|$|R

Fruiting bodies found {{growing on}} trunks or <b>root</b> <b>flares</b> of living or dead {{hardwood}} trees. Very common taxon, being found in practically every state East of the Rocky Mountains within the United States. Mature fruiting bodies are laccate and reddish-brown, {{often with a}} wrinkled margin if dry. Fruiting bodies are shelf-like if on stumps or overlapping clusters of fan-shaped (flabelliform) fruiting bodies if growing from underground roots, and range in size of 3-20 cm in diameter. Hymenium white, bruising brown, and poroid with irregular pores that can range in shape from circular to angular. The context tissue is cream colored and can be thin to thick and on average the same length as the tubes. Black resinous deposits are never found embedded in the context tissue, but concentric zones are often found. Spores appear “smooth”, or nearly so, due to the fine (thin) echinulations from the endosporium, which can differentiate them from other common Eastern North American species such as Ganoderma curtisii (Berk.)

5000|$|One goal {{of looking}} at overall tree shape {{is to find a}} method of {{determining}} overall tree volume using a minimum of measurements and a generalized volume formula. The simplest method to achieve this is to model the entire trunk with one application of a solid. Application of one form to the whole tree has been discussed {{as a way to get}} a quick volume approximation. But, the method is unlikely to produce an accurate result. [...] Given the general form changes from the base to top of the tree and the pattern of change in form factor over time, a predictive model was developed and applied to a variety of trees in New England where volume estimates were made based upon measurements tree height, girth at breast height, girth at root flair, and assigned values for form factor (taper), and a flare factor. For young to mature Eastern White Pines, applying the cross-sectional area at trunk flare with full tree height in the cone formula almost always overstates the fully modeled volume. Similarly, using the cross-sectional area at breast height with full tree height in the cone formula usually understates the volume. These values provide an upper and lower bound for actual volume for younger trees. Old-growth pines can develop a columnar form, and if they have only a modest <b>root</b> <b>flare,</b> the actual trunk volume can exceed the volume as estimated by the upper bound formula. In an analysis of 44 trees, including 42 Eastern White Pines, one Eastern Hemlock, and a single Tuliptree, the average of the upper and lower-bound volumes as compared to the modeled volume shows that the average divided by the modeled volumes is 0.98 with a standard deviation of 0.10. The volumes of 34 trees fall within the hypothetical upper and lower-bound calculations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{seeks to}} answer the question, what factors of the urban social–ecological system predict survival and growth of trees in nonprofit and neighborhood tree-planting projects? The Ostrom social–ecological system framework and Clark and colleagues’ model of urban forest sustainability inform our selection of variables in four categories in the social–ecological system; these categories are the trees, the biophysical environment, the community, and management institutions. We use tree inventory methods {{to collect data on}} the survival, growth, and the social–ecological growing environment of recently-planted street trees in Indianapolis, IN to answer our research question. We use a probit model to predict tree survival, and a linear regression model to predict tree growth rate. The following variables are positively related to tree success (survival and/or growth) : ball-and-burlap or container packaging, a visible <b>root</b> <b>flare,</b> good overall condition rating, the size of the tree-planting project, planting area width, median household income, percent of renter occupied homes, resident tenure, prior tree planting experience, correct mulching, and a collective watering strategy. The following variables are negatively related to tree success: caliper at planting, crown dieback, and lower trunk damage. Additional variables measured have less clear connections to tree success and should be examined further. Given that models including variables from all four categories of the social–ecological system generally outperform models that exclude some components, we recommend that future research on urban tree survival and growth should consider the holistic social–ecological systems context of the urban ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|Background: Reinforcement of root canals obturated with Resilon was {{reported}} by several investigators, but no studies reported the reinforcement of overtly <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals obturated with Resilon material. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the fracture resistance of overtly <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals filled with Resilon as compared to similar root canals filled with gutta-percha (GP). Materials and Methods: Sixty single-rooted premolars were divided randomly into six groups. Group 1 served as control group. The control group was sub-divided into two groups, a negative group and a positive group. The negative group consisted of root canals that were only cleaned from residual pulpal tissues, however, the positive group had prepared and overtly <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals without obturation. Groups 2 and 4 were shaped using 0. 04 taper rotary files, while groups 3 and 5 were shaped using 0. 06 taper rotary files. Before obturation, the last four groups were further flared coronally with a reverse cone diamond bur. Groups 2 and 3 were obturated with GP and a resin-based sealer, while groups 4 and 5 were obturated with Resilon and Epiphany self-etching primer and Epiphany sealer. Roots were then fixed into a universal testing machine and vertically loaded until fracture. SPSS software (Release 9. 0 for Windows, SPSS, Chicago, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis. Results: Fracture resistance measurements showed that there were differences in resistance to fracture among the experimental groups (ANOVA, P < 0. 0001). Mean values of the loading force applied to the negative control group were the highest at 1. 81 KN, whereas the mean values for the Resilon groups (Groups 4 and 5) at 1. 13 KN and 1. 54 KN were found to be higher than the GP groups (Groups 2 and 3) at 0. 45 KN and 0. 88 KN, respectively. Tukey′s post hoc test showed that there was no statistical difference between the mean values of the negative control group and Group 5 (P = 0. 69).

40|$|European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is an {{important}} forest and landscape tree. These trees are susceptible to attack by various Phytophthora species. A survey of these trees in the northeastern United States shows approximately 70 % of trees have symptoms {{of this type of}} infection, when patches of necrotic bark on the <b>root</b> <b>flares</b> of trunk ooze dark or rusty colored liquid. Forty percent of symptomatic bark tissue yielded a Phytophthora isolate. The most frequent species associated with this disease were P. citricola and P. cactorum. Multiple gene phylogenetic analysis indicated that isolates classified as P. citricola can be divided into two distinct clades, P. citricola A and B. Phytophthora citricola A is most frequently found associated with bleeding canker symptoms, approximately 60 % of the time, followed by P. cactorum approximately 30 % of the time. Phytophthora citricola B, P. gonapodyides and P. cambivora were found rarely. All of these pathogens {{can be found in the}} soil surrounding both asymptomatic and symptomatic beech, although the frequency varies. All five pathogens cause necrotic symptoms when inoculated into European beech sapling stems. In addition, P. citricola A and B and P. cactorum can cause disease on leaf and stem tissue of Betula lenta, Syringa vulgaris and Ulmus americana, and they are able to cause disease on leaf tissue of Acer saccharum, Fraxinus americana, Viburnum trilobum and V. opulus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fracture strength and failure mode of <b>flared</b> bovine <b>roots</b> restored with different intraradicular posts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty bovine incisors with similar dimensions were selected and their <b>roots</b> were <b>flared</b> until 1. 0 mm of dentin wall remained. Next, the roots were allocated into five groups (n= 10) : GI- cast metal post-and-core; GII- fiber posts plus accessory fiber posts; GIII- direct anatomic post; GIV- indirect anatomic post and GV- control (specimens without intraradicular post). A polyether impression material was used to simulate the periodontal ligament. After periodontal ligament simulation, the specimens were subjected to a compressive load at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min in a servo-hydraulic testing machine (MTS 810) applied at 135 º to the long axis of the tooth until failure. The data (N) were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: GI and GIV presented higher fracture strength (p 0. 05) from GI, GII and GIV. Control specimens (GV) produced the lowest fracture strength mean values (p< 0. 05). Despite obtaining the highest mean value, GI presented 100 % of unfavorable failures.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{evaluated}} the bond strength of translucent fiber posts to experimentally weakened radicular dentin restored with composite resin and polymerized with different light-exposure time. Methods: Roots of 60 maxillary incisors were used. Twenty-four hours after obturation, the filling materials of root canals were removed {{to a depth}} of 12 mm, and 4 groups were randomly formed. In 3 groups, <b>root</b> dentin was <b>flared</b> to produce a space between fiber post and canal walls. In the control group, the roots were not experimentally weakened. The <b>flared</b> <b>roots</b> were bulk restored with composite resin, which was light-activated through the translucent post for 40, 80, or 120 seconds. Posts were cemented, and after 24 hours, all roots were sectioned transversely in the coronal, middle, and apical regions, producing 1 -mm-thick slices. Push-out test was performed, and failure modes were observed. Results The quantitative analysis showed significant statistical difference only among groups (P <. 001). Comparing the weakened/restored groups, composite light-exposure time did not influence the results. Overall, adhesive failures occurred more frequently than other types of failures. Cohesive failures occurred only in the weakened/restored roots. Conclusions Intracanal root restoration with composite resin and translucent fiber posts provided similar or higher bond strength to dentin than the control group, regardless of the light-exposure time used for polymerization.

40|$|From 2014 October 19 to 27, six X-class flares {{occurred}} in super active region (AR) 12192. They were all confined flares {{and were not}} followed by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To examine the structures of the four flares close to the solar disk center from October 22 to 26, we employ firstly composite triple-time images in each flare process to display the stratified structure of these flare loops. The loop structures of each flare in both lower (171 Å) and higher (131 Å) temperature channels are complex, e. g., the <b>flare</b> loops <b>rooting</b> at <b>flare</b> ribbons are sheared or twisted (enwound) together, and the complex structures have not been destroyed during the flares. For the first flare, although the flare loop system appears as a spindle shape, we can estimate their structure from observations, with lengths ranging from 130 to 300 Mm, heights from 65 to 150 Mm, widths at the middle part of the spindle from 40 to 100 Mm, and shear angles from 16 ^∘ to 90 ^∘. Moreover, the flare ribbons display irregular movements, such as the left ribbon fragments of the flare on 22 swept a small region repeatedly, and the both ribbons of the flare on 26 moved along the same direction, instead of separating from each other. These irregular movements also imply that the corresponding flare loops are complex, e. g. several sets of flare loops are twisted together.

The samples were distributed into 5 groups (n= 10) : Positive control (PoC) - no <b>root</b> canal <b>flaring</b> or filling; Negative control (NeC) - teeth were sectioned and their root canals were flared; Direct anatomical glass fiber post (RaP) - # 2 Reforpost main glass fiber post relined with composite resin; Double tapered conical glass fiber posts (ExP) - # 3 Exacto glass fiber post; and # 2 Reforpost main glass fiber + Reforpin accessory glass fiber posts (RrP). In RaP, ExP and RrP, 4. 0 -mm apical plugs were done with MTA Angelus.

Das 60 raízes de incisivos bovinos, quarenta foram fragilizadas com ponta diamantada # 4137, e todas foram tratadas endodonticamente. Uma semana após o tratamento endodôntico, o conduto foi preparado para a cimentação dos pinos D. T. Light Post tamanho 3, de acordo com os grupos: G 1 - cimentação convencional com Scotchbond Multi-Uso Plus (SBMP) /RelyX ARC (ARC); G 3 - pino cimentado na raiz fragilizada com SBMP/ARC; G 5 - pino reembasado cimentado na raiz fragilizada com SBMP/ARC. Nos grupos 2, 4 e 6 os pinos foram cimentados da mesma maneira, porém com o sistema adesivo All Bond 3 e o cimento resinoso C&B Cement. Após 24 h, as raízes foram seccionadas transversalmente e foram obtidas 2 fatias para cada região do conduto (cervical, média e apical). Uma foi usada para avaliação da microdureza e outra para o teste push-out, a 0, 5 mm/min., realizada em máquina de ensaios Instron. Os dados foram analisados com o teste ANOVA (3 -way) e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey (5 %).

After 24 hours, the roots were transversely sectioned and 2 slices per region of post space (cervical, middle and apical) were obtained. One was used to evaluate the microhardness and the other for the pushout test, at 0. 5 mm/min. performed at Instron testing machine. Data were analyzed with ANOVA (3 -way) and means compared by Tukey test (5 %). For the microhardness test, no significant differences were found among regions for the two groups in the three studied conditions. The hardness of the groups luted with C&B Cement was higher than the groups with RelyX ARC in the three conditions studied. For the groups luted with RelyX ARC, the bond strength in the cervical region was upper than middle and apical regions. For groups luted with C&B Cement the bond strength was higher in the cervical region compared to the apical. The groups luted with C&B Cement had greater bond strength than those cemented with RelyX ARC. In the RelyX ARC luted groups, the relined post group had higher bond strength than conventional and <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> groups. The relined group in C&B Cement gained greater bond strength than the conventional group. Failure mode was predominantly adhesive at resin cement and dentin interface.

Teeth were decoronated and the <b>root</b> canals coronally <b>flared.</b> Actual canal lengths were then determined by inserting a # 10 k-file until the tip was visualized (12. 8 X magnification) just within the apical foramina and randomly tested with each electronic apex locator (EAL) to determine the electronic canal length. The Actual length was subtracted from the electronically determined distance. The measurements exceeding the Actual length were recorded as positive (long) and the measurements (short) of the AL were recorded as negative. Results: The Mean differences between electronic and actual lengths - 0. 2 mm and 0. 43 mm for Elements apex locator and Propex II respectively.

The question is addressed whether such heating events can provide the observed average level of the coronal emission measure and thus of the observed flux of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray emission without contradicting the observed average power spectrum of the emission measure, the typical emission measure variations observed for individual pixels and the observed flare energy distribution.

40|$|One of the {{clinically}} relevant problems dentists {{face when}} restoring endodontically treated teeth is the mismatch between fiber post and post space diameters, {{which results in}} an excessively thick resin cement layer. Fiber post relining appears as a solution for this problem. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of fiber post relining with composite resin on push-out bond strength. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty bovine incisors were selected to assess post retention. The crowns were removed below the cementoenamel junction and the root canals were treated endodontically and flared with diamond burs. The roots were allocated into two groups (n= 10) : G 1 : fiber posts without relining and G 2 : fiber posts relined with composite resin. The posts were cemented with a dual-cured resin cement and the specimens were sectioned transversally. Three 1. 5 -mm thick slabs were obtained per root and identified as cervical, medium and apical thirds. The push-out test was performed at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min until post dislodgement occurred. The failure mode of fractured specimens was analyzed under scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed by split-plot ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's test at a pre-set alpha of 0. 05. RESULTS: Relined fiber posts presented higher retention values than non-relined post in all thirds. No statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found among thirds for relined posts. All failures occurred at the interface between resin cement and root dentin. CONCLUSIONS: Relining with composite resin seems to be an effective method to improve the retention of fiber posts to <b>flared</b> <b>root</b> canals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Glass and {{quartz fiber}} posts {{are used in}} {{restoration}} of structurally compromised roots. Accessory fiber posts are recently introduced to enhance the fiber post adaptation. This study evaluated the effectiveness of glass versus quartz accessory fiber posts. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 mandibular premolar roots with similar dimension (radius of 3. 5 ± 0. 2 mm and length of 13 ± 0. 5 mm) were selected and their <b>root</b> canals were <b>flared</b> until 1. 5 mm of dentin wall remained. They {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups (n = 10) and restored as follows: Exacto glass fiber post (EX), Exacto glass fiber post + 2 Reforpin accessories (EXR), D. T. Light quartz fiber post (DT), and D. T. Light quartz fiber post + 2 Fibercone accessories (DTF). All posts were cemented with Duo-Link resin cement and the cores were built with the particulate filler composite. Following 1 -week water storage, specimens were subjected to fracture loads in a universal testing machine. The maximum loads and failure modes were recorded and analyzed with the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher′s exact tests (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean fracture resistance values (N) were 402. 8 (EX), 378. 4 (EXR), 400. 1 (DT), and 348. 5 (DTF). Two-way ANOVA test showed neither reinforcing method (P = 0. 094), nor post composition (P = 0. 462) had statistically significant differences on fracture resistance of the structurally compromised premolar teeth. Fisher′s exact test also demonstrated no statistically significant difference regarding two variables (P = 0. 695). Core fracture was the most common failure mode (62. 5 %). Conclusion: Glass and quartz fiber posts with or without accessories restored the weakened premolar roots equally...|$|R
40|$|A restauracao dos dentes tratados endodonticamente muitas vezes e uma tarefa complexa em razao da grande perda de estrutura coronaria. Quando a destruicao atinge a raiz, os canais muito amplos dificultam a colocacao de pinos intra-radiculares necessaria para a reabilitacao protetica do dente. A reconstrucao {{cervical}} por meio de materiais adesivos tem sido sugerida, devido as propriedades mecanicas favoraveis e a adesao as paredes dentinarias. Este trabalho teve por objetivo aplicar o metodo dos elementos finitos para: a) comparar a distribuicao de tensoes em dentes tratados endodonticamente com raizes reconstruidas com resina composta ou ionomero de vidro cermet entre si, e em relacao a dentes tratados endodonticamente com raizes estruturalmente integras, sob carga estatica; b) verificar os provaveis tipos de falha da reconstrucao (fratura radicular, deslocamento do pino) de acordo com a resistencia da dentina e dos materiais utilizados, e sua provavel localizacao; c) de posse da magnitude e da distribuicao das tensoes, verificar o comportamento desses dentes sob carregamento ciclico, com base na resistencia a fadiga dos materiais estudados; e d) comparar os resultados obtidos com os disponiveis na literatura. O programa Ansys¥ 12. 0 (Canonsburg, PA, EUA) foi utilizado para modelagem e processamento. Foram confeccionados 3 modelos geometricos tridimensionais, representando um incisivo central superior com raiz integra, restaurado com pino/nucleo/coroa total (Modelo 1), ou com o canal ampliado e paredes radiculares reconstruidas com resina composta (Modelo 2) e ionomero de vidro cermet (Modelo 3). Uma carga de 100 N foi aplicada na regiao palatina, a 130 o com o longo eixo do dente. As tensoes principais (S 1 e S 3) foram analisadas no dente, na raiz isolada, no pino, no cimento e na area da reconstrucao radicular. Sob carga estatica, os resultados indicaram que a falha na dentina radicular e pouco provavel. Entretanto, existe a possibilidade de falha nas interfaces adesivas. No Modelo 2, a falha mais provavel ocorreria na uniao cimento/dentina, enquanto que no Modelo 3, a falha ocorreria na uniao ionomero/dentina. O comportamento do Modelo 2 ficou mais proximo do Modelo 1 do que Modelo 3. Nos tres modelos, os dentes trabalham proximos a resistencia a fadiga da dentina. Os resultados apontaram um prognostico desfavoravel para as reconstrucoes adesivas de raizes fragilizadas, devendo ser indicadas com cautela, levando-se em consideracao as caracteristicas individuais dos pacientes. The {{restoration of}} endodontically treated teeth {{is often a}} complex task, because of the great loss of coronal structure. When the destruction reaches the <b>root,</b> the <b>flared</b> canal makes the insertion of an endodontic post very difficult, during the prosthetic rehabilitation of the tooth. The reconstruction of the cervical root walls with adhesive restorative materials has been suggested, due to their favorable mechanical properties and dentin bonding ability. This study aimed to apply the finite element method to: (a) compare the stress distribution in endodontically treated teeth with reconstructed roots to those with healthy roots, under static loads; (b) investigate the location and probable modes of failure (root fracture, post dislodgement) of the reconstructed roots, according {{to the strength of}} the dentin and the materials used; (c) verify the behavior of these teeth under cyclic loads, based on the stress magnitudes and distributions, and also, based on the fatigue strength of the simulated materials; (d) compare the results to the data available in the literature. The software Ansys¥ 12. 0 (Canonsburg, PA, EUA) was used for modeling and processing. Three geometric 3 D models were created, representing a maxillary central incisor with a healthy root, post/core and crown restored (Model 1), or with weakened roots reconstructed with composite resin (Modelo 2) or cermet glass ionomer cement (Model 3) prior to the post/core/crown restoration. A 100 N load was applied on the palatal surface at 130 o to the long axis of the tooth. The principal stresses (S 1 and S 3) were used for the stress analysis of the tooth, isolated root, post, cement and root reconstruction area. Under static loads, the results indicated that failure is unlikely to occur in the root dentin. However, there is a possibility of failure of the adhesive interfaces. In Model 2, the most probable failure would appear along the cement/dentin bonding interface, while in Model 3, this would happen along the dentin/ionomer interface. When compared to Model 3, the behavior of Model 2 is more similar to that of Model 1. Based on the fatigue strength of the materials that were simulated, the results demonstrate that, for the 3 models, the teeth work very close to the fatigue limit of the dentin. The results indicate an unfavorable prognosis for the adhesively reconstructed thin-walled roots. Therefore this treatment modality should be carefully indicated, taking into account the individual features of the patient...|$|R
40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar, in vitro, a influência de diferentes protocolos de tratamento da dentina intrarradicular de raízes fragilizadas sobre a resistência de união (RU) de pinos fibrorreforçados fixados com diferentes cimentos resinosos. Quarenta e dois caninos superiores humanos tiveram suas raízes padronizadas em 17 mm após eliminação das porções coronárias. O preparo biomecânico foi realizado por meio do sistema Reciproc, com instrumento R 50. 05 e NaOCl 2, 5 %. As raízes foram fragilizadas por meio das brocas # 4137 e # 720 G na profundidade de 12 mm e obturadas pela técnica da condensação lateral com cimento AH Plus acrescido de Rhodamina B 0, 1 %. Decorrido 3 vezes o tempo de endurecimento a obturação foi removida e os pinos de fibra de vidro reembasados com resina composta. As raízes foram distribuídas em 3 grupos (n= 14) {{conforme}} o tratamento da superfície dentinária: NaOCl 2, 5 %; NaOCl 2, 5 % + EDTA 17 % e; NaOCl 2, 5 % + EDTA 17 % + ultrassom. Em metade dos espécimes de cada grupo a cimentação do pino foi realizada com RelyX U 200 e na outra, com Panavia F. Ambos cimentos foram acrescidos de fluoreceína 0, 1 %. As raízes foram seccionadas transversalmente obtendo-se dois slices de cada terço, um destinado ao teste de push-out e outro, à análise por meio do Confocal e mensuração da microdureza Knoop. Os dados foram submetidos ao teste ANOVA com parcela sub-dividida seguido do teste de Tukey (α= 0, 05). Os maiores valores de RU foram observados com o NaOCl + EDTA e NaOCl + EDTA + ultrassom (p> 0, 01) em relação ao NaOCl isolado (p 0, 01). Os protocolos não influenciaram a RU do cimento RelyX U 200. Em geral a maior incidência de falha foi do tipo adesiva (38, 83 %), seguido da mista (34, 72 %) e coesiva (26, 45 %). O tratamento da dentina com NaOCl + EDTA + ultrassom promoveu a maior redução da microdureza. Concluiu-se que o cimento resinoso Panavia F apresentou os maiores valores de RU nos três terços radiculares e que os protocolos não influenciaram a RU dos espécimes cimentados com RelyX U 200 The {{present study}} aimed to evaluate, in vitro, {{the influence of}} different treatment protocols of weakened root dentin on the bond strength (BS) of glass fiber reinforced post luted with different resin cements. Forty two upper human canines were sectioned and the root length was standardized on 17 -mm after coronary portion was removed. Biomechanical preparation was performed via Reciproc system with R 50. 05 instrument and 2. 5 % NaOCl. The <b>roots</b> were <b>flared</b> using diamond bur # 4137 and # 720 G {{at a depth of}} 12 mm and filled by the lateral condensation technique with AH Plus sealer modified with 0. 1 % Rhodamine B. After 3 times the time required to the setting reaction of the sealer the filling was removed and the glass fiber post was relined with composite resin. The roots were divided into 3 groups (n = 14) according to the treatment of dentin surface: 2. 5 %NaOCl; 2. 5 %NaOCl + 17 % EDTAand 2. 5 % NaOCl+ 17 % EDTA+ ultrasound. Half of the samples of each group had the post luted with RelyX U 200 and the other half with Panavia F. Both cements were added with 0. 1 % fluorescein. The roots were transversely sectioned obtaining two slices of each third, one for the push-out test and the other for the confocal analysis and measurement of knoop hardness. Data were submitted to ANOVA test with sub-divided portion followed by Tukey test (α= 0. 05). The highest BS values were observed for 2. 5 % NaOCl + 17 % EDTA and 2. 5 %NaOCl + 17 % EDTA + ultrasound (p> 0. 01) compared to 2. 5 %NaOClalone (p 0. 01). The protocols did not affect the BS of RelyX U 200. Overall the higher incidence of failure was adhesive (38. 83 %) followed by mixed (34. 72 %) and cohesive (26. 45 %) failure. Dentin treatment with 2. 5 %NaOCl+ 17 % EDTA + ultrasound promoted the greatest reduction in microhardness. It was concluded that the Panavia F presented the highest BS in the three root thirds and the protocols did not influence the BS of the specimens filled with RelyX U 20...|$|R
