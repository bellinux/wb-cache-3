500|$|The {{original}} UK LP (with a monaural mix) {{was released}} on 5 August 1967, and one month later it was released in stereophonic mix. It reached number six on the UK charts. The Canadian LP had the same title and track listing as the UK version. The original US album appeared on the Tower division of Capitol on 26 October 1967. This version was officially titled simply Pink Floyd, though the original album title did appear on the back cover as on the UK issue, and Dick Clark referred to the record by its original title when the group appeared on his American Bandstand television program on 18 November 1967. The US album featured an abbreviated track listing, and reached number 131 on the Billboard charts. The UK single, [...] "See Emily Play", was substituted for [...] "Astronomy Domine", [...] "Flaming" [...] and [...] "Bike". Released {{in time for the}} band's US tour, [...] "Flaming" [...] was released as a single, backed with [...] "The Gnome". The Tower issue of the album also faded out [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] and broke up the segue into [...] "The Gnome" [...] to fit the <b>re-sequencing</b> of the songs. Later US issues on compact disc had the same title and track list as the UK version. The album was certified Gold in the US on 11March 1994.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new cell <b>re-sequence</b> {{mechanism}} is proposed to restore cell sequence in multipath ATM switches. Since the proposed mechanism uses per-VC logical queues which store only the cells {{belonging to the}} same VC, the mechanism can reduce processing time compared to convent ional <b>re-sequence</b> mechanisms. The mechanism also has no limitation on the peak rate of VCS and no arbitration functions to select an output cell. The mechanism can be implemented using a RAM buffer, a CAM/RAM table, a controller, etc...|$|R

50|$|The {{music in}} video or {{computer}} games and certain films {{is meant to}} draw the audience through a storyline using two distinct techniques: horizontal <b>re-sequencing</b> and vertical re-orchestration. Horizontal <b>re-sequencing</b> is the method by which pre-composed segments of music can be re-shuffled according to a player’s choice of where they go in a storyline or environment. vertical re-orchestration is the technique of changing the mix of separate parts of an ongoing loop of music {{in relation to a}} player’s movement within the narrative of a game. Games, such as Halo 2, employ a mixture of these techniques in the creation of their soundtracks. Street Fighter II and Mario Kart DS are examples of games which change the music's tempo under certain circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of relying}} on {{individual}} tracks of audio such as in horizontal <b>re-sequencing</b> and vertical re-orchestration, some games automatically generate their content on the fly, such as the case of Spore, which uses an embedded version of the music software Pure Data to generate music to certain cues such as the addition of parts to your creature throughout the game.|$|E

40|$|Modernization of {{the airline}} fleet {{avionics}} is essential to fully enable future technologies and procedures for increasing national airspace system capacity. However in the current national airspace system, system-wide benefits gained by avionics upgrade are not fully directed to aircraft/airlines that upgrade, resulting in slow fleet modernization rate. Preferential merge <b>re-sequence</b> scheduling is a best-equipped-best-served concept designed to incentivize avionics upgrade among airlines by allowing aircraft with new avionics (high-equipped) to be <b>re-sequenced</b> ahead of aircraft without the upgrades (low-equipped) at enroute merge waypoints. The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential benefits gained or lost by airlines under a high or low-equipped fleet scenario if preferential merge resequence scheduling is implemented...|$|R
50|$|The {{one-dimensional}} cutting stock {{problem as}} {{applied in the}} paper / plastic film industries, involves cutting jumbo rolls into smaller ones. This is done by generating cutting patterns typically to minimise waste. Once such a solution has been produced, one may seek to minimise the knife changes, by <b>re-sequencing</b> the patterns (up {{and down in the}} figure), or moving rolls left or right within each pattern. These moves do not affect the waste of the solution.|$|E
50|$|They make {{extensive}} use of reel-to-reel audio tape recording, and incorporate techniques of Musique concrète composers, which {{is not limited to}} tape splicing and <b>re-sequencing,</b> tape reverse, pitch/speed alteration etc. Their performances {{have more in common with}} avant garde happenings from the late 1950s and early 1960s than traditional rock concerts. Their music is heavily influenced by Minimalist music, such as La Monte Young and Terry Riley, and electronic composers, such as Hugh Le Caine and Karlheinz Stockhausen.|$|E
50|$|With the {{availability}} of a reference template, only differences (e.g., single nucleotide substitutions and insertions/deletions) need to be recorded, thereby greatly reducing the amount of information to be stored. The notion of relative compression is obvious especially in genome <b>re-sequencing</b> projects where the aim is to discover variations in individual genomes. The use of a reference single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map, such as dbSNP, can be used to further improve the number of variants for storage.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, rigorously writing data to disk {{in the order}} that maximizes data {{integrity}} also impacts performance.
