A uniform ADC, which {{is characterized by a}} sensible phase inaccuracy depending on frequency, is connected to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor, that is especially affected by a round-off amplitude noise linked to both the FFT <b>register</b> <b>length</b> and samples number. If the <b>register</b> <b>length</b> is equal to 32 bits, then the round-off noise is entirely negligible, else, once bits are reduced to 16, a technique of compensation must occur. In fact, oversampling can be employed within a short time window, reaching a compromise between the needs of limiting the phase inaccuracy due to ADC and not raising too much the number of averaged FFT values sufficient to bound the round-off. Finally, the appendix presents an outline of somewhat lengthy demonstrations needed to calculate the amplitude and especially phase inaccuracies due to the round-off noise of FFT processors.

40|$|A {{frequency}} sampling filter {{which is}} a finite impulse response digital filter uses a recursive structure that requires exact pole zero cancellation on the unit circle. When implemented with digital technology, errors due to finite length registers and finite precision arithmetic can prevent exact pole zero cancellation making the filter unstable. To guarantee stability, the poles and zeros on the unit circle are moved to {{a circle of radius}} r where 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1. Most frequency sampling filter design techniques determine optimal frequency responses for r = 1 and then chose a value of r, 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1, near to 1 so that the filter 2 ̆ 7 s frequency response does not differ significantly.
