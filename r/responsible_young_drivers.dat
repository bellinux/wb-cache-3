40|$|In Australia {{and other}} {{developed}} countries, <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> {{are more likely}} to be involved in crashes than older, more experienced drivers. However, not all <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> are crash involved. There is increasing evidence within road safety literature suggesting the existence of a subgroup of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> with an elevated risk of crashing. The aim of this thesis was to examine characteristics of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> (aged 16 to 24 years) that identify those with an elevated risk of crash involvement and to validate high-risk driver subtypes among different <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> populations. <b>Young</b> <b>driver</b> interventions might be more effective if tailored to the needs and motivations of these specific subgroups of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> identified as being at a higher risk of crash involvement. The first of four studies examined the ability of previous driving behaviour, reflected in driver records, to identify high-risk drivers, that is, drivers deemed culpable for a fatal crash. The official driver records, both crashes and traffic offences, of drivers involved in a multiple vehicle fatal crash were tracked for five years prior to the fatal crash (N= 388). This analysis was repeated for a subset of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> aged 16 to 24 years (n= 82). Although driver records (i. e., prior drink driving offences) had some value in identifying high-risk drivers, they were not useful in identifying the subset of high-risk <b>young</b> <b>drivers.</b> The second study involved an examination of personality characteristics, motivations, driving related attitudes, and behaviours to ascertain whether they could differentiate young traffic offenders (N= 336), drivers detected engaging in risky driving, from other <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> (i. e., university students N= 270). Based on a wide variety of questionnaire measures, the profile of characteristics for the offenders indicated that they were well adjusted and generally did not differ greatly from the students. However, there were notable differences on some measures related to aggression. In addition, offenders generally had less safety-oriented attitudes towards road safety issues than students. Considering that <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> are not a homogenous group, the third and fourth studies examined whether personality characteristics and attitudes could identify different subtypes of <b>young</b> <b>drivers,</b> specifically subtypes with an elevated crash risk. The existence of subtypes was examined and validated among the two <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> populations: university students (N= 270) and young traffic offenders (N= 336). Based on questionnaire measures, cluster analysis identified four meaningful <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> subtypes in each of the <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> populations. High-risk <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> subtypes were more clearly differentiated among <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> already identified by their driving record as high-risk (i. e., traffic offenders). Of significance, the high-risk <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> subtypes had a similar profile (i. e., "emotional, hostile" and "thrill-seeking") to those found in previous research. Interventions that matched the needs of these high-risk subtypes were discussed. A 12 -month follow up of driver records showed that high-risk subtypes continued to be detected for more traffic offences than other subtypes, and there was a trend of greater crash involvement. It is recommended that further research follow these driver records for a number of years to allow comprehensive validation of these subtypes. Thesis (PhD) [...] School of Psychology, 200...|$|R

40|$|<b>Young</b> <b>drivers</b> remain overrepresented in road crashes {{around the}} world, with road injury {{the leading cause}} of death among adolescents. In addition, the {{majority}} of road traffic crashes, fatalities and injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries. All <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> are at risk due to a breadth of age- and inexperience-related factors; however it is well recognised that <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> may also intentionally engage in risky driving behaviours which increase their crash risk. The aim of this paper is to examine the self-reported risky driving behaviour of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in Australia, New Zealand (high-income countries), and Colombia (middle-income country), and to explore the utility of a crash risk assessment model in these three countries. <b>Young</b> <b>drivers</b> aged 16 - 25 years completed the Behaviour of <b>Young</b> Novice <b>Drivers</b> Scale (BYNDS), in addition to self-reporting crash involvement and driving offences. A hierarchical segmentation analysis via decision trees was used to study the relationship between self-reported crashes and risky driving. <b>Young</b> <b>drivers</b> in Colombia reported more risky driving than <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in New Zealand, and considerably more risky driving than <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in Australia. Significant differences among and across countries in individual BYNDS items were found, and 23. 5 % of all participants reported they had been involved in a road crash. Handheld mobile phone usage was the strongest predictor of crashes, followed by driving after drinking alcohol, and carrying friends as passengers. Country of origin predicted mobile phone usage, with New Zealand and Colombia grouped in the same decision tree branch which implies no significant differences in the behaviour between these countries. Despite cultural differences in licensing programs and enforcement, <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> reported engaging in a similar breadth of risky behaviours. Road crashes were explained by mobile phone usage, drink driving and driving with passengers, suggesting interventions should target these three risk factors. Whilst New Zealand and Australia have implemented graduated driver licensing programs, are geographical neighbours, and are high-income countries, the finding that behaviours of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in New Zealand and Colombia were more similar than those of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in New Zealand and Australia merits further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study into characteristic <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> accidents. The aim was to bundle the information from the research institutes in the member states of the European Union by using a questionnaire. Information was received from all but one country. All countries report a high proportion of <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> accidents with the exception of Ireland. Both males and females are frequently involved in accidents, but the problem is greater with the young male. Especially the week-end night accidents are typical <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> accidents. The 'single accident' is also a typical <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> accident that decreases with age and experience. In comparison with older <b>drivers,</b> <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> are under-represented in alcohol accidents.

40|$|Graduated driver {{licensing}} (GDL) is {{a method}} of licensing novice drivers commonly implemented {{in response to the}} over-involvement of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in crashes. The literature on graduated driver licensing suggests that it is an effective method by which the crash rates of <b>young,</b> inexperienced <b>drivers</b> may be reduced. Positive preliminary results in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada show that allowing <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> to obtain experience in low risk driving conditions and delaying full, unrestricted licensure leads to fewer crashes. Although {{there is a possibility that}} the main sources of these countries' crash reductions are coincidental reductions in exposure, it is nonetheless apparent that graduated driver licensing programs can save lives and reduce injuries suffered by <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> and passengers in road trauma. Attitudinal surveys have also revealed widespread support for the restrictions on <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> that are incorporated into the schemes. The quantitative analysis of trends in crash fatalities and serious injuries suggests that there were reductions over the ten-year period 1983 to 1992 for <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> relative to older drivers in South Australia. It also seems there were reductions in fatalities over this period compared with Victoria. The introduction of zero blood alcohol concentration (BAG) for probationary licence holders in 1985, as a component of the licensing system along with GDL and other factors, could have been responsible for the decline.

40|$|Background The overrepresentation of <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> in road crashes, {{injuries}} and fatalities {{around the world}} {{has resulted in a}} breadth of injury prevention efforts including education, enforcement, engineering, and exposure control. Despite multifaceted intervention, the <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> problem remains a challenge for injury prevention researchers, practitioners and policy-makers. The intractable nature of <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> crash risks suggests that a deeper understanding of their car use – that is, the purpose of their driving – is required to inform the design of more effective <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> countermeasures. Aims This research examined the driving purpose reported by <b>young</b> <b>drivers,</b> including the relationship with self-reported risky driving behaviours including offences. Methods <b>Young</b> <b>drivers</b> with a Learner or Provisional licence participated in three online surveys (N 1 = 656, 17 - 20 years; N 2 = 1051, 17 - 20 years; N 3 = 351, 17 - 21 years) {{as part of a larger}} state-wide project in Queensland, Australia. Results A driving purpose scale was developed (the PsychoSocial Purpose Driving Scale, PSPDS), revealing that <b>young</b> <b>drivers</b> drove for psychosocial reasons such as for a sense of freedom and to feel independent. Drivers who reported the greatest psychosocial purpose for driving were more likely to be male and to report more risky driving behaviours such as speeding. Drivers who deliberately avoided on-road police presence and reported a prior driving-related offence had significantly greater PSPDS scores, and higher reporting of psychosocial driving purposes was found over time as drivers transitioned from the supervised Learner licence phase to the independent Provisional (intermediate) licence phase. Discussion and conclusions The psychosocial needs met by driving suggest that effective intervention to prevent <b>young</b> <b>driver</b> injury requires further consideration of their driving purpose. Enforcement, education, and engineering efforts which consider the psychosocial purpose of the driving are likely to be more efficacious than those which presently do not. Road safety countermeasures could reduce the <b>young</b> <b>driver’s</b> exposure to risk through such mechanisms as encouraging the use of public transport...|$|R
