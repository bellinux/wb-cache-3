50|$|For example, say the 5 prices chosen are $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5. A first random chosen price {{might be}} $4. If the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> in top 2 on {{purchase}} intent, {{then there is}} only $5 left higher so the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> asked purchase intent at that price. If they are in top 2 on $5 then the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> coded $5 as this is the highest price they are in top 2 to pay. If {{they are not in}} top 2 on $5 then the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> coded as $4 as this was the highest price they are willing to pay. If the <b>respondent</b> <b>is</b> not top 2 on $4, then they are asked a random lower price.

30|$|The {{sample size}} was {{selected}} based on Comrey and Lee (1992) inferential statistics.

25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} by the following example. Assume that an opinion poll is conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed {{people are more likely}} to be home and answer the phone than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed <b>respondents</b> <b>are</b> likely to be over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
30|$|A {{structured}} online {{questionnaire was}} developed to collect data for the current study. Using Qualtrics, 212 participants were recruited.

Male <b>respondents</b> <b>are</b> more likely to change their status from being not-employed to employed, but being insured has a negative effect on switching job status from “not-employed” to “employed” for people aged 60–62 and insignificant effect for 55-59 and aged over 63.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. <b>Respondents</b> <b>are</b> asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put things back in their proper place, or Am careful to avoid making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E
25|$|Statistics New Zealand gathers {{information}} on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law {{for every person}} in New Zealand on census night but <b>respondents</b> <b>are</b> able to object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion {{more than doubled in}} two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. <b>Respondents</b> <b>are</b> asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E

The 2016 annual NFL poll found significant difference of opinion based upon age and race. Older <b>respondents</b> <b>are</b> opposed to a name change, but those between 18 and 29 are strongly (70%) in favor of a change. While 77% of all white fans believe the name should not be changed, only 38% of African-American and 33% of Latino fans agree, which is a change since the 2014 poll in which there was little difference between white and non-white opinion.|$|E
