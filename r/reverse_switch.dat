The rotary converter is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the <b>reversing</b> <b>switch,</b> but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the rotary converter avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{electric}} energy quality of switching power supply, through the theoretical analysis on the high frequency large-power rectification and the <b>reverse</b> <b>switch</b> supply theory, we conclude that the switch supply is the main polluting source of affecting the power energy quality. At the same time, we obtain that the contents of 3, 5, 7 th-fold harmonic components in the switching supply is highest through the measurement of special harmonics test instrument. Other high-frequency harmonics also exist, but their proportions are rather low, as can be neglected. Therefore, the 3, 5, 7 th-fold harmonic components of the switching supply are the major reasons leading to the system polluted. In order to eliminating the pollution of the harmonics produced by the switching supply to power grid and the side-effect to its own control system, this paper designs a general 3 -phase passive filter instrument which can not only restrict harmonics, but also improve the power factor of the supply system. The test shows that the method can make the supply system to ideal effect, the contents {{of all kinds of}} harmonics become rather lower than the standard constituted by our country, and it also degrades the power harmonics and decreases the alternating current ripples greatly...|$|E

All treatments received nutrient solution at 9 dates during the experiment. The high-N and low-N controls received 1. 96 and 0. 56 g/application, respectively. In the high-low treatment the switch from the higher to the lower application rate took place 57 days after planting (DAP) and in the low high treatment the <b>reverse</b> <b>switch</b> took place 85 DAP; these 2 treatments received the same total amount of N. Plant N concentrations changed rapidly upon changes in N supply regime. When the supply rate was increased, N concentration increased in leaves that had completed their expansion. Changes in leaf growth started about 15 days after the switch in N regime. Leaves that were expanding at the switch responded by increase in area when N supply increased without a change in mass, i. e. specific leaf area increased. Leaf areas and specific leaf area of expanding leaves decreased when the N supply became smaller. The control of leaf size during initiation and expansion is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{cold atom}} and {{ultra-fast}} pump-probe experiments we study the melting of long-range antiferromagnetic {{order of a}} perfect Néel state in a periodically driven repulsive Hubbard model. The dynamics is calculated for a Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions with non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory. In the absence of driving melting proceeds differently depending on the quench of the interactions to hopping ratio math formula from the atomic limit. For math formula decay occurs due to mobile charge-excitations transferring energy to the spin sector, while for math formula it is governed by the dynamics of residual quasi-particles. Here we explore the rich effects that strong periodic driving has on this relaxation process spanning three frequency ω regimes: (i) high-frequency math formula, (ii) resonant math formula with integer l, and (iii) in-gap math formula away from resonance. In case (i) we can quickly switch the decay from quasi-particle to charge-excitation mechanism through the suppression of ν 0. For (ii) the interaction can be engineered, even allowing an effective math formula regime to be reached, giving the <b>reverse</b> <b>switch</b> from a charge-excitation to quasi-particle decay mechanism. For (iii) the exchange interaction can be controlled with {{little effect on the}} decay. By combining these regimes we show how periodic driving could be a potential pathway for controlling magnetism in antiferromagnetic materials. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of matrix product state techniques to the Hamiltonian DMFT impurity problem subjected to strong periodic driving...|$|E

40|$|Conjugative plasmid {{transfer}} {{is an important}} mechanism for diversifying prokaryotic genomes and disseminating antibiotic resistance. Relaxases are conjugative plasmid-encoded proteins essential for plasmid transfer. Relaxases bind and cleave one plasmid strand site- and sequence-specifically before transfer of the cleaved strand. TraI 36, a domain of F plasmid TraI that contains relaxase activity, binds a plasmid sequence in single-stranded form with subnanomolar KD and high sequence specificity. Despite 91 % amino acid sequence identity, TraI 36 domains from plasmids F and R 100 discriminate between binding sites. The binding sites differ by 2 of 11 bases, but both proteins bind their cognate site with three orders of magnitude higher affinity than the other site. To identify specificity determinants, we generated variants having R 100 amino acids in the F TraI 36 background. Although most retain F specificity, the Q 193 R/R 201 Q variant binds the R 100 site with 10 -fold greater affinity than the F site. The <b>reverse</b> <b>switch</b> (R 193 Q/Q 201 R) in R 100 TraI 36 confers a wild-type F specificity on the variant. Nonadditivity of individual amino acid and base contributions to recognition suggests that the specificity difference derives from multiple interactions. The F TraI 36 crystal structure shows positions 193 and 201 form opposite sides of a pocket within the binding cleft, suggesting binding involves knob-into-hole interactions. Specificity is presumably modulated by altering {{the composition of the}} pocket.

40|$|Ambiguous {{figures have}} fascinated {{researchers}} for almost 200 years. The physical properties of these figures remain constant, yet two distinct interpretations are possible; these <b>reverse</b> (<b>switch)</b> from one percept to the other. The {{consensus is that}} reversal requires complex interaction of perceptual bottom-up and cognitive top-down elements. The specific processes that allow the phenomenal experience of reversal remain mysterious. This monograph has two aims: first, to identify specific processes of the reversal phenomenon by using a developmental approach. Second, to use ambiguous figures as a research tool to shed more light onto children's developing understanding of pictorial representation. Four studies (7 experiments), each involving around sixty 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-old children, using multiple tasks, yielded the following conclusions. The concept of ambiguity develops {{between the ages of}} 3 and 4 (Study 1). Understanding ambiguity requires pictorial metarepresentation and is associated with understanding mental (false beliefs) and linguistic representation (synonymy, homonymy). This suggests a broader conceptual development of representation around the age of 4. The perception of ambiguity develops between 4 and 5 years (Study 2). Within this age range children also develop inhibitory (Study 3) and image generation abilities (Study 4). These are key processes allowing reversal. Further, when task demands are changed (prompted reversal task; feature identification), children's reversal reaches ceiling by the age of 5 (Studies 2, 3, and 4). The conclusion is a two-stage empirical model of reversal: During Stage 1 (between 3 and 4 years), children develop the conception of pictorial ambiguity (top-down knowledge). During Stage 2 (between 4 and 5 years) children develop the necessary additional processes for reversal to occur (inhibition and image generation). These are the key specific top-down and bottom-up developments underlying the phenomenon of ambiguous figure reversal. They correspond to the distinction of ambiguity and reversibility highlighted in adult research...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Short-Open-Load-Thru (SOLT) on-wafer vector network {{calibration method}} for broad-band accuracy is proposed. Accurate measurement of on-wafer devices {{over a wide}} range of frequency, from DC to high frequencies with a minimum number of space conservative standards has always been desirable. Therefore, the work is aimed at improving the existing calibration methods and suggesting a best 2 ̆ 2 practice 2 ̆ 2 strategy that could be adopted to obtain greater accuracy with a simplified procedure and calibration set. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons are made to the existing calibration techniques. The advantages and drawbacks of each calibration are analyzed. Prior work done at the University of South Florida by an improved SOLT calibration is briefed. The presented work is a culmination and refinement of the prior USF work that suggested that SOLT calibration improves with more complex definitions for the calibration standards. Modeling of the load and thru standards is shown to improve accuracy as the frequency variation of the two standards can be significant. The load is modeled with modified equivalent circuit to include the high frequency parasitics. The model is physically verified on different substrates. The relation of load impedance with DC resistance is verified and its significance in SOLT calibrations is illustrated. The thru equation accounts for the losses in a transmission line reflections and phase shift including dielectric and conductor losses. The equations used are important for cases where a non-zero length of thru is assumed for the calibration. The complex definitions of the calibration standards are included in the calibration algorithm with LabView and tested on two different VNA 2 ̆ 7 s [...] Wiltron 360 B and Anritsu Lightning.

In LDL, apo-B was lower and apo-E higher in LF-than high-fat-fed rats. HDL-apo-E was higher and HDL-apo-Al lower in LF- than high-fat-fed rats.

40|$|Dynamical systems {{techniques}} {{are used to}} examines three biological questions including macrophage activation, coupled oscillators and decision making in fish schools. Macrophages are fundamental cells of the innate immune system. Their activation is essential for such distinct immune functions as inflammation (pathogen-killing) and tissue repair (wound-healing). An open question has been the functional stability of an individual macrophage cell: whether it can change its functional profile between different immune responses such as between the repair pathway and the inflammatory pathway. We studied this question theoretically by constructing a rate equation model for the key substrate, enzymes and products of the pathways; we then tested the model experimentally. Both our model and experiments show that individual macrophages can switch from the repair pathway to the inflammation pathway but that the <b>reverse</b> <b>switch</b> does not occur. We analyzed the periodically forced Kuramoto model. This system consists of an infinite population of phase oscillators with random intrinsic frequencies, global sinusoidal coupling, and external sinusoidal forcing. It represents an idealization of many phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology in which mutual synchronization competes with forced synchronization. In other words, the oscillators in the population try to synchronize with one another while also trying to lock onto an external drive. Previous work on the forced Kuramoto model uncovered two main types of attractors, called forced entrainment and mutual entrainment, but {{the details of the}} bifurcations between them were unclear. Here we present a complete bifurcation analysis of the model for a special case in which the infinite-dimensional dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system. Exact results are obtained for the locations of Hopf, saddle-node, and Takens-Bogdanov bifurcations. The resulting stability diagram bears a striking resemblance to that for the weakly nonlinear forced van der Pol oscillator. Many types of fish travel in schools where they cooperate on activities such as foraging for food and avoiding predators. In the past, it was believed that such group actions were dictated by a small number of informed leaders but recent evidence has shown that strictly local interactions can be responsible for cohesive group dynamics. Using an ODE model, we investigated the ability of a group of fish to make an accurate decision when portions of the group have conflicting information. Beyond the disparity of information, it is not known which individuals have which information. We modeled fish schools where a portion of the school believed food was in one location and another equalsized portion of the school believed the food was in another location. We found that the ability to make an accurate decision (locate food) required that some individuals "forget" or ignore their information. Without the loss of information by some individuals there was no ability to make a consensus decision...|$|E
