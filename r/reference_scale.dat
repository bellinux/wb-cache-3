5000|$|To assure accuracy, the {{calibration}} of {{the optical}} factor should be checked for each instrument rather than solely relying upon the manufacturer’s specifications. A series of tree diameters up {{the trunk of}} the tree are systematically measured using this procedure {{from the base of the}} tree to the top and their height is noted. Diameters can sometimes be measured with the monocular w/reticle in sections where it is difficult to obtain accurate laser distances because intervening thin brush or branches. Distances to the obscured section may be interpolated from measurements made above and below the obscured section. Some photographic methods are being developed to allow calculation of diameters of trunk and limb segments in photographs that contain a scale of known size and where distance to the target is known. Essentially, the camera is treated as if it were a monocular w/reticle and the [...] "optical factor" [...] for the camera at a particular focal length is calculated for each photograph based upon the size of a <b>reference</b> <b>scale</b> and its distance from the camera. The scale need not be present in every image of an individual tree so long as the focal length has not been changed between images. Using this principle a shot can be made of each measurement point through an enlarged image to make the girth measurements easier and more accurate. In addition, this allows the central, less optically distorted portion of the image to be used for the measurements. The measured diameter of the almost cylindrical section is not going to vary significantly with viewing angle. Using data from clinometer and distance measurements at each end of a segment, the height, length, and distance of intermediate points can be calculated and the trunk diameters at these points can be measured. One advantages of the photographic method is the ubiquity of the digital camera. In addition, once the framework data is measured in the field, the trunk diameter measurement process can be done later on a computer. The photographic image can be also easily be re-measured if an error is encountered in the calculations.|$|E
40|$|Most statewide testing {{programs}} use methods {{based on}} item response theory (IRT) to equate tests. Each test generally includes an anchor set {{of items that}} is anchored to the <b>reference</b> <b>scale.</b> IRT calibration of an equating sample brings new items onto the <b>reference</b> <b>scale.</b> Stable, reliable equating {{can have an impact}} at both the individual and institutional levels. In high-stakes testing, individuals may be granted or denied a diploma or other property rights {{on the basis of the}} outcomes of a test that is equated to the <b>reference</b> <b>scale</b> on which the passing standard is set. Similarly, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law attaches school and district sanctions to objectives measured against standards on a <b>reference</b> <b>scale</b> to which tests are equated. Unstable equating can lead to volatility that may lead unfairly to sanctions or rewards. The quest for stable linkages across years has led to the adoption of post-hoc mechanisms to exclude items from the anchor set. In theory, items should maintain a constant difficulty relative to one another across samples. When this expectation fails, items are said to drift. Using anchor items that drift for construct-irrelevant reasons to anchor a scale can bias test scores. Therefore, operational testing programs seek to exclude such items from the anchor set. Volatility of state trend data is a problem, and more reliable linkages will go a long way to fi...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE To {{validate}} the German {{version of the}} spinal stenosis measure (SSM), a disease-specific questionnaire assessing symptom severity, physical function, and satisfaction with treatment in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. METHODS After translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and pilot testing, we assessed internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness of the SSM subscales. Data from a large Swiss multi-center prospective cohort study were used. <b>Reference</b> <b>scales</b> {{for the assessment of}} construct validity and responsiveness were the numeric rating scale, pain thermometer, and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. RESULTS One hundred and eight consecutive patients were included in this validation study, recruited from five different centers. Cronbach's alpha was above 0. 8 for all three subscales of the SSM. The objectivity of the SSM was assessed using a partial credit approach. The model showed a good global fit to the data. Of the 108 patients 78 participated in the test-retest procedure. The ICC values were above 0. 8 for all three subscales of the SSM. Correlations with <b>reference</b> <b>scales</b> were above 0. 7 for the symptom and function subscales. For satisfaction subscale, it was 0. 66 or above. Clinically meaningful changes of the <b>reference</b> <b>scales</b> over time were associated with significantly more improvement in all three SSM subscales (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{modelling}} the aliasing error in single-input single-output (SISO) linear systems with gridded input data is studied. First, a general linear esti-mation framework for SISO systems, {{based on the}} use of a multiresolution <b>reference</b> <b>scaling</b> kernel, is established, which includes the usual FFT-based numerical approxi-mation of geodetic convolution integrals as a special case. The output signal error is modelled {{with the help of a}} spatio-statistical parameter (sampling phase) that depends on the resolution of the input data grid. A frequency do-main algorithm is then developed which computes the de-cay rate of a certain output error functional with respect to the data resolution level, using the power spectra of the input signal, the chosen scaling estimation kernel, and the theoretic convolution kernel of the linear system. A simple numerical experiment is also included to compare the ac-curacy of the classic FFT approach in SISO approximation problems against the proposed generalization that utilizes an arbitrary <b>reference</b> <b>scaling</b> kernel...|$|R

40|$|The global {{nature of}} {{geomagnetic}} polarity reversals has made magnetostratigraphy an essential tool for precise correlation between widely distributed sections of rocks of different lithological and biotic facies. The best documented history of geomagnetic polarity reversals {{is for the}} Jurassic to Recent {{and is based on}} the analysis of numerous marine magnetic anomaly profiles from the global ocean (e. g., Cande and Kent, 1992; Gradstein et al., 1994).
