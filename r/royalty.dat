5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a <b>royalty</b> rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented. An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10,000 units per year is an annual fee of $5,000 with a <b>royalty</b> rate of $1 per unit. The <b>royalty</b> only applies to final products {{and does not}} apply to products that are included in, or with, a licensed HDMI product that is already subject to the <b>royalty.</b> For example, an HDMI cable sold directly to consumers is paid for by the cable manufacturer; however, if the cable manufacturer sells the HDMI cable to a HDTV manufacturer (who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the <b>royalty)</b> then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the <b>royalty</b> on the HDTV.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{an article}} in The Day stated that the push to restore the house came from {{conservation}} specialist Doug <b>Royalty,</b> who was researching prefabricated homes from the 1920s and 1930s. <b>Royalty</b> approached Abigail Van Slyck, the chairwoman of Connecticut College's art history department and architectural studies program about the house. The Day referred to the house's historic value as a new discovery, but its history {{was included in the}} Winslow Ames House National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1995. The Winslow Ames House nomination detailed the House's origin, but criticized its gable roof modification. After its re-discovery, Connecticut College began collecting grants to restore the house under the direction of <b>Royalty</b> and Van Slyck. <b>Royalty</b> stated that the House and Winslow Ames House are very rare, with only a few surviving examples in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how far the Member States of EU have unified the system of taxation of <b>royalties</b> with respect to the Czech Republic. This issue is analyzed on the basis of comparison of Conventions between Czech Republic and other member states of EU.

In order to examine the issue of taxation of <b>royalties,</b> attention is also given to the definition of <b>royalties</b> from the Czech legislation as well as from OECD (based on the Commentary to the Model Treaty) point of view. The thesis outlines also practical approaches to taxation of <b>royalties</b> in various model situations...|$|R

5|$|Over time, {{because of}} the {{relatively}} limited number of potential consorts, the gene pool of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European <b>royalty</b> was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European <b>royalty</b> and nobility descended from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was infamous for inbreeding, with the Habsburg lip cited as an ill effect, although no genetic evidence has proved the allegation. The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also engaged in first-cousin unions frequently and in double-cousin and uncle-niece marriages occasionally.|$|E

Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky.
