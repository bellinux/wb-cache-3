40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{determine}} the prevalence and risk factors for necrotic enteritis in broilers, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 857 farms, rearing broilers for nine UK poultry companies. The main data collection tool was a postal questionnaire directed at farm managers. Additional information on disease occurrence on the farm was collected from veterinary post-mortem reports. The response rate to the questionnaire was 75 %, ranging from 54 % to 90 % within companies. During 2001, 32. 8 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} they had had a case of necrotic enteritis (95 % C. I. 29. 1 – 36. 8) in at least one flock. The disease was most often reported during the months October to February. Farm manager reported point prevalence (necrotic enteritis occurrence in the most recently <b>reared</b> <b>flock)</b> was 12. 3 % (95 % C. I. 9. 8 – 15. 2). Multilevel logistic regression with poultry company as random effect was performed using the occurrence of necrotic enteritis in the farm's most recently <b>reared</b> <b>flock</b> as dependent variable. Strong associations were found between the outcome variable and the occurrence of wet litter (O. R. 2. 39; 95 % C. I. 1. 27 - 4. 52; p= 0. 007) and coccidiosis (O. R. 4. 68; 95 % C.

Finally, the positive association between the use of plasterboard walls in poultry houses and the occurrence of necrotic enteritis might point to an important role of cleaning and disinfection in the epidemiology of this disease (O.

40|$|In a <b>flock</b> of artificially <b>reared</b> turkeys {{originally}} {{consisting of}} 85 birds and reduced {{during the summer}} and fall by deaths and withdrawals for experimental purposes to 42 birds, five cases of blackhead occurred. These appeared during the months of July, September, and October. In four, Heterakis was searched for and found. In 38 birds from this flock killed for food during November and December, five harbored no Heterakis, and the rest carried light infestations. Of sixteen healthy birds withdrawn from the above flock during July and placed with a flock of older birds which had passed through this disease in former seasons, all contracted blackhead and fourteen died of the disease. The infestation with Heterakis was, as a rule, high, reaching a hundred specimens in some cases. In general, it appears that a high infestation with Heterakis is correlated with a high incidence of blackhead, a relation that had already been inferred in feeding experiments. In both of these groups no other species of worm was found in the ceca, and in instances in which examinations for coccidia were made none was found.

Feather pecking was seen in 54 % of the <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks,</b> although symptoms were very subtle. The main risk factor was high den-sity during the first 4 weeks of life. Finally, feather pecking once started during rearing, seems to be very persistent throughout the whole life.

40|$|Feather pecking {{is one of}} {{the most}} obvious welfare {{problems}} in laying hens. It is seen in all types of housing systems. Although banned in some countries, beak trimming is generally used to reduce the damage caused by this behaviour. In organic farming, where beak trimming is prohibited, the animals are being kept in a less intensive way than in conventional farming in order to improve their welfare. However, feather pecking is also seen in organic laying hens. Generally, rearing circumstances play an important role in the development of this behaviour. Therefore, <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> were monitored for feather pecking and the relations between rearing factors and feather pecking at a young and at an adult age were analysed. Also the correlation between feather pecking during the rearing period and feather pecking during adult life was studied. Twenty-eight commercial <b>flocks</b> of <b>rearing</b> hens were monitored. These flocks split into 51 flocks of laying hens. Flocks were scored for signs of feather damage during rearing at the ages of 7, 12, and 16 weeks and on the laying farms at 30 weeks. On the rearing as well as the laying farm, data were collected on the housing system. Logistic regression was used to analyse our data. Feather damage was seen in 13 out of 24 (54 %) of <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks.</b> Logistic regression showed that a higher number of pullets being kept per square meter in the first 4 weeks of life were associated with feather damage during the rearing period (Chi square = 8. 49, df = 1, p = 0. 004). Moreover, the combination of not having litter at the age of 1 – 4 weeks and the absence of daylight at the age of 7 – 17 weeks was a significant predictor of feather damage during the laying period (Chi square = 13. 89, df = 4, p = 0. 008). In 71 % of the cases that pullets did not show feather pecking damage during rearing, they did not show feather pecking damage in the laying period either. When flocks of pullets did show feather damage, in 90 % of the cases they did so during adult life. These results lead to suggestions on how to improve the rearing conditions of laying hens and increase their welfare not only during rearing but also during later life. Although the observations were done on organic farms, the results can be applied for other non-cage systems too...|$|R

40|$|Billions {{of laying}} hens are kept worldwide. Severe feather pecking (SFP) is a {{behaviour}} which occurs {{with a high}} prevalence on commercial farms. SFP, the pecking and plucking of feathers of another bird, induces pain and stress and can ultimately lead to cannibalism. Moreover, SFP can occur if a bird is unable to cope with fear and stress and is living in an inappropriate environment. SFP thus reduces the welfare of many laying hens worldwide. To prevent SFP {{it is essential to}} know the risk factors in its development. To that aim, first, two experimental studies were conducted to gain insight in the principles of SFP, and three on-farm studies were conducted to assess the risk factors of SFP under commercial conditions. THE PRINCIPLES Factors which relate to SFP are high fearfulness as young and low levels of brain and peripheral serotonin (5 -HT) and brain dopamine (DA). Furthermore, commercial laying hen lines can differ in SFP tendencies and associated traits indicating that SFP has a genetic component. In chapters 2 and 3, fear response as young and adult, and stress response, 5 -HT and DA brain levels as adult were compared in hens of two lines: the low mortality line (LML) selected on low levels of mortality due to cannibalism and individual performance vs. the control line (CL) which was selected on individual performance only. Hens were exposed to an Open Field (OF) test at 5 weeks of age and a Manual Restraint (MR) test at 33 weeks of age. At 33 weeks of age, levels of corticosterone (CORT) post MR and 5 -HT and DA levels in four brain areas were determined. Hens of the LML were less fearful at both ages and had lower levels of DA in the arcopallium, a somatomotor area involved in fear and motor control, compared to hens of the CL. In chapter 2, it was also shown that fearful chicks had higher levels of CORT and higher activity levels as adult, compared to non-fearful chicks. Moreover, presence of fearful animals in the group was related to average CORT levels of their pen members. Fearful hens may induce social instability in a group, and thereby affecting the stress-sensitivity of their group mates. These results indicate that groups differ in levels of fear and stress-sensitivity, and that fearfulness at a young age can lead to stress-sensitivity as adults, which create a risk for development of SFP. THE PRACTICE In chapters 4, 5 and 6, the laying hen production chain consisting of parent stock, <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> and laying flocks was studied. Risk factors for SFP could originate from previous parts in the chain. Therefore, in all on-farm studies, measurements of SFP, fearfulness, basal CORT and peripheral 5 -HT system were obtained, and related to housing conditions and to previous parts in the chain. Fearfulness was assessed, on a flock level, by distance to a stationary person (SP) test and latency of bird to approach a novel object (NO). Dekalb White (DW) and ISA brown (ISA) crosses whose pure lines differ in levels of fear, CORT, 5 -HT and DA, were compared. First, parent stock (PS) flocks were studied and associations between production performance and measurements of fear, stress and 5 -HT were conducted and related to group size conditions (chapter 4). Second, <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> originating from PS flocks were studied throughout the rearing period (chapter 5). High levels of feather damage, CORT and 5 -HT in the mothers were related to fearfulness and SFP in their offspring at flock level. Especially, a large flock size and limitation and/or disruption in litter supply affected SFP and levels of fearfulness and 5 -HT (chapter 5). Finally, high levels of feather damage during the laying period were related to high SFP rearing, and high fearfulness during rearing and laying (chapter 6). These studies together aimed to determine the risk factors for the development of SFP and the resulting feather damage. The main outcomes of these studies are as follows. Ø Parent stock flocks DW flocks were more fearful of an SP and hens had higher levels of feather damage than in ISA flocks. ISA flocks, in turn, were more fearful of the NO and hens had higher 5 -HT levels than in DW flocks. A small flock size led to higher feed conversion, mortality levels, and smothering events in ISA but not in DW flocks. These results indicate that DW and ISA PS flocks differ in levels of fear and feather damage, and respond differently to their social environment. For both crosses, fear of an SP related to high mortality and fear of the NO related to low hen body weight, egg weight, and feed intake. High basal CORT related to low egg weight. High fear and stress levels in PS flocks may, thus, negatively affect (re) production, and thereby potentially negatively influence the developing embryo. Ø <b>Rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> In the DW cross, high CORT, feather damage, and 5 -HT of mother hens related to high SFP and fearfulness of their <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> at 1 week of age. At 5 weeks of age, a peak in both gentle feather pecking (GFP) and SFP was recorded, coinciding with a disruption in substrate availability (i. e. a temporal absence of substrate) and a limitation of substrate (i. e. limited amounts of substrate provided) in some of the farms. Especially, ISA pullets showed higher SFP under substrate limitation and became more fearful under substrate disruption than DW pullets. ISA pullets had higher 5 -HT levels than DW pullets. Only in the ISA cross, high 5 -HT related to high fearfulness, specifically under substrate disruption. For both crosses, high fearfulness was related to high feather damage. Furthermore, in a level system (floor system where levels are gradually added) higher levels of SFP and feather damage were found compared to an aviary system (a tier-system with cages and litter area). These results highlight that; 1) parental effects exist in the development of fearfulness and SFP, 2) disruption and limitation in substrate availability can lead to high SFP at 5 weeks of age, 3) ISA pullets are more strongly influenced by environmental conditions than DW pullets and 4) a level housing, which coincided with a large group size, increase the risk of SFP and feather damage during <b>rearing.</b> Ø Laying <b>flocks</b> In our sample, 49 % of the laying flocks had severe damage at 40 weeks of age, compared with 71 %, 65 % and 53 % of the <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> at 15, 10 and 5 weeks of age, respectively. High fear of a SP at rearing and high SFP at 5 weeks of age related to high levels of feather damage at lay. In a floor system and at a large flock size higher levels of feather damage were recorded than in an aviary system and at a small flock size. An adjusted management on the laying farm (i. e. aerated blocks, presence of roosters or a radio playing) reduced levels of feather damage compared to standard management. DW flocks were more fearful of the SP and NO than ISA flocks. This study showed that factors during rearing and laying contributed to feather damage at 40 weeks of age. With the knowledge from the experimental and on-farm studies in this thesis, an assessment of the risk factors for SFP could be established. Risk factors for SFP are: high fear, stress and feather damage in DW parent stock, high fear of humans, especially for DW hens, litter disruption or limitation during rearing, large group sizes, and a floor or level system...|$|R

In total, 1618 ewes in nine flocks were used for assessment of locomotion score and detailed clinical examination, which were performed fortnightly throughout a milking period. Subsequently, two logistic regression models were employed to assess impact of various variables on occurrence and severity of lameness. Mean lameness incidence in the nine flocks under surveillance during the milking period was 6. 8 % (110 cases in 1618 ewes); between flocks range of the incidence was 0. 4 %- 22. 0 %. In 48 % of the cases, lameness was considered to be severe. Foot-rot was found to be the commonest lameness-causing disorder, accounting for 66 % of all cases.

40|$|Sheep flocks are {{sensitive}} to the top soil intake, via their grazing activity and the ingestion of soil particles incorporated into the hay especially during harvesting operations. Such intake is estimated between 2 and 20 % of the dry matter from grass and hay and may vary accounting for seasonal and geographical differences in the quality of pastures. The persistent organic pollutants accumulated in soil such as polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs), may transfer through the food chain. In this paper, the authors consider the quality of soils and the toxicokinetic factors that allow the transfer of the contamination to milk and the edible tissues in sheep. The wide range of PCDD/F concentration reported in milk (0. 05 - 30 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ/g fat), meat (0. 18 - 4. 9 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ/g fat) and liver (4. 8 - 161 pg WHO 1998 -TEQ/g fat) from extensively <b>reared</b> <b>flocks</b> in areas of European countries under different industrial and urban pressures, indicate the opportunity to adopt risk management options based on environmental quality standards and good agriculture practices, able to support the access to a safe and nutritious food.

40|$|Feather damage due {{to severe}} feather pecking (SFP) in laying hens is most severe during the laying period. However, SFP can develop {{at an early}} age and is {{influenced}} by early rearing conditions. In this study we assessed the risk factors during the rearing and laying period for feather damage at 40 weeks of age, in ISA brown and Dekalb White laying hens. Variables related to housing conditions during the rearing and laying period, and variables related to fearfulness (response to novel object, stationary person, and social isolation) and feather pecking (SFP, feather damage and feather eating) were tested to affect feather damage at 40 weeks of age. Feather damage on the neck, back and belly region was assessed on 50 hens, resulting in a total body score, and averaged per flock (based on Welfare Quality ®, 2009). First, analysis was conducted by a two-way ANOVA to assess separate factors to influence feather damage at 40 weeks of age. Hereafter, the final GLM for predicting feather damage at 40 weeks of age included only variables which had P < 0. 1 in the two-way ANOVA. Risk factors during the rearing period were high levels of SFP at five weeks of age and elevated fear of humans (explained variance 29 % and 5. 3 %, resp.). Risk factors during the laying period were a large group size (explained variance: 1 %), distance to stationary person (explained variance: 16 %), floor housing compared to aviary housing (1. 27 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 75 ± 0. 07, explained variance: 21 %) and a standard management compared to adjusted management such as a radio, pecking blocks, round drinkers and/or roosters (0. 98 ± 0. 31 vs. 0. 51 ± 0. 04, explained variance: 26 %). Approximately 49 % of the laying flocks and 60 % of the <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> in this study showed high SFP or severe feather damage.

During the study, C. jejuni was found in 35. 5 % of the 251 shed flocks but only 9. 2 % (23 of 251) had Campylobacter isolates in successive flocks, with 9 of those 23 sheds having the same serotype between consecutive flocks, indicating {{a low level of}} transmission between flocks. Analysis of a systematic sample of 484 of 3, 304 (14. 6 %) C. jejuni isolates showed that 85 % were of 10 serotype complexes but 58 % were of 3 serotype complexes, indicating a high degree of strain similarity throughout the entire study. The three commonest types were detected in 8 of 32 flocks during the 5 -year study period, suggesting an intermittent common external Campylobacter source. This hypothesis was tested by a retrospective cohort analysis of C. jejuni rates and types by reference to hatchery supplier of the 1 -day-old chicks. Isolation rates of C. jejuni and frequency distribution of types were determined in 6 -week-old broiler chickens identified by the hatchery supplying the original chicks. The isolation rate of C. jejuni in broilers, supplied by hatchery A, was 17. 6 %, compared to 42. 9 % (P < 0. 0001) for broilers reared from chicks supplied by hatchery B. In two instances, when both hatcheries were used to stock the same farm flock, Campylobacter isolates were found only in those sheds with chicks supplied by hatchery B. Thus, the frequency distribution of Campylobacter types for chickens supplied by the two hatcheries over the 5 -year period showed marked dissimilarity. These findings suggest that the isolation rate and type of Campylobacter isolates in broiler chickens was associated with the hatchery supplying chicks. The lack of diversity of types and the intermittent high positivity of sheds is evidence for a common source of C. jejuni introduced by vertical transmission rather than contamination at the hatchery or during transportation...|$|R

This land was used partly for tillage and partly for the pasturage of cattle, but principally for the latter, as the <b>rearing</b> of <b>flocks</b> and herds was, for various reasons, a more advantageous mode of procuring food for man in those ancient days than the culture of the ground. The rural population, therefore, of the Roman territory consisted chiefly of herdsmen; and when the approaching danger from the Sabines became imminent, Romulus called all these herdsmen in, and required the flocks of sheep and the herds of cattle to be driven to the rear of the city, and shut up in an inclosure there, where they could be more easily defended. Thus the Sabine army found, when they were ready to cross the frontier, that the Roman territory, on that side, was deserted and solitary; and that there was nothing to oppose them in advancing across it almost to the very gates of Rome.|$|R
60|$|Nor could these {{noble and}} valiant knights and barons occupy {{themselves}} in any useful employment. There was nothing {{which it was}} respectable {{for them to do}} but to fight. They looked down with contempt upon all the industrial pursuits of life. The cultivation of farms, the <b>rearing</b> of <b>flocks</b> and herds, arts, manufactures, and commerce--every thing of this sort, by which man can benefit his fellow-man, was entirely beneath them. In fact, their descendants to the present day, even in England, entertain the same ideas. Their younger sons can enter the army or the navy, and spend their lives in killing and destroying, or in awaiting, in idleness, dissipation, and vice, for orders to kill and destroy, without dishonor; but to engage in any way in those vast and magnificent operations of peaceful industry, on which the true greatness and glory of England depend, would be perpetual and irretrievable disgrace. A young nobleman can serve, in the most subordinate official capacity, on board a man-of-war, and take pay for it, without degradation; but to build a man-of-war itself and take pay for it, would be to compel his whole class to disown him.|$|R
40|$|Dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) is {{the most}} widely used bone quantity investigation in human osteoporosis; it is so ubiquitous that many clinicians now mistakenly equate DXA derived areal BMD with bone strength. Bone strength partly depends on bone mass and the distribution of this mass in terms of size and shape but also depends on bone quality factors of microarchitecture, material properties, accumulated microdamage and remodelling rate. In osteoporosis research, sheep have emerged as a useful lar ge animal model due to size and physiological similarities to humans; and, as a flock animal, large numbers of sheep can be reared at reasonable costs. The aim of this research, part of the ?Bone for Life? group of studies, was to evaluate; DXA scanner val idity in the ovine animal model, DXA derived bone quantity (aBMD) change in an ovine animal model of osteoporosis, and following on from these preliminary studies; to examine the influence of DXA derived aBMD on cortical and trabecular bone mechanical prop erties. In initial validation studies of DXA scanner reliability and assessment of natural variation in aBMD in the Irish sheep population ex - vivo bone samples were sourced from heal thy Irish mixed breed ewes (age > 5 yr) at routine commercial sacrifice. Fur ther samples were also harvested from control (CON) and ovariectomised (OVX) sheep in a specially <b>reared</b> <b>flock</b> at two time points, 12 and 31 month post - ovariectomy, to determine the short - and long - term effect of ovariectomy on bone quantity (aBMD); and in further collaborative studies, bone quantity and quality relationships to mechanical properties. The DXA scan protocol consisted of standardised alignment of the whole sample (WB) on a holding jig within a tank filled with normal saline, followed by basel ine repeat data acquisition scans using a standard algorithm. The same algorithm allowed further analysis (SRA) of six sub - regions down the length of selected long bones femur (FMR), tibia (TBR), humerus (HMR) and radius (RDR); and, the six vertebrae spina l samples (LS); as well as smaller region of interest (ROI) analyses in areas of high trabecular bone content. Statistical analysis was made of initial repeat test data to determine DXA scanner reliability, establish measurement limits; and assess biologic al variability; and for the specially <b>reared</b> <b>flock,</b> inter - group differences in aBMD were analysed for effect of ovariectomy, and then re - analysed in conjunction with bone quality variables to assess the strength of aBMD and bone quality relationships to me chanical test data. xxiii The results of preliminary studies confirmed an acceptable level of; repeatability (ICC > 0. 9), reliability (%TEM 3 - 5 %) and measurement limits (95 %LOA ? 0. 035 g. cm - 2) of the adapted DXA scanning protocol for large ovine bone samples. In a representative sample of the Irish ewes evaluation of biological variability revealed; an aBMD range of approximately 0. 60 to 1. 20 g. cm - 2, minimal inter - breed variation and a small seasonal effect toward lower density in Spring months at some sites. Ana lysis of inter - group differences between CON and OVX detected no significant difference in aBMD post - ovariectomy at any spinal or long bone site at 12 month; but did detect a significant reduction in aBMD in the proximal humeral region and an unexpected fi nding of increased aBMD in the mid - region of the tibia, both with large effect size, at the 31 month time point. In follow on studies; aBMD (r 2 ~ 0. 83) and then structural geometric properties of CSMI (r 2 ~ 0. 75) and section modulus (r 2 ~ 0. 65) had the stronges t association with breaking strength (Fmax) of ovine radii in three point bending. In microdamage analysis of radii exposed to cyclic loading, and stratified as high, medium or low aBMD, results also suggested significantly higher microcrack numerical and surface density in bones with lower aBMD. Analysis of compressive strength of isolated trabecular cores was less clear, but significant inter - group differences in trabecular thickness of large effect size were detected in the CON vs. OVX comparison at the 31 month time point, and in terms of relationships to strength, trabecular number and spacing (r 2 ~ 0. 4 to 0. 5) were better related to compressive strength and modulus than any DXA or microCT derived bone quantity variable. In conclusion this work has further validated DXA bone quantity measurement and defined measurement limits for scanning and sub - regional analysis of whole bone samples in this animal model. Bone quantity data for Irish s heep were of a similar range to those seen in human female populations, and exhibited some seasonal variation again similar to human populations living in northern latitudes. In this animal model ovariectomy alone however, did not prove a sufficient enough stimulus in the short - term to produce a significant reduction in bone quantity detectable by DXA in time frames suitable for research; however longer term changes detected in the proximal humerus and tibia require further evaluation. In terms of relations hips to strength DXA derived aBMD data was the better predictor of bending strength in a typical long bone mid - shaft site; but in compression of isolated trabecular cores, bone quality factors were more closely associated to mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of the addition of recycled cellulose on the quality and temperature of the straw bedding. Starting from week 2 of the production cycle temperatures were registered and the degree of encrustation of both the cellulose and straw bedding was determined. The cellulose bedding was characterized by higher temperatures throughout the production cycle except for weeks 10., 12., 13. and 14. The warmer bedding meant that the appearing encrustation did not restrict the diffusion of vapour and gases. It exhibited more beneficial, aerobic conditions for exothermic processes. The narrower span of temperatures indicates a more uniform temperature of the cellulose bedding.

40|$|Feather pecking is a multi-factorial {{behavioral}} {{disorder and}} a serious welfare issue in the poultry industry. Several studies report early life experience with litter {{to be a major}} determinant in the development of feather pecking. The current study aimed to test the large-scale on-farm efficiency of a simple and cheap husbandry procedure applied during the rearing period with the ultimate goal of reducing the incidence of feather pecking and plumage damage during the production stage in laying hens. Five laying hen-rearing farmers from across Norway participated in the study. These farmers were asked to create divisions within their hen rearing houses and to separate their chicks into 2 groups: one reared with access to a paper substrate from the first d of age, the other a control group without access to paper substrate during <b>rearing.</b> All <b>flocks</b> were visited at the production farms at 30 wk of age and observed for pecking behavior and feather damage. Birds in the control group had higher odds of having more feather damage compared to the birds from the treatment group. In addition, flocks provided with environmental enrichment at the production farms had a reduced incidence of feather pecking, irrespective of the treatment. These results indicate that husbandry procedures during both rearing and production stages have the potential to alleviate feather pecking and increase laying hen welfare. </p...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the Campylobacter genotypes colonizing {{extensively}} <b>reared</b> broiler <b>flocks</b> and their survival through the slaughter process, despite the increasing demand for free-range and organic products by the consumer. Campylobacter isolates from a free-range boiler flock, sampled before and after slaughter, were genotyped by MLST (multilocus sequence typing) and sequence analysis of the flaA short variable region (SVR). The Campylobacter genotypes isolated before and after slaughter were diverse, with up to five sequence types (STs) (seven-locus allelic profiles resulting from MLST) identified per live bird, up to eight STs identified per carcass and 31 STs identified in all. The majority (72. 0 %) of isolates sampled from carcasses post-slaughter were indistinguishable from those isolated from the live flock before slaughter by ST and flaA SVR type, however, sampling 'on-farm' failed to capture all of the diversity seen post-slaughter. There were statistically significant increases in the genetic diversity of Campylobacter (p= 0. 005) and the proportion of C. coli (p= 0. 002), with some evidence for differential survival of genotypes contaminating the end product. C. coli genotypes isolated after slaughter were more similar to those from free-range and organic meat products sampled nationally, than from the live flock sampled previously.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{clinical and}} economic relevance of M. synoviae a poultry pathogen causing arthritis and eggshell apex abnormalities and egg production drops prompted the Dutch poultry industry {{to launch a}} mandatory control and eradication programme for this mycoplasma species in 2013 This programme is based on monitoring of commercial poultry aiming at detection of infected flocks improving awareness, and the implementation of control measures to prevent vertical and horizontal transmission. The success of a disease control and eradication programme depends on the accurate and early detection of infected flocks. This is achieved by the regular monitoring of flocks, using adequate diagnostic tests. A qPCR {{for the detection of}} M. synoviae in case of infectious synovitis in poultry was developed and may as such contribute to the reduction of economic damage due to this disease. Adequate diagnostics become especially relevant when intervention strategies such as live M. synoviae vaccination are introduced as they jeopardize seromonitoring due to the induction of vaccinal antibodies. To overcome these problems development of a DIVA (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals) PCR is beneficial. Test parameters of the differentiating M. synoviae qPCR were excellent, while field validation yielded good results also. Horizontal spread of the MS-H live vaccine strain from vaccinated to non-vaccinated birds located at different houses on the same farm was demonstrated. The test is recommended for assessing freedom from field M. synoviae in MS-H vaccinated flocks, but {{can also be used to}} determine shedding of MS-H. Using this PCR it was shown that vaccination with MS-H significantly reduced the shedding and horizontal spread of a M. synoviae challenge strain. Based on this findings this vaccine could be used in successive <b>rearing</b> <b>flocks</b> to populate M. synoviae infected multiple age layer farms. Although elimination of infected flocks can be a very effective disease control strategy in case of low prevalence, this is not attainable in poultry categories with high prevalence. In such cases antibiotic treatment and vaccination may be used to diminish the impact of clinical signs. Drawbacks of antibiotic treatment are the occurrence of resistance, residues and birds remain infected despite treatment. Furthermore, vaccination may help to prevent or reduce clinical signs it does not protect against infection with field M. synoviae. One of the main pillars in a control and eradication programme is the implementation of effective biosecurity measures to separate M. synoviae free flocks from those infected. The identification of risk factors for infection and subsequent adjustment of named programmes, is crucial. This can be achieved by tracing M. synoviae infections, for which reproducible molecular typing techniques are necessary. The shortcomings of M. synoviae vlhA typing prompted the development and evaluation of a Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) for molecular typing of M. synoviae. MLST allows both, local and global phylogenetic analysis as well as source investigation of outbreaks. Tracing of M. synoviae to unravel high risks for M. synoviae outbreaks are strongly advised if the efficiency of biosecurity programmes, which are of utmost importance in disease control, is to be maximized...|$|R
