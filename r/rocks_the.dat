He penned the Latin word fluorés (fluor, flow) for fluorite <b>rocks.</b> <b>The</b> name later evolved into fluorspar (still commonly used) and then fluorite.

5|$|In the {{geologic}} record, the K–Pg {{event is}} marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K–Pg boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial <b>rocks.</b> <b>The</b> boundary clay shows high levels of the metal iridium, which is rare in the Earth's crust, but abundant in asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} {{differences exist}} among the Negriales <b>rocks,</b> <b>the</b> Lastarria lavas, and the Lastarria pyroclastics. The Negriales rocks are the richest in silicon dioxide, and their trace element composition sharply diverges as well. The Negriales rocks may originate from parental magmas {{that are different}} from the main Lastarria magmas.|$|E

5|$|More than 70species {{of animals}} {{are known to}} live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, {{southern}} alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table <b>Rocks.</b> <b>The</b> rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.|$|E

5|$|Oak savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered oak trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table <b>Rocks.</b> <b>The</b> Takelma tribe often set fires in the oak savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the first}} European Americans to visit the area were fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Rogue Valley. Neither Ogden nor the {{expedition}} mentioned the Table <b>Rocks.</b> <b>The</b> gold rush of the early 1850s brought many emigrants to the area, and Table Rock City (later renamed Jacksonville) was established several {{miles south of the}} <b>rocks.</b> <b>The</b> sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with the Rogue River Indians. These conflicts turned into warfare, and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end the hostilities. In June 1851, soldiers of the United States Army led by Major Philip Kearny attacked the Takelma near Lower Table Rock, but the Takelma were prepared. One soldier died, and three others were injured. Major Kearny returned with volunteers from Yreka soon after, accompanied by Oregon Territory delegate Joseph Lane. The ensuing Battle of Table Rock lasted 10days, and 30Takelma were imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|The Proterozoic {{sedimentary}} formations of the Pahrump Group were {{deposited on}} these basement rocks. This occurred following uplift and erosion of any earlier sediments from the Proterozoic basement <b>rocks.</b> <b>The</b> Pahrump {{is composed of}} arkose conglomerate (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and mudstone in its lower part, followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats as stromatolites, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible glacial till from the hypothesized Snowball Earth glaciation. The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are basaltic lava flows.|$|E
