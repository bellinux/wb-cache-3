40|$|Background: The use of methylisothiazolinone (MI) in {{cosmetic}} products has caused an unprecedented epidemic of MI contact allergy. Current data concerning exposures at a European level are required. Objectives: To describe demographics and MI exposures for European patients with MI contact allergy. Methods: Eleven European dermatology departments from eight European countries prospectively collected data between 1 May and 31 October 2015 among consecutive {{patients who had}} positive patch test reactions to MI (2000 ppm aq.). Results: A total of 6. 0 % (205 / 3434; range 2. 6 - 13. 0 %) of patients had positive patch test reactions to MI. Dermatitis most frequently affected the hands (43. 4 %), face (32. 7 %), arms (14. 6 %), and eyelids (11. 7 %); 12. 7 % had widespread dermatitis. For 72. 7 % (149 / 205), MI contact allergy was currently relevant mainly because of exposure to {{cosmetic products}} (83. 2 %; 124 / 149). Of these 124 patients, 19. 5 % were exposed to leave-on and <b>rinse-off</b> cosmetic <b>products,</b> 24. 8 % only to leave-on cosmetic products and 38. 9 % only to <b>rinse-off</b> cosmetic <b>products</b> containing MI or methylchloroisothiazolinone/MI. The majority of these (79 %) noted onset of their dermatitis between 2013 and 2015. Fifteen patients (7. 3 %) had previously experienced allergic reactions {{when they were in}} newly painted rooms. Conclusion: Clinically relevant MI contact allergy remains prevalent across European countries, mainly because of exposure to rinse-off and leave-on cosmetic products...|$|R

The concen-tration of use in hair preparations is in the 1 - 5 % range- Isostear-amidopropyl Morpholine Lactate was nontoxic in acute oral toxic-ity studies in rats. Although Morpholine is considered a cutaneous, ocular, and mucous membrane irritant, and a sensitizer, Isostear-amidopropyl Morpholine Lactate exhibits none of the sensitization and irritant reactions observed with Morpholine. Isostearamido-propyl Morpholine Lactate was minimally irritating to rabbit eyes, and mildly irritating to intact and abraded rabbit skin. Although sensitization was not seen in clinical tests, some irritancy was noted. Isostearamidopropyl Morpholine Lactate was not mutagenic in the Ames test, with or without metabolic activation, although cell killing was seen at most test concentrations. Although Morpholine is readily nitrosated to form carcinogenic nitrosamines, N-nitroso impurities were not detected in Isostearamidopropyl Morpholine Lactate. Mutagenicity data on Isostearamidopropyl Morpholine Lactate in a mammalian system were not available, nor were data available on skin penetration or toxicity associated with inhalation exposures. Accordingly, the safety of this ingredient in leave-on cos-metic formulations could not be determined. Based on the available data, this ingredient was considered safe for use in <b>rinse-off</b> cos-metic <b>products.</b> Additional data needed for assessing the safety of leave-on uses include: (i) skin penetration; if there is significant skin penetration, then both a 28 -day dermal toxicity study to assess general skin and systemic toxicity, and a reproductive and devel-opmental toxicity study are needed; (ii) one genotoxicity study in a mammalian system; if positive, then a 2 -year dermal carcinogene-sis study using National Toxicology Program (NTP) methods may be needed; and (iii) inhalation toxicity data...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia cepacia complex {{bacteria}} can contaminate and {{survive in a}} variety of antimicrobial and preserved industrial products. Contamination may lead to economic loss for manufacturers and also potentially pose a risk to the health of vulnerable consumers. Understanding the interaction between Bcc bacteria and preservatives, and the molecular basis for their resistance, is essential in order to better target these organisms and to facilitate the implementation of improved preservative strategies which target resistance mechanisms. In the present study, multi-locus sequence typing analysis of a collection of 67 Bcc isolates from environmentalindustrial sources was used to expand the current knowledge of Bcc species diversity within this niche and identified B. lata (n= 17) and B. cenocepacia (n= 11) as predominant species groups. The relationship between Bcc species diversity, isolation source and preservative susceptibility was investigated using a collection of 83 genetically diverse Bcc strains from clinical, environmental and environmental-industrial isolation sources. Susceptibility to eight preservatives was not related to Bcc taxonomy, as susceptibility profiles varied both between and within species groups. However, Bcc isolates from environmental-industrial sources had a significantly higher minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC and MBC) for the formaldehyde releasing agent DMDM hydantoin. This suggests that for this preservative agent, susceptibility was related to source and that the selection of highly tolerant Bcc bacteria had occurred within the niche. Isothiazolone, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol and methyl paraben preservatives were observed to be highly efficacious against Bcc bacteria when evaluated in growth medium at the maximum concentration regulated for use in <b>rinse-off</b> personal care <b>products</b> in EU-regulated countries. Benzethonium chloride and sodium benzoate preservatives had the weakest anti-Bcc activity at these levels but were effective against several strains. Combinations of preservatives, and preservatives with potentiating agents, were evaluated for synergistic anti- Bcc activity. The greatest anti-Bcc activity was observed when isothiazolone preservatives were combined with EDTA or phenoxyethanol, with each combination resulting in an additive effect. The competency of Bcc bacteria to adapt to preservatives was explored via the progressive sub-culture of B. lata strain 383 in subinhibitory preservative concentrations. This genome sequence strain represented a Bcc species commonly encountered in the environmental-industrial niche. Stable adaptive-resistance to isothiazolone and benzethonium chloride preservatives was developed. Phenoxyethanol, DMDM hydantoin and methyl paraben preservatives were recalcitrant to B. lata strain 383 adaptation. The preservative and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the adapted B. lata strain 383 derivatives differed, suggesting the induction of agent-specific adaptive-resistance mechanisms had occurred. The B. lata 383 -CMIT,-BIT, derivatives (adapted respectively to chloromethylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone), demonstrated cross-resistance to isothiazolone preservatives and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Sequence analysis of the topoisomerase genes in these derivatives revealed fluoroquinolone resistance was not mediated by target modification. Preservative-induced adaptive resistance was not associated with overall increased multi-drug resistance. The molecular basis for resistance to DMDM hydantoin and isothiazolone preservatives was investigated via the random transposon mutagenesis of B. lata strain 383 using pTnModOTp’. Several genetic pathways were identified as putative preservative resistance determinants, suggesting that resistance is multi-factorial. These included the detoxification of formaldehyde via a glutathione-dependent pathway; a type II general secretory system (A 3244 _A 3233 genes); a homologue of an ABC-type efflux system involved in resistance to organic solvents (A 3512 _A 3517 genes); homologues of multi-drug RND-type efflux systems EmrB/QacA-Emr-TolC; and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. A transcriptomic microarray-based approach was used to profile global gene expression of B. lata strain 383 in response to sub-MIC of 0. 00162 % DMDM hydantoin and 0. 00001498 % of a methylisothiazolinone and CMIT blend, as well as isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance. With a 1. 5 -fold change and P < 0. 05 confidence level criterion applied, few significant changes were observed after a single sub-MIC exposure, and the differential expression of putative resistance determinants identified by transposon mutagenesis was not induced at these concentrations. Isothiazolone-induced adaptive-resistance involved a greater number of significant gene expression changes that were stable irrespective of the presence of the priming agent, with 126 up-regulated and 90 down-regulated genes. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance was multi-factorial in nature, and identified active efflux as a putative key resistance mechanism. A novel role for a RND-type efflux system (B 1004 _B 1006 genes) was identified, and the up-regulation of the ABC-efflux system (A 3512 _A 3517 genes) and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress corroborated the transposon mutagenesis findings. B. lata strain 383 -CMIT demonstrated a four-fold reduction in MIC for the priming preservative (2. 81 E- 04 %) in the presence of 512 mg/L of the efflux inhibitor PAβN. Resistance mechanism targeted preservative strategies such as using efflux inhibitors may work to improve preservation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{cosmetics}} regulation, 26 potential allergenic fragrance substances {{have to be}} {{indicated on}} the product containers if they are present above 0.001 percent in ‘leave-on’ products or above 0.01 percent in ‘rinse-off’ products [10, 38]. These 26 potential allergenic fragrance ingredients are chemically defined constituents. All ten manufacturers used several of them. 82 natural personal care products reported {{at least one of}} the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’. On average, the natural products analyzed declared 3.8 of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’, with a maximum of 11 per product.

30|$|Carcinogens, mutagens and {{substances}} {{toxic to}} reproduction (CMR substances) are in principle prohibited according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [1], but there are exceptions for these substances where ‘their use has been found safe’ by the Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) [1]. Mutagens (such as m-phenylenediamine), carcinogens (such as carbomer) or substances toxic for reproduction (such as cyclomethicone) were listed in formulations of PCPs [26], but they usually are below the concentration thresholds for labelling and classification of the mixture thus exposing uninformed consumers. Butylphenyl methylpropional, classified as suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn child (C&L Inventory [27]), is a frequently used masking agent present in products sold in retail shops where the exact percentage in the final product is not disclosed. Furthermore, Hutter and colleagues [28] identified synthetic musks in blood of young healthy adults which came from cosmetic products applied to the skin. In the USA, a correlation was observed {{between the use of}} PCPs containing estrogens (e.g., placenta or synthetic hormones such as estron or estradiol) and increased breast cancer incidence [29]. In another study in the USA, endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, parabens or nitrosamines, were identified in PCPs [30]. Assessing the human health risks posed by dangerous ingredients in PCPs is an important public health concern because of the high exposures resulting from PCP direct application to the human body surface both intentionally and frequently [31]. Some PCPs are diluted with water during application (<b>rinse-off</b> <b>products),</b> such {{as in the case of}} shampoo or soap, whereas others are applied undiluted onto the skin or hair (leave-on products), as is the case with lotion or deodorant, leading to higher exposures than <b>rinse-off</b> <b>products.</b> Users tend to use varied amounts of PCPs and several products at the same time which leads to a further increase of the exposure. Furthermore, application of PCPs on children potentially poses a greater risk of exposure to hazardous chemicals [32, 33]. Therefore, exposures and exposure risks will vary considerably for consumers using PCPs [34]. RC measures consequently must address these varied exposures and exposure patterns, as well as differences in consumer populations (e.g., children, culturally diverse).|$|E
40|$|Background Chemical products, {{cosmetics}} {{and other products}} handled by consumers and workers frequently contain contact allergens (skin sensitizers). Contact allergens are low-molecular substances which may induce contact allergy (Type IV allergy) after contact with skin. 15 - 20 % of adults are allergic {{to one or more}} of the most common contact allergens, which can cause allergic contact dermatitis (eczema) on any part of the body, although the hands and face are the most common sites. Contact allergy is a lifelong condition, requiring avoidance of further skin exposure to the allergen, in order to minimize the risk of developing contact dermatitis. Aim The main aim of this thesis project was to contribute to a scientific basis for preventive measures to reduce contact allergy and dermatitis. Skin sensitizing hair dye substances and preservatives in products frequently used by consumers were of special concern. Methods In study I and II, we assessed the occurrence and use pattern of skin sensitizing hair dye substances in hair dye products available to consumers in one Northern European country and one Southern European country, based on ingredient labeling. In study III, we examined if typographical design and the order of the list of ingredients could improve the readability of product ingredient labels. This was done by comparing the readability of original product labels versus alternative formats we developed, using several quantitative and qualitative measures. Study IV was an experimental clinical study, repeated open application test (ROAT), in which we examined whether permissible concentrations of the preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetic <b>rinse-off</b> <b>products</b> had the potential to elicit allergic contact dermatitis. Main findings In study I and II we showed that many different potent skin sensitizing hair dye substances are commonly used in oxidative hair dye products on the market and the products contain a “cocktail” of these sensitizers. In study III we showed that rather simple adjustments in the design of cosmetic product ingredient labels would improve their readability and understanding significantly. In study IV we showed that cosmetic <b>rinse-off</b> <b>products</b> preserved with 100 ppm or 50 ppm MI elicited allergic reactions in the majority of previously sensitized individuals...|$|E
40|$|Background: The rate {{of contact}} allergy and {{allergic}} contact dermatitis caused by methylisothiazolinone (MI) is dramatically increasing throughout Europe. Objectives: To report on methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI) /MI and MI allergy in Belgium. Patients and methods Between January 2010 and December 2012, the medical charts of 6599 patients of the Belgian Contact and Environmental Dermatitis Group were retrospectively reviewed for MCI/MI and MI sensitization by use of a standardized questionnaire. Available data on sensitization in 2081 patients tested in 2013 were also included. Results: In 2012, the sensitization rate for MCI/MI had increased to 4. 5 % and that for MI to 6. 0 %; the latter showed a further increase to 7. 2 % in 2013. The people mainly affected were women with a median age of 49 years with hand and/or facial dermatitis, most often resulting {{from the use of}} cosmetics. Simultaneous reactions to octylisothiazolinone were observed. Conclusion: A dramatic increase in the rate of contact allergy caused by MI in cosmetics is occurring in Belgium. Notwithstanding the recent recommendation to discontinue the use of MI in leave-on cosmetics, safer use concentrations should also be determined for <b>rinse-off</b> <b>products.</b> Close monitoring of MI sensitization in the near future will be necessary, and the highest test concentrations reported for MI and MCI/MI {{should be included in the}} baseline series...|$|E
40|$|In {{this part}} of a series of review {{articles}} on formaldehyde-releasers and their relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy, formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics are discussed. In this first part of the article, key data are presented including frequency of sensitization and of their use in cosmetics. In Europe, low frequencies of sensitization have been observed to all releasers: 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol 0. 4 - 1. 2 %, diazolidinyl urea 0. 5 - 1. 4 %, imidazolidinyl urea 0. 3 - 1. 4 %, quaternium- 15 0. 6 - 1. 9 % (for DMDM hydantoin no recent data are available). All releasers score (far) higher prevalences in the USA; the possible explanations for this are discussed. The relevance of positive patch test reactions has been insufficiently investigated. In the USA, approximately 20 % of cosmetics and personal care products (stay-on products: 17 %, <b>rinse-off</b> <b>products</b> 27 %) contain a formaldehyde-releaser. The use of quaternium- 15 is decreasing. For Europe, there are no comparable recent data available. In {{the second part of the}} article, the patch test relationship of the releasers in cosmetics to formaldehyde contact allergy will be reviewed and it will be assessed whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals who have contact allergy to formaldehyde...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the risks posed by {{cosmetic}} products {{can also be}} larger compared with other consumer products due to the following reasons: (1) Repeated exposure increases the hazard ([1] Annex VI Part 1 1.2. 1.), which is clearly the case for cosmetic products since {{many of them are}} used daily, such as tooth paste, soap or shower gel. (2) Cosmetic products are applied intentionally directly on the body surface and lead therefore to a higher exposure compared with most other consumer products. Leave-on products such as lotions or decorative cosmetics should be differentiated from <b>rinse-off</b> <b>products</b> such as shower gels or shampoos. (3) Most consumers use several cosmetic products, not only one single product everyday, which increases the exposure. (4) Solvents in cosmetic products increase fat solubility and therefore skin penetration. (5) Combined exposure of an allergen with a detergent e.g. in washing liquids can increase the allergic reaction [19]. (5) There are further interactions of substances, e.g. musk compounds are known to inhibit cellular xenobiotic export systems [17]. (6) Cross-reaction is known e.g. for some fragrances which are contact allergens [18, 19]. (7) Many ingredients are not stable, especially in light and at warm temperatures. The metabolites can be more toxic than the original compounds. An example for this case is D-Limonene with a low allergenic potency that can be oxidized by air to strong allergens [20 – 22]. Further examples are carcinogenic nitrosamines which can be contaminants or reaction products of triethanolamin and Cocamide DEA, frequently used components in decorative eye cosmetics [23]. Cosmetics have been demonstrated to be the cause of contact allergies and many of them contain acids, bases, inorganic salts, aldehydes, and surfactants, substances which can be corrosive or irritant at concentrations < 1 % and would need to be considered with special care according to the CLP Regulation ([1] 3.2. 3.3. 4.1). (9) Cosmetic products are mainly discharged via waste water. Therefore, their toxicity to aquatic organisms is of greater relevance than for many other consumer products. (10) The products under scrutiny here correspond to the Cosmetic Regulation [6]. However, not all products in the retail shops comply with the requirements laid down there. Many products have to be withdrawn from the market because the levels of hydroquinone, methyl metacrylate, carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, di-n-butyl-phthalate, di(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate or heavy metals were too high [24]. It {{is interesting to note that}} microbiological contamination is another frequent reason why cosmetic products need to be withdrawn [24].|$|E
