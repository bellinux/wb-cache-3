40|$|Biorefinery {{of rubber}} tree side streams could add {{economic}} value and income for farmers, who already grow the trees for latex production. The {{objective of this}} research was to design a process for the recovery of proteinaceous fractions from rubber tree. The aimed applications were expected to be suitable for local use, particularly in Indonesia, being one of the world’s largest rubber producers. Rubber seed was selected as a model biomass based on its availability (21 - 144 kg-protein/ha) and its oil content that enables the combination of protein and biodiesel productions within a biorefinery framework. Experimental works were focused on three parts: separation of protein and oil from rubber seed kernel, enzymatic hydrolysis of rubber <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> into amino acids, and separation of amino acids from hydrolysate. Using alkaline extraction, up to 80 % protein from the total original amount of protein in the kernel could be recovered in the extract, comparable to protein recoveries from other oilseeds and oilseed cakes. Seed type and pre-treatment had the most influence on protein recovery. Following protein extraction, the extracted proteins were recovered via isoelectric precipitation, resulting in rubber <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate</b> that can be used as such or can be processed further. Different protease combinations were used to hydrolyse rubber <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate.</b> After 24 h hydrolysis of rubber <b>seed</b> <b>protein,</b> up to 53 % degree of hydrolysis and 35 % protein recovery as free amino acids could be achieved. Combination of Pronase + Peptidase R resulted in the highest recovery and concentration of hydrophobic amino acids (phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, methionine, and proline) in the hydrolysate. Some hydrophobic amino acids are essential in human and farm animal diets, therefore they can potentially be applied as a group in food and feed. Ethanol was used as an anti-solvent for selective precipitation of amino acids. Ethanol was able to selectively increase the hydrophobic amino acid fraction in rubber <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> hydrolysate from 59 % (mol/mol) in the starting material to 76 % in the supernatant. Leucine and valine contributed most to this increase.

40|$|Protein {{hydrolysis}} enables {{production of}} peptides and {{free amino acids}} that are suitable for usage in food and feed or {{can be used as}} precursors for bulk chemicals. Several essential amino acids for food and feed have hydrophobic side chains; this property may also be exploited for subsequent separation. Here, we present methods for selective production of hydrophobic amino acids from proteins. Selectivity can be achieved by selection of starting material, selection of hydrolysis conditions, and separation of achieved hydrolysate. Several protease combinations were applied for hydrolysis of rubber <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrate,</b> wheat gluten, and bovine serum albumin (BSA). High degree of hydrolysis (> 50 %) could be achieved. Hydrophobic selectivity was influenced by the combination of proteases and by the extent of hydrolysis. Combination of Pronase and Peptidase R showed the highest selectivity towards hydrophobic amino acids, roughly doubling the content of hydrophobic amino acids in the products compared to the original substrates. Hydrophobic selectivity of 0. 6 mol-hydrophobic/mol-total free amino acids was observed after 6 h hydrolysis of wheat gluten and 24 h hydrolysis of rubber <b>seed</b> <b>proteins</b> and BSA.

Several plants {{for the production of}} rape methyl ester (RME, biodiesel) are in operation or under construction. Combustion properties have been studied for <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal produced as a by product to rape-methyl esther (RME, biodiesel). Composition of the material has been measured, using proximate and ultimate analysis. The lower heating value was 18. 2 ± 0, 3 MJ/kg d. w. and the ash content was 7 - 8 percent d. w. The material is rich in nitrogen and sulphur. Concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg are high in the fuel. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal was mixed with bark and pelletised. Bark pellets were also used as a reference fuel. Pellets with 10 and 30 percent <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal were produced. Material with 80 percent <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal and 20 percent planer shavings was also pelletised. Wood had to be added to provide enough friction in the pelletising process, with adapted equipment <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal could probably be easily pelletised). The material was studied using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and compared with data from tests with wood powder. The pyrolysis of the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal has a characteristic temperature of 320 oC. Devolatilisation starts at 150 oC (at a lower temperature than for wood powder), and proceeds within a rather wide temperature range. The probable cause is the difference in organic content, in particular protein content. The result does not suggest that the material will be difficult to ignite. Experiments in a bench-scale fluidised bed (5 kW) showed that pellets containing only bark, and the mixture <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal/wood had a bed agglomeration temperature well over the normal operational bed temperature. For the fuel mixtures <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal and bark, the agglomeration temperature was slightly over the operational temperature. Particle emissions from fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion were, the latter simulated using a commercial pellet burner, were roughly doubled with fuels containing <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal compared to bark. In the powder burner tests, particle emissions increased with a factor 17 with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal compared to wood powder. The emitted particles were mainly found in the fine (1 µm) and a fine mode fraction. The particles from grate combustion of bark contain mostly K, S, Na and Cl apart from oxygen and carbon. When <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal is present, Cl and Na concentrations decrease considerably and the main contents of the particles are K and S (and O and C). The results from the X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) analyses showed the presence of crystalline K 2 SO 4 och KCl. The fine particles (< 1 µm) from powder combustion contain mainly K, P and S. The only identified crystalline phase was K 2 SO 4, suggesting that most phosphorus was in the amorphous phase, i. d. most probably molten. The deposit formation on a cooled probe was studied during the fluidized bed and powder combustion experiments. The fine particles deposited during fluidised bed combustion contained K, Cl and S. When bark was combusted in the fluidised bed, the coarse fraction contained Ca and Si, when <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal in different mixes was combusted this changed to P, K, Ca and Mg. The deposits formed during combustion of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal in the powder burner were mainly made up of phosphates (Ca-, Mg/K-, Ca/Mg-phosphates) and MgO. Sintered material (slag) from grate combustion of bark contained mainly Si, Ca, K and Al, probably as silicates. Adding <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal tended to increase P, Ca and Mg while Si and Ca content tended to decrease. Through XRD a number o crystalline phases in the sintered material {{and the rest of the}} bottom ashes could be identified. NO emissions from the combustions tests increased two to four times with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal compared to typical wood fuels. For the fluidised bed test, SO 2 concentrations were rather high for the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal pellets (with 20 percent wood), still only about 20 percent of the sulphur in the fuel formed SO 2. For the grate combustion and powder burner combustion, 60 percent and 70 percent of the sulphur respectively formed SO 2. HCl emissions were low for all tests. The rather high emissions of NOx and SOx mean that the material should be used in large-scale facilities with external SOx and NOx cleaning. In smaller facilities, the material may be used in small amounts mixed with other fuels. The risk of slagging is not very high, and should not rule out grate combustion of pellets with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal mixed with other fuels. The risk of corrosion of superheater surfaces during combustion is probably low since the smaller-size particles formed at fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion contain K 2 SO 4. However, a large fraction of the particles formed in powder burner combustion probably contains low temperature melting K 2 PO 4, making the risk for deposit formation significant. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal for powder burner applications should be used with care. The content of phosphorus in the material may be an advantage when mixes of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal and other fuels are considered. The high affinity between potassium and phosphorus means that more sulphur in the fuel will be available for sulphatising of any KC. (formed from combustion of many forest and agricultural fuels). Use of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal as a sulphur containing additive could thus be an option. For grate combustion and fluidised bed combustion, addition of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal may reduce the risk of slagging and bed agglomeration, respectively. Full scale tests in fluidised beds or grate combustors with problematic biofuels (containing Cl and K) would be useful to test whether ash-reduced operational problems could be reduced through the addition of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal. Effektiva värmevärdet hos rapsmjöl är 18, 2 +/- 0, 3 MJ/kg TS och askhalten varierar mellan 7 - 8 %. Bränslet har högt N- och S-innehåll, och bränslet är rikt på K, P, Ca och Mg. Partikelemissionerna från fluidbäddseldning och rosterförbränning med rapsmjölsblandningar var ungefär dubbelt så höga som från barkförbränning. Vid pulverförbränning av rapsmjöl ökade partikelemissionerna med en faktor 17 jämfört med träpulver. De höga NOx och SOx emissionerna från rapsmjölsförbränning innebär att materialet bör utnyttjas i storskaliga anläggningar med extern svavel. - eller NO-rening, eller i relativt låga inblandningsgrader i andra bränslen.

These vitamins, however, didn't have any effect on safflower germination. Hydrogen peroxide strongly increased safflower germination. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine decreased catalase activity in sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> whereas hydrogen peroxide increased it. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine prevented protein degradation and lipid peroxidation in germinated seeds. Consequently, we understand that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine can increase sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination and stimulate rate of growth. Also safflower germination increased due to germination inhibitor oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, this report shows that oil seeds treated with ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide remarkably increase the capacity of germination. We suggest that treatments with such substances can improve the old oil seed germination during storage...|$|R

In the light of our developing knowl-edge of thyroid physiology, the present data suggest that <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil meal should not be fed to young growing animals as a high protein feed as it would tend to de-press the thyroid hormone secretion and the growth rate.

Key process step is mechanical {{expression of the}} oil from the feed material, e. g. <b>rape</b> <b>seed.</b> A new process for enhanced pressing of oil-seeds was designed and realized in pilot scale. The novelty is the additional use of pressurized gasses in screw-pressing which can modify oil yield as well as oil and cake properties. Uniaxial gas-assisted pressing enhances oil yield significantly, but a pilot screw press with pressure housing did not so far...|$|R

40|$|Replacement {{of fossil}} fuels by <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil and <b>rape</b> straw saves about 3 tonnes of CO_ 2 {{emissions}} per hectare and year: replacement of mineral oil/gas/hard coal by <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil saves 1 tonne of CO_ 2 per hectare and year; replacement by straw saves 2 tonnes of CO_ 2 per hectare and year. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil is biologically degradable. Therefore it has advantages both as an industrial feedstock and as a lubricating and hydraulic fluid in all environmentally sensitive areas. Given the current price structure of fossil energy feedstocks, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil cultivation and use as a fuel needs subsidies {{in order to be}} competitive. 50 per cent grants on investment costs for plants using biofuel lead to the following maximum increase in real net output per 100 000 DM of grant from the cultivation and utilization of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil: plants for cold pressing of rape oil: recultivation of 200 hectares of fallow farmland; burning of whole plants: recultivation of 20 hectares of farmland.

40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{deals with}} {{small-scale}} extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> {{oil and the}} use of this oil in an Elsbett engine tractor. Small-scale extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil was studied in practical tests in the laboratory at Ultuna, Uppsala. The influence of the speed of the press screw, nozzle size and nozzle performance, the distance between the press screw and the press chamber head, the ambient temperature, and preheating of the seed with air was studied. At Sjösa farm a small plant for on-farm extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil was built. The processing of three bigger batches of oil seed was studied. Data of interest were registered in an operating log. Capacity and oil extraction efficiency were studied. A tractor with an Elsbett engine was operated at Sjösa farm on the processed <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil. Data of interest were registered in an operating log and with an automatic data collection system. The data obtained on the farm were used to conduct an energy analysis. The oil press has higher capacity with bigger nozzles and higher screw speeds. However, the amount of oil extracted from each seed increased if the nozzles were smaller and/or the press screw speed was lower. Nozzles with a long press nozzle channel gave a more solid meal. It was important that the temperature in the press chamber head reached a temperature of about 70 °C. The optimum seed moisture content (wet basis) was 7 - 8 per cent. Preheating with air usually improved the capacity, but there is a risk of over-drying so it must be done with care. Preheated seed involves a risk of getting too high levels of phosphorus in the oil. On the farm, the simplest way of cleaning the oil is settling. This can be done in three series-coupled sedimentation tanks. If the ambient temperature is + 20 °C and the settling height is 0. 6 m, about 18 days are needed for the settling. A tractor with an Elsbett engine can be operated almost {{in the same way as}} a conventional tractor. The differences are <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil fuel, separate starting fuel, more frequent fuel filter exchange, electrical heating of the fuel system and about 10 per cent higher fuel consumption. Problems may occur when the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil stiffens at - 15 °C. To obtain a good energy balance it is important to have a high yield and low moisture contents. It is important also to have uses for the meal and straw. Direct seeding also improves the energy balance. The main conclusion of the project is that a system involving <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil and the Elsbett engine works well technically. The system is not, however, competitive as there are cheap fossil fuels on the market, and the Elsbett engine has not yet entered serial production. In addition, the supply of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil in Sweden is limited, and the oil produced could be used for better purposes than as vehicle fuel...|$|R
