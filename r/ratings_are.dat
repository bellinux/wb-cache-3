Furthermore, they found that participants showed an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> valuable to MovieLens subgroups than when <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> valuable to the entire MovieLens online community, and participants demonstrated an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> valuable to individuals who liked similar movie genres as the participant than when <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> valuable to individuals who liked dissimilar movie genres as the participant.
