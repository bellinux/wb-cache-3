The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar.

Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love.

50|$|Delaware Dynasty {{entered the}} PDL in 2006 as an {{expansion}} franchise under head coach Matt Okoh. Things began superbly {{for the new}} boys, enjoying a comprehensive 5-1 victory over Vermont Voltage on {{the opening day of}} the season that featured a hat trick from Nigerian striker Oluwafemi Badejo; unfortunately for Delaware, things never carried on from this auspicious opening. They lost four of their next five matches (including a 7-2 hammering {{at the hands of the}} Rhode Island Stingrays), and struggled to regain their form for much of the rest of the season. They beat Westchester Flames 3-2 at home in early June, and enjoyed a 3-2 revenge win over Rhode Island shortly thereafter, but finished the season with five losses in their final seven games, including a 3-1 defeat on the <b>road</b> at Reading <b>Rage,</b> and a hard-fought 3-2 defeat to Vermont on the final day of the season which gave the New Englanders recompense for their opening-day humiliation. Dynasty finished their freshman year fourth in the Northeast Division, fourteen points behind divisional champions Westchester, and well out of the playoffs.

5000|$|A {{peculiar}} mantle ("idra"-according to Levy, [...] "Neuhebr. Wörterb." [...] i. 32, a sword) {{belongs to}} the equipment of the Angel of Death (Eccl. R. iv. 7). The Angel of Death takes on the particular form which will best serve his purpose; e.g., he appears to a scholar {{in the form of}} a beggar imploring pity (The beggar should receive Tzedakah.)(M. Ḳ. 28a). [...] "When pestilence rages in the town, walk not in the middle of the street, because the Angel of Death pestilence strides there; if peace reigns in the town, walk not on the edges of the <b>road.</b> When pestilence <b>rages</b> in the town, go not alone to the synagogue, because there the Angel of Death stores his tools. If the dogs howl, the Angel of Death has entered the city; if they make sport, the prophet Elijah has come" [...] (B. Ḳ. 60b). The [...] "destroyer" [...] (saṭan ha-mashḥit) in the daily prayer is the Angel of Death (Ber. 16b). Midr. Ma'ase Torah (compare Jellinek, [...] "B. H."

Baz was apparently acting out of revenge for the Hebron massacre of 29 Palestinian Muslims by Baruch Goldstein {{that had taken place}} a few days earlier on February 25, 1994. Baz was convicted of murder and sentenced to a 141-year prison term.

25|$|A <b>road</b> <b>rage</b> {{incident}} {{on the side}} of the highway led to the death of Richard Aderson in 1997. Aderson, an assistant superintendent at the Valley Central School District in Montgomery, was returning to his LaGrange home on the evening of February5, 1997, when he had a minor collision with a relatively new green Jeep Cherokee carrying what appeared to be New Hampshire license plates just before crossing the NewburghBeacon Bridge. The two drivers pulled over near exit12, and after a brief argument the other driver shot Aderson and left the scene. Aderson was able to give the 9-1-1 operator he called on his cell phone a description of his assailant and the vehicle before dying at the scene. A police sketch based on Aderson's description has been widely circulated and is still posted prominently in kiosks at the freeway's rest areas.

The developers felt that everything else needed a new approach, while only the driving portion of <b>Road</b> <b>Rage</b> was worth keeping; in Hit & Run, enhanced traffic artificial intelligence is introduced, which makes computer-controlled vehicles react better to the player's driving. The developers also decided to add an exploration element to the game to make players {{get out of the car}} and navigate the area on foot, so that the game offered a better experience of Springfield.|$|E
500|$|<b>Road</b> <b>Rage</b> is a {{new game}} mode in which the player must achieve {{a certain number of}} Takedowns in a preset time limit or before their vehicle is totaled.

When a set number of vehicles become involved in the pileup, a Crashbreaker is unlocked which allows the player to detonate their vehicle to cause further damage Cash bonuses, score multipliers, a speed boost, or an immediate Crashbreaker can be obtained by driving through power-ups that lie on track in Crash mode.

500|$|Irving {{was dismayed}} by the storyline which saw Meyer shot in a <b>road</b> <b>rage</b> incident, {{describing}} filming the scenes as an [...] "unpleasant experiences", the worst aspect being that Meyer loses his spleen {{as a result of}} his injuries. Of the later storyline which sees Meyer investigated by Tom Campbell-Gore on behalf of the hospital Board, Denis Lawson explained: [...] " [...] actually rather fancies Meyer's job but if he finds against him in the investigation he cannot get the job because it's a conflict of interest. So he has to play a rather clever game, which he does." [...] On taking over as head of the cardiothoracic surgery department, he commented: [...] "George is fantastic in the show, but obviously I'm going to do something very, very different, so I don't feel that I'm stepping into his shoes." ...|$|E

[...] He deemed Meyer one of the series' two major assets, alongside Siobhan Redmond as paediatrician Janice Taylor, and criticised the opening episode of series four, in which Meyer is shot in a <b>road</b> <b>rage</b> incident, believing that Meyer was [...] "wasted" [...] in spending [...] "most of a wearisome hour-long show under the knife". Jim Shelley of The Mirror similarly hoped for Meyer to [...] "get well soon and resuscitate the series."
