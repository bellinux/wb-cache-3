When Goofy gets a date with her, he rushes off to tell Max only to interfere with Max's practice; the result is Bradley Uppercrust III, leader of the Gammas, perceiving Goofy's clumsy antics on Max's skateboard for skill, offers him membership to the Gammas. Max encourages his father to join, viewing it as an opportunity to escape Goofy for a while.

5000|$|It was {{generally}} {{believed that it}} was Lady Astor who, during a World War II speech, first referred to the men of the 8th Army who were fighting in the Italian campaign as the [...] "D-Day Dodgers". Observers thought she was suggesting they were avoiding the [...] "real war" [...] in France and the future invasion. The Allied soldiers in Italy were so incensed that Major Hamish Henderson of the 51st Highland Division composed a bitingly sarcastic song to the tune of the popular German song [...] "Lili Marleen" [...] (popularised in English by Marlene Dietrich), called [...] "The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers".

The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact, and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on 7 March 1945.

5000|$|The {{song was}} written in November 1944 by Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the <b>Tank</b> <b>Rescue</b> Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade, who was with the 78th Infantry Division just south of Bologna, Italy. There were many {{variations}} on verses and even the chorus, but the song generally and sarcastically referred to how easy their life in Italy was. There {{was no mention of}} Lady Astor in the original lyrics. Actually, many Allied personnel in Italy had reason to be bitter, as the bulk of material support for the Allied armies went to Northwest Europe after the invasion of Normandy. They also noted sardonically that they had participated in several [...] "D-days" [...] of their own before the landings in Normandy became popularly known as [...] "D-Day". The expression was used to refer to any military operation, but the popular press turned it into an expression synonymous with the Normandy landings only. Italian campaign veterans noted that they had been in action for eleven months before the Normandy D-Day, and some of those had served in North Africa even before that.|$|R
40|$|This paper applies our {{developed}} novice users oriented {{force feedback}} steering wheel interface and mouse interface to navigating a <b>tank</b> type <b>rescue</b> robot. By analyzing merits and limitation of operating each interface, we propose a combined navigation strategy {{by the two}} interfaces. The steering wheel interface consists of a force feedback steering control and a six monitors’ wall. Through this interface, users can navigate the tank robot like driving cars, while watching incoming videos. It provides a daily life operation method for novice users to navigate the <b>tank</b> <b>rescue</b> robot. The steering wheel interface is efficient in exploring open areas. For complex disaster fields, this interface requires users have skillful operation experiences, which take them more attention. The mouse-screen interface consists of a mouse and a camera’s view displayed in a computer screen. Through this interface, users can navigate the tank robot just by mouse clicking. Path planning and low-level controlling are realized by system automatically. The mouse-screen interface can realize exact navigation, especially needed in complex structures, without taking much attention. It gives users more time to care incoming information. The two interfaces can shift into each other at any time. The combined navigation strategy adopts merits of the two interfaces and compensates limitation of each of them. It provides an efficient operation method for novice users to navigate rescue robots. </p...|$|R
