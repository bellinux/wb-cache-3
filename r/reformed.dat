5|$|In <b>Reformed</b> theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. <b>Reformed</b> confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of <b>Reformed</b> churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The <b>Reformed</b> doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{increasingly}} {{recognized the importance}} of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli in the early formation of the <b>Reformed</b> tradition. Richard Muller, a chief authority on the development of this movement, has argued that Vermigli, Wolfgang Musculus, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not more influential than Calvin on the development of <b>Reformed</b> theology in the sixteenth century. Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as <b>Reformed</b> orthodoxy. In the <b>Reformed</b> orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematized. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of scholastic theology and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli {{was the first of the}} <b>Reformed</b> scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.|$|E

5|$|Early <b>Reformed</b> theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later <b>Reformed</b> orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises.

5|$|From {{the end of}} {{the sixteenth}} century through the eighteenth century, a period known as <b>Reformed</b> orthodoxy, <b>Reformed</b> baptismal {{theology}} further developed the covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of <b>Reformed</b> Baptists. <b>Reformed</b> Baptist theologians had much in common with the <b>Reformed,</b> but saw baptism {{as a sign of the}} baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.|$|E
5|$|Later <b>Reformed</b> theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish <b>Reformed</b> theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German <b>Reformed</b> liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. <b>Reformed</b> churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E
5|$|Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 149912 November 1562) was an Italian-born <b>Reformed</b> theologian. His {{early work}} as a {{reformer}} in Catholic medieval Italy and decision to flee for Protestant northern Europe influenced many other Italians to convert and flee as well. In England, he influenced the Edwardian Reformation, including the Eucharistic service of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. He was considered an authority on the Eucharist among the <b>Reformed</b> churches, and engaged in controversies on the subject by writing treatises. Vermigli's Loci Communes, a compilation of excerpts from his biblical commentaries organized by the topics of systematic theology, became a standard <b>Reformed</b> theological textbook.|$|E

Three main questions oriented the research: why <b>reform?</b> what kind of <b>reform?</b> and, how well did the <b>reform</b> perform? The main {{focus is on the}} pro-market <b>reforms</b> as they have been summarized in the so-called Washington Consensus, but the paper also deals with political <b>reform</b> and the consolidation of democracy. The general goal is to understand <b>reform</b> in a broad economic and political sense. The study is not just aimed at assessing the <b>reforms</b> implemented, but rather to understand why the market-friendly <b>reforms</b> moved faster in some areas than in others, who promoted and who opposed <b>reform,</b> how the political process shaped the <b>reform,</b> and how well the <b>reform</b> performed.

5|$|The Assembly was {{a product}} of the British <b>Reformed</b> tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the {{theology}} of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European <b>Reformed</b> tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental <b>Reformed</b> theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the <b>Reformed</b> Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the <b>Reformed</b> doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to <b>Reformed</b> covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the <b>Reformed</b> confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Reformed</b> {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of <b>Reformed</b> churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language <b>Reformed</b> confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. <b>Reformed</b> orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E

5|$|Twentieth-century <b>Reformed</b> theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the <b>Reformed</b> belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace.

Another twentieth-century <b>Reformed</b> theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith.

Originally a German-speaking congregation, its documents and religious services were in German until 1821 (an early transition to English for a German denomination in the United States).
