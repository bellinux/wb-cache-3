The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an ex gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E

It has been estimated that a person {{infected with}} hepatitis C in the United States will result in a monthly cost of $691. That number nearly doubles to $1,227 for people with compensated (stable) cirrhosis, while the monthly cost of people with decompensated (worsening) cirrhosis is almost five times as large at $3,682. The wide-ranging effects of hepatitis make it difficult to estimate indirect costs, but studies have speculated that the total cost is $6.5 billion annually in the United States.

When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the University and that, hitherto, lectures by visiting scholars had been free-of-charge, Friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free-of-charge in a meaningful sense: lectures always have <b>related</b> <b>costs.</b> What mattered was whether attendees or non-attendees covered those costs.

500|$|In Enron's {{natural gas}} business, the {{accounting}} had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying {{the gas and}} actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent [...] "true economic value." [...] Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as {{the present value of}} net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, [...] "If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income." [...] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.|$|E

However, Schultz's poverty plea fell on universally deaf ears, even after his associates began making threats of violence if any serious resistance developed. The runners and controllers hired a hall, held a mass protest meeting, and declared a strike of sorts. Suddenly, fewer and fewer bets were being delivered to the banks, reducing the vast policy inflow to a mere trickle as Schultz's street soldiers lost their zeal. Schultz was forced to back down and restore the status quo, but he had already permanently damaged his relationships with his underlings.|$|E

40|$|A Split System Approach (SSA) based {{methodology}} {{is presented}} to assist in making optimal Preventive Maintenance decisions for serial production lines. The methodology treats a production line as a complex series system with multiple PM actions over multiple intervals. Both risk <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> and maintenance <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> are factored into the methodology as either deterministic or random variables. This SSA based methodology enables Asset Management (AM) decisions to be optimized considering {{a variety of factors}} including failure probability, failure cost, maintenance cost, PM performance, and the type of PM strategy. The application of this new methodology and an evaluation of the effects of these factors on PM decisions are demonstrated using an example. The results of this work show that the performance of a PM strategy can be measured by its Total Expected Cost Index (TECI). The optimal PM interval is dependent on TECI, PM performance and types of PM strategies. These factors are interrelated. Generally it was found that a trade-off between reliability and the number of PM actions needs to be made so that one can minimize Total Expected Cost (TEC) for asset maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Water {{emission}} trading (WET) {{is promising}} in sustainable development strategy. However, low participation impedes its development. We develop an evolutionary game model of two enterprise populations’ dynamics {{and stability in}} the decision-making behavior process. Due to the different perceived value of certain permits, enterprises choose H strategy (bidding for permit) or D strategy (not bidding). External factors are simplified according to three categories: rH-bidding <b>related</b> <b>cost,</b> G-price and F-penalty. Participation increase equals reaching point (H,H) in the model and is treated as an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). We build a system dynamics model on AnyLogic 7. 1. 1 to simulate the aforementioned game and draw four conclusions: (1) to reach ESS more quickly, we need to minimize the bidding <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> rH and price G, but regulate the heavy penalty F; (2) an ESS can be significantly transformed, such as from (D,D) to (H,H) by regulating rH, G and F accordingly; (3) the initial choice of strategy is essential to the final result; (4) if participation seems stable but unsatisfying, it is important to check whether it is a saddle point and adjust external factors accordingly. The findings benefit both water management practice and further research...|$|R
