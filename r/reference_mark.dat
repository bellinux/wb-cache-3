40|$|A {{method to}} obtain the {{absolute}} measure of the position is {{by means of the}} autocorrelation of two zero <b>reference</b> <b>marks.</b> In one-axis measurement systems one dimensional mark are used and the design of these marks is relatively complex. When the movement is in two-axes, two dimensional <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> are required and they are even harder to design. We report a method of global optimization to calculate the optimal two dimensional zero <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> which generate the reference signal with the highest central peak. This method proves to be a powerful tool for solving this problem...|$|R
2500|$|Michelson and Morley {{and other}} early experimentalists using {{interferometric}} techniques {{in an attempt}} to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used (partially) monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Purely monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even when the interferometer was set up in a basement. Because the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations caused by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, an observer could easily [...] "get lost" [...] when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. As Dayton Miller wrote, [...] "White light fringes were chosen for the observations because they consist {{of a small group of}} fringes having a central, sharply defined black fringe which forms a permanent zero <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> for all readings." [...] Use of partially monochromatic light (yellow sodium light) during initial alignment enabled the researchers to locate the position of equal path length, more or less easily, before switching to white light.|$|E
50|$|Most incremental, linear {{encoders}} {{can produce}} an index or <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> pulse providing a datum position along the scale for use at power-up or following {{a loss of}} power.

5000|$|In the U.S., {{a survey}} disk is usually {{engraved}} {{with the name}} of the agency that placed it. The name of the mark (or the [...] "station" [...] it locates) is usually stamped into its surface, along with the date on which it was set (or re-set, since markers that have been destroyed can be replaced). Disks marked with a triangle are known as [...] "triangulation station disks," [...] since they mark the position of the primary point used for triangulation (or map-making). Disks marked with an arrow are called <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (RMs), since they point (or [...] "refer") to the principal station that may be located many feet away. A triangulation station often had two or three <b>reference</b> <b>marks.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>marks</b> were set to enable the primary station to be re-established (or re-set) if needed.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> in texts written by Dutch deaf {{children and adults}} who differed in sign language proficiency. The temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> systems in Dutch and Sign Language of the Netherlands (SLN) differ substantially, with Dutch having {{a wide range of}} lexical and morphological markers of temporal reference, and SLN relying on lexical <b>marking</b> of temporal <b>reference.</b> The results showed that the youngest proficient signers had difficulties with tense morphology: they avoided the marked past tense form in narratives and omitted verbs, but showed no problems with lexical <b>marking</b> of temporal <b>reference.</b> In the older proficient signing writers, verb morphology emerged, and in proficient signing adults temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> resembled that of the hearing adults. This study shows that in order to gain more insight into deaf people's writing, it is important to adopt a bilingual perspective and take variations in sign language proficiency into account...|$|R
50|$|Many linear {{encoders}} interpolate the analogue sine/cosine {{signals in}} order to sub-divide the scale period, providing a higher measurement resolution. The output of the interpolation process is quadrature squarewaves - the distance between edges of the two channels being {{the resolution of the}} encoder. The <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> or index pulse will also be processed digitally and will be a pulse, usually one to four units-of-resolution wide.|$|E
50|$|Traversing is {{a common}} method of {{surveying}} smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> or known position and places a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.|$|E

5000|$|Geodetic survey markers {{were often}} set in groups. For example, in {{triangulation}} surveys, the primary point identified {{was called the}} triangulation station, or the [...] "main station". It was often marked by a [...] "station disk" [...] (see upper photo at left), a brass disk with a triangle inscribed on its surface and an impressed mark that indicated the precise point over which a surveyor's plumb-bob should be dropped to assure a precise location over it. A triangulation station was often surrounded by several (usually three) <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (see second photo at left), each of which bore an arrow that pointed back towards the main station. These <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> {{made it easier for}} later visitors to [...] "recover" [...] (or re-find) the primary ("station") <b>mark.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>marks</b> also made it possible to replace (or reset) a station mark that had been disturbed or destroyed.|$|R

50|$|A {{stereoscopic}} {{range finder}} uses two eyepieces and {{relies on the}} operator's visual cortex to merge the two images into a single picture. A <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> is separately inserted into each eyepiece. The operator first adjusts {{the direction of the}} range finder so that the fixed mark is centered on the target, and then the prisms are rotated until the mark appears to overlap in the operator's combined view. Again the range to the target is proportional to the degree of rotation of the prisms.|$|E
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} to assure that a found disk is the one {{described}} on the data sheet, so as to avoid false reports. A <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> may be mistakenly reported as the station mark. A disk set in 1945 may be confused with a similarly named disk that was set in 1946 by a different agency, and so on. A RESET elevation benchmark should not be reported as the original. Sorting out these differences and reporting them correctly {{is an important part of}} the hobby.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} the first {{hotel in the}} district was built by the Gustavus Hamilton (father of Messrs. F. G. Hamilton, barrister, and R. Hamilton, surveyor). Amongst the earlier lessees of the hotel was a Mrs. Warren, who, by coincidence, married another Mr. Hamilton, so that the hotel was occupied by different families of the name Hamilton.

40|$|A {{new method}} for 3 -D shape {{registration}} of prismatic objects is presented. The term prismatic object denotes any object with sharp boundaries on its surface. These kinds of objects cannot be correctly registered with typical existing methods, which require smooth overlapping {{of the whole}} surface. The method presented here {{is based on the}} use of <b>reference</b> <b>marks,</b> placed on a planar glass plate that is attached to the prismatic object. Two 3 -D range measurements of the object are then acquired, before and after rotating the object by approximately 180 deg. Using the <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> on the glass and two different calibrations of the 3 -D range scanning system, these two range measurements can be correctly merged to provide a full 3 -D range scan of the prismatic object...|$|R

5000|$|An obelus (symbol: ÷ or †, plural: obeluses or obeli) is {{a symbol}} {{consisting}} of a short horizontal line with a dot above and below, and in other uses it {{is a symbol}} resembling a small dagger. In mathematics it is mainly used to represent the mathematical operation of division. It is therefore commonly called the division sign. Division may also be indicated by a horizontal line (fraction bar) or a slash. In ISO 80000-2-9.6 (about division) it says, [...] "The symbol ÷ should not be used."
