5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with <b>real</b> <b>money</b> within the game.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} new simple {{theoretical}} framework for understanding the sterilisation of foreign exchange intervention within a monetary policy framework where a short-term interest rate is the main policy instrument. Another aim is to carry out new empirical analysis that compares and contrasts the effects of intervention on base money growth with its effects on broad money growth, and to investigate if these effects are associated with common country characteristics in terms of the nature of intervention, balance of payments flows and monetary policy frameworks. Using a portfolio balance model and simple balance sheet constraints, it is shown that base money sterilisation does not imply broad money sterilisation. Incomplete broad money sterilisation, when intervention is a positive money supply shock, leads to looser monetary and financial conditions, even as base money growth is completely sterilised in an interest rate-targeting framework. With a progressively lower degree of broad money sterilisation, the policy interest rate in an optimal monetary policy reaction function needs to respond more strongly to the exogenous factors affecting the output gap and inflation. The empirical analyses of the contemporaneous and long-run effects of real intervention on <b>real</b> base <b>money</b> growth and <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth are carried out using multivariate autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) regressions for individual countries. These regressions include controls for demand factors. The focus on a reasonably large sample of 30 countries, with individual country heterogeneity taken into account, and the emphasis on broad money sterilisation represent a clear departure from existing empirical literature. The empirical results reveal that on average, the real intervention effect on <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth is higher than and disconnected from the effect on <b>real</b> base <b>money</b> growth. The baseline group average short-run and long-run coefficients are 0. 122 and 0. 496 respectively for <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth and 0. 075 and 0. 111 respectively for <b>real</b> base <b>money</b> growth (excluding outliers, Egypt and Taiwan, in both instances). With regard to the relevance of country characteristics, a general lack of statistical significance is observed across mean and median equality tests and bivariate regressions. This is not unexpected with regard to real intervention effects on <b>real</b> base <b>money</b> growth, but indicates that the real intervention effects are very much country-specific in the case of <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth. In particular, {{there is no evidence of}} a difference in real intervention effects on <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth between inflation-targeting and non-inflation-targeting countries. The short-run and long-run real intervention effects on <b>real</b> base <b>money</b> growth are found to be robustly associated with differences in capital account openness although these differences are not of a monotonic nature. Meanwhile, the short-run real intervention effects on <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth have a positive, monotonic association with current account surpluses and concurrently a negative monotonic association with capital account surpluses. On the other hand, the long-run real intervention effects on <b>real</b> broad <b>money</b> growth do not appear to be robustly linked to any particular country characteristic in a statistically significant manner. A key implication of the thesis is that broad money sterilisation matters, not base money sterilisation, in understanding how balance of payments flows and intervention permeate the economy. Complete broad money sterilisation, however rarely occurs. Furthermore, regardless of the degree, broad money sterilisation, seen as a blunt instrument, may have unpredictable and undesirable effects, owing to uncertainties over money demand and money supply shocks, and mismatches in asset demand and supply. The model presented provides a framework for understanding the continued reliance on measures such as prudential policies and restrictions on capital flows in dealing with financial imbalances; this despite seemingly successful sterilisation by way of the containment of base money growth.

25|$|Many MMORPGS such as RuneScape, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Warhammer Online, Lord of the Rings Online and Final Fantasy XI {{strictly}} prohibit buying gold, items, or {{any other}} product linked with the game, with real world cash.

To control <b>real</b> <b>money</b> trading, EVE Online created an official and sanctioned method to convert real world cash to in-game currency; players can use real world money to buy a specific in-game item which can be redeemed for account subscription time or traded on the in-game market for in-game currency.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{secondary}} market {{is unlikely to}} have followed {{the growth of the}} primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as World of Warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player <b>real</b> <b>money</b> trading. Also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland China targeting the global secondary market. Furthermore, the global decline in consumption that followed the financial crisis of 2007–2008 would have affected {{the secondary}} market negatively as well. Post 2007 secondary market growth is likely localized to emerging markets such as Russia, eastern Europe, South America, and South East Asia - all of which are relatively inaccessible to international merchants due to payment systems, advertisement channels and language barrier.

25|$|To help users {{protect their}} Battle.net accounts, Blizzard {{implemented}} a two-factor authentication {{option for the}} service. Launched in 2008, this was initially through a separate device that could be purchased from Blizzard, encoded with the user's credentials.

Later, Blizzard introduced the Battle.net mobile application for iOS and Android platforms in 2009, replicating the same functionality. An update during June 2016 simplified the process, allowing the user, when logging into their Battle.net account from a computer, to simply press a single button on their connected mobile device to affirm their authenticity.
