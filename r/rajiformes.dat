To obtain a comprehensive view of the feeding ecology of these species, we combined different approaches: stable isotope analyses (delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 values), stomach content analyses and published sources. Our results revealed differences in feeding strategies among elasmobranch groups: skates (<b>Rajiformes)</b> mainly consume crustaceans; sharks (Carcharhiniformes, Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes and Lamniformes) prefer mixed diets composed of cephalopods, crustaceans and fishes; electric rays (Torpediniformes) feed mostly on fishes; and the diet of stingrays (Myliobatiformes) varies between species. Sharks and electric rays show higher trophic positions than skates, and the former occupy similar positions to other apex predators. Skates are more similar to other mesopredator fishes.

40|$|Cartilaginous {{fish are}} very ancient organisms. In the Antarctic sea, the modern chondrichthyan genera are poorly represented, {{with only three}} species of sharks and eight species of skates; the paucity of chondrichthyans is {{probably}} an ecological consequence of unusual trophic or habitat conditions in the Southern Ocean. In the Arctic, there are 26 species belonging to the class Chondrichthyes. Fish in the two polar regions {{have been subjected to}} different regional histories that have influenced the development of diversity: Antarctic marine organisms are highly stenothermal, in response to stable water temperatures, whereas the Arctic communities are exposed to seasonal temperature variations. The structure and function of the oxygen-transport haem protein from the Antarctic skate Bathyraja eatonii and from the Arctic skate Raja hyperborea (both of the subclass Elasmobranchii, order <b>Rajiformes,</b> family Rajidae) is reported in the present paper. These species have a single major haemoglobin (Hb 1; over 80 % of the total). The Bohr-proton and the organophosphate-binding sites are absent. Thus the haemoglobins of northern and southern polar skates appear functionally similar, whereas differences were observed with several temperate elasmobranchs.

40|$|Interspecific {{variation}} in relative brain size (encephalization), the relative {{size of the}} five major brain areas (the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, cerebellum, and medulla) {{and the level of}} cerebellar foliation was assessed in over 20 representative species of batoid (skates and rays), from eight families. Using species as independent data points and phylogenetically independent contrasts, relationships among each of the neuroanatomical variables and two ecological variables, habitat and lifestyle, were assessed. Variation in relative brain size and brain organization appears to be strongly correlated with phylogeny. Members of the basal orders <b>Rajiformes</b> and Torpediniformes tend to have relatively small brains, with relatively small telencephalons, large medullas, and smooth, unfoliated cerebellums. More advanced Myliobatiformes possess relatively large brains, with relatively large telencephalons, small medullas, and complex, heavily foliated cerebellums. Increased brain size, telencephalon size, and cerebellar foliation also correlate with living in a complex habitat (such as in association with coral reefs) and an active, benthopelagic lifestyle, but as primary habitat and lifestyle also closely match phylogenetic relationships in batoids, it is difficult to separate the influence of phylogeny and ecological factors on brain organization in these animals. However, the results of two forms of multivariate analysis (principal component analysis and cluster analysis) reveal that certain species are clustered with others that share ecological traits, rather than with more closely related species from the same order. This suggests that ecological factors do play a role in defining patterns of brain organization and there is some evidence for 2 ̆ 7 cerebrotypes 2 ̆ 7 in batoids...|$|E
40|$|The order <b>Rajiformes,</b> or skates, is a morphologically {{conservative}} {{group that}} exhibits {{a wide range}} of life history characteristics. This inter-species variability warrants species-specific research. This study investigates the age, growth, reproduction, and habitat of the Starry Skate, Raja stellulata, which is endemic to the U. S. West Coast. Age and growth parameters were determined using two preparation techniques: gross sectioning and histological sectioning. The assumption that gross sections deposit one band pair a year was indirectly validated with centrum edge analysis and marginal increment ratio. It was not indirectly validated with histological sections. Age estimates from gross sections ranged from 0 to 11 years, and growth was best described by the two parameter von Bertalanffy growth function in which L∞ = 865 mm TL and k = 0. 15. Age estimates from histological sections ranged from 0 to 15 years, and growth was best described by the Gompertz function in which L∞ = 845 mm TL, g = 0. 15, and k = 1. 53. Histological section results are recommended for describing growth of R. stellulata because the longevity is more conservative. Raja stellulata exhibits year-round reproduction and attains 50 % maturity at 632 mm TL, and 11. 2 years old for females and 603 mm TL, and 11. 5 years for males.

40|$|A "snapshot" of the fish-habitat {{associations}} {{in the vicinity}} of James Price Point was obtained during a single expedition in October 2009, when Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) were deployed in coastal waters to survey the demersal and semi-demersal ichthyofauna. A total of 7108 individuals from 116 species of fishes, sharks, rays and sea snakes were recorded from 154 sites. Bony fishes were represented by 8 orders, and cartilaginous fishes were well represented by the Carcharhiniformes, <b>Rajiformes</b> and Orectolobiformes. There were 2 species of hydrophiid sea snakes. Multivariate analysis showed that species responded to the amount of epibenthic cover in the study area and that there was an interaction between depth and sediment composition, as well as depth and epibenthic cover, in defining four fish assemblages to the north and south of James Price Point. Diversity appeared to increase with depth amongst these assemblages. The sandy seabed offshore from James Price Point was inhabited by a "deep sandy" fish assemblage, which intruded inshore across the study area, and was characterised by the presence of ponyfish (Leiognathus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus) and queenfish (Scomberoides). On either side were shallow, northern and deeper, southern, assemblages inhabiting "gardens" of macroalgae, filter-feeders and some seagrass beds. These epibenthic habitats at the northern and southern ends of the survey area were clearly important to many species, but in general there appeared to be little association of particular vertebrate species or biotic habitat types with the James Price Point area itself. The study area was notable for the diversity and abundance of the fauna, given the shallow depth, lack of rugose seafloor topography and lack of sub-tidal coral reefs in the area sampled. Coarse comparison with the fauna at similar distance to shore in similar latitudes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the Burrup Peninsula and the Kimberley indicated that the study area had more small pelagic planktivores and more large semi-demersal predators. There was also an absence of some species normally associated with muddy seafloors and fringing coral reefs that are common on BRUVS set elsewhere in regions with less extreme tidal ranges. © Royal Society of Western Australia 2011...|$|E
