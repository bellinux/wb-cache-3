Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the <b>read</b> <b>head</b> and uses PRML and Reed–Solomon error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction, and performs bad sector remapping, data collection for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, and other internal tasks.|$|E

2500|$|For intuitionists, {{infinity}} {{is described}} as potential; terms synonymous with this notion are becoming or constructive. For example, Stephen Kleene describes {{the notion of a}} Turing machine tape as [...] "a linear 'tape', (potentially) infinite in both directions." [...] To access memory on the tape, a Turing machine moves a <b>read</b> <b>head</b> along it in finitely many steps: the tape is therefore only [...] "potentially" [...] infinite, since while there is always the ability to take another step, infinity itself is never actually reached.|$|E

50|$|Laserdiscs, {{the first}} {{consumer}} optical discs, used constant linear velocity to double playback time (CLV disc can hold 1 hour per side; CAV disc only 30 minutes). As the motor's speed decreases from 1,800 to 600 rpm when the <b>read</b> <b>head</b> {{moves away from}} the center (which is the start of the recording), the disc constantly moves past the <b>read</b> <b>head</b> at a constant speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{differencing}} calculator with recording (German:Differenzen Rechengereat, English:Differencing Calculating Apparatus) was {{a machine}} designed to compute a flag of difference {{for a set}} of enciphered code groups and record it. it consisted of two teleprinter tapes with photoelectric <b>reading</b> <b>heads,</b> a set of calculating relays and an recording electric teleprinter.

50|$|There {{was also}} a system based on quarter-inch {{magnetic}} tape. This had a single write <b>head</b> and two <b>read</b> <b>heads.</b> The <b>read</b> <b>heads</b> were identical but each read from half of {{the width of the}} tape. Each digit was represented by two flux-reversal portions on the tape. The length of these segments determined the value of each digit. This meant that tape capacity was somewhat data dependent.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{utilization}} of multiple <b>read</b> <b>heads</b> to predict and correct a track mis-registration (TMR) in bit-patterned media recording (BPMR) {{based on the}} readback signals.

Then, a pair of two-dimensional (2 D) target and its corresponding 2 D equalizer associated with the estimated TMR will be chosen to correct the TMR in the data detection process. Numerical results show that the proposed system can achieve a very high accuracy of TMR prediction, thus performing better than the conventional system, especially when TMR is severe...|$|R
50|$|It {{consisted}} of a two teleprinter <b>reading</b> <b>head,</b> a relay-bank interpreter circuit, a plugboard weight assigner and a recording pen and drum. Each <b>head</b> <b>read</b> the tape using a photo-electric reader at a speed to 75 characters per second. The interpreter took the two readings and translating then from two separate letters reading into one digraphic reading, which it sent to the plugboard.|$|R
50|$|Data {{are read}} {{back by the}} <b>read</b> <b>head,</b> {{producing}} a weak and noisy analog signal. NPML aims at minimizing the influence of noise in the detection process.

5000|$|A {{different}} problem {{occurred when}} using a double-density diskette in the 1.2 MB drive; the high-density drive's heads had a track width {{half that of}} the 360 kB drive, so they were incapable of fully erasing and overwriting tracks written by a 360 kB drive. Therefore, overwriting a DD disk that had been written to in a DD drive with an HD drive {{would result in a}} disk perfectly readable on an HD drive, but producing many read errors in a DD drive. Whereas a HD <b>read</b> <b>head</b> would only pick up the half track that drive had written, the wider DD <b>read</b> <b>head</b> would pick up the half-track written by the HD drive mixed with the unerased half-track remnant of the track written earlier by a DD drive. Thus, the DD drive would end up reading both new and old information together, causing it to [...] "see" [...] garbled data.|$|E
