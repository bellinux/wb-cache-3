As {{soon as the}} basic design had been developed, contracts were let and construction was commenced in quantity before {{the completion of a}} test vessel. Preliminary orders were rushed out verbally or by telegrams, telephone, and <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letters.</b> The ordering of certain materials actually preceded the completion of design work. While many heavy equipment items, such as main propulsion machinery, were furnished directly by the Navy, the balance of the procurement was handled centrally by the Material Coordinating Agency—an adjunct of the Bureau of Ships—so that the numerous builders in the program would not have to bid against one another. Through vigorous follow-up action on materials ordered, the agency made possible the completion of construction schedules in record time.|$|R

Capt. Shaw {{told me that he}} {{received an}} <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letter</b> from you, too. We are feeling very good toay as the situation is turning in our favor. It was good to see the Belgian men returning to the town when they had heard that the drive of the Boche had been stopped. Yes, even Joseph 2 ̆ 6 Mimi’s father came home. He is about 28 or 30 years old and is the school teacher of the town. He had many interesting stories to tell about the activities in the rear areas of Belgium. The children were very happy to see their father and I imagine he was happy to see them. His wife told him that the soldiers burned a lot of coal that they had stored up in the basement. I replied “When you come to visit us in the United States, you can burn as much of our coal as you lie. ” All these people seem abashed at the good treatment the Americans give the Nazis [sic] prisoners. I told them it was because we are still an ultra-humane people and will take our retributions later. Darling, I’m glad that you and Miss Ingram “hit it off. ” It makes it so much more pleasant to work with an assistant who is cooperative and cheerful. I’m sorry to hear that Ukie was ill and I sincerely hope that she is well at this time. By the way, I haven’t heard from Mother and Dad for a while. Dad is excused—he just doesn’t write but I’m a little bit disappointed in mother. I really like to hear from her and she writes excellent letters. You know, sweetheart, {{there was a time when}} I was indifferent to babies in the same way like I was indifferent to marriage, etc., but now I know that the reason I want babies is because I love you so intensly [sic] and our love has reached a point where it is capable of attaining new horizons. Do you know what I mean? No guesswork in our relationship whatsoever—our marriage has a foundation of solid granite and now we are ready to build upon that foundation. Eadie, Honey, ask Ukie to please let you have those letters in French that this Belgian woman wrote to her. I’d like to keep them among our memoirs if it’s O. K. with Ukie. Don’t you worry your little head about that 25 bond for September. I understand all the bonds were cancelled as of Aug. 31 and my new one didn’t go into effect until Oct. 1. I’ll check up anyways [sic] and see if the above is correct, sweets. I’m glad to see that you’re corresponding with the other wives. Yes, I agree with you Karla is a nice name. According to [D]oc, they wanted a girl for the first one but he was ready to accept a boy, too. [?], please take care of your health and see that you get sufficient recreation. Every month or so take a visit to a friend in another city (if rail facilities permit and you’re not denying a soldier a place on the train). I’ve read and re-read the poem that Alma 2 ̆ 6 Harold sent you entitled “GI [?]” and feel that the poet has “hit the nail on the head” when he expresses himself and the feelings of the American soldier thusly: “Although on my violent hands is blood In my mind is a garden of beauty. ” I think you have gathered the same theme in my letters when you find me speaking vehemently about the Nazis and in the next breath extolling the charm of Mimi and Joseph (the Belgian kids). The American soldier has not lost his perspective and will not present any psychological problem when he returns home to his loved one. I admit there may be some exceptions, but I am speaking for the majority. Darling, you won’t have any problem, I assure you. This morning we had a brief glimpse of snow flurries but they did not stay with us very long. Tell me, dear, has Sanford spoken to you about any prospects of marriage? I’m speaking like my [?] Goldberg now, but seriously, I wish he found [sic] a swell wife like I have and got [sic] himself married. Do you ever hear about the rest of the Goldbergs? (I mean from a casual source.) Bubsie, doll, I’ll close this letter by kissing your nose, your eyes, and... O. K. if you want me to—a real passionate kiss on your lips.

My mail is so screwed up yet that I cannot determine which method is more rapid, <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> or V-Mail. One of these days I should find out, however. I got a “kick” from your dislike of mustaches. Sweetheart, out here personal vanity doesn’t mean a thing. Should I retain the mustache by the time I come home, I shall allow you to march me {{to the bathroom and}} watch me “whack” it off. It shall be a pleasure on my part. It’s so good that you are being kept constantly occupied. Darling, you can fiddle away time just like me—an old family trait. There are times when I put aside time to do a particular thing but I’ll be doggone if the time doesn’t pass without my doing what I wanted to do. Your article concerning Jap-American relations reflects in a small part some of the racial problems which will manifest themselves greatly after the war. I pity those people—it is not their fault. Thus far, darling, I have not received the camera but remain on the constant lookout for it. Tell me, too, if you received the money order and the box containing film and sundry items. Darling, I don’t ever want you to feel morbid. Promise me that you’ll always try and be as cheerful as possible—O. K. ? Before I forget, send me a box of stationery, will you, dear? It’s a critical item around here and very difficult to procure. V-Mail stationery is issued and we can get as much as we want. You say you sent me a cablegram on the 2 nd of November. To date I have not received your cablegram. They are pretty useless when you send them to me, but are quite good when I send them to you. I’m glad to hear that you enjoy Lt. Embry’s company as her husband is a “purty” regular guy and very much in love with his wife. A quality that we both have in common. “Winkie” Luddecke sent Doc a picture of their baby and herself. Gee, but I’m jealous, but don’t you worry, my precious, we’ll have our day, too. And what a day that will be!!! We’re getting along O.

Also, if you like an LST so well, why didn’t you join the Navy? Honey, I’m not sending you any snapshots, etc. until I get a somewhat permanent address from you.

I can eat almost anything, 2 ̆ 6 all that the bezenderine will do is speed up my metabolism. After I lose what I want, I can keep the weight [off] by merely watching my diet. Well, I’m determined to try it! Since I missed (took off) an hour’s work, I make it up tomorrow by working from 9 – 6. That’s a long day but I don’t mind it—what else would I do? Instead of missing you less as the days roll by; my dearest, I miss you more—the longer I’m away from you, the more I miss you. My precious—take good care of yourself! My work is still wonderful.

If I’m willing to take care of myself the least you can do is {{take care of yourself}}. Believe it or not, but after I finished reading your letters, I, too, felt exhausted. I suppose it’s because I feel and experience each and every emotion that is yours. After reading your letter I wanted to carry you tenderly to bed, put my arms around you and kiss your forehead, your temples, your eyes, your cute little nose, your neck, and then to be “mean,” plant a passionate kiss on your lips. Mmmm! I hate like “heck” to leave the previous subject but I suppose you would like to hear about other things, too. Darling, mail every 10 days isn’t bad at all. I only hope it continues that way. Don’t bother with the P. D. subscription if it takes {{as long as it does}} to reach me. Shelton is receiving papers from Abilene, Texas, dated 22 Sept. which are of little or no value at this late date. I received a notice from Coronet stating that I was to receive a copy but to date the magazine has failed to put in an appearance. I’ll get it one of these days, I suppose. Your sweetheart is becoming a real onion sandwich eater. I found an onion associate in the person of Doc so we have our daily onion sandwiches. He says they are very healthful and as long as we don’t have to create impressions around here, we are enjoying our sandwiches. Doc laughed when I told him that you ate onions too, whenever, I got into an onion eating mood so that I wouldn’t drive you out from bed with onion breath. Bubsie, don’t bother with the clippings from the 9 th Army. As long as you save the Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes we should have a pretty good account of it anyway. Ahem! So the boys have a “crush” on teacher? So would I if I were on of the boys! Don’t be so cruel to the boys—after all, they do appreciate charm and you can’t blame them for that, can you?

We’re supposed to have the highest priority on mail coming in and not such a high priority on mail going out so I imagine that the situation should be even worse with you. I’m not angry and if you’re not angry, everything is Jake. Sweetheart, I am writing practically every day so I’m {{taking care of my}} end of the deal. I love you so very much, my dearest, and regardless of whatever happens you find your way into my thoughts. I don’t know how you do it, perhaps you can tell me. Nothing new or exciting happened today, just old stuff. We’ve got a darling little den here—pictures on the wall, library cases, carpets on the floor—oh so ducky! We played bridge last night until 9 : 00 p. m. and then went to bed. Golly, these 10 - 12 hr. nights are just too, too, divine. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day and believe it or not, we’re going to have a real genuine turkey. Of course, it won’t have any trimmings at the Mess. The Sgt. said that he’s going to do the best he can to roast it. Our food has been unbelievably good here considering our proximity to the action. I’ve no complaints and I know that we are 10, 000 % better off than so many of our boys here. Actually, sweets, we have a “bed of roses. ” Each night we have a pack of mail that we all pitch in and censor. Then we brew us some coffee on our elegant stove, bring out our excellent tableware and eat our snack. I still haven’t received the camera as well as other packages which I presume everybody has sent me (at least their letters intimate such). Sweetheart, when you eat your Thanksgiving meal tomorrow, I shall be at your side enjoying that delicious meal right with you. Actually, darling, I’m glad I’m here and doing something “constructive” for the war effort. The cartoon was cute and I got a “kick” out of it. As I said before, I don’t give a damn for promotions, etc. I’m happy. What a choicy bit of gossip [...] ”meow. ” Listen we shouldn’t talk—who knows what people were saying about us, my dear.

I hope they lieft [sic] the ban on censorship so I can tell you what an outstanding job the outfit is doing. Trench-foot seems to be giving the dough-feet a lot of trouble, so we in the artillery have to check the men’s feet each and every day to make sure the men are taking care of their feet. Since our men are very little exposed to the elements we do not have any trouble on that score. We’ve listening to the Army-Navy game and to add special interest we organized a pool in which every officer selected a no. which he thought would be the cumulative score of the game. I selected no. 34 and plunked down 50 f ($ 1. 00). If I win, I get $ 42. 00. Golly, I’m going to the dogs in a hurry, gambling, etc. —but you still love me, don’t you, despite my faults? “Doc” Luddecke continues to be a “good Joe” and we have a load of fun. Imagine last night Shelton, Doc, Haygood and myself played the game,“What object in this room am I thinking about?” Isn’t war hell? Here’s something that’s hard to believe. We’re starting to send men on 2 -day passes to a not to[o] far away town in Holland and it’s hard to believe at the number of men who refuse the pass. The officers are not eligible for passes. There’s talk of passes to Paris, but at the rate of men to go on pass it will take one year to get them all on pass. As far as I’m concerned I’ll take my pass when I get home and cane [sic] take it with you. Not a heck of a lot to write darling, so I’ll say the usual good night, dear, and sweet dreams. Oddles of love, Vic [Translation ends...|$|R

It’s high time we get “out of the rut” 2 ̆ 6 realize we’re fighting a war 2 ̆ 6 it’s not all concerned with no nylons, no radios, etc. My darling, I am rather anxious about you, but a voice within me keeps reassuring me that you are all right! Do take care of yourself, my sweets—anyhow, {{the best you can}} do in your present situation! I received your <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letter</b> of the 7 th. Your letters certainly do give me “a life. ” I do love you, my darling! So far, I haven’t received any packages from you, but I imagine they’ll show up after this Xmas rush! I shall try 2 ̆ 6 find you a toilet kit—if I can! However, don’t expect too much. I tried to send you another AEF message, but the rule on them is—wait until after Xmas—so I’ll send one the 26 th or 27 th. I can’t get you Mrs. Anthony’s relatives’ address. Mrs. A. moved—don’t know where! This afternoon I had a meeting—all head teachers are asked to attend to discuss administrative problems. It was interesting 2 ̆ 6 I noticed that there were 4 other teachers who were below 30 (I’m sure). However, according to Mr. Bryan, I’m the youngest. After the meeting I went to a Xmas party at my ex-school. Gosh, was I glad to see the children 2 ̆ 6 vice versa. I had a lovely time 2 ̆ 6 didn’t leave until 6 : 30. Mrs. Sevain (her hubby is an FBI agent), the girl Amy 2 ̆ 6 I went out with one Sunday—her husband was there 2 ̆ 6 honestly, they reminded me of us—the way we always have to keep touching each other! Spoke to Sanf 2 ̆ 6 your mom today. Your pop is feeling lots better. Otherwise, my darling, with you at my side, I know I’ll be able to assume any role in life the Fates have in store for us! I love you so very much. You are my life! Your roses are so lovely! As each petal falls from the dying flowers, I imagine you are one step nearer to coming home to me. I adore you, lover!

Dearest beloved, When I {{came home}} {{a few minutes}} ago 2 ̆ 6 found your <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letter</b> dated 11 / 22, I really got excited 2 ̆ 6 thrilled. That’s the fastest service I’ve ever gotten on your mail {{including}} V-mails. I called your folks 2 ̆ 6 they were happy, too. However, I do not emphasize {{the fact that you are}} now a “veteran” [...] 2 ̆ 6 I think it is best that you “skim over” exactly what you’re doing when you write to them. I believe Sanford shares this opinion! So glad you have rec’d most all of my letters—it gives me an incentive to keep the pen moving! Also, the films from the Kodak Company have arrived 2 ̆ 6 I’ll send them to you with some toiletries 2 ̆ 6 stuff! I’ll probably mail a package to you next week, 2 ̆ 6 hope that, in the meanwhile, you will receive some of your Xmas presents, plus the camera I sent, plus the cigarette lighter Morty sent you. Thanks sweetheart for the clippings! The map is certainly a good one! Altho’ I gather you are seeing action 2 ̆ 6 I should be worried 2 ̆ 6 upset—well, I’m not! I know you’re okay 2 ̆ 6 that you’ll do what is expected of you 2 ̆ 6 soon we’ll be together!!! Honey, if I didn’t feel that way I don’t think I’d be able to go on existing! Boy, they sure feed you good—considering your location! I hope your various comforts (shelter 2 ̆ 6 food) continue to be good! Can you imagine—after all these months I finally get a letter from Esther Moskowitz? She’s doing social work at a mental hosp. in N. Y. —but mainly, I think marriage is on her mind 2 ̆ 6 I can’t blame her! My dramatic group was very enthusiastic tonight 2 ̆ 6 if it continues that way, we may be able to put on a good show some time in the spring. Thurs. I got an app’t with Dr. Furst 2 ̆ 6 I’m going to have my teeth checked. I’m really “getting in shape” for you, sweetheart! My work is still very satisfying! Tonight, Mrs. Chand (Douglas’ mom) brought her mother up with her to call for Doug. When Mrs. C. introduced me to her mother (both generations were kindergarten teachers) she said, “Mrs. Speert is one of the best. ” I really was flattered! All the loving I would normally shower on you goes to my children in a rather logical, objective 2 ̆ 6 discreet manner. But honey—sometimes I forget I’m a teacher 2 ̆ 6 Buzzy Wilson 2 ̆ 6 Randy Bankstron (2 yrs. old) really get a “loving up. ” But actually all my love—all my life is yours to do as you please with.

40|$|Transcription begins] 22 November, 1944 Somewhere in Germany My dearest beloved, I’m {{ashamed of}} myself, I failed to write you an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letter</b> yesterday. Sweetheart, you see, {{we were on}} the move and I didn’t set [sic] still in one place long enough to write you a long letter but I did drop you a V-Mail letter. As far as mail was {{concerned}} I had a banner day yesterday. Yes, I received 27 pieces of mail, dating from Oct. 1 to Nov. 3. I can truthfully say that I think that most of my mail has caught up with me now, except for the ones you sent to the “Red Ball” mail. Today I received a V-mail birthday greeting. Sweets, you’re a doll! A lot of things are happening around here which are very interesting and ev-en-a wee bit exciting. Of course us [sic] veterans take this kind of stuff as being the usual. I can’t for the love of me understand how the army feeds us so well in our location. Just {{to give you an idea}} of what we ate this evening: Spaghetti and meatballs! (fresh meat), green beans, stewed tomatoes, vanilla pudding, coffee, orange juice (can). You can’t go hungry on that, can you? The men 2 ̆ 6 officers got another distribution of cigarettes, gum, blades, etc. so everybody is happy. In our present set-up, Lt. Luddeche is living in our room since Lt. Wittman went on temperary [sic] duty with Division. Our present room in the cellar of a former gorgeous home is not as airy as the others we occupied but, oh so much more comforting. It’s all white-washed and has a library in it with some wonderful litary [sic] books (in German). Doc Luddeche, while perusing about, discovered a copy of Meiv Kamf [1][sic] (in German) which looked as if it had never been used, absolutely new. As I look through much of the literature I find I can see now how Hitler sold his flock all that propoganda [sic]. One thing is certain, the people bought the stuff and are as guilty as he. Some of the books and pamplets [sic] are beautifully illustrated and right smart photography, too. These bastards were high price “con” men of the first water. It’s tragic that Germany with one of the highest cultures of Europe has to use that culture to destroy rather than to progress. Oh, well! Since Germany wanted to destroy, so shall she be destroyed. The weather here has kept up quite well despite this time of the year. We’ve had some rain showers but it has not been too bad. Tell me when you receive the package I sent you. Goodnight sweetheart, I’m going to drop a line to Sally and June 2 ̆ 6 Kenny. I love you, my darling Vic [Translation ends] [1] Mein Kampf (translated to English as My Struggle or My Battle), the autobiography of Adolf Hitler, published in 1925, outlined his political ideology, the focus of which was “the Jewish peril. ...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] 26 November 1944 Somewheres in Germany My most {{precious}} jewel, Today, I again {{hit the jackpot}} on the mail situation. Yes 11 letters and a serviceman’s box from the Heights’ B’nai B’rith. I’m {{going to write a}} thank you note to the B’nai B’rith as soon as I finish writing to you. Among the letters were a letter from Mort, a letter from Sanford dated Nov. 12 (whatta surprise) 2 ̆ 6 your letters with the following dates: Oct. 25 and Oct. 22 2 ̆ 6 25 (newspaper clippings), an anniversary card (2 yrs. 2 ̆ 6 5 months of delicious married life), and a Thanksgiving card. Also a V-Mail from my folks. Actually, dear, I’m surprised at myself, for I, too, am carrying on an intensive, as well as extensive, correspondence. In our present set-up, I can do an awful lot of letter writing. The weather here continues to be nice; however, I hear that in some areas not far from here they have been having snow. Brr— We listened to the Ohio State-Michigan game last night and got a genuine thrill with State coming from behind to win. My heart went out to the announcer who complained that his hands were so cold he [sic] it was necessary that he sit on his hands to keep them warm. Tsch, tsch, I would recommend that he come over here where it is much “hotter. ” We received a bunch of Christmas cards in the PX distribution which I shall send to our friends. Most of them are cards which deal with troops in France. I suppose they haven’t come out yet with cards from Germany. I’m very interested to know whether you received the box I sent you and also whether you can use the film enclosed. Incidentally, my <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letter</b> to you yesterday contained a Nazi armband of the Nazi party. Tell me when you receive it. At the present time I am munching Nabisco Fig Newtons which are very good—make a good evening snack. We’re going to try and take pictures of our cozy little room and if they come out O. K. I’m going to send it to you. Darling, one thing I would greatly appreciate is a new picture of you. One that I can look at [at] times I get real sentimental. O. K., sweets? (Not that I don’t look at your picture constantly, either.) At the present time I’m listening to an opera coming over the radio. It’s a tough life, isn’t it? Sanford’s letter had a clever remark in the upper right-hand corner where I put “Somewhere in Germany. ” His remark was “Could it be anywhere else but from home?” Those sheets from the “Hobo News” were a “bit of all right. ” The paper has a lot of appeal. I showed Doc Luddecke Winkie’s letter to you and he innocently remarked, “an intelligent letter” and wants to keep it, so I gave it to him. He’s a good guy. Sweets, I adore your every atom 2 ̆ 6 molecule and that’s getting pretty small. I love you, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R

You know I think “the world” of him 2 ̆ 6 would be very glad to write him; but you neglected to send me his address. Also, you sent me the names of officers to receive Xmas cards from us, but you neglected to send me their address[es]. I think we should send a Xmas card to Sgt. Earl Embry since I’m friendly with his wife, and one to Nate Morris, if you know their addresses. Huh? So please, sweets, send me names plus addresses. Thanks. Shall not send you any packages until I hear you have rec’d some from the states [...] especially since everyone has sent you something for Xmas. However, shall take your request for films to the Kodak Co. 2 ̆ 6 eventually, I’ll send you out some toiletries [...] okay, so I can’t spell!
