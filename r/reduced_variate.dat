40|$|Frequency {{analysis}} {{allows the}} estimation of design floods, which {{are used in the}} hydrological dimensionality of hydraulic structures. In particular, regional frequency analyses are convenient to obtain a higher amount of information, and thus more reliability on the calculated results (in the case of homogeneous regions). Hitherto some errors have been found in the theory and application of the original Langbein Test. Here, a corrected version of this statistic test is described in detail, which uses the <b>reduced</b> <b>variate</b> of Gumbel distribution as estimator. Four numerical applications are exposed briefly and their results are discussed. Based on this discussion, the systematic application of this corrected test is recommended when verifying regional homogeneity due to its simplicity and consistency...|$|E
40|$|Hydrometeorologists and ot,hers {{interested}} {{in the frequency of}} extreme values of meteorologic or climatic quantities-rainfalls, for example-have found their distribution to be well approximated by a Fisher-Tippett type I distribution of extreme values [l](sometimes called a Gumbel [2] distribution). The nomogram presented here is based on this distribution and has practical value in the analysis of extreme-value data and the determination of values for various return periods. The Fisher-Tippett type I distribution is given by p=e-e "y where P is the probability that an extreme value wil be less than X, e is the base of the natural logarithms and y is a <b>reduced</b> <b>variate</b> defined following equation (5). 1 "P is, therefore, the probability that an extreme value wil equal or exceed X; and the return period T, is the reciprocal of this probability, i. e., and (1...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} method using spreadsheets {{is proposed}} for calculating the Hasofer-Lind second moment reliability index beta. Two example problems involving correlated normals and correlated nonnormals, respectively, are solved and compared with established mathematical approach. The proposed method {{is based on}} the perspective of an ellipsoid that is tangent to the failure surface in the original space of the random variables; concepts of transformed space or <b>reduced</b> <b>variates</b> are not required. Correlation is accounted for by setting up the quadratic form in the spreadsheet. Nonnormals are dealt with using established relationships between nonnormal distribution and its equivalent normal distribution. Iterative searching is performed automatically by invoking a spreadsheet's optimization tool. An advantage of the spreadsheet method is that partial derivatives {{are not part of the}} input; the method may therefore be especially attractive for cases with complicated or nonexplicit performance functions...|$|R
40|$|Position-specific scoring {{matrices}} {{are useful}} for representing and searching for protein sequence motifs. A sequence family can often be described {{by a group of}} one or more motifs, and an effective search must combine the scores for matching a sequence to each of the motifs in the group. We describe three methods for combining match scores and estimating the statistical significance of the combined scores and evaluate the search quality (classification accuracy) and the accuracy of the estimate of statistical significance of each. The three methods are: 1) sum of scores, 2) sum of <b>reduced</b> <b>variates,</b> 3) product of score pvalues. We show that method 3) is superior to the other two methods in both regards, and that combining motif scores indeed gives better search accuracy. The mast sequence homology search algorithm utilizing the product of p-values scoring method is available for interactive use and downloading at URL [URL] Keywords: protein sequence motifs, profiles, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} models {{are used in}} a variety of applications in transportation engineering and have become a prime aid in decision making. The applications range from evaluating traffic control strategies for single intersections to such complex decision processes as evaluating the impact of removing toll facilities at the George Washington Bridge in New York City. While it is widely accepted that simulation offers an unmatchable capability of evaluating alternate control policies, the high variance of the output variable presents a critical problem in such comparative analyses. The {{simulation models}} with high output variance must be run longer or replicated many times to achieve a desired precision level, and that corresponds to increased cost of computer resources. This paper describes and illustrates the application of variance reduction concepts that can improve the reliability and efficiency of the simulation experimental process by taking advantage of the simulation model structure. The two variance reduction concepts (common random numbers and antithetic <b>variates)</b> <b>reduce</b> the variance of the output variable by replacing the original sampling procedure with a new procedure that yields the same expected value but with a smaller variance. The application of the variance reduction concept was illustrated using results from experiments with a freeway simulation model. The results indicate that both common random numbers and antithetic variates sampling procedures appreciably reduce the variance of the simulation output measure. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} century and {{accelerated}} {{since the end of}} the post WWII manufacturing boom, a number of forces acting upon manufacturing organisations have led to significant changes to underlying manufacturing philosophies used, to the technologies employed and to the manufacturing methods and practices applied. Such forces (Hammer and Champy, 1993, pp. 17) are related to organisational survival factors such as market share and price premiums, cost reductions, quicker response to new market demands, quicker response to competitor practices, operating equipment effectiveness, cycle time reductions and reductions to inefficiencies and material requirements. As a result, manufacturing organisations now have an increased focus on specific competitive advantages, geographic spread and location, management of costs, relations with customers and suppliers and by no means least, the treatment and development of people (Porter, 1990, pp. 40 41). As well, in some industries more than others, there has been a progressive change in focus away for separate, arms-length entities along a common supply chain to a more integrated and collaborative view. (Christopher, 1998, pp. 5). Supply Chain Management (SCM) as such, is by now recognised by many organisations as a means by which they can gain competitive advantage and improve their business results (Spekman et al., 1998, pp. 630). Effective SCM therefore can become a strategic factor in a firm 2 ̆ 7 s success (Cohen and Roussel, 2005, pp. 9). This is particularly the case as more companies link their advantages together and start to operate as supply networks of interdependent supply chain partners as opposed to separate, stand-alone entities (Spekman et al., 1998, pp. 632). Associated with such an approach is the integration of intra and inter-businesses processes in order to achieve such business-to-business linkage. As illustrated by companies such as Amazon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Wal-Mart, Shell Chemical and Georgia-Pacific Corp, an effective supply chain network can competitively outperform the standalone model (Lummus and Alber, 1997, pp. 10, Cohen and Roussel, 2005, pp. 10). This superior performance manifests itself as performance advantages on a number of key supply chain performance measures (Shin et al., 2000, pp. 330). Consistent with the theme of supply chain management, this research deals specifically with the order fulfilment processes operating within a supply chain and in particular the integration of those processes both horizontally and vertically within the chain. The key belief is that higher levels of such integration will assist organisations to improve their supply chain and overall business performance. The major objective of this work therefore was to answer the question: 2 ̆ 7 How much and in what ways does the integration of supply chain logistics processes in manufacturing organisations impact upon business performance? 2 ̆ 7 The methodology used to address the above research question consisted firstly of conducting an exhaustive literature review. From that review, the main research hypotheses and three theoretical frameworks were proposed. The hypotheses and theoretical frameworks captured the ideas and findings of numerous researchers and writers with respect to variables and relationship structures that may help answer the research question. The main research hypotheses developed and tested therefore were as follows: H 1 : That the integration of supply chain logistics processes does significantly and positively impact supply chain and business performance. H 2 : That the application of supply chain management principles does significantly and positively impact supply chain and business performance. H 3 : That the application of human 2 ̆ 7 social 2 ̆ 7 principles/approaches does significantly and positively impact supply chain and business performance. Following the literature review, a survey instrument was designed and tested, contact details of target participants were obtained and finally the sequence of questionnaire related letters (including the questionnaire) was mailed out. Responses were assessed for suitability (completeness and reasonableness), entered into Excel and later imported into SPSS ver. 13. 0 for analysis. 210 usable responses were obtained from 230 returned questionnaires sent to 1050 supply chain professionals in 990 companies worldwide. The results of the data analysis (principally via the use of structural equation modelling) showed conditional support for each of the research hypotheses and good support for the first of the proposed theoretical frameworks. Because of this, a simulation model of the first theoretical framework was developed such that the research results can: (a) be seen visually and in a dynamic way, (b) be used by others to test their mental models of supply chain 2 ̆ 7 DNA 2 ̆ 7 against and to improve the robustness of their supply chain improvement plans and initiatives and (c) be used by educators to demonstrate dynamically the relationships between supply chain lever and outcome variables. The second and third theoretical frameworks proposed were not supported. Factor analysis was undertaken in order to reduce highly related variables to fewer underlying constructs. The factor analysis confirmed that such data-reduction was possible for the study 2 ̆ 7 s chosen variables such that the 10 dependent variables could be <b>reduced</b> to 5 <b>variates</b> and the study 2 ̆ 7 s 32 independent variables could be <b>reduced</b> to 8 <b>variates.</b> The research conclusions are described including identification of conditional support for the three above hypotheses, confirmation of the best-fit theoretical model and affirmation that integration of supply chain logistics processes does positively influence both supply chain and business outcomes. Implications arising from and limitations of the study are discussed, as are recommendations for further researc...|$|R
