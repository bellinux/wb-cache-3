40|$|We {{examined}} the geochemistry and micromorphology of the soils on {{a suite of}} morphologically well-defined and visually distinct fluvial terraces, up to 40 m elevation above the current riverbed, at Thangbi in the upper Bumthang Valley, Bhutan. The alluvia forming each of the terraces are lithologically and structurally similar, with shallow or moderately deep, clast-free sandy loam overbank deposits capping deep clast-supported beds of rounded boulders and interstitial sand. The topsoils on the 40 m terrace have more silt than those on the lower terraces. The soils are interpreted mainly as a monoclinal post-incisive chronosequence. Features that indicate progressive pedogenesis with increasing elevation include subsoil <b>rubefaction,</b> crystallinity of free Fe sesquioxides, and weathering of susceptible primary minerals, such as biotite and hornblende. However other soil attributes show no systematic trends and the overall impression is of limited pedogenesis, even in the soils on the higher terraces. We examine possibilities that the immaturity of the soils is due to pedogenic rejuvenation by post-incision additions to the soil parent materials...|$|E
40|$|Lavaka {{represent}} a typical erosional landform in Madagascar. The chronology of their formation remains, however, under discussion. Our {{research focuses on}} the Ankarokaroka lavaka, a spectacular landform located in NW Madagascar (Ankarafantsika natural reserve), which {{is characterized by the}} presence of sandy units of regional extension at its top. The two main units correspond to white and red sands, and are closely associated with specific vegetations (dry dense forest for the white sands, savannah grasslands for the red sands). We applied a geochronological approach based on Optically Stimulated Luminescence (for the coversands) associated to radiocarbon dating performed on archaeological remains found at the contact between the sands and the lavaka. The combination of this approach with field work and sedimentological analyses makes it possible to show that the sands experienced a complex history, both in terms of sedimentation and post-sedimentary pedogenesis (podzolisation of the white sands, <b>rubefaction</b> of the red sands). The numerical ages furthermore indicate that the Ankarokaroka lavaka formed between 18. 5 ± 2. 3 ka ago and the 14 th century AD. The present study demonstrates that this lavaka has a climatic origin, and highlights the potential of OSL to date sediments associated with Madagascar lavaka...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Ediacaran {{detrital}} succession in the Cantabrian Zone shows geochemical and mineralogical changes {{resulting from}} sub-Cambrian weathering during the Late Ediacaran worldwide sea-level fall. Relative to the unaltered rocks the altered ones show crosscutting <b>rubefaction</b> of varying thickness and remarkable increase in illite, K 2 O, Rb and Cs indicating K-metasomatism, and also depletion in MgO, CaO, Na 2 O, Be and Sr, {{but not in}} Zr, Nb, Y or Sc. The basal Cambrian siliciclastic rocks mostly consist of detritus derived from the Ediacaran materials, {{as demonstrated by the}} geochemical and Nd-isotope data (εNd(t) ranges are − 3. 4 to − 2. 1 and − 3. 6 to − 1. 8, respectively). However, these geochemical features of the basal Cambrian change upwards to more evolved compositions with lower εNd(t) values (− 4. 9 to − 5. 8). This change coincides with the Ediacaran–Cambrian unconformity in the Central Iberian Zone, and the Ediacaran siliclastic rocks of this zone and their unaltered equivalents of the Cantabrian Zone share the same geochemical features. This geochemical homogeneity rules out a significant coeval juvenile contribution to the Upper Ediacaran series. Thus, the juvenile supply was from a geological setting different from that in which the Ediacaran series were finally deposited...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{carried out}} a {{combined}} thermal and magnetic evaluation on experimentally knapped clasts of different lithologies (chert, quartzite, limestone, sandstone and obsidian) heated under controlled field and temperature conditions. The main {{aim of this study}} is to estimate the feasibility of use of these raw materials, which are commonly found in prehistoric archaeological sites for archaeomagnetic purposes. Rock magnetic analysis included measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM) acquisition curves, hysteresis loops and thermomagnetic curves of lithic clasts both before and after experimental heating. All lithologies, except the obsidian, recorded an increase of up two orders of magnitude in their magnetic concentration-dependent parameters revealing the formation of new ferrimagnetic minerals. Obsidian and sandstone are the most reliable magnetic carriers, followed by limestone, chert and quartzite. Magnetic susceptibility values show significant differences among lithologies. Isothermal remanent magnetisation proved also to be highly discriminatory as well as the room temperature hysteresis parameters. The main macroscopic alterations resulted in colour changes, <b>rubefactions,</b> potlids in cherts and the massive formation of internal fissures in obsidian specimens. The multispecimen palaeointensity technique was applied on selected samples yielding satisfactory results for heated obsidian and sandstone samples. The archaeological applicability of the results is discussed as well as their geomagnetic significance...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a fatal case of accidental {{ingestion of}} {{a mixture of}} hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid. The man was admitted to hospital, where appropriate treatment, adequate to his condition, was instituted. Numerous ventricular fibrillation episodes, for which the patient was defibrillated repeatedly, were observed {{during the period of}} hospitalization. The patient was in a critical condition, with progressive symptoms of hypovolemic shock and multiorgan failure. On the next day after admission, signs of electromechanical dissociation progressing to asystole were noted. The instituted resuscitation procedure proved ineffective and the patient died. Autopsy revealed brownish discoloration of the esophageal, gastric, and small intestinal mucous membranes. Numerous ulcerations without signs of perforation were found both in the esophagus and in the stomach. The mucous membrane of the small intestine demonstrated focal <b>rubefactions,</b> whereas no focal lesions of the large intestinal mucosa were seen. Microscopic investigation of the biopsy specimens collected from the stomach, duodenum and small intestine revealed mucous membrane necrosis foci, reaching the deeper layers of the wall of these organs. The mucous membrane of the large intestine was congested. Bioptates obtained from the lungs indicated the presence of hemorrhagic infarcts and focal extravasations. Poisoning with the aforementioned acids with consequent necrosis of the esophageal, gastric, duodenal and small intestinal walls with hemorrhages to the gastrointestinal tract, as well as extravasations and hemorrhagic infarcts in the lungs was considered to be the cause of death...|$|R
40|$|The parietal painted sign {{keeps on}} {{the memory of}} gesture that {{produces}} it. It {{is one of the}} distinctive features of this particular artefact. However, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct this gesture if we do not give the context of the sign, if we do not present the numerous physical and cultural parameters which are in charge of their production. About schematic paintings of Neolithic age, we must take the union of criterions into account such as the parietal and site topography, the cultural constraints that appoint the location of figures and the ritual practices originally the graphical expression. The painter perceives, adapts and behaves according to this spatial and social environment. We refer here to several strategies: the attention for the parietal microtopography in accordance with the signs to draw, the respect of some criterions that specify the choice of the site like the hygrophily of places and the <b>rubefaction</b> of rock walls, the need to paint at the limits of the accessibility of site and wall, the use of drawing-tools for increase the capacities of the body. The efficiency of the gesture consists in realizing a sign bearing a meaning because in harmony with the features of its support...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Araripe-Campos Sales area in {{semi-arid}} Brazilian “Nordeste” is locally {{capped by}} lateritic plateau remnants {{that have never}} been precisely mapped. All these laterites are preserved on a high exhumed pre-cenomanian paleosurface (600 - 650 m a. s. l.) entirely developed on a gneissic or granitic bedrock. On the top of the Chapada do Araripe (800 - 900 m a. s. l.), the Cenomanian Exu sandstones have only allowed the formation of non-indurated ferrallitic soils. Another class of soils (“fersiallitic” soils, typified by <b>rubefaction</b> and significant occurrence of 2 / 1 clays) is principally developed on a lower topographic level (300 - 400 m a. s. l.) connected to the low “Sertaneja” surface shaped into the crystalline basement. If lithology appears as a discriminating factor to explain some aspects of the laterite and soil distribution (between sedimentary cover and crystalline rocks), it is insufficient to explain the differences observed within the crystalline basement in a region of homogenous semi-arid climate. So it is necessary to develop a model that accounts adequately for these observations. This can be achieved by considering a morphotectonic model that combines the effects of tectonics, erosion and climatic change. The uplift history, which also controls patterns and rates of regolith stripping, seems to be a key to understanding the regional geography of weathering and soils in a context of increased aridity during the Cenozoic...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA novel {{approach}} to the intensity of archaeological fires is proposed, based {{on a combination of}} archaeological observations and analyses of sedimentary hearths with relevant proxies obtained from using experimental combustion structures. In this work, two different structures were built and monitored. They aimed at reproducing two types of archaeological hearth morphology encountered at the Bronze Age site of the cave of Les Fraux (Saint Martin de Fressengeas, Dordogne, France). A series of fires was constructed and a large amount of data was collected: temperature curves, wood consumption and observations on substratum evolution. A numerical code for heat transfer was developed to model heat propagation from the surface to the underlying sedimentary layers, the input parameters of which were adapted to fit the thermal evolution observed with the experimental fires. We found that two archaeological parameters are fundamental to characterise the intensity of the fire: the paleotemperature reached at the surface of the burnt sediment (which in our case was determined by thermoluminescence analyses) and the depth of the <b>rubefaction</b> front as an indicator of a 250 °C isothermal surface. We then estimated the duration of an equivalent single fire that would correspond to one of the archaeological hearths investigated. Finally, with the wood consumption recorded during the fire experiments, and the estimated firing duration, the energy involved was evaluated. When generalised to the study of archaeological hearths, this approach could be of great interest in firing intensity evaluation (temperature/time/energy) ...|$|E
40|$|Soils {{developed}} in representative landforms, which were previously mapped at a detailed {{scale in the}} Empordà Basin, were selected to characterize their main pedogenetic processes and to improve the soil maps through {{a better understanding of}} the soil – landscape relationships. This basin is a relatively large region (1, 300 km 2) in Northeastern Catalonia, where Neogene and Quaternary sediments outcrop. They are alluvial and delta fan deposits that mainly reflect a continental environment. Besides varying degrees of soil <b>rubefaction,</b> we can identify calcium carbonate redistribution, clay illuviation and sodication as the main soil forming processes, together with abrupt textural changes, vertic and redoximorphic features. These processes and features are expressed under different morphologies in the area, depending not only on parent material, landform and age, but also on human action, which allows us to refine the conceptual soil-landscape model. Calcium carbonate redistribution is a key process reflecting both changing general environmental conditions and local chemical soil conditions. The actual soil characteristics and the soil forming processes allow us to propose that (i) aeolian dust inputs in these soils have been low to moderate throughout, and that (ii) the rainfall pattern in the last part of the Holocene was able to remove these dust inputs, but unable to leach carbonates from medium textured, moderately calcareous soils in the area when they are some kilometres from the sea and not directly affected by the dune system...|$|E
40|$|Black shales, perhaps {{owing to}} their {{seemingly}} homogeneous nature, are mainly interpreted {{on the basis}} of their unusual geochemical characteristics. Their physical record is mostly neglected as a source of information. It has now been amply demonstrated, experimentally and analytically, that many black shales were deposited by physical processes comparable to those that shape coarser grained sediments, i. e. transport and deposition by currents may play a role as well. Black shales are not necessarily the product of sedimentation in quiet, stagnant water and, therefore, the a priori interpretation of such conditions is not valid. These lithologies are more varied than their generic name implies and, in addition to geochemical data, their physical record is an important source of independent information. Black shales are common sedimentary products during periods associated with supercontinent breakup, large-scale volcanic activity and high sea levels. Such periods are associated with greenhouse climates, enhanced nutrient supply to seawater, both a result of volcanism and its byproducts, and extensive shelves. Thus, the overall tendency of marine sediments, in particular in relatively shallow water settings, to become enriched in organic matter during specific periods in Earth’s history, may be ascribed to global forcing mechanisms. These periods are referred to as oceanic anoxic events—not implying, however, global ocean anoxia. It is often asserted that the deposition of black shales during oceanic anoxic events was global and synchronous. The geographical distribution of black shales shows this not to be the case. Storage of organic carbon in geographically definite areas of the seafloor has, nevertheless, led to perturbations in the global carbon cycle, which, in turn, have been recorded in sediments globally as excursions in the carbon isotope record irrespective of lithology. Black shale deposition was regionally favoured in basins with physiographies and hydrological regimes that promoted organic productivity and organic matter preservation, i. e. vigorous overturning circulation, estuarine circulation patterns and enhanced Ekman-induced upwelling. Whether marine sediments are enriched in organic matter or not, regardless of global and regional forcing mechanisms, ultimately depends on local sedimentary processes. These control the type and proportion of sedimentary components in the final sediment and, therefore, its organic richness and its petrological characteristics. Different combinations of these processes may lead to very different sedimentary products. Cretaceous oceanic red beds, although a different sedimentary product, are similarly largely dependent on local processes. The global mechanisms that promoted their deposition in specific time intervals remain enigmatic, but the laterally and vertically diachronous <b>rubefaction</b> of different lithologies in marine sedimentary sequences shows that—if synchronous global mechanisms exist that can force the system towards the full oxidation of marine sediments—the local response can nonetheless be diachronous. Thus, palaeoceanographical interpretations and correlations based on the appearance of such <b>rubefaction</b> in a sedimentary sequence do not allow inferences regarding the exact timing of the global mechanisms behind their formation. The products of marine sedimentation at any given location are the result of a complex interplay of global, regional and local factors and processes. Even though global and regional forcing mechanisms may explain the temporal distribution of black shales and red beds, their geographical distribution and physical characteristics underline the importance of local processe...|$|E
40|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the Segre river, flowing through the Pyrenees, offers a variety of geomorphic {{surfaces}} that allow us to study soil chronosequences. The objective of this work is to widen the knowledge about the main characteristics and formation processes of some benchmark soils developed on fluvio-glacial, alluvial-fan and terrace materials of Pleistocene and Holocene age related to the Segre river, either siliceous or carbonatic. This knowledge will allow us to identify soil forming processes, commonly found in Mediterranean environments such as carbonate redistribution, clay formation and mobilization and <b>rubefaction,</b> all as functions of parent material and age. Five profiles, ranging from the Lower Pleistocene to the Holocene were classified according to Soil Taxonomy /WRB. The Montferrer profile (Calcic Palexeralf /Calcic Cutanic Luvisol (Chromic) is a deep, partly decarbonated soil, with calcium carbonate accumulation in depth covering glacial features. The Torre del Remei profile (Typic Paleustalf /Cutanic Luvisol) developed on silicic moraines and shows an extreme clay formation and illuviation. The Alp (Typic Haplustalf /Cutanic Luvisol) and Tartera (Petric Calciustept /Petric Calcisol) soils are developed on alluvial fans with calcium carbonate sources. The former is partly decarbonated, whilst the latter is rubefacted on top and shows speleothem-like carbonate pendants with superposition of clay illuviation. The youngest profile, Abellerols, (Typic Calciustept /Typic Calcisol) shows only a partial decarbonation and calcite accumulation at depth. The results show that soil development is determined by the age of the surface and the source of calcite, either in the parent rock or brought by subsurface flow: clay illuviation is extreme in absence of it. Special morphologies of carbonate pendants are indicators of environmental conditions. The coexistence of clay coatings and secondary calcite can be explained by recarbonatation or by spatial differentiation of soil environments in the profile. One of the implications of this research is the inconsistence of using soil development indices based on morphological indicators when soils are formed on different parent materials and are subjected to different geomorphic dynamics...|$|E
