50|$|The {{reciprocal}} denotes a <b>reciprocated</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R
50|$|Positive {{reciprocity}} {{occurs when}} an action committed by one individual {{that has a}} positive effect on someone else is returned with an action that has an approximately equal positive effect. For example, if someone takes care of another person's dog, the person who received this favor should then return this action with another favor such as with a small gift. However, the <b>reciprocated</b> <b>action</b> should be approximately equal to the first action in terms of positive value, otherwise this can result in an uncomfortable social situation. If someone takes care of another person's dog and that person returns the favor by buying that individual a car, the reciprocated gift is inappropriate because it does not equal the initial gesture. Individuals expect <b>actions</b> to be <b>reciprocated</b> by <b>actions</b> that are approximately equal in value.|$|R

50|$|A {{diaphragm}} pump (also {{known as a}} Membrane pump) is a positive displacement pump that uses {{a combination of the}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> of a rubber, thermoplastic or teflon diaphragm and suitable valves {{on either side of the}} diaphragm(check valve, butterfly valves, flap valves, or any other form of shut-off valves) to pump a fluid.|$|E
50|$|Modern double-barreled shotguns, often {{known as}} doubles, are almost universally break open actions, with the barrels tilting {{up at the}} rear to expose the breech ends of the barrels for {{unloading}} and reloading. Since there is no <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> needed to eject and reload the shells, doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as pump action or lever-action shotguns.|$|E
50|$|The term 'tappet' is also used, obscurely, as a {{component}} of valve systems for other machinery, particularly as part of a bash valve in pneumatic cylinders. Where a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> is produced, such as for a rock drill, the valve may be actuated by inertia or by the movement of the working piston. As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston.|$|E
5000|$|Financial {{restrictions}} / Trade normalization - The U.S. {{has placed}} heavy financial sanctions on North Korea {{for what they}} see as an uncooperative attitude and unwillingness to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. In addition, other parties such as China have taken actions such as the freezing of North Korean assets in foreign bank accounts, such as the US$24 million in Macau's Banco Delta Asia. With the nuclear test on October 9, 2006, UNSCR 1718 was passed, which included a ban on all luxury goods to North Korea. These funds have since been unfrozen by the US on March 19, 2007 to <b>reciprocate</b> <b>actions</b> by their North Korean counterparts.

40|$|Cultures {{are built}} on social exchange. Most {{languages}} have dedicated grammatical machinery for expressing this. To demonstrate that statistical methods can also be applied to grammatical meaning, we here ask whether the underlying meanings of these grammatical constructions are based on shared common concepts. To explore this, we designed video stimuli of <b>reciprocated</b> <b>actions</b> (e. g. ‘giving to each other’) and symmetrical states (e. g. ‘sitting next to each other’), {{and with the help}} of a team of linguists collected responses from 20 languages around the world. Statistical analyses revealed that many languages do, in fact, share a common conceptual core for reciprocal meanings but that this is not a universally expressed concept. The recurrent pattern of conceptual packaging found across languages is compatible with the view that there is a shared non-linguistic understanding of reciprocation. But, nevertheless, there are considerable differences between languages in the exact extensional patterns, highlighting that even in the domain of grammar semantics is highly language-specific...|$|R
50|$|The large {{vertical}} blowing engine illustrated {{was built}} in the 1890s by E. P. Allis Co. of Milwaukee (later to form part of Allis-Chalmers). The air pumping cylinder is above the steam power cylinder and crosshead. The main force of the piston is transmitted to the air cylinder by a purely <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> and the flywheels are there merely to smooth the action of the engine. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the beam}} engines, the main {{force of the}} piston is {{transmitted}} to the air cylinder by a purely <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> and the flywheels are there merely to smooth {{the action of the}} engine. To permit adjustment though, the steam piston rod only goes as far as the crosshead and above this there are twinned rods to the air piston. The flywheel shaft is mounted below the steam piston, the paired connecting rods driving downwards and backwards to make this a return connecting rod engine.|$|E
50|$|For {{percussion}} techniques, {{the main}} limitation is air pressure. Air must {{be delivered to}} the piston at sufficient pressure to activate the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action,</b> and in turn drive the head into the rock with sufficient strength to fracture and pulverise it. With depth, volume {{is added to the}} in-rod string, requiring larger compressors to achieve operational pressures. Secondly, groundwater is ubiquitous, and increases in pressure with depth in the ground. The air inside the rod string must be pressurised enough to overcome this water pressure at the bit face. Then, the air must be able to carry the rock fragments to surface. This is why depths in excess of 500 m for reverse circulation drilling are rarely achieved, because the cost is prohibitive and approaches the threshold at which diamond core drilling is more economic.|$|E
50|$|At T-minus 10 seconds, {{hydrogen}} igniters were activated {{under each}} engine bell {{to quell the}} stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition. Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create {{the possibility of an}} overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase. The main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time. The computers <b>reciprocated</b> this <b>action</b> by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phase.|$|R

50|$|During Thirumalai's reign, two rebellions {{occurred}} amongst his feudatories. The {{first was}} by the Setupati of Ramnad. It was due to an order of Thirumalai in 1635 regarding the succession to the chief of that territory, which was resisted by the rightful claimant. Thirumalai was successful in placing his nominee on the throne and in imprisoning the rival aspirant, but he was ultimately compelled to allow the latter to succeed. His heir <b>reciprocated</b> this <b>action</b> by supporting Thirumalai in his final war with Mysore.|$|R
50|$|The <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> may be {{produced}} several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E
50|$|Pumps in this {{category}} range from simplex, with one cylinder, to in some cases quad (four) cylinders, or more. Many reciprocating-type pumps are duplex (two) or triplex (three) cylinder. They can be either single-acting with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other, or double-acting with suction and discharge in both directions. The pumps can be powered manually, by air or steam, or by a belt driven by an engine. This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in {{the early days of}} steam propulsion—as boiler feed water pumps. Now reciprocating pumps typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils, and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance. Reciprocating hand pumps were widely used to pump water from wells. Common bicycle pumps and foot pumps for inflation use <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For {{larger and}} heavier models, {{the most popular}} {{powerplant}} is the glow engine. Glow engines are fueled by a mixture of slow burning methanol, nitromethane, and lubricant (castor oil or synthetic oil), which is sold pre-mixed as glow-fuel. Glow-engines require an external starting mechanism; the glow plug must be electrically heated until its temperature can trigger fuel-ignition, upon which the engine's combustion-cycle becomes self-sustaining. The <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> of the cylinders applies torque to a rotating crankshaft, which is the engine's primary power-output. (Some power is lost {{in the form of}} waste-heat.)Vendors of model engines rate size in terms of engine displacement. Common sizes range from as small as 0.01 cubic inch (in3) to over 1.0 in3 (0.16 cc-16 cc). Under ideal conditions, the smallest [...]01 engines can turn a 3.5 in propeller at speeds over 30,000 rpm, while the typical larger (.40-.60 cubic inch) engine will turn at 10-14,000 rpm.|$|E

40|$|Available online 19 January 2016 Using a {{laboratory}} experiment, we study the predictive {{power of the}} Fehr–Schmidt (1999) model of inequity aversion and its robustness to reciprocity and stakes. We find stronger evidence for the model’s predictive power {{at the individual level}} than what the existing literature suggests. This finding is robust to stakes. However, the model’s predictive power is highly reduced if subjects can <b>reciprocate</b> others’ <b>actions.</b> This suggests that parameter estimates obtained in an environment that allows for reciprocal responses yield a bias in the parameter estimates. In particular, previous estimates (especially of the disutility of disadvantageous inequity aversion) may overestimate the importance of inequity aversion...|$|R

50|$|The DANA was a {{significant}} departure from contemporary self-propelled guns as it used a wheeled chassis and featured an innovative automated loading system which was {{the first of its kind}} at the time of its introduction to service. The vehicle has a driving cabin at the front, an open-topped fighting compartment at mid-length and the engine compartment in the rear. The front crew cabin seats both the driver/mechanic and vehicle commander. The armoured turret is installed on a traversable mount adapted to the Tatra 815 wheeled chassis (8x8) and is divided into two halves, divided by the howitzer's recoil mechanism and a pathway for the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> during firing. The left half of the turret is occupied by the gunner and first loader and houses the various fire control optics, electro-mechanical gun laying controls, the automatic propellant charge feeding device as well as an auxiliary ammunition magazine. The right side of the turret contains a mechanized projectile delivery system which is operated by a second loader at this position.|$|E
50|$|Where a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> is produced, such {{as for a}} rock drill, {{the valve}} may be {{actuated}} either by inertia of the frame or by {{the movement of the}} working piston. As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston. One form of this, the arc tappet valve, was an important feature of the Ingersoll rock drill, the first successful compressed air rock drill for use in mining and tunneling. This used a valve that rotated in a slight arc, rather than sliding. The valve was double-acting, controlling the air supply for both the power and the return stroke. The innovation that made this valve so reliable, thus successful, was a separate tappet that was actuated by the piston in passing at the middle of the stroke, rather than being hammered by a jarring direct impact of the piston. The mid-stroke actuation also opened the valve passageways earlier, before top dead centre, allowing in air that provided a cushioning effect. This further improved the action of the drill, giving a powerful stroke on the working piston and drill rod, but with less damaging hammering to the frame of the drill.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{operation}} conditions (the vibration intensity and gas flow rate) {{on the gas}} holdup in a 16. 6 cm i. d. two-phase reciprocating plate column (RPC) were studied. Distilled water and aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl-cellulose of different concentration were used as the liquid phase and air as the gas phase in this investigation. The gas holdup was measured after the gas flow and the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> had been stopped. An empirical correlation which correlates the gas holdup with the specific power consumption and the superficial gas velocity showed that the aeration intensity had a greater influence on the gas holdup than the intensity of agitation. Because the gas holdup was approximately the same in RPC's of different diameters, an equation relating the gas holdup with the specific power consumption and the superficial gas velocity was derived. The correlation {{could be used in}} the scaling up of reciprocating plate columns...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{cutting of}} bone offers {{advantages}} compared with orthopaedic devices {{that rely on}} a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action,</b> including the elimination of swarf, improved cut quality and precision, and reduced reaction forces. The technology has become accepted as an alternative cutting procedure for use in surgical operations on soft tissue. Recent studies conducted on bovine bone and a bone substitute material have shown that ultrasonic cutting results in a precise and fast operation using relatively low forces. Previous work by the authors highlighted the significance of frictional heating during ultrasonic cutting, a phenomenon {{that can lead to}} material degradation and excessive burning of the cut surface. The work presented a method of reducing cutting temperature by controlling ultrasonic cutting parameters and also presented a method of further reducing cutting temperature by incorporating blade geometry modifications that reduce friction between the blade and the specimen. Such studies have been concerned with uni-axial cutting blade orientations, known as guillotine cutting, and opportunities exist to enhance orthopaedic ultrasonic cutting by developing blades that can operate in more than one cutting direction. This paper investigates the relationship between cutting parameters (such as cutting speed, applied load and blade tip vibration velocity) and temperature at locations around the cut site for a synthetic bone material during guillotine and slicing mode cutting...|$|E
40|$|Acquiring {{samples from}} the {{subsurface}} of Mars poses many challenges. The scientific return increases with the depth from which the samples are obtained, but so does the risk. Thus, {{it is important to}} develop a fully autonomous drilling platform that will be capable of accessing the required depth and retrieving cores for scientific analysis. The method of drilling most likely to succeed will be a conventional mechanical core drill, either rotary or percussive, with a mechanical system for removing the cuttings and rock core from the hole. Instead of fluid flushing systems for removing cuttings, which {{would be very difficult to}} provide and in addition may contaminate the sample, an auger system is the best solution for rotary drilling. However, no such solution has been identified for the percussive drilling method. To solve this problem, a novel means of conveying cuttings out of the hole during percussive drilling has been developed and is presented in this paper. It relies on the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>action</b> between a pair of surfaces covered with bristles. Experimental results show that there is an optimum ratio of particle diameter to bristle length that gives the highest speed of particle conveyance. This new method also stabilizes the hole so that the drill string may be removed to recover a rock core sample. ...|$|E
50|$|Social {{behavior}} and cooperation with other participants are two {{factors that are}} not modeled in traditional game theory, but are often seen in an experimental setting. The evolution of social norms has been neglected in decision-making models, but these norms influence {{the ways in which}} real people interact with one another and make choices. One tendency is for a person to be a strong reciprocator. This type of person enters a game with the predisposition to cooperate with other players. They will increase their cooperation levels in response to cooperation from other players and decrease their cooperation levels, even at their own expense, to punish players who do not cooperate. This is not utility-maximizing behavior, as a strong reciprocator is willing to reduce their payoff in order to encourage cooperation from others. Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) developed a model based on reciprocity called the sequential reciprocity equilibrium. This model adapts traditional game theory logic to the idea that players <b>reciprocate</b> <b>actions</b> in order to cooperate. The model had been used to more accurately predict experimental outcomes of classic games such as the prisoner's dilemma and the centipede game. Rabin (1993) also created a fairness equilibrium that measures altruism's effect on choices. He found that when a player is altruistic to another player the second player is more likely to reciprocate that altruism. This is due to the idea of fairness. Fairness equilibriums take the form of mutual maximum, where both players choose an outcome that benefits both of them the most, or mutual minimum, where both players choose an outcome that hurts both of them the most. These equilibriums are also Nash equilibriums, but they incorporate the willingness of participants to cooperate and play fair.|$|R

We find a strong homophily effect for females and higher clustering coefficients of females in trade and attack networks.
