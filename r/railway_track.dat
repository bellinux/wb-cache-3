5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double <b>railway</b> <b>track.</b> The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn reminder of the tragedy of 1879.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{two of the}} disused {{platforms}} {{hosted a}} theatrical performance of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit. The audience was seated {{either side of the}} actual <b>railway</b> <b>track.</b> The show included the use of a steam locomotive coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (propelled by a diesel locomotive). The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E

5|$|Brookwood {{station on}} the former LSWR line (now the South Western Main Line and the Alton Line) is little changed since the 1903 {{expansion}} and rebuilding. It remains in use both by commuters from the village which has grown {{to the north of}} the railway line, and by visitors to the cemetery to the south of the line. A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway, consisting of a short length of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> on the former trackbed, was erected in 2007 outside the southern (cemetery-side) entrance to the station.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway line from {{the city to the}} Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|E
5|$|Rail {{connectivity}} in Mangalore {{was established}} in 1907. Mangalore was also {{the starting point of}} India's longest rail route. The city has two railway stations—Mangalore Central (at Hampankatta) and Mangalore Junction (at Kankanadi). A <b>railway</b> <b>track,</b> built through the Western Ghats, connects Mangalore with Hassan. The broad gauge track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan was opened to freight traffic in May 2006 and passenger traffic in December 2007. Mangalore is also connected to Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kollam through the Southern Railway and to Mumbai, Bhatkal, Karwar, Gujarat, Ajmer and Goa via the Konkan Railway.|$|E

5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> led from the fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry {{had long since}} been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham <b>Railway</b> <b>track</b> cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him {{time to make a}} success of the gardens; {{by the end of the}} 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.|$|E

5|$|In a flashback, {{after losing}} his mother, Gopal, in his sorrow had been {{wandering}} aimlessly at Singapore. In a nightclub, he meets a singer named Chitra. He gets {{attracted to her}} and they decide to marry, {{in the presence of}} Chitra's brother Raju. But he is disappointed— from the very first day of their marriage, she comes home inebriated, and despite his repeated requests, has little respect for tradition and family values. Eventually, Gopal's father dies of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's drunken behaviour on Gopal's birthday. Gopal tries to control Chitra, but she is always irritated by his acts. At one point, she tries to leave him. Gopal begs her to change her decision, but Chitra still leaves. The next day, he hears that Chitra had died on a <b>railway</b> <b>track,</b> and this hurts him a lot. Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{first noticed}} {{construction}} activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> and the offloading stores {{into the old}} quarry. After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the cliff face below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top, installed to conceal the dome. The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from Westphalia, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome. The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.|$|E

5|$|Preceded by mixed Universal Carrier and {{motorcycle}} reconnaissance detachments, the 192nd and 193rd Regiments {{began moving}} to their designated areas after noon, and arrived there at nightfall. At this point, 192nd Regiment could muster only 295 men, while another 241 {{could not be}} moved by vehicle—presumably due to {{the large number of}} breakdowns and the lack of spare parts—and were ordered to proceed to Kilkis. Shortly after 17:00, about 45 German planes bombed the 192nd Regiment at the village of Theodorovo. Two officers and 15 men were killed, over 50 personnel were wounded, while two Carriers, ten Austins and ten motorcycles were destroyed, effectively destroying the 2nd Open Tank Company as a combat formation. Col. Sionidis' command, which was also in the village, suffered 13 dead and 45 wounded. Despite these losses, the 192nd Regiment reached its assigned positions, where it divided in two Resistance Centres: left, with the Tank Battalion and one of the 47mm anti-tank troops, and the right, with the Foot Battalion and a 20mm anti-tank troop. First German probing attacks during the night were successfully repelled. 193rd Regiment was more fortunate; it reached its deployment area without major obstacles, although a reconnaissance patrol clashed with the Germans near Kato Sourmena, and returned with a German prisoner. On the same evening, the division's 3.7cm Flak shot down a German reconnaissance plain over Krisia railway station, and reconnaissance patrols reported German infiltration along the entire line of the <b>railway</b> <b>track</b> between Mouries and Rodopoli. During the night, the division was allocated reinforcements from the 1st Security Battalion of Thessaloniki in the form of two infantry companies (one for each of the 192nd and 193rd Regiments), two MG squads and a 75mm battery. In order to reconstitute the 192nd Regiment's 2nd Open Tank Company, divisional command ordered the crews of the two Italian-equipped Closed Tank Companies to abandon their vehicles and help man the Universal Carriers. The Italian tanks were hence abandoned and took no part in the fighting, but the reorganization of the 2nd Open Tank Company was not completed until April 8. 191st Regiment was also ordered to send a squadron of its Tank Company to the Rupel Pass.|$|E
