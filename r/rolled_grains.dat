In general, growing cattle fed corn or grain sorghum silages out-performed those fed forage sorghum silages. Only forage sorghums with moderate grain yields supported gains approaching those from grain sorghum silages.

40|$|Multi-pass {{fusion welding}} by a filler {{material}} (wire) is normally carried out to join thick steel sections used in most engineering applications. Multiple thermal cycles from a multi-pass weld resulted in a variable distribution of residual stress field across the weld and through the thickness. Presence of tensile residual stresses can be detrimental to the integrity and the service behaviour of the welded joint. In addition to a complex distribution of residual stress state, multi-pass welds also form dendritic grain structure, which are repeatedly heated, resulting in segregation of alloying elements. In this research, microstructural refinement with modification of residual stress state was attempted by applying post-weld cold rolling followed by laser processing and then cold rolling. The residual stress was determined non-destructively by using neutron diffraction. Post-weld cold rolling followed by laser processing was carried out to induce recrystallization of the cold <b>rolled</b> <b>grains.</b> Microstructural characterisation indicates a significant grain refinement near the capping pass. However, post-weld cold rolling followed by laser processing reinstates the lock-in stress. In this study, it was demonstrated that a complete recrystallized microstructure with compressive state of stress can be formed when a further cold rolling is applied on the laser processed, recrystallized microstructure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAISI Type 304 L {{austenitic}} stainless steels are extensively used in industries, and welding is an indispensable tool used for joining these materials. In a multi-pass weld, the development of residual stress {{to a large extent}} depends on the response of the weld metal, heat affected zone and parent material to complex thermo-mechanical cycles during welding. Earlier researchers on this area used either mechanical tensioning or heat treatment to modify the residual stress distribution in and around the weld. In this research, microstructural refinement with modification of residual stress state was attempted by using high pressure cold rolling followed by laser processing in 12 mm thick 304 L {{austenitic stainless}} steels which is a novel technique. The hardening of the weld metal was evaluated after welding, post weld cold rolling, and post weld cold rolling followed by laser processing. The residual stress was determined non-destructively by using neutron diffraction. Residual stress analysis show that post weld cold rolling was effective in modifying the longitudinal residual stress distribution throughout the entire thickness. Post weld cold rolling followed by laser processing performed in this research was to induce recrystallization of the cold <b>rolled</b> <b>grains.</b> However, post weld cold rolling followed by laser processing showed minor grain refinement but was not effective as it reinstated the stress state...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Deformation {{characteristics}} of cold <b>rolled</b> <b>grains</b> and {{their contribution to}} the development of recrystallization texture in IF steel were investigated using EBSD. Quantitative evaluation of the intra-granular orientation spread in the deformed grains was attempted. Both of the GAM and SGS could represent the orientation spread but in different manner. The GAM value was higher in { 111 }//ND orientations than in other orientation groups implying steep orientation gradient within short ranges in { 111 }//ND oriented grains. This steep orientation gradient was generally originated from the existence of deformation heterogeneities. Particularly, { 111 } orientation which was the dominant component in the recrystallization texture showed the maximum values of both GAM and SGS, which was caused by the frequent development of shear bands. SGS values of { 001 }//ND oriented soft grains were unexpectedly large in spite of their small GAM values. It could be confirmed that their uniform deformation behavior led to the gentle but monotonous orientation gradient in long ranges. The lowest values of both GAM and SGS were obtained in the { 112 } orientation, probably, because of the highest orientation stability in that orientation during plain strain deformation condition. GAM was more closely related {{to the development of}} recrystallization texture and the significance of the steep orientation gradient in the recrystallization behavior should be re-addressed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{machining}} of hard turning {{is carrying}} out on hardened steel {{in the range}} of 45 to 68 Rockwell hardness. It is substitute to traditional grinding process is a flexible, productive and successful machining process for hardened metals. Hence mainly used in various uses such as dies, moulds, tools, gears, cams, shafts, axles, bearings and forgings. The machining of hardened steel using superior tool materials such as coated carbide inserts, mixed ceramic inserts and cubic boron carbide nitride(CBN) have higher merits than traditional grinding such as high material removal rate, can produce good surface finish, reduced processing costs, ability to machine narrow walled sections and minimum environmental problems without using cutting fluid. Although the process is accomplish with small depth of cut and feed rates, evaluate to minimizing the machining time as high as 60 % in hard turning process. In this paper, the machining of AISI D 2 steel workpiece having 66 HRC hardness is carried out using coated carbide insert. The microstructure shows <b>rolled</b> <b>grains</b> of the steel along the direction of the material. The microstructure shows fine grains of cementite with the grain boundary chromium and other alloys and the presence of carbide, which increases strength and wearresistant.

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} the feeding value of grain sorghum relative to corn and various grain processing methods for grain sorghum. It {{has been widely}} recognized that grain sorghum (milo) must be processed to be efficiently used by finishing cattle. Grain sorghum shows more improved utilization from processing than corn, wheat and barley. Dry ground or <b>rolled</b> <b>grain</b> sorghum has a relative feeding value of 85 % to 95 % (avg 90 %) of dry <b>rolled</b> corn. Processing <b>grain</b> sorghum by more sophisticated methods (early harvesting, steam-flaking, etc.) greatly enhances its feeding value. Chemical composition suggests {{that there should be}} less difference in the feeding value of grain sorghum compared with corn than what actually exists. Starch, which represents 70 % of the dry matter, and protein appear to be less digestible in grain sorghum than in other grains. The rate that starch is digested in the rumen of cattle is also much slower for grain sorghum than for other grains. Thus, processing grain sorghum increases rate and extent of starch digestion resulting in large improvements in its feeding value...|$|R

40|$|Hot band Fe- 3 %Si steel (CRGO or cold <b>rolled</b> <b>grain</b> oriented) {{was cold}} rolled with {{different}} reductions. The main {{objective of this}} study was an overall understanding of deformation texture and microstructure development. Hot band CRGO had a strong alpha-fiber (RD//[110]) texture. Cold reduction strengthened the alpha and gamma (ND//[111]) fibers, but weakened theta (ND//(100)). All Taylor type deformation texture models were reasonably successful in predicting these bulk texture developments, and the Lamel model seems to be the 'best-fit' model, both in terms of a 'deviation' parameter (indicating differences between experimental and simulated values of idealized texture components) and a 'trend' parameter (indicating the relative change(s) in texture components with strain). The striking feature of the microstructure was the 'selective' appearance of grain interior strain localization's. These appeared at approximately 37 degrees with the rolling direction (RD). Though 37 degrees bands appeared only in orientations with high Taylor factor (M), the absolute value of the Taylor factor alone, was not enough for the appearance of such bands.

The total starch content (TS) was determined directly by liquid chromatography (TS 1) and as sum of resistant and non-resistant starch using a specific enzymatic kit before the spectrophotometric reading (TS 2). In vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) by pepsin-cellulase technique was also estimated. The content of resistant starch was low in the cereals (on average 2. 0 % of the total starch), except for the whole corn samples. TS 1 values were lower than TS 2, particularly at lower starch levels. The in vitro OMD values ranged from 66. 8 % (whole white oats) to 95. 7 % (flaked corn).
