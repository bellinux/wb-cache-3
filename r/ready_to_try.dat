5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|Smetana {{did not act}} {{immediately}} on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending {{the building of a}} permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written The Brandenburgers in Bohemia to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. The Brandenburgers, which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's Der Barbier, and was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> his own hand at the comic genre.|$|E
25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, they walked into a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays {{a big part in}} helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E

This group rapidly expanded to include Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz and eventually a large circle of players. Gygax sent the 50 pages of rules to his wargaming contacts {{and asked them to}} playtest the new game. Gygax and Arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns, calling the amalgamation of Blackmoor and Greyhawk [...] "The Great Kingdom". This collaboration gradually petered out as Gygax and Arneson realized their visions for the new game were diverging.|$|E

This collection of objects, and a phone message from a tailor reminding the occupant that [...] "the cassock was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> on", along with the fact of the Pope's impending visit, was enough for Police Major Francisco F.

2500|$|According to one account, the Maharishi {{beginning}} in 1959, began [...] "building an infrastructure" [...] using a [...] "mass marketing model" [...] for teaching the TM technique to Westerners. First, the Maharishi visited the U.S. {{because he felt}} that its people were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something new, {{and the rest of}} the world would then [...] "take notice". By the same token, author Philip Goldberg says the Maharishi's insistence that TM was easy to do was not a [...] "marketing ploy", but rather [...] "a statement about the nature of the mind." [...] In 1963 the Maharishi published his first book on Transcendental Meditation called The Science of Being and Art of Living. [...] In the mid-1960s, the TM organization began presenting its meditation to students via a campaign led by a man named Jerry Jarvis who had taken the TM course in 1961. By 1966, the Students Meditation Society (SIMS) had begun programs in U.S. colleges such as University of California, Berkeley, Harvard, Yale and others, and was a [...] "phenomenal success".|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{there was}} a {{movement}} to resettle free-born blacks and freed slaves who faced racial discrimination {{in the form of}} political disenfranchisement, and the denial of civil, religious and social privileges in the United States. [...] Most whites and later a small cadre of black nationalists believed that blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The American Colonization Society was founded in 1816 in Washington, DC for this purpose, by a group of prominent politicians and slaveholders. But its membership grew to include mostly people who supported abolition of slavery. Slaveholders wanted to get free people of color out of the South, where they were thought to threaten the stability of the slave societies. Some abolitionists collaborated on relocation of free blacks, as they were discouraged by racial discrimination against them in the North and believed they would never be accepted in the larger society. Most blacks, who were native-born by this time, wanted to work toward justice in the United States rather than emigrate. Leading activists in the North strongly opposed the ACS, but some free blacks were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a different environment.|$|E

2500|$|Through the Klapmeiers' vision, the SR20 {{became the}} first of many {{aviation}} advancements within production aircraft, including glass computer-monitored flight-displays instead of round analog dials (which would boast flat-panel avionic utilities such as satellite weather, traffic awareness and GPS steering), side-yoke flight controls instead of traditional yoke or stick consoles, all-composite construction instead of aluminum, and, most popularly known, the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). The Cirrus team spent several weeks during the summer of 1997 in the high desert of southern California testing the parachute. They would drop barrels of sand out a C-123 Cargo plane and flip a switch that would deploy the chutes when the barrels reached nearly 200mph. By the summer of 1998, they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> the tests with an actual SR20. Chief Test Pilot Scott D. Anderson, a Stanford graduate and [...] "Renaissance man" [...] who was known as a beloved and charismatic figure in Duluth, successfully made the first deployment of CAPS, and would go on to make all seven of the inflight test-deployments for development and certification of the SR20.

[...] Four Billboard writers reviewed the track. Giving it three-and-a-half stars, Jason Lipshutz said Gomez's [...] "PG-13-rated yearning and Rocky's braggadocio never quite align enough to make thematic sense". Columnist Erin Strecker deemed the song [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "grown-up" [...] and quipped that Gomez was [...] "clearly <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something new". Joe Lynch stated that it [...] "finds her sounding like a grown woman (for perhaps the first time ever?)". Chris Martins said the song was [...] "a testament to [...] taking the reins of her career". Carl Williott and Mike Wass of Idolator deemed it Gomez's [...] "reinvention single", with the latter deducing that she sounded [...] "almost-unrecognizable" [...] on [...] "Good for You". He {{felt it was a}} reinvention and growth in her artistry, calling the song a [...] "refreshingly original anthem", and complimenting its [...] "unusually artful balance" [...] of genres. Dave Hanratty from Drowned in Sound described Gomez's growth from [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] as [...] "astonishing", calling [...] "Good for You" [...] a [...] "fresh chapter" [...] for Gomez and [...] "the sexiest scorched earth policy you're ever likely to hear".

[...] The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain.
