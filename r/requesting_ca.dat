40|$|Given {{that the}} {{operating}} system supports multiple processes, there may be various interactions among them. We will study three rather different types of interactions: • Access to shared operating system data structures. This issue is concernedwith internal operating system integrity. The problem is that several processesmayrequest {{the operating system}}to take relatedactions, which require updates to internal operating system data structures. Note that thereisonlyoneoperatingsystem, butmanyprocesses. Thereforetheoperating system data structures are shared in some way by all the processes. Updates to such shared data structures must be made with care, so that data is not corrupted. • Deadlock due to resource contention.

30|$|If {{at a later}} instant in time, a {{receiver}} would like to prove that a message was indeed generated by the source (i.e., nonrepudiation), the receiver can simply send a nonrepudiation <b>request</b> to the <b>CA.</b> Upon receiving the <b>request,</b> the <b>CA</b> discloses one of the previously undisclosed MAC keys for the message in question. The receiver can compute the MAC for the message with the newly disclosed key and compare the MAC with the set of MACs it had saved previously. If the CA and the receiver operates correctly, the newly computed MAC will match one of the saved MACs. Since (i) the undisclosed MAC keys were known only to the source and the CA, and (ii) the CA is universally trusted, therefore the saved MAC must have been computed by the source using its MAC key and hence the message must have been generated by the source. Thus nonrepudiation is achieved.|$|R

30|$|Key {{distribution}} as a service: The KD service operates with {{symmetric encryption}} and shares secret symmetric keys for the encryption and decryption {{of the data}} stored in document-based NoSQL. KD service separately manages the keys for each user and for each resource. A complete mapping between keys, users, and document-oriented database resources is provided to avoid conflicts and searching overhead. This service is also responsible for creating, managing, and distributing the keys across different services within the proposed system. PDP service sends an attribute query request (discussed in the next section) to the KD service for the retrieval of keys from the KD database. KD service validates the <b>request</b> through <b>CA</b> (FIPS 196 protocol) and checks for keys corresponding to the attributes mentioned in the request. The keys are passed to the encryption service for further processing of encryption/decryption operation.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} last {{unexplored}} regime of the asymmetric six-vertex model: the low-temperature {{phase of the}} so-called ferroelectric model. The original publication of the exact solution, by Sutherland, Yang, and Yang, and various derivations and reviews published afterwards, do not contain many details about this regime. We study the exact solution for this model, by numerical and analytical methods. In particular, we examine {{the behavior of the}} model in the vicinity of an unusual coexistence point that we call the ``conical'' point. This point corresponds to additional singularities in the free energy that were not discussed in the original solution. We show analytically that in this point many polarizations coexist, and that unusual scaling properties hold in its vicinity.

40|$|The Globus Toolkit is {{properly}} configured {{open source software}} for setting up grid nodes across multiple heterogeneous platforms. The process of grid enabling a machine is a long one involving Globus Toolkit installation, certificate requests generation, signing certificate <b>requests</b> by <b>CA</b> (Certificate Authority), installation of signed certificates, configuring various grid services and some basic testing {{to ensure that the}} setup is correct. Generally, a grid deployment is done across a large number of distributed machines. In such cases, the process of grid enabling becomes tedious and time-consuming more so in a heterogeneous environment. This paper proposes a solution for grid infrastructure deployment across multiple heterogeneous distributed machines in parallel using SmartFrog (Smart Framework for Object Groups) technology. SmartFrog is a framework for configuring and automatically activating distributed applications. SmartFrog helps in abstracting the configuration for grid enabling process and its runtime environment automatically triggers installations across distributed machines. The initial results we achieved on experimental setups are encouraging. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} orthorhombicity on Josephson {{tunneling}} in high T$_c$ superconductors such as YBCO is studied for both single crystals and highly twinned crystals. It is shown that experiments on highly twinned crystals experimentally determine the symmetry of the superconducting twin boundaries (which {{can be either}} even or odd {{with respect to a}} reflection in the twinning plane). Conversely, Josephson experiments on highly twinned crystals can not experimentally determine whether the superconductivity is predominantly $s$-wave or predominantly $d$-wave. The direct experimental determination of the order-parameter symmetry by Josephson tunneling in YBCO thus comes from the relatively few experiments which have been carried out on untwinned single crystals.

40|$|Supersymmetric (SUSY) {{theories}} are often thought to give large branching ratios for b → s γ from charged Higgs loops. We {{show that in}} many cases chargino loop contributions can cancel those of the Higgs, and SUSY can give B(b → s γ) at or below the prediction. We show this occurs because the large stop mass splittings usually found in SUSY break a GIM mechanism suppression. These effects are strongly enhanced by large tanβ, so that B(b → s γ) is very sensitive to the value of tanβ, contrary to what has been claimed. We also note that the supergravity relation B_ 0 = A_ 0 - 1 is somewhat disfavored over the general case. Comment: TRI-PP- 93 - 66. 12 pp (Plain LATEX) + 4 fig not incl.

40|$|Proton {{transfer}} {{rates and}} mechanisms are studied in mesoscopic, liquid-state, molecular clusters. The proton transfer {{occurs in a}} proton-ion complex solvated by polar molecules comprising the cluster environment. The rates and mechanisms of the reaction are studied using both adiabatic and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. For large molecular clusters, the proton-ion complex resides primarily {{on the surface of}} the cluster or one layer of solvent molecules inside the surface. The proton transfer occurs as the complex undergoes orientational fluctuations on the cluster surface or penetrates one solvent layer into the cluster leading to solvent configurations that favor the transfer. For smaller clusters the complex resides mostly {{on the surface of the}} cluster and proton transfer is observed only when the complex penetrates the cluster and solvent configurations that favor the proton transfer are achieved. Quantitative information on the cluster reaction rate constants is also presented. Comment: To appear in JCP (March).

40|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to integrate EPICS functionality with National Instruments LabVIEW. With existing EPICS code, labs want to reuse the code while still being able to use LabVIEW to interface with FPGA enabled embedded controllers and other COTS hardware. In this paper, we will show how we can run EPICS IOC simultaneously with LabVIEW on VxWorks based hardware. We will go into the implementation details and the benchmarks that will be obtained from the LANSCE-R project at Los Alamos National Labs. We will also examine ways to implement a Channel Access(CA) server natively in LabVIEW. This will open up the opportunity to use a variety of IO and different operating systems that LabVIEW can interface with. The native LabVIEW CA server will implement all Channel Access functionality exposed by a standard EPICS IOC such as synchronous and asynchronous publishing of data, alarm processing, and response to connection <b>requests</b> by <b>CA</b> clients. We will finally cover the programming of FPGA allowing for custom solutions. Several {{attempts have}} been made to integrate EPICS functionality with National Instruments LabVIEW.

GSI implemented LabVIEW and EPICS DIM interfaces to allow the two execution systems to interact [2] [3].

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this article is to give an {{overview}} of the complexities and unexpected regulatory requirements for obtaining approval of multinational and multicentre non-interventional studies (NIS) in the European Union (EU). Methods: The websites of national competent authorities (CAs), ethics committees (ECs) and data protection (DP) authorities were consulted to find regulations and guidance information related to the authorisation of NIS in various member states of the EU. Results: Many additional hurdles, neither disclosed nor clear in the various regulations/guidances for NIS, were identified. Although approval from the CA is not needed for NIS, in many countries <b>request</b> of <b>CA</b> opinion is nevertheless recommended, prior to submission to the EC, to obtain confirmation that the planned NIS does not fall in the interventional trial category. Clinical trial insurance was required in some countries. In countries like Belgium and Italy, the multicentre NIS required the approval from a central EC and local ECs as a single central EC opinion was not considered sufficient. The EC document requirements for submission and the fees were extremely variable among all member states. Additional approvals from data protection authorities and insurance companies were required in some countries. Conclusions: The process of obtaining approval for multicentre and multinational NIS is time consuming due to lack of transparency and the different regulatory requirements among member states. The EU pharmacovigilance legislation and clinical trial regulation No 536 / 2014 is a step forward in providing a regulatory framework for PASS (post-authorisation safety studies) and low intervention clinical trials, but since regulation No 536 / 2014 excludes NIS, it will be difficult to enforce harmonization of requirements for approval of NIS among member states...|$|R

40|$|Flux-tubes in {{different}} representations of SU(2) and U(1) lattice gauge theories {{in three dimensions}} are measured. Wilson loops generate heavy "quark-antiquark" pairs in fundamental (j= 1 / 2), adjoint (j= 1), and quartet (j= 3 / 2) representations of SU(2). The first direct lattice measurements of the flux-tube cross-section A_j {{as a function of}} representation are made. It is found that A_j ≈ constant, to about 10 %. Results are consistent with a connection between the string tension σ_j and A_j suggested by a simplified flux-tube model, σ_j = g^ 2 j(j+ 1) / (2 A_j) [g is the gauge coupling], given that σ_j scales like the Casimir j(j+ 1), as observed in previous lattice studies in both three and four dimensions. The results can discriminate among phenomenological models of the physics underlying confinement. Flux-tubes for singly- and doubly-charged Wilson loops in compact QED_ 3 are also measured. It is found that the string tension scales as the squared-charge and the flux-tube cross-section is independent of charge to good approximation. These SU(2) and U(1) simulations lend some support, albeit indirectly, to a conjecture that the dual superconductor mechanism underlies confinement in compact gauge theories in both three and four dimensions.

40|$|We {{consider}} both equilibrium and kinetic {{aspects of}} the phase separation (``thermal faceting") of thermodynamically unstable crystal surfaces into a hill [...] valley structure. The model we study is an Ising lattice gas for a simple cubic crystal with nearest [...] neighbor attractive interactions and weak next [...] nearest [...] neighbor repulsive interactions. It is likely applicable to alkali halides with the sodium chloride structure. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} fact that the equilibrium crystal shape can be interpreted as a phase diagram and that the details of its structure tell us into which surface orientations an unstable surface will decompose. We find that, depending on the temperature and growth conditions, a number of interesting behaviors are expected. For a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor, these include a low temperature regime with logarithmically [...] slow separation into three symmetrically [...] equivalent facets, and a higher temperature regime where separation proceeds as a power law in time into an entire one [...] parameter family of surface orientations. For a crystal slightly out of equilibrium with its vapor (slow crystal growth or etching), power [...] law growth should be the rule at late enough times.

Constructing the resolvent of the corresponding Hamiltonian by means of Krein's formula, we analyze its spectral and scattering properties. The bound state [...] problem is analogous to that of point interactions in the plane: since a two [...] dimensional point interaction is never repulsive, there are m discrete eigenvalues, 1 < m< N, the lowest of which is nondegenerate. On the other hand, due to the presence of the boundary the point interactions give rise to infinite series of resonances; if the coupling is weak they approach the thresholds of higher transverse modes. We derive also spectral and scattering properties for point perturbations in several related models: a cylindrical surface, both of a finite and infinite heigth, threaded by a magnetic flux, and a straight strip which supports a potential independent of the transverse coordinate. As for strips with an infinite number of point perturbations, we restrict ourselves to the situation when the latter are arranged periodically; we show that in distinction to the case of a point [...] perturbation array in the plane, the spectrum may exhibit any finite number of gaps. Finally, we study numerically conductance fluctuations in case of random point perturbations. Comment: a LaTeX file, 38 pages, to appear in Ann.

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} mixed methods study {{traces the}} request development of eight UK based students learning German in Germany and Austria. Although language socialisation {{was used as}} an underlying contextual framework, the main focus was on the development of politeness as operationalised in requests, and the factors which may have influenced this development such as the establishment of an L 2 identity and membership in communities of practice (CofPs). Five participants were English native speakers, two had grown up bilingually, one speaking Croatian and English and the other Italian and Twi, and one was a French native speaker. The requests were primarily elicited in semi-structured role plays carried out with German native speakers, yet the participants were also asked to record authentic interactions in service encounter scenarios, expected to lead to the utterance of requests. The role play data, which amount to 144 role plays, were collected before, during and after the students’ stay abroad. In-sojourn, the participants were also asked to record authentic exchanges, three of which were used in the present study. In addition, the students were also interviewed pre-in-and post-sojourn (24 interviews) and were asked to fill in an online background questionnaire before going abroad and a language engagement questionnaire while they were abroad. The role plays were coded based on the CCSARP coding scheme to determine the degree of directness and of internal and external mitigation in learner requests. The authentic data were analysed with Conversation Analysis. The data show a shift towards more directness, i. e. less internal and more external mitigation in-sojourn, thus indicating an adaptation to target community specific language behaviour. However, the degree of adaptation varied partly in line with participants’ degree of awareness of differences in linguistic politeness and identification with German society, and partly in line with the extent of their engagement with local CofPs. The variables which mostly influenced the change between pre-and in-sojourn request realisations, were the awareness of differences in linguistic politeness and the successful establishment of an L 2 identity. Interaction with the host-community, which did not have a noticeable influence on the general pre- to in-sojourn change data, and awareness of difference in linguistic politeness, did however impact the change in pre- to in-sojourn <b>request</b> variation. The <b>CA</b> analysis of the authentic exchanges and the corresponding role plays both show the same preference structure for requests, thus providing researchers in the field with important new validation for role play methodology...|$|R
