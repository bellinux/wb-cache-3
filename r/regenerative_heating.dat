50|$|<b>Regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution when it was used in the hot blast process on blast furnaces, It was later used in glass and steel making, to increase the efficiency of open hearth furnaces, and in high pressure boilers and chemical and other applications, where it continues to be important today.|$|E
50|$|As first developed, {{it worked}} by {{alternately}} storing {{heat from the}} furnace flue gas in a firebrick-lined vessel with multiple chambers, then blowing combustion air through the hot chamber. This is known as <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating.</b> Hot blast was invented and patented for iron furnaces by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland, but was later applied in other contexts, including late bloomeries. Later the carbon monoxide in the flue gas was burned to provide additional heat.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{technique}} of hot blast used iron for the <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> medium. Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. Edward Alfred Cowper developed the Cowper stove in 1857. [...] This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem. The Cowper stove was also {{capable of producing}} high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces. The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.|$|E

50|$|As {{the piston}} is pushed inward, it uncovers exhaust ports in the {{cylinder}} wall. The supercritical water has now given up enough energy through expansion {{that it is}} in a vapor state. This exhaust vapor passes out of the exhaust ports in the cylinder wall and across <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> coils, which are wrapped around the cylinder. The heat from the exhaust vapor is used to preheat the water in these tubes before it enters the steam generator. The vapor then passes into the condenser.|$|E
5000|$|Adopting coal as {{the main}} source of fuel created {{numerous}} problems for glass production. Burning coal produced short flames which shifted the location of the hearth from the far ends of the furnace to the center. Air draughts are also necessary to create a <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> system for glassmelting. [...] Early coal furnaces, such as at Bolsterstone, contain underground flues to provide an easy way to remove ash.Additionally, the carbon from the coal fumes contaminated the glass in the uncovered pots which created a dark and often uneven colour. Lids, such as those found at Bolsterstone, needed to be implemented to prevent these impurities.Glass bottles from this initial transition are often dark in color.|$|E
50|$|The {{condenser}} is a {{stack of}} interleaved circular plates, with an open core containing an impeller and a condensate sump underneath it. The exhaust vapor enters {{the top of the}} condenser from the piston block and is forced by the impeller onto the sides of the condenser and into the leaves of the circular plates. On the outside of the plates, a blower circulates air around the interleaved plates. This effectively condenses the exhaust vapor, which falls into the condensate sump {{at the bottom of the}} engine. A high pressure pump then pumps the condensate out of the sump, through the <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> coils around the cylinder, and back into the steam generator.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{thermal value}} theory, {{the aim of}} this paper is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical heating furnaces. Heat transfer models for continuous heating furnaces, batch-type heating furnaces, and <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> furnaces are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, thermal value equations of continuous, batch-type, and <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> furnaces are derived.

A <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger (sometimes called, simply, a "regenerator" in the Stirling-engine art) is basically a thermal capacitor: Its role in the Stirling cycle is to alternately accept heat from, then deliver heat to, an oscillating flow of a working fluid between compression and expansion volumes, without introducing an excessive pressure drop.

The increase of <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> transfer affects the efficiency of the steam generator through a degradation of the outlet steam quality: the number of bayonet tubes required to remove the nominal power increases with the increase of the global heat transfer coefficient of the inner tube. A higher inner diameter results in a larger surface area for the <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and in a higher heat transfer coefficient in the annular region because of the reduction of the cross section.

40|$|Abstract. For {{the problem}} of the {{abandoned}} large-scale wind power currently, in order to improve the utilization of wind power and make full use of wind resources, a method of using wind power to heat the condensed water through electrothermal furnace is proposed.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} power plants in past decades is the gas turbine. Significant {{studies have been conducted}} on the effects of various design and operation parameters on gas turbine performance. However, it is still a challenge to find the optimal operating parameters for the best performance. One of the important parameters is the climate at which the gas turbine operates. The current study is on the performance of gas turbine with fog cooling, focusing on the effect of inlet air humidity and ambient temperature. The overall efficiency will be altered through inlet fog cooling and <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating.</b> Other components such as reheating are accompanied. The fog cooling is also compared to the chiller inlet cooling, in which the performance of coefficient (COP) varies with temperature difference. The analysis is conducted by using Aspen Plus software. The results indicate that a combination of fog cooling and regeneration as well as reheating can substantially improve the system thermal efficiency. Compared to the system with only fog cooling, the efficiency increases by 24. 5 % when both regeneration and reheat systems are combined to the fogging cooled system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{work is a}} first-of-a-kind {{feasibility}} study investigating technology options with gas/gas rotary heat exchangers for the water management in the integration of Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) plants with post-combustion carbon capture, with and without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). A range of configurations are examined for wet and dry cooling of the flue gas entering a post- combustion capture (PCC) absorption system, and <b>regenerative</b> <b>heating</b> of the CO 2 -depleted flue gas prior to the power plant stack. First, this work examines {{the addition of a}} gas/gas rotary heat exchanger to transfer heat from the exhaust gas entering the absorber into the CO 2 -depleted gas stream leaving the absorber. It then investigates the performance of a configuration with an additional air/gas rotary heater to further reduce exhaust flue gas temperature and water consumption, and, eventually, a more compact arrangement which combined the two heaters into a single gas/gas/air heater with a trisector configuration. A thermal performance analysis was conducted for each of the previous configurations, in order to evaluate the dimensions and the operational parameters of the heaters. By replacing the direct contact cooler traditionally used in PCC technology by a dry-cooling system, a significant reduction in the overall process water usage and cooling water consumption associated to the capture plant can be achieved. The second part of this work examines the use of a similar system for NGCC plant with EGR. This strategy increases CO 2 concentration in gas turbine exhaust gases and reduce O 2 induced solvent degradation. In addition to the heat and water balance around the absorber column of the PCC process, an important aspect of EGR is that recirculated gas stream temperature should be as low as possible so that the gas turbine performance is not compromised.
