40|$|This {{study shows}} that the {{political}} preferences of those responsible for retaining judges are strongly associated with judicial voting. The evidence supports the widespread belief that judges respond to political pressure {{in an effort to}} be reelected or reappointed. Using a data set of decisions in state supreme courts from 1995 - 98, I find that state supreme court judges who face retention decisions by Republicans tend to decide cases in accord with standard Republican policy. Judicial behavior is correspondingly liberal for judges facing retention decisions by Democrats. The results are strongest for judges facing partisan reelections. Among judges with conservative fundamental ideologies, those facing Democratic <b>retention</b> <b>agents</b> vote more liberally than those facing Republican <b>retention</b> <b>agents.</b> Similarly, judges' voting changes when the political preferences of the <b>retention</b> <b>agents</b> change.

A wide range of admixtures with different molecular weight and constant structure was prepared.

It appears that cellulose and guar gum derivatives, used as water retention agents, exhibit a significant molecular weight reduction according to the ultrasonic treatment duration. The water retention capacity of the mortars mixed with ultrasonically degraded admixture solutions increases with molecular weight for a same admixture.

Hence, it was possible to obtain an increase in cell retention on the cellulose fibres from 45 % to 75 %, within less than 5 min of contact between the carbamate and the pulp suspension. This effect increased with the concentration of carbamate solution in the fibre suspension (100 - 300 mgl- 1), and was always higher than in the absence of biocide...|$|E

40|$|The water {{extraction}} out of mortar during brick laying was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance. The experiments show that using a fired-clay brick, {{the water is}} extracted out of the mortar within 3 minutes, whereas {{in the case of}} a sand-lime brick this takes about 10 minutes. Prewetting a fired-clay brick hardly affects the {{water extraction}}, whereas prewetting a sand-lime brick slows down the water extraction, although the effect is small. The extraction process is slowed down only if the bricks are almost fully saturated. These effects are explained with the help of computer simulations. The final moisture content of the mortar is shown to depend on the suction of the brick and thereby on the equilibrium moisture content of the brick. By adding a water <b>retention</b> <b>agent</b> to the mortar, the extraction process seems to slow down, although the final moisture content of the mortar is not changed. The water extraction experiments suggest that the suction of the mortar which is formed depends on the water extraction rate and thereby on the type of brick that is used in the extraction experiment.

40|$|This article {{presents}} both an experimental {{as well as}} a theoretical study on the effect of MethylHy droxyEthylCellulose (MHEC) on drying in porous materials using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMR). MHEC, a water soluble polymer, is normally added to glue mortars as a water <b>retention</b> <b>agent</b> in order to improve the drying by increasing Accepted the open time. However, the exact processes that determine the drying rate of a glue mortar are unknown. In this study, we therefore focus on investigating the drying of a Fired day Brick (FCB) saturated with an aqueous MHEC solution. By using a FCB as a model system, the influence of hydration and changing of pore sizes due to hydration can be removed. The performed NMR experiments show a transition from homogeneous drying for a water saturated FCB toward an inhomogeneous (front receding) drying behavior for FCB saturated with increasing MHEC concentration. The capillary number (Ca) indicates a homogeneous drying for water saturated brick (Ca«i) and an inhomogeneous drying (Ca» 1) in case of saturated brick with more than 1. 5 wt% MHEC. Analysis of capillary number shows that the main parameter determining the capillary numbers are viscosity, surface tension, contact angle and evaporation rate. Among this viscosity change match with change in capillary number and therefore viscosity has a major influence on the drying behavior and rate. Based on the measured profiles, the moisture diffusivity is calculated. Using an empirical equation, the moisture diffusivity and NMR profiles were fitted to obtain the key parameters. From these analyses we conclude that 1) the moismre diffusivity scales with viscosity, which is the main parameter in shift in drying behavior. 2) Surprisingly, the presence of MHEC reduced the evaporation, which is unexpected since evaporation of MHEC solutions, for instance present in capillaries do not exhibit this behavior. 3) A minimum moisture diffusivity is found which shows to correlate to the evaporation process, which indicates that this might be the result of a vapor dominated diffusion flux...|$|E

40|$|Formation of fouling {{deposits}} is {{a serious}} problem facing paper mills. Despite the search for alternative methods, chemical biocides still represent the chief countermeasure to control microbial growth and general fouling buid-up in pulp and paper mills. The purpose of this work was to determine the effect of two biocides (carbamate and glutaraldehyde) on both planktonic cells and fouling layers of a paper machine system. A flow system was used for the study of fouling accumulation in an industrial white water circuit. Both biocides proved to be more effective in reducing the microbial loading of the white water circuit than the deposit accumulated on the stainless steel surfaces. Carbamate, in contrast to glutaraldehyde, had the ability of promoting cell agglomeration since the microbial loading decreased much more when the white water, treated with carbamate, was filtered through a filter-linen. The retention of suspended cells in the cellulose fibres acquires major importance since it is obtained by using an already existing physical process (filtration), which strongly enhances the overall microbial reduction obtained with the addition of the carbamate, without increasing the economic costs. These results also suggest that the use of conventional <b>retention</b> <b>agents</b> in pulp and paper processes can be efficient in controlling unwanted microbial effects.

Cortical venous partial retention that is due to slow non-dominant venous sinus drainage can increase local cerebral vein pressure, and cause related neurological impairment. This article is to investigate the diagnosis of local intracranial hypertension caused by abnormal non-dominant transverse sinus drainage {{and the effect of}} anticoagulation treatment. Methods From February 2008 to February 2016, there were 12 patients diagnosed as abnormal cerebral non-dominant transverse sinus drainage. Among these patients, 8 patients presented as dizziness and brain swelling; 2 presented as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); one presented as cerebral cortex bleeding; 2 presented as blurred vision; 2 presented as ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus; one presented as narcolepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of 2 patients were > 280 mm H 2 O. Nine patients were confirmed no abnormal characteristics by MRI. In DSA examination, 10 patients were confirmed non-dominant transverse sinus drainage and contrast <b>agent</b> <b>retention</b> on the left side, and 2 patients were confirmed on the right side. All patients were treated by anticoagulation, and 2 underwent stent implantation, 5 underwent thrombolysis through carotid artery. Results All patients were greatly improved after 7 -day treatment. They were discharged within 2 weeks and were continuously treated by anticoagulation after discharge for one year. There was no recurrence or aggravation in all patients during the follow-up period ranging from 6 to 34 months. Two patients were confirmed less contrast <b>agent</b> <b>retention</b> by DSA after 6 months.   Conclusions Abnormal non-dominant transverse sinus drainage can increase local cerebral vein pressure, and presents non-specific clinical features such as dizziness, headache or tinnitus.
