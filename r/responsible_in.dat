5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was <b>responsible</b> <b>in</b> the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded by {{the media}} and Head Coach Alain Vigneault for improving his defensive game. He had been criticized at times in the past for making risk/reward plays that resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become more <b>responsible</b> <b>in</b> the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured bone in his foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{were divided}} on which {{submarine}} was <b>responsible.</b> <b>In</b> Royal Australian Navy, 1942–1945, published in 1968 {{as part of}} the series detailing the Australian official history of World War II, George Hermon Gill concluded that either I-178 or I-180 was responsible; the former was more likely as she had served in Australian waters the longest of any Japanese submarine at the time, but had claimed no kills in the three-month period surrounding Centaurs sinking. In 1972, German military historian Jürgen Rohwer claimed in Chronology of the war at sea that I-177 torpedoed Centaur, based on a Japanese report stating that I-177 had attacked a ship on 14 May 1943 in the area the hospital ship had sunk. Japanese Rear Admiral Kaneyoshi Sakamoto, who had shown Rohwer the report, stated that Nakagawa and I-177 were responsible for the attack on Centaur in his 1979 book History of Submarine Warfare.|$|E

5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been <b>responsible</b> <b>in</b> some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|Jay and Mark Briscoe {{made their}} debuts for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) at Delaware Invasion on January 20, 2001, being {{brought in to}} job {{as part of a}} three-on-one {{handicap}} match against Trent Acid. At the inaugural Best of the Best event, a show somewhat atypical of CZW in that it is a tournament spotlighting athletic junior heavyweight wrestling as opposed to violent hardcore matches, the two advanced past the first round in a three-way match with Nick Mondo where the stipulation was whoever took the fall would be eliminated. They were then matched against each other in the second round, with Jay winning and advancing further. This match was seen by fans as the best of the tournament, and seen in retrospect as having been <b>responsible</b> <b>in</b> large part for helping launch the brothers' careers, as they were new to the independent circuit and very young at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records {{dating back to}} 1837. This program {{consisted}} of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. The owner was then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares. Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England. Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same. In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American stud book was published in 1882. In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded {{to compete with the}} Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were <b>responsible</b> <b>in</b> large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale.|$|E
