40|$|This paper uses a novel data source, namely German {{employee}} inventors' compensation records compiled {{in compliance}} with the German Employee Invention Act of 1957 to estimate the returns to patented inventions. In contrast to patent value estimates obtained from surveys and renewals, these records primarily provide a measure {{of the value of the}} use of the invention and not the value of patent protection. While indicators of patent value explain much of the variation in these patent value estimates, the values are only weakly correlated with the estimated <b>renewal</b> <b>value</b> of the patents. The distribution of patent value from these records is highly skew, with the vast majority of the returns earned by a select set of high valued patents, consistent with finding for other measures of patent value. The value estimates however are considerably lower than recent survey estimates with most of the patents having little or no realized value, suggesting that the returns appropriated through the use of an invention may represent only a fraction of the value of a patented invention.

40|$|In {{the first}} of the two {{companion}} papers, we show that the dynamic aspects of the license utilization decision in an uncertain environment, together with the usual policy of rewarding high license utilization with future license allocations. creates four components of the license price. These are the scarcity, asset, option, and <b>renewal</b> <b>value</b> components. Each of these components are identified and explored {{in the context of the}} existing literature. The effect of imperfections in the license market on license price paths is also explored. In the second paper, we use monthly data on license prices and utilization to test for the presence of imperfect competition in the market for apparel quota licenses in Hong Kong. A competitive structural model which respects the dynamic aspects of the problem is developed and estimated. We argue that concentration could affect the supply side as well as the demand side by affecting the cost associated with the search. The regressions indicate that concentration of license holdings affect the supply of licenses as predicted by models of imperfect competition. Since the implementation scheme encourages full utilization, imperfect competition affects the supply path of licenses rather than total supply. Concentration does not affect the demand side. which means that search costs are not an important consideration. ...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} the welfare {{consequences}} of quotas often assume perfect competition everywhere. If this assumption is not valid, welfare estimate and policy recommendations may err dramatically. The popular press often argues that market power is being exercised in markets constrained by import quotas. The authors develop a framework for testing the hypothesis of perfect competition {{in the market for}} apparel quota licenses. Drawing on simple models, they predict the behavior of license prices, taking into account four influences on prices: scarcity value, option value, <b>renewal</b> <b>value,</b> and asset value. They explore the effect of imperfections in the license market on license price paths. They test allegations that there is price fixing in the market for Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) apparel quota licenses in Hong Kong. (Hong Kong often serves as a benchmark case for the welfare consequences of the MFA.) They use monthly data on license prices and use rates to test for the presence of imperfect competition. They argue that a concentration of license holding could affect both the supply side and the demand side, by affecting the costs of search. These results accord well with the authors theoretical discussion, in which they point out that license use and price paths with imperfect competition in the license market may be quite different from the corresponding paths in the case of perfect competition - even though the total use of licenses is the same. The authors estimate the structural demand and supply equations of the model, which provide further evidence of imperfect competition in the license market. In particular, the intra-year path of quota license prices and of quota use are found to be affected by concentration in license holdings. The results, in short, suggest that market power exists in Hong Kong's quota license market. Hong Kong is often considered the prime example of perfect competition, so this has major implications for other developing countries.

We propose a conceptual framework for the relationships between user-induced and organisation-based renewal, and service innovation quality in the healthcare sector. By putting service innovativeness and organisational renewal at the input side of the healthcare organisations’ value creation process, and treating service innovation quality as an output, this study hypothesises direct relationships between these two ends. We conducted an empirical study in the Dutch healthcare sector. Based on data from 168 service innovation projects in Dutch healthcare organisations, the empirical study verifies these hypothesised relationships. The results reveal that both service innovativeness and organisational renewal are significant antecedents of quality improvement of the healthcare service innovations in these projects. This study provides theoretical and managerial implications for {{improving the quality of}} healthcare service innovations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of asset-liability management (ALM) is {{to measure and}} manage {{the degree to which}} the economic value of an insurer is adversely exposed to changes in interest rates. ALM is therefore a component of Enterprise Risk Management, which considers the impact of changes in other variables as well. As practiced by most insurers, ALM fails to take into account the existence of franchise value – the economic value to the firm of future <b>renewals.</b> Franchise <b>values</b> is not recognized by accounting rules, but can be a significant portion of an insurer’s market value. Incorporating franchise value into ALM is certainly essential, but it also poses a problem. For firms that have substantial franchise value, strategies that limit or minimize economic risk from changes in interest rates can create rating agency or regulatory problems, since these entities view the firm from an accounting, rather than an economic, point of view. The problem, then, is to identify a strategy that limits a firm’s exposure to interest rate risk while simultaneously limiting its exposure to accounting rules that could jeopardize its solvency or its ratings. The solution presented here lies in adopting a pricing strategy that controls the interest rate exposure of future cash flows from new business. This solution substantially extends the analysis first presented in Panning (1994) ...|$|R

40|$|Population structure, {{growth and}} {{production}} of the wedge clam Donax trunclus, inhabiting highly exposed sandy beaches of the littoral of Huelva (SW Spain) were investigated between January 2014 and July 2015. Growth rates were estimated comparing two different methods in the intertidal zones of beaches: (i) length-frequency distributions (LFD) analysis in two separated beaches (Doñana and Isla Canela) (ii) internal shell growth bands by thin shell cross sections (TS). For the TS methodology, valves were embedded in methyl-methacrylate, and sequential sections were grounded and polished to a thickness of 80 - 100 µm. This technique allowed the identification of annual ring depositions and the shell length-age keys were performed. In addition, several deformities (related to environmental stress or damages probably caused by fishing gears) as well as signs or recovery were observed. Both methodologies were equally appropriate to estimate growth of D. trunculus. Von Bertalanffy growth functions were established from LFD and TS using an asymptotic length (L∞) of 44. 8 mm and the growth constants (K) of 0. 5 (LF) and 0. 44 yr- 1 (TS). The intertidal biomass of D. trunculus ranged between 3. 03 - 3. 31 g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) m- 2 yr- 1.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the economic {{basis for the}} existence of business enterprise value in a shopping mall. The existence of business enterprise value in a mall is then tested by examining the rent paid by existing tenants on a lease renewal vs. that paid by new tenants for otherwise identical space. The hypothesis that there is no difference in rents between renewals and new tenants can be rejected. This suggests that with each lease renewal there is a marginal increase in business enterprise value component of the rents. Proposed federal regulations for the appraisal of federally related transactions, the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice, and real property tax law call for separation of the value of intangibles (which include business value) from tangible personal property and from real property. Thus the business value portion of the mall rental should not be capitalized into the value of the real estate. Because income from lease <b>renewals</b> included business <b>value,</b> the leases must be adjusted before they can be used as an indication of market rent. ...|$|R

As an investment, it {{can be interpreted as}} the simplest stochastic version of the point-in, point-out investment problem of Jevons [Jevons, W. S., Theory of Political Economy, Macmillan, London 1871]. This paper provides a compound variation of the Newsboy problem. Instead of demand simply being known as to its distribution, here demand is generated by customers arriving at different points in time requiring amounts of varying size. Arrivals follow a renewal process, and amounts required are each taken from a second independent distribution. It is shown how the optimal purchase quantity in explicit form depends on properties of the two distributions, maximising the expected net present value (NPV) of the payments involved. The solution to the compound problem will be the solution to the classical problem, if designing a special distribution for the demand process. The developments make use of the relation between the NPV and the Laplace transform, simultaneously using the Laplace transform as a moment-generating function.

Von Bertalanffy growth functions were established from length-frequency distributions using an asymptotic length (LN) of 44 mm and the growth constants (K) of 0. 46 and 0. 47 y 1 respectively of Mar de las Pampas and Faro Querand&# 305;Ž. Compared with growth studies four decades ago, D. hanleyanus today is growing more slowly, but is reaching a higher maximum length. Longevity {{is estimated to be}} approximately five years. The present study confirms that the overall growth performance index is habitat-specific, grouping Donacidae into tropical/subtropical, temperate and upwelling species. The intertidal biomass of D. hanleyanus ranged between 0. 04 and 1. 32 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m 2 yr 1. Individual production revealed the highest value at 30 mm length (0. 16 g AFDM m 2 yr 1) and annual production ranged between 0. 08 and 0. 99 g AFDMm 2 yr 1, resulting in <b>renewal</b> rate <b>values</b> (P/B) between 0. 82 and 2. 16.

A significant negative correlation between abundances of both surf clams suggests that abundance peaks of D. hanleyanus are related with population crashes of M. mactroides. Spatial differences in abundance are significantly related to sand texture as confirmed by nonmetrical multidimensional scaling, but not to sea surface temperature. However, the decrease of D. hanleyanus seems to be principally related to human activities...|$|R

Therefore, downscaling of precipitation and temperature has {{to be carried out}} from the GCM grids to smaller scales of a few square kilometres. Daily precipitation and temperature are modelled as stochastic processes coupled to atmospheric circulation. Precipitation is linked to circulation patterns (CPS) using conditional model parameters. Temperature is modelled using a simple autoregressive model conditioned on atmospheric circulation and local daily precipitation. The models use an automated objective classification of daily atmospheric circulation patterns based on optimized fuzzy rules. Both temperature and precipitation are downscaled to several locations taking into account the CP dependent spatial correlation. The models were applied to the Mesochora medium-sized mountainous catchment in Central Greece for validation using observed precipitation and temperature and observed classified geo-potential heights (at 700 hPa).

If we substantiate the paradigms of protection in the relationship that cultural heritage builds with a territory and its inhabitants, we could consider protection as a safeguard of co-evolutive potentiality of heritage itself, overcoming the old logic of denial of possible transformations. This approach outlines new and more positive scenarios in which heritage becomes catalyst for systemic and complex multidimensional process of production. Because cultural heritage, as any limited resource, requires measures of enhancement able to operate a controlled transformation without compromising its essence, the culture of projecting plays a strategic role for its subsistence and revaluation. With culture of projecting we mean a set of practices organisable in five steps: • Careful observation of reality on which action is taken; • Construction of interpretative models sufficiently simplified to treat operatively; • Formulation of hypotheses of model transformation; • Evaluation of the results (positive and negative); • Transfer of the changes to the simulated reality. Each step involves the fields of knowledge, practices, supporting technologies and control systems that, taken together, constitute a complex multidimensional and long-term design process. The paper describes the experience of participatory planning gained in the Cultural District Oltrepò Mantovano, conducted also through the involvement of practice and creative communities {{as well as the}} application of triggering models of bottom-up, which {{led to the creation of}} new businesses...|$|R
50|$|ISO 14001 was {{developed}} primarily to assist companies with {{a framework for}} better management control that can result in reducing their environmental impacts. In addition to improvements in performance, organizations can reap a number of economic benefits including higher conformance with legislative and regulatory requirements (Sheldon 1997) by adopting the ISO standard. By minimizing the risk of regulatory and environmental liability fines and improving an organization’s efficiency (Delmas 2009), benefits can include a reduction in waste, consumption of resources, and operating costs. Secondly, as an internationally recognized standard, businesses operating in multiple locations across the globe can leverage their conformance to ISO 14001, {{eliminating the need for}} multiple registrations or certifications (Hutchens 2010). Thirdly, there has been a push in the last decade by consumers for companies to adopt better internal controls, making the incorporation of ISO 14001 a smart approach for the long-term viability of businesses. This can provide them with a competitive advantage against companies that do not adopt the standard (Potoki & Prakash, 2005). This in turn can {{have a positive impact on}} a company's asset value (Van der Deldt, 1997). It can lead to improved public perceptions of the business, placing them in a better position to operate in the international marketplace (Potoki & Prakash 1997; Sheldon 1997). The use of ISO 14001 can demonstrate an innovative and forward-thinking approach to customers and prospective employees. It can increase a business’s access to new customers and business partners. In some markets it can potentially reduce public liability insurance costs. It can serve to reduce trade barriers between registered businesses (Van der Deldt, 1997). There is growing interest in including certification to ISO 14001 in tenders for public-private partnerships for infrastructure <b>renewal.</b> Evidence of <b>value</b> in terms of environmental quality and benefit to the taxpayer has been shown in highway projects in Canada.|$|R
