5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space</b> known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space.</b> A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
25|$|Applying {{standard}} diffraction {{techniques to}} crystal powders or polycrystals {{is tantamount to}} collapsing the 3D <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space,</b> as obtained via single-crystal diffraction, onto a 1D axis.

25|$|The Gibbs {{phenomenon}} manifests as a {{cross pattern}} artifact in the Discrete Fourier Transform of an image, where most images (e.g. micrographs or photographs) have a sharp discontinuity between boundaries {{at the top}} / bottom and left / right of an image.

40|$|A <b>reciprocal</b> linear <b>space</b> is {{the image}} of a linear space under coordinate-wise inversion. These {{fundamental}} varieties describe the analytic centers of hyperplane arrangements and appear as part of the defining equations of the central path of a linear program. Their structure is controlled by an underlying matroid. This provides a large family of hyperbolic varieties, recently introduced by Shamovich and Vinnikov. Here we give a definite determinantal representation to the Chow form of a <b>reciprocal</b> linear <b>space.</b> One consequence is the existence of symmetric rank-one Ulrich sheaves on <b>reciprocal</b> linear <b>spaces.</b> Another is a representation of the entropic discriminant as a sum of squares. For generic linear spaces, the determinantal formulas obtained are closely related to the Laplacian of the complete graph and generalizations to simplicial matroids.

25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space.</b> This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted.|$|E
500|$|The {{equality}} of their magnitudes {{ensures that the}} Friedel mates have the same intensity |F|2. This symmetry allows one to measure the full Fourier transform from only half the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space,</b> e.g., by rotating the crystal slightly more than 180° instead of a full 360° revolution. In crystals with significant symmetry, even more reflections may have the same intensity (Bijvoet mates); in such cases, even less of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space</b> {{may need to be}} measured.

500|$|One {{image of}} spots is {{insufficient}} to reconstruct the whole crystal; it represents only a small slice of the full Fourier transform. To collect all the necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step-by-step through 180°, with an image recorded at every step; actually, slightly more than 180° is required to cover <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space,</b> due to the curvature of the Ewald sphere. However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as 90° or 45° may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least once, to avoid developing a [...] "blind spot" [...] in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space</b> close to the rotation axis. It is customary to rock the crystal slightly (by 0.5–2°) to catch a broader region of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

500|$|Each X-ray {{diffraction}} image {{represents only}} a slice, a spherical slice of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space,</b> {{as may be}} seen by the Ewald sphere construction. Both kout and kin have the same length, due to the elastic scattering, since the wavelength has not changed. Therefore, they may be represented as two radial vectors in a sphere in <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space,</b> which shows the values of q that are sampled in a given diffraction image. Since there is a slight spread in the incoming wavelengths of the incoming X-ray beam, the values of|F(q)|can be measured only for q vectors located between the two spheres corresponding to those radii. Therefore, to obtain a full set of Fourier transform data, it is necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than 180°, or sometimes less if sufficient symmetry is present. A full 360° rotation is not needed because of a symmetry intrinsic to the Fourier transforms of real functions (such as the electron density), but [...] "slightly more" [...] than 180° is needed to cover all of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space</b> within a given resolution because of the curvature of the Ewald sphere.

500|$|For every {{reflection}} {{corresponding to}} a point q in the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>space,</b> there is another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point -q.

This symmetry results from the mathematical fact that the density of electrons f(r) at a position r is always a real number. As noted above, f(r) is the inverse transform of its Fourier transform F(q); however, such an inverse transform is a complex number in general. To ensure that f(r) is real, the Fourier transform F(q) must be such that the Friedel mates F(−q) and F(q) are complex conjugates of one another. Thus, F(−q) has the same magnitude as F(q) but they have the opposite phase, i.e., φ(q) = −φ(q) ...|$|E
