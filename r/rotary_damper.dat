5000|$|Sport bikes {{have a short}} {{wheelbase}} and an aggressive steering geometry to provide {{the ability to make}} very quick changes in direction. This has the harmful side-effect of making the bike less stable, more prone to feedback from uneven road surfaces, and more difficult to control. [...] If the front wheel significantly deviates from the direction of travel when it touches down, it may cause an unwanted wobble. Steering dampers are factory installed on some high-end sport motorcycles and fitted to most contemporary racing bikes to counter these behaviours.Steering dampers are also mounted to off-road motorcycles such as motocross bikes. A damper helps keep the bike tracking straight over difficult terrain such as ruts, rocks, and sand, and also smooths out jolts through the handlebars at the end of jumps. They also reduce arm fatigue by reducing the effort to control the handlebars.On motorcycles, one end of the damper is mounted to the steering yoke or triple tree, the other to the frame. Two main types are linear and rotary. Linear dampers resemble a telescoping shock absorber and operate in a similar manner. They can be aligned either longitudinally and {{to one side of the}} steering, or transversely across the bike. Rotary dampers resemble small boxes and operate via a rotating pivot. They are mounted coaxially with the steering axis and are typically located on top of the steering head. An electronically variable damper uses a <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> with hydraulic fluid that flows freely at low speeds, allowing easy turning, while restricting flow at higher speeds when more damping is necessary, as determined by the engine control unit.|$|E

40|$|Rotating {{machinery}} systems experience {{torsional vibrations}} with varying frequencies {{to some degree}} during normal operation. These vibrations if not controlled properly may cause severe system performance limitation and reduction of the fatigue life. Attenuation of torsional vibrations in these systems is a challenging engineering problem and raises several important issues in industrial applications. The present research aims at developing a novel hybrid torsional vibration damper incorporating a conventional Centrifugal Pendulum Vibration Absorber (CPVA) with the Magnetorheological (MR) damper capable of suppressing torsional vibrations at different excitation frequencies. In fact, CPVA and torsional MR damper have been investigated separately in previous research, however, {{there has been no}} study reported on integrating the two systems for the attenuation of torsional vibration. In this research study, first, the governing equations of motion for both horizontal and vertical CPVA have been derived using Lagrange’s principle to investigate the effect of gravity on the dynamics and performance of CPVA. Moreover, softening nonlinear behavior of the pendulum absorber and its effect on the natural frequency of the system has been investigated. Next, a <b>rotary</b> MR <b>damper</b> prototype was optimally designed, manufactured and tested. The design process of the <b>rotary</b> MR <b>damper</b> included several critical factors, particularly, analysis and design of the magnetic circuit of the MR damper. In order to ensure efficient design of the proposed damper, a finite element (FE) model of the <b>rotary</b> MR <b>damper</b> was developed to accurately evaluate the magnetic field distribution in the MR fluid and electromagnet core generated by the built-in electromagnet. The developed FE model enables to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design configuration as well as the selected material for the MR damper components. In addition, the equation of transmitted torque has been derived and utilized to evaluate the MR damper performance. In order to obtain the optimum geometric dimensions of the designed MR damper, an optimization problem has been formulated. The combined Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) have been employed to accurately capture the global optimum solution. An experimental test set up has been designed to evaluate the fabricated <b>rotary</b> MR <b>damper</b> performance by measuring the generated damping torque and to validate simulation results obtained from the model. Subsequently, the hybrid torsional MR damper incorporating both conventional CPVA and <b>rotary</b> MR <b>damper</b> has been proposed. The CPVA has been connected to the cylindrical housing of the MR damper. The governing equations of motion of the system consisting of a rotor with attached hybrid torsional dampers have been derived to evaluate the performance of the system under current off and maximum current applied to the MR damper’s electromagnet. The results are also compared with those obtained from rotor systems with only attached CPVA and <b>rotary</b> MR <b>damper.</b> Finally, a feedback control system using the semi-active skyhook control algorithm has been developed to adaptively control the proposed hybrid torsional damper under varying external excitations.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{sponsored}} by QinetiQ Limited (QinetiQ); whose aim it is to model the dynamics of a prototype high-speed military tracked vehicle. Specifically their objective is to describe the mechanism by which force inputs are transmitted from the ground to the vehicle’s hull. Many track running gear components are steel and can be modelled as simple lumped masses or as linear springs without internal damping. These present no difficulty to the modeller. However tracked vehicle running gear also has nonlinear components that require more detailed descriptions. Models for two rubber components, the road wheel tyre and track link bush, and {{a model for the}} suspensions <b>rotary</b> <b>damper,</b> are developed here. These three components all have highly nonlinear dynamic responses. Rubber component nonlinearities are caused by the materials nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. Stiffness is amplitude dependent and the material exhibits a significant amount of internal damping, which is predominantly Coulombic in nature but also relaxes overtime. In this work, a novel method for measuring the elastic and viscoelastic response of Carbon Black Filled Natural Rubber components has been devised and a ‘general purpose’ mathematical model developed that describes the materials response and is suited to use in multibody dynamic analysis software. The vehicle’s suspension <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> model describes three viscous flow regimes (laminar, turbulent and pressure relief), as a continuous curved response that relates angular velocity to damping torque. Hysteresis due to the compression of entrapped gas, compliance of the dampers structure and compression of damper oil is described by a single non-parametric equation.

40|$|Abstract [...] The Viscous Beam is a {{wearable}} tremor-suppression orthosis {{that applies}} viscous {{resistance to motion}} of the wrist in flexion and extension. The orthosis reduces tremor amplitude and is small enough to be worn under the sleeve of a shirt. Hand and forearm cuffs couple the damper to the user. The cuffs permit full thumb and finger motion, wrist flexion and extension, and forearm pronation and supination. Damping is provided by a constrained-layer-damping (CLD) system, distinct in that it can damp large rotary deflections through a small bending radius. A bending-plate transmission linearly converts wrist extension/flexion to rectilinear translation within the damper. Bending deformation of two plates held a fixed distance apart within the transmission results in relative displacement along the lengths of the plates. A viscous fluid incorporated between the plates provides shear damping. Silicone fluids with viscosities as high as 10 million centistokes (cS) and shear layers as thin as 0. 76 mm have been tested. With these parameter values, damping constants as high as 2. 0 × 10 - 3 N-m/(°/s) have been measured. This testing was conducted with strain rates as high as 4, 580 °/s.

40|$|There {{are over}} 15 million people {{affected}} by strokes worldwide {{with a third}} left disabled. It is estimated that only 5 to 20 % regain upper limb functionality. However, {{research has shown that}} repetitive movement on the affected limb improves motor relearning. With the number of people affected by strokes rising each year the demand has begun straining hospital resources, therefore {{there is a need for}} some therapy to be moved away from clinical settings and into a person’s home. Robot assisted therapy is a growing field aiming to meet this demand. However currently there are no low cost devices able to actively exercise and strengthen a person’s hand during the acute (early) stage of stroke rehabilitation. This study is a part of a larger project involving the development of a low cost, assistive stroke rehabilitation device requiring a controllable damper. The aim of the study is to determine whether the use of magnetorheological fluid in a controllable damper is viable for use in the planned rehabilitation device. A <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> configuration was chosen as it can be made compact and avoid fluid leakage. To be deemed suitable for the application, the viscous torque of the damper needed to be controllable with varying input current. The required damping torques produced must be repeatable and needs to be generated below 34 C, the specified maximum operating temperature of the system. The performance of three vane designs for the <b>rotary</b> <b>damper</b> were investigated. These three designs were layered discs, a paddle and a helix. A test rig using a pulley configuration was designed and constructed to quantify the performance of the vane designs. The test rig recorded the opposing force and temperature measurements for each damper design. The measurements of interest were the off-state (no input current) torque, the achievable torque range, and also the consistency of the measurements. Experiments were conducted with the damper containing air to determine the pre-existing friction between the vane and housing, and water and motor oil were used as the damper fluid to investigate the performance of the designs with known fluid viscosities. Lastly experiments containing magneto-rheological fluid were conducted to determine the controllability and consistency of the viscous torque of each design. The paddle design was selected based on its range and consistency of produced torque, simplicity of the design and expected economical manufacture. With an input current of 0 to 2 A the damper produced a viscous torque range of 0. 0036 Nm to 0. 044 Nm, which was the equivalent opposing force of approximately 7. 3 N. During testing of the various damper designs, a few imperfections were found. A modified version of the chosen damper was constructed to determine whether those features were manufacturing artifacts. It was found that the force measurements became smoother and previous periodic oscillations in the measurements were eliminated. The viscous torque of the paddle design was found to be controllable within the given operational conditions and therefore the use of magnetorheological fluid is a viable solution for use in a low cost stroke rehabilitation device...|$|E

40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) damper is {{one type}} of {{semi-active}} devices that shows a great potential for vibration suppression and hazard mitigation of civil structures. One special advantage of the damper is that its damping characteristics can be adaptively and quickly altered by a varying magnetic field. A linear valve-mode MR damper was obtained from Lord Corporation for investigation. A phenomenological model based on Bouc-Wen hysteresis model was developed to emulate the highly nonlinear behavior of the MR damper. A simplified yet relatively accurate inverse dynamic model that can directly relate the damper force to the input voltage was then proposed. This inverse dynamic model can directly estimate voltage required to be commanded into the damper {{in order to produce}} a desired damping force. Experiments demonstrate that MR damper using this inverse model can closely reproduce the prescribed forces. Two control algorithms, the classical pole placement technique and the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) with output weighting method, were used to illustrate how this inverse model can be implemented in the applications. In an attempt to validate the effectiveness of the MR damper in controlling wind-induced response of a building model in wind tunnel, it is necessary to have a damper with a small force range {{so that it can be}} used to control the light-weight building model.

In the EU FP 7 MARINA Platform project, three floating combined concepts, namely the spar torus combination (STC), the semi-submersible flap combination (SFC) and the oscillating water column (OWC) array with a wind turbine, were selected and studied in detail by numerical and experimental methods. This paper summarizes the numerical modeling {{and analysis of the}} two concepts: STC and SFC, the model tests at a 1 : 50 scale under simultaneous wave and wind excitation, as well as the comparison between the numerical and experimental results. Both operational and survival wind and wave conditions were considered. The numerical analysis was based on a time-domain global model using potential flow theory for hydrodynamics and blade element momentum theory (for SFC) or simplified thrust force model (for STC) for aerodynamics. Different techniques for model testing of combined wind and wave concepts were discussed with focus on modeling of wind turbines by disk or redesigned small-scale rotor and modeling of power take-off (PTO) system for wave energy conversion by pneumatic damper or hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>damper.</b> In order to reduce the uncertainty due to scaling, the numerical analysis was performed at model scale and both the numerical and experimental results were then up-scaled to full scale for comparison. The comparison shows that the current numerical model can well predict the responses (motions, PTO forces, power production) of the combined concepts for most of the cases. However, the linear hydrodynamic model is not adequate for the STC concept in extreme wave conditions with the torus fixed to the spar at the mean water level for which the wave slamming on the torus occurs and this requires further investigation. Moreover, based on a preliminary comparison of the displacement, the PTO system as well as the wind and wave power production, the STC concept will have a lower cost of energy as compared to the SFC concept.

The current model’s static and dynamic data coverage of the angular and rate excursions experienced during out-of-control motions was evaluated. This revealed that extending static sideslip effects to higher sideslip benefits modeling of some out-of-control maneuvers. When implemented using methodology proposed by Kalviste, properly collected dynamic data are capable of providing adequate dynamic definition.

The zero-lift drag and the drag-due-to-lift parameter of the test configuration varied linearly with Mach number. The maximum lift-drag ratio was 7. 0 at a Mach number of 1. 25 and decreased slightly to a value of 6. 6 at a Mach number of 1. 81.

These predicted damping torques satisfied the specified damping torque of 475 N⋅m at 1. 5 A and showed errors of less than 5 % when compared to experimental measurements from theMR damper manufactured by the proposed design. The current study could {{play an important role in}} improving the performance of rotary type MR dampers. 1...|$|R

V-twin engines are longer from front to rear than standard inline four cylinder motors used in most sportbikes. In {{order to keep the}} wheelbase as short as possible engineers separated the rear shock absorber/damper from the spring. The spring was located {{on the right side of}} the bike and Suzuki developed and employed a <b>rotary</b> style rear <b>damper</b> that provided its damping characteristics through rotating arms. A similar version was also used on the Suzuki TL1000R. The rear shock was similar to suspension dampers used on Formula One race cars.|$|R
40|$|Viscoelasticity, as {{the name}} implies, is a {{property}} that combines elasticity and viscosity or in other words such materials store energy as well as dissipates it to the thermal domain when subjected to dynamic loading and most interesting the storage and loss of energy depends upon the frequency of excitation. Modeling of viscoelastic materials is always difficult whereas modeling the elastic behavior is easy, modelling the energy dissipation mechanism possess difficulty. This work attempts to study the dynamics of a viscoelastic rotor-shaft system considering the effect of internal material damping in the rotor. The rotation of rotors introduces a <b>rotary</b> <b>damping</b> force due to internal material damping, which is well known to cause instability in rotor-shaft systems. Therefore, a reliable model is necessary to represent the rotor internal damping for correct prediction of stability limit of spin speed and unbalance response amplitude of a rotor-shaft system. An efficient modelling technique for viscoelastic material, augmenting thermodynamic field (ATF) {{has been found in}} literature. Here the material constitutive relationship has been represented by a differential time operator. Use of operators enables to consider general linear viscoelastic behaviours, represented in the time domain, for which, in general, instantaneous stress and its derivatives are proportional to instantaneous strain and also its derivatives. The operator may be suitably chosen according to the material model. The constitutive relationships for ATF approach is represented in differential time operator to obtain the equations of motion of a rotor-shaft system after discretizing the system using beam finite element method. The equations thus developed may easily be used to find the stability limit of spin speed of a rotor-shaft system as well as the time response as a result of unbalance when the rotor-shaft system is subjected to any kind of dynamic forcing function. In this work dynamic behavior of an aluminium rotor is predicted through viscoelastic modelling of the continuum {{to take into account the}} effect of internal material damping. To study the dynamics of an aluminium rotor-shaft system stability limit of spin speed, unbalance response amplitude and time response are used as three indices. It is observed that, the operator based approach is more suitable for finding the equation of motion of a viscoelastic rotor which is used to predicts the dynamic behaviour of that continuum. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, free {{vibration}} of a simply supported rotating shaft with stretching nonlinearity is investigated. Rotary inertia and gyroscopic effects are included, but shear deformation is neglected. The {{equations of motion}} are derived {{with the aid of}} the Hamilton principle and then transformed to the complex form. To analyze the {{free vibration}}, the method of multiple scales is directly applied to the partial differential equation of motion. An analytical expression, as a function of system parameters, is derived, which describes the nonlinear free vibration of the rotating shaft in two transverse planes. The effects of <b>rotary</b> inertia, external <b>damping</b> and rotating speed on the forward and backward nonlinear natural frequencies are considered. It is shown that both forward and backward nonlinear natural frequencies are being excited. To validate the perturbation results, we use numerical simulation...|$|R
40|$|Student and Young Researcher AwardLack of {{sustainable}} power source prevents wireless smart sensors (WSS) from widespread application in long-term structural health monitoring (SHM). Some {{efforts have been}} reported in literatures to solve this problem by using solar energy, micro-wind turbine technology and vibration-based energy harvester. In particular, a variety of mechanisms or materials have been explored for vibration-based energy harvesting techniques, including electromagnetic induction, piezoelectricity, electrostatic generation, dielectric elastomers and so on. However, there still exists a gap between the power output of most existing vibration-based energy harvesting devices and the power demand of commercially available WSS. This paper presents an experimental study on a novel energy harvesting solution to WSS-utilizing regenerative electromagnetic tuned mass dampers (EMTMD). The EMTMD, as a key element in the system, is composed of a pendulum-type TMD and a <b>rotary</b> electromagnetic <b>damper.</b> When connected to an energy harvesting circuit (EHC), it converts vibration energy of structures to electrical energy, and functions in both structural vibration reduction and sensor power supply. The functionality of the regenerative EMTMD system was validated in this study through shaking table tests of a single-story steel frame model equipped with an integrated EMTMD, EHC and WSS system. The experimental results revealed that the proposed regenerative EMTMD system can provide regenerative and economical power to WSS. The harvested power under random ground motions (RMS acceleration = 0. 05 g) reaches up to 312. 4 mW. The proof-of-concept experiments clearly demonstrate the novel EMTMD is a promising device to be exploited as a sustainable and regenerative power source to WSS.

40|$|Standard routes for {{upgrading}} existing buildings {{to improve their}} seismic response can be expensive {{in terms of both}} time and cost due to the modifications required to the foundations. As a result, interest has grown in the installation of viscoelastic dampers (VEDs) in mid and high-rise buildings. Details of a low-cost viscoelastic passive control device, the <b>rotary</b> rubber braced <b>damper</b> (RRBD), are presented in this paper. This design has the added benefits of being lightweight and simple to install. Experimental methods and finite element modeling were used to assess the performance of the proposed VED design and its effect on building response during earthquakes. The analyses took into account the behaviors of non-linear materials and large deformations. The results indicate that the proposed RRBD provides high levels of energy absorption, ensuring the stable cyclical response of buildings in all scenarios considered. In addition, time history analysis was employed in this study to evaluate the RRBD’s ability to control the displacements and accelerations experienced by steel frame structures.

In recent years, viscoelastic dampers (VEDs) {{have been widely used}} in many mid- and high-rise buildings. This study introduces a viscoelastic passive control system called <b>rotary</b> rubber braced <b>damper</b> (RRBD). The RRBD is an economical, lightweight, and easy-to-assemble device. A finite element model considering nonlinearity, large deformation, and material damage is developed to conduct a parametric study on different damper sizes under pushover cyclic loading.

The result show excellent energy absorption and stable hysteresis loops in all specimens. Additionally, by using a sinusoidal shaking table test, the effectiveness of the RRBD to manage the response displacement and acceleration of steel frames is considered. The RRBD functioned at early stages of lateral displacement, indicating that the system is effective for all levels of vibration. Moreover, the proposed damper shows significantly better performance in terms of the column compression force resulting from the brace action compared to chevron bracing (CB) ...|$|R
