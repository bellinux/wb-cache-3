40|$|The {{performance}} of the cementitious materials within a radioactive waste repository as a physical barrier to the migration of radionuclides depends on {{the maintenance of the}} integrity of the barrier. One mechanism which can potentially compromise the behaviour of a repository is physical damage to the barrier caused by pressurisation as gas is generated. The maintenance of chemical homogeneity within the material used for backfilling the repository may also be compromised as a consequence of gas pressurisation through the formation of additional cracks and the reaction of cementitious materials with gases such as carbon dioxide. Consequently, the migration of gas within repository construction materials may be a significant parameter in both the design of a repository and the provision of a safety case for disposal. The migration of hydrogen, helium, methane, argon, and carbon dioxide have been studied for materials selected to be typical of repository structural concretes and grouts that are being considered for both <b>repository</b> <b>backfilling</b> and waste encapsulation and solidification. The apparent permeability of these materials to gas {{has been shown to be}} dependent on gas type and average pressure in the structural concrete due to the effects of Knudsen flow at pressures of the order of 100 kPa. This is not observed in the grouts due to the significantly greater pore size. The permeability coefficients for the grouts are several orders of magnitude greater than those of the concrete. Gas migration is strongly influenced by the degree of water saturation of the materials. The presence of interfaces within the materials results in an increase in permeability at higher degrees of water saturation. A simple model has been developed to simulate the effects of gas pressurisation. The tangential hoop stress at the surface of a void is calculated and comparison with the expected tensile strength of the materials is used to assess the potential for cracking. The backfill grouts seem to have sufficient permeability to disperse gas without crack formation...|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} {{model for the}} back end of the nuclear fuel cycle was developed for a once-through cycle, a standard reprocessing cycle, and a reprocessing cycle with fractionation of cesium and strontium. The development of the model was performed under the expected political constraints and scenario for the first nuclear waste repository. Technical issues concerning the repository design were analyzed, in particular the thermal design. A parametric thermal analysis was performed for waste emplaced in five different geologic formations: salt, granite, basalt, shallow tuff, and deep tuff. The results of the thermal analysis, in the form of maximum permissible loadings, were incorporated into the {{economic model}}. The economic analysis was performed for a variety of situations in order to compare the five possible repository host rocks, the three different back end cycles, and different locations of the Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility (MRS). A sensitivity analysis was also performed for evaluating the effect of variations in some parameters in the final cost of the system;The results of the thermal analysis indicated that the maximum permissible thermal loadings in granite and tuff were relatively high, whereas for basalt the thermal loadings are very restricted for both spent fuel and reprocessed waste and for salt the loadings are very restricted for spent fuel only. The results of the economic analysis showed that a repository in basalt always resulted in higher costs than in any other rock; the other repository media yield comparable costs, except in the case of spent fuel disposal in salt, where the costs are higher. Co-location of the MRS with the repository results in a lower system cost than locating it away from the repository. The regular reprocessing cycle presents the lower storage plus disposal costs among the three cycles studied, and disposal of spent fuel has the highest costs associated. The model proved to be very sensitive to variations of the discount rate, the storage facility capital cost, and the delay of <b>repository</b> <b>backfilling</b> after waste emplacement. Lower waste storage plus disposal costs can be obtained by delaying disposal in the fractionation waste cycle in any rock or disposal of any waste form in basalt. In the other cases, aging the waste before disposal does not reduce, in general, the total cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} {{of uranium}} and thorium has been measured under the conditions anticipated in a cementitious, geological disposal facility for low and intermediate level radioactive waste. Similar solubilities {{were obtained for}} thorium in all media, comprising NaOH, Ca(OH) 2 and water equilibrated with a cement designed as <b>repository</b> <b>backfill</b> (NRVB, Nirex Reference Vault Backfill). In contrast, the solubility of U(VI) was one order of magnitude higher in NaOH than in the remaining solutions. The presence of cellulose degradation products (CDP) results in a comparable solubility increase for both elements. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) {{data suggest that the}} solubility-limiting phase for uranium corresponds to a becquerelite-type solid whereas thermodynamic modelling predicts a poorly crystalline, hydrated calcium uranate phase. The solubility-limiting phase for thorium was ThO 2 of intermediate crystallinity. No breakthrough of either uranium or thorium was observed in diffusion experiments involving NRVB after three years. Nevertheless, backscattering electron microscopy and microfocus X-ray fluorescence confirmed that uranium had penetrated about 40 µm into the cement, implying active diffusion governed by slow dissolution-precipitation kinetics. Precise identification of the uranium solid proved difficult, displaying characteristics of both calcium uranate and becquerelite...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} of sorption and {{dispersion characteristics}} of uranium in the zeolite-quartz mixture as candidate of raw material of backfill {{material in the}} radioactive waste repository has been performed. The objective is to know the effect of zeolite and quartz grain size on the zeolite-to-quartz weight ratio that gives porosity (ε), permeability (K), and dispersivity (α) of uranium in the zeolite-quartz mixture as backfill material. The experiment {{was carried out by}} fixed bed method in the column filled by the zeolite-quartz mixture with zeolite-to-quartz weight percent ratio of 100 / 0, 80 / 20, 60 / 40, 40 / 60, 20 / 80, 0 / 100 wt. % in the water saturated condition flowed by uranyl nitrate solution of 500 ppm concentration (Co) as uranium simulation which was leached from immobilized radioactive waste in the repository. The concentration of uranium in the effluents represented as Ct were analyzed by spectrophotometer Corning Colorimeter 253 every 15 minutes, then using Co and Ct uranium dispersivity (α) in the backfill material was determined. The experiment data shown that 0. 196 mm particle size of zeolite and 0. 116 mm particle size of quartz on the zeolite-to-quartz weight ratio of 60 / 40 wt. % with ε = 0. 678, K = 3. 345 x 10 - 4 cm/second, and α = 0. 759 cm can be proposed as candidate of raw material of backfill material in the radioactive waste <b>repository.</b>   Keywords: <b>backfill</b> material, quartz, radioactive waste, zeolit...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive waste {{disposal}} {{in a deep}} subsurface repository hosted in clay/shale/argillite is a subject of widespread interest given the desirable isolation properties, geochemically reduced conditions, and widespread geologic occurrence of this rock type (Hansen 2010; Bianchi et al. 2013). Bianchi et al. (2013) provides a description of diffusion in a clay-hosted repository based on single-phase flow and full saturation using parametric data from documented studies in Europe (e. g., ANDRA 2005). The predominance of diffusive transport and sorption phenomena in this clay media are key attributes to impede radionuclide mobility making clay rock formations target sites for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The reports by Hansen et al. (2010) and those from numerous studies in clay-hosted underground research laboratories (URLs) in Belgium, France and Switzerland outline the extensive scientific knowledge obtained to assess long-term clay/shale/argilliterepository isolation performance of nuclear waste. In {{the past several years}} under the UFDC, various kinds of models have been developed for argillite repository to demonstrate the model capability, understand the spatial and temporal alteration of the repository, and evaluate different scenarios. These models include the coupled Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical (THM) and Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical-Chemical (THMC) models (e. g. Liu et al. 2013; Rutqvist et al. 2014 a, Zheng et al. 2014 a) that focus on THMC processes in the Engineered Barrier System (EBS) bentonite and argillite host hock, the large scale hydrogeologic model (Bianchi et al. 2014) that investigates the hydraulic connection between an emplacement drift and surrounding hydrogeological units, and Disposal Systems Evaluation Framework (DSEF) models (Greenberg et al. 2013) that evaluate thermal evolution in the host rock approximated as a thermal conduction process to facilitate the analysis of design options. However, the assumptions and the properties (parameters) used in these models are different, which not only make inter-model comparisons difficult, but also compromise the applicability of the lessons learned from one model to another model. The establishment of a reference case would therefore be helpful to set up a baseline for model development. A generic salt repository reference case was developed in Freeze et al. (2013) and the generic argillite repository reference case is presented in this report. The definition of a reference case requires the characterization of the waste inventory, waste form, waste package, <b>repository</b> layout, EBS <b>backfill,</b> host rock, and biosphere. This report mainly documents the processes in EBS bentonite and host rock that are potentially important for performance assessment and properties that are needed to describe these processes, with brief description other components such as waste inventory, waste form, waste package, repository layout,aquifer, and biosphere. A thorough description of the generic argillite repository reference case will be given in Jové Colon et al. (2014) ...|$|R
