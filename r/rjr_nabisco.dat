5|$|The buyout of <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> and Duracell.|$|E
5|$|After the 1987 {{resignation}} of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded {{his own private}} equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm {{was responsible for the}} 1988 leveraged buyout of <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco.</b> <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign {{of the end of the}} 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in , and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{a number}} of {{leveraged}} buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco.</b> The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden {{the performance of the}} investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, {{the company}} {{acquired}} Jacobs Suchard (a European coffee and confectionery giant) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas as its business was {{heavily dependent on}} the U.S. In 1993, it acquired <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco's</b> cold cereal business (mainly Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals) while selling its Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and its Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods.

50|$|Castro-Wright {{graduated}} in 1975 from Texas A&M University {{with a degree}} in mechanical engineering. He rebuilt <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco's</b> Latin American operations during the KKR era. In the late 1990s he ran all of the Asia-Pacific division for Honeywell. He then joined Walmart in 2001 as president and COO (Chief Operations Officer) of Walmart Mexico and was promoted to President and CEO, of Walmart U.S. in 2003. In 2004, Castro-Wright led sales of Wal-Mex's 700 outlets to rise 11 percent to $12.5 billion and net income to grow 36 percent. He also served as COO for a short period until being named president and CEO of Walmart U.S. in 2005. He was promoted to Vice Chairman in 2008. In August 2010, he was named one of the Top 25 Multilatinos by Latin Business Chronicle.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, the {{landscape}} of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E
5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (as will be discussed below) and leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco,</b> {{formed in}} 1985 by {{the merger of}} Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading {{producer}} of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994 RJR {{sold its}} breakfast cereal {{business}} (primarily the Shredded Wheat franchise) to Kraft Foods {{and the international}} licenses to General Mills, which later {{became part of the}} Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture with Nestle. [...] Also in 1994, RJR acquired Knox Gelatin and integrated the Shredded Wheat franchise into the Post Foods portfolio. [...] Post continues to sell the product today. In 1995 Nestle agreed to buy the Ortega Mexican foods business from Nabisco Inc. [...] That same year, RJR-Nabisco also acquired the North American margarine and table spreads business of Kraft foods. This purchase included Parkay, Touch of Butter and Chiffon. In 1998 Nabisco Holdings announced its sale of its margarine and egg substitute business to ConAgra of Omaha. In 1997 the brands of Fleishmann's, Blue Bonnet and Parkay had sales of $480 million. [...] It also sold its College Inn broth brand to HJ Heinz and its Venezuelan Del Monte operations to Del Monte Foods. In 1999 <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco's</b> food and tobacco empire fell apart when they sold its international tobacco division to Japan Tobacco for $7.8 billion.|$|R
5|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the debt}} markets were {{improving}} and KKR {{had moved on}} from the <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for {{what was then a}} record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund. However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).|$|E
5|$|The {{firm was}} founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, {{all of whom had}} {{previously}} worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco,</b> which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date. KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, KKR was one {{of seven}} private equity firms {{involved}} in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable {{given the number of}} firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{a bidding}} war ensued between several {{financial}} firms for tobacco and food giant <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco.</b> Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events {{in more than two}} dozen Journal articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, , which was turned into a film for HBO.|$|E
25|$|His arrival on Wall Street {{coincided with}} the {{explosion}} of white collar criminal investigations in finance. He wrote about the stock trading scandals involving speculator Ivan Boesky and junk bond king Michael Milken, {{as well as the}} Treasury markets scandal at Salomon Brothers.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s {{the excesses}} of the buyout market were {{beginning}} to show, with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including Robert Campeau's 1988 buyout of Federated Department Stores, the 1986 buyout of the Revco drug stores, Walter Industries, FEB Trucking and Eaton Leonard. Additionally, the <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization in 1990 that involved the contribution of $1.7 billion of new equity from KKR.|$|E

500|$|The {{decade of}} the 1980s is perhaps more closely {{associated}} with the leveraged buyout than any decade before or since. [...] For the first time, the public became aware of the ability of private equity to affect mainstream companies and [...] "corporate raiders" [...] and [...] "hostile takeovers" [...] entered the public consciousness.

Has the buyout craze gone too far?". KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout. KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.

500|$|Interestingly, {{two years}} earlier, in 1987, Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. {{resigned}} from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over differences in strategy.

500|$|Since {{the origins}} of the modern private equity {{industry}} in 1946, there have been four major epochs marked by three boom and bust cycles. The early history of private equity—from 1946 through 1981—was characterized by relatively small volumes of private equity investment, rudimentary firm organizations and limited awareness of and familiarity with the private equity industry. The first boom and bust cycle, from 1982 through 1993, was characterized by the dramatic surge in leveraged buyout activity financed by junk bonds and culminating in the massive buyout of <b>RJR</b> <b>Nabisco</b> before the near collapse of the leveraged buyout industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] The second boom and bust cycle (from 1992 through 2002) emerged from the ashes of the savings and loan crisis, the insider trading scandals, the real estate market collapse and the recession of the early 1990s. [...] This period saw the emergence of more institutionalized private equity firms, ultimately culminating in the massive Dot-com bubble in 1999 and 2000. The third boom and bust cycle (from 2003 through 2007) came {{in the wake of the}} collapse of the Dot-com bubble—leveraged buyouts reach unparalleled size and the institutionalization of private equity firms is exemplified by the Blackstone Group's 2007 initial public offering.|$|E
