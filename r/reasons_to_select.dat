5000|$|The Suriani Catholics {{south of}} the river Aluva were placed under the vicariate of Kottayam, one of the {{important}} cities in the kingdom of Thiruvithamcoor. There were 12,000 inhabitants according to the 1881 census; Catholics numbered around 300. Kottayam was the centre of the Syrian Orthodox Christians and {{this was one of the}} main <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> Kottayam as the residence of the apostolic vicar. Charles Louis Lavigne, was born on 6 January 1840 in France. He was ordained priest in 1864 and later he became a Jesuit. He received episcopal consecration on 13 November 1887 at Marvejols, his native place. When he reached Mannanam, there were 25 to 30 thousand people with two elephants to receive him. The schism was almost extinct in the Kottayam vicariate except for Elamthottam, where Mar Oudeesho(formerly Fr.Antony Thondanatt [...] ) stayed. Although the schism was ended a large number of present Syro Malabarians in Shertallai taluk entered their community as Chaldeans in the Census of Travancore held at1901.Lavigne planned a systematic development of the vicariate, building a college, a seminary, bishop’s residence and schools and orphanages all of which required an enormous amount of money. Though the Suriani Carmelites of Mannanam treated him well, he naturally wanted to have a residence for the apostolic vicar. A college to prepare the students for the public examination was an urgent need. Lavigne was interested in the reunion movements. In April 1888, Lavigne went to Ootty at the apostolic delegation with Mar Dionysius, the Jacobite metropolitan and Fr. Nidiry. The Suriani Christians both Catholic and non-Catholics, were divided from time immemorial into two sections: Nordists and Suddists & Thekkumbhagar As the separation of the Suriani Catholics from Latins was effected, the question of this division came into serious discussion for the first time. Most of the Suddist priests wanted to remain under Varapuzha. Mathew Makil, along with Nordist Varghese Valiaveettil (Vazhakulam, Muvattupuzha) went to Ootty to meet Aiuti as representatives of the apostolic vicar of Varapuzha. In Ootty, Makil submitted a petition of the Suddists as their representative to Aiuti. There were 15 to 20, 000 Suddists with 12 parishes and 21 priests and 100-109,000 Nordists with 133 parishes and 256 priests. The general picture of the vicariate in 1888 was as follows: Suriani Catholics 107,000; Priests 271; Seminarians 190; churches 96; chapels 49; seminary: besides the common seminary at Puthenpally there was one exclusively for the Syrians at Mannanam; religious men: 69; religious houses 5; Religious women: 25; religious houses 1, secondary schools 5 & primary schools 200. A petition of ten parish priests of the Suddist community dated 21 November 1887, requested the Pope to place them under Mellano or his coadjutor Marcellinos. Even before the arrival of Lavigne, the division was clear in Malabar, and from Lavigne’s very reception he had to face the division. During the reception the Suddists requested him for an occasion to read a special address after the official one. Lavigne agreed to do this on the following day. Aiuti and Lavigne found the only solution to resolve the problem forever was to give a separate administration for the Suddists. Aiuti had already informed Propaganda that the project for a separate vicariate for the Suddists was designed by archbishop Mellano and Carmelites of Varapuzha. Following Aiuti's proposals, the general assembly of Propaganda Fide decided to give a separate administration granting them a vicar general and two councilors. Thus though Mellano could not attain his objective, i.e., a special vicariate for the Suddists, his strategy proved to have a bad effect, the growth of a division among the Suriani Catholics. Mellano was vehemently opposed to the separate administration of the 200,000 Suriani Catholics, including 360 priests, 213 seminarians and 59 religious priests, in 172 parishes. He wanted to erect a third vicariate for the Suddists who numbered 15-20,000, with 21 priests and 12 parishes.|$|E

Sparrow (2010) claims that PPBs imply that we should select only female children, unless we attach norma-tive significance to “normal ” human capacities. We argue that this claim fails on both empirical and logical grounds. Empirically, Sparrow’s argument for greater female well-being rests on a selective reading of the evidence and the incorrect assumption that an advantage for females would persist even when a serious gender imbalance is obtained. Logically, PPBs cite only pro tanto reasons and allow that the good of an individual child could be outweighed by other morally relevant considerations, such as those which take collectively suboptimal outcomes into account. There is thus no need to attach value to the “normal. ...|$|E

40|$|On what basis does God {{choose a}} {{possible}} world to make actual? Theists typically claim that God freely selects exactly one {{world on the}} basis of its axiological characteristics. But suppose that (a) there are infinitely many unsurpassable worlds from which to choose; or else that (b) there are no unsurpassable worlds, but instead an infinite hierarchy of increasingly better worlds. On each of these scenarios, philosophers have alleged that God is unable rationally to choose a world for actualization. In the former case, God lacks sufficient <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> any particular world, since there are infinitely many other equally good candidates. In the latter case, God lacks sufficient <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> any particular world, since for any world there are infinitely many better candidates. These considerations generate arguments for atheism, as follows. On theism, God is supposed to be the explanation for this world’s being actual, and God requires sufficient reasons for action. So on either scenario (a) or (b), since there is an actual world, and since God could not have had a sufficient reason for selecting it, this world was not actualized by God. In response, defenders of theism have urged that God need not have sufficient reason for choosing a world on (a) or (b) : God may defensibly choose a world at random...|$|R

30|$|The {{results show}} that when {{conducting}} feeding assays with gammarids, attention has {{to be given to}} the selection of the test organisms in terms of their body size. In order to increase the chance of measuring influences of the treatment, the results suggest conducting experiments with organisms of a specific size class. Which size class to use might depend on the length of the planned study. Short-term experiments may be conducted with juvenile organisms of a very particular size because their feeding rate is in general higher than that for adults. Juveniles have been shown to have a higher sensitivity to toxicants [[40],[41]], making this size class a good candidate for toxicity studies. A further <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> juvenile individuals may be the increased representativeness of the test for the field situation. The density of organisms within the larger size class (adults) in the field is lower than that of smaller organisms [[42]]. However, as the feeding rate of juveniles fluctuates over time, they may only be suitable for short-term experiments. One may want {{to increase the number of}} replicates in such an experiment as the total amount of food consumed by juveniles within a day is rather low which increases the measuring uncertainty. Long-term experiments are particularly important to observe recovery potential following a treatment and for investigation of effects from pulsed exposure. Such experiments should be conducted with adult gammarids to stabilise the control feeding rate over time. A further <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> adults is their importance for sustainability of the population as these individuals reproduce.|$|R

Both humans and pigs are prone to the development of obesity and related cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Bad cholesterol (LDL) is high and good cholesterol (HDL) is low in pigs, like in humans. Disease-relevant pig models fill the gap between rodent models and primate species including humans. Diet-induced obese pigs show a phenotype related to the metabolic syndrome including high amounts of visceral fat, fatty organs, insulin resistance and high blood pressure. However, overt hyperglycaemia does not develop within 6 months after initiation of high sugar-fat feeding. Therefore, to accelerate the induction of obese type 2 diabetes, obese pigs can be titrated with streptozotocin, a chemical agent which selectively damages the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. However, insulin is required to maintain obesity. With proper titration of streptozotocin, insulin secretion can be restrained at such a level that hyperglycaemia will be induced but lipolysis is still inhibited {{due to the fact that}} inhibition of lipolysis is more sensitive to insulin compared to stimulation of glucose uptake.

The data were first explained in terms of their frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation. Little research has been conducted on international students in Turkey. According to the findings of this study, The majority of the students studying in Turkey come from Turkish-speaking neighboring countries. The findings of the present study also reveal that {{there seems to be no}} systematic policy for attracting international students to Turkey. Students’ academic accomplishment has been negatively influenced by their low level of proficiency in the Turkish language. In addition, international students also suffer from difficulty in becoming accustomed to their social environment. According to the findings of the study, most international students have economic problems. Despite these problems, the majority of the international students in Turkey were satisfied with their education. In order to maintain the satisfaction of international students, adopting both long-term and short-term strategies and policies by government is recommended. Having a positive attitude towards Turkey can be considered as one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> Turkey as a destination for higher education. In general, the findings of the study illustrated that international students selected Turkey mainly due to their cultural proximity, Turkey’s comparatively developed economy and access to high-quality higher education...|$|E
40|$|Mortality {{rates in}} females who survived acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) exceed those in males. Differences between sexes in age, cardiovascular risk factors and revascularization therapy have been proposed as possible <b>reasons.</b> <b>To</b> <b>select</b> sets of female and male patients comparable in respect of relevant risk factors in order to compare the sex-specific risk in a systematic manner. Data of the ISAR-RISK and ART studies were investigated. Patients were enrolled between 1996 and 2005 and suffered from AMI within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. Patients of each sex were selected with 1 : 1 equivalent age, previous AMI history, sinus-rhythm presence, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and revascularization therapy. Survival times were compared between sex groups in the whole study cohort and in the matched cohort. Of 3840 consecutive AMI survivors, 994 (25. 9 %) were females and 2846 (74. 1 %) were males. Females were older and suffered more frequently from hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In the whole cohort, females showed an increased mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1. 54 compared to males (p< 0. 0001). The matched cohort comprised 802 patients of each sex and revealed a trend towards poorer survival in females (HR for female sex 1. 14; p = 0. 359). However, significant mortality differences with a higher risk in matched females was observed {{during the first year}} after AMI (HR = 1. 61; p = 0. 045) but not during the subsequent years. Matched sub-groups of post-AMI patients showed a comparable long-term mortality. However, a female excess mortality remained during first year after AMI and cannot be explained by differences in age, cardiovascular risk factors, and modes of acute treatment. Other causal factors, including clinical as well as psychological and social aspects, need to be considered. Female post-AMI patients should be followed more actively particularly during the first year after AMI...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis „Reading of the Online Version of Postimees Among Upper Secondary School Students“ was to determine which articles young people open at Postimees. ee website and on what grounds their choices are based. Responses to the research questions were obtained by combining two methods, qualitative research method (semi-structured interviews) and observations using think-aloud method. I comprised in my study nine last-year-students of media class of Lähte Gymnasium aged 17 to 20. To analyse the research results, I used qualitative content analysis and received the following answers to the research questions. The responders almost merely opened the articles in the middle column of Postimees. ee. Next to all the opened articles the photographs were used by the editor. The most frequent reason for opening an article was involvement in the topic. Other reasons to open the news were human interest and actuality of the topics. News about Estonia and Estonians were also important and interesting for young readers. Less interesting were news about exceptional events and previous experience as the reason of selecting the news. The headline and photo next to the article were also important <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> the articles, but more {{in the way of}} being teasers, rather than the main reason. It also occurred, that in most cases respondents didn’t finish reading the article. They said they got the information they wanted {{from the beginning of the}} story or that the article was too long. The opinion that the second part of the article wasn’t that interesting, was also mentioned as a reason for not finishing reading the story. During the study no-one opened the articles which could be classified as entertainment, though the majority of respondents said they often visit one or several web-sites, which offer that kind of material. The future studies in the topic are important for several reasons. It is important to study the online-reading habits and the reasons why online-readers tend not to finish reading the articles. Second of all the results may prove useful materials for the practitioners, who provide online texts and news for young people...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{debate on}} procreative {{selection}} {{focuses on the}} wellbeing of the future child. However, selection decisions can also have significant effects on the wellbeing of others. Moreover, these effects may run in opposing directions; some traits conducive to the wellbeing of the selected child may be harmful to others, while other traits that limit the child’s wellbeing may preserve or increase that of others. Prominent selection principles defended to date instruct parents <b>to</b> <b>select</b> a child, of the possible children they could have, {{likely to have a}} good (or non-bad) life, but they do not instruct parents to independently take wellbeing of others into account. We refer to these principles as individualistic selection principles. We propose a new selection principle—Procreative Altruism—according to which parents have significant moral <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> a child whose existence can be expected to contribute more to (or detract less from) the wellbeing of others than any alternative child they could have. We present the case for adopting Procreative Altruism alongside any of the major individualistic selection principles proposed to date and defend this two-principle model against a range of objections...|$|R

The case-study of a highly nonlinear exothermic continuous stirred tank reactor, which poses a multivariable control problem with two interacting loops and open-loop instability, is used. The behaviour of the fuzzy logic controller is {{compared with that of}} a PID controller. A smooth. easily tuneable gain-schedule is designed to handle offset-like problems with a fuzzy controller. It is analytically shown that such a gain-schedule is the simpler, intuitive equivalent of a manipulation of the corresponding fuzzy membership functions. The fuzzy controller structure chosen is a parsimonious one, with the choice of Gaussian bell-shaped membership functions generating a smooth input/output surface with nontrivial inferencing spanning the entire input space. This provides a clear, non-heuristic <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> Gaussian over triangular shapes for membership functions. The gain-scheduled fuzzy controller shows excellent control performance, significantly outperforming the PID controllers in both servo and regulatory modes. The disturbance rejection behaviour of the modified fuzzy controller is observed to be particularly good. (C) 2002. ...|$|R
