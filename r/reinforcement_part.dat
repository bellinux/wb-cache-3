In this work, this factor is split into two parts with opposite effects that account for the Mullins softening and for the filler reinforcement, respectively. Evolutions of both parts are obtained through a direct analysis of cyclic uniaxial tensile tests performed on a series of materials.

40|$|New {{lightweight}} {{design requirements}} from {{the automotive industry}} call for the realization of structural components with a maximum strength in excess of 1000 MPa. On the other hand, demands as far as component complexity, function integration and component quality are concerned are becoming ever higher. The press hardening technology involving the use of boron-manganese alloyed steel for blank- based component applications represent {{the state of the}} art. Typical applications include <b>reinforcement</b> <b>parts</b> in crash-relevant car body structures. Consistent use of these components will enable the needs of current and future car models as regards crash performance to be met whilst maintaining acceptable structural weights. In addition to press hardened components, hydro-formed profiles also provide a high level of potential for applications in structural car body elements with high loads. At the same time, hydro-forming tubes and blanks at room temperature is also representative {{of the state of the}} art for a number of applications in car body structures or exhaust systems, as well as for special applications outside the car industry. These parts are mainly made from materials such as steel, high-strength steel, stainless steel and aluminium. Increased demands on hydro-formed parts in terms of maximum strength and complexity mean that the limits of conventional hydro-forming processes have been reached. The use of temperature as a process parameter in hydro-forming offers the opportunity to increase the application field of this innovative technology. The potential of this strategy has been identified; complex car body parts fabricated in aluminium and magnesium have been produced at high temperatures. However, fluids available today can only be used up to 300 °C because of the limited thermal resistance of these fluids. Gaseous media (e. g. nitrogen) offer the chance to make use of the potential of temperature-assisted hydro-forming in steel forming as well. Consequently, temperatures up to 1000 °C can be provided.

40|$|Concrete is a {{structural}} composite material with excellent properties when subjected to compression. But the poor ability to resist tensile stresses forces the concrete {{to be used}} with reinforcement. Commonly, large continuous steel bars have been applied as reinforcement since mid- 1800 &# 146;s to carry the tensile loads. Placing the steel bars takes many man-hours, which contributes to {{a significant part of the}} total concrete costs. By eliminating the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>part</b> of the construction work, the costs can be reduced considerably. Fibers have been incorporated into building materials since ancient times to improve the properties. Today, fibers are incorporated in concretes to improve certain properties of this material. They are added to enhance the ductility of the concretes. Additionally, the tensile and the flexural strengths of the material are enhanced. The crack widths and their propagation are decreased by the insertion of fibers. Research over the years have shown that fiber reinforcement has sufficient strength and ductility to be used as a complete replacement to conventional steel bars in some types of structures; foundations, walls, slabs. Fibers are also used in beams in combination with conventional reinforcement which increase the capacity and the stiffness of the concrete. The technology that is available today has made is possible to consider fiber reinforcement without the use of conventional steel bars in load carrying structures. For this to be a reality, the fibers must be distributed and oriented as expected, which is difficult. If fibers can be used without the need of steel reinforcement bars, the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>part</b> of the construction work will be eliminated. Hence, the construction costs will be significantly reduced. In recent years, a project within COIN has set the aim to develop a high tensile strength all-round concrete which exhibits a residual flexural tensile strength in the range of 10 - 15 MPa and that can be applied in load carrying structures. This MSc-thesis is a part of this work and it has consisted of testing fiber-reinforced self-compacting concretes with different types and contents of fibers, namely steel fibers and basalt fibers. The different concrete mixes were tested and the corresponding fresh and hardened concrete properties were evaluated and compared. Based upon the results achieved in these experiments, the conclusion was taken of whether or not the different concrete mixes could be used for the purpose the COIN project was aiming for. </p...|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{momentum}} theory relates {{resistance to change}} of responding in a multiple-schedule component to the total reinforcement obtained in that component, regardless of how the reinforcers are produced. Four pigeons responded {{in a series of}} multiple-schedule conditions in which a variable-interval 40 -s schedule arranged reinforcers for pecking in one component and a variable-interval 360 -s schedule arranged them in the other. In addition, responses on a second key were reinforced according to variable-interval schedules that were equal in the two components. In different parts of the experiment, responding was disrupted by changing the rate of reinforcement on the second key or by delivering response-independent food during a blackout separating the two components. Consistent with {{momentum theory}}, responding on the first key in Part 1 changed more in the component with the lower reinforcement total when it was disrupted by changes in the rate of reinforcement on the second key. However, responding on the second key changed more in the component with the higher reinforcement total. In Parts 2 and 3, responding was disrupted with free food presented during intercomponent blackouts, with extinction (Part 2) or variable-interval 80 -s <b>reinforcement</b> (<b>Part</b> 3) arranged on the second key. Here, resistance to change was greater for the component with greater overall reinforcement. Failures of momentum theory to predict short-term differences in resistance to change occurred with disruptors that caused greater change between steady states for the richer component. Consistency of effects across disruptors may yet be found if short-term effects of disruptors are assessed relative to the extent of change observed after prolonged exposure...|$|E
40|$|D. arizonae and D. mojavensis are sibling {{species with}} {{overlapping}} distributions. There is character displacement for sexual isolation. Speciation {{may have been}} completed through <b>reinforcement.</b> <b>Part</b> of the sexual isolation {{can be explained by}} female preference for male lovesongs. Within the D. mojavensis cluster of the repleta species group lovesongs always contain pulse song with long inter-pulse intervals (L-IPIs) and generally feature pulse song with short inter-pulse intervals (S-IPIs) giving a bimodal IPI distribution. 'Normal' song is produced by a single wing. D. arizonae and D. mojavensis race B differ significantly in mean S-IPIs but not in mean L-IPIs. Divergent character displacement for mean IPIs is absent. The species do not differ for mean burst duration (MBD). Many pairwise comparisons between stocks show significant differences in mean IPIs and MBDs. Females from a sympatric D. arizonae stock prefer simulated songs with IPIs and bursts characteristic of conspecific males and discriminate against simulated songs with IPIs or bursts resembling a sympatric D. mojavensis stock. Females from the sympatric D. mojavensis stock do not discriminate between simulated songs of the D. arizonae and D. mojavensis stocks. In both species, mean IPIs depend on temperature which accounts for between 50 - 93 % of the variation. MBD depends on temperature in 7 / 8 stocks. Mean IPIs and MBDs of a sympatric D. arizonae and a sympatric D. mojavensis stock remain distinct over 20 °C. For sexually mature sympatric males, mean IPIs do not vary with age for a D. arizonae stock but they shorten with age for a D. mojavensis stock. A reduction in MBD with age was observed for a stock from each species. Song characters of sexually mature males, from a single stock of each species, remain distinct in sympatry. IPIs are probably controlled autosomally between species and influenced by the X-chromosome between D. mojavensis races. The Y chromosome may influence burst length. An D. arizonae stock has a shorter mean copulation duration than a D. mojavensis stock.

Shortening the development period may involve cancelling the hardware prototype phase, without which the learning process of parts and assembling behavior in the assembling process is omitted. In this context, the subject of dimensional management and especially tolerance simulation is an essential tool. For the digital prototyping phase {{it is essential that}} the simulation rebuilds the real processes. Through the process of validation by production tests, the simulation model becomes more precise, which is necessary to be faster in the subsequent digital concept validation processes. This paper establishes the challenges in simulating real assembly processes in conventional tolerance simulations. It emphasizes the limits of simulating real processes and component behavior in conventional tolerance simulations. The real process with all possible shim settings cannot be simulated using the simulation tools due to the limited datum targets which can be set. Furthermore the component behavior itself should be integrated in the simulation model to get results that are closer to reality, because the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>parts</b> and the alignment scheme are important for assembly accuracy...|$|R

Before {{trying the}} Bohemian Passes, you shall have <b>reinforcement.</b> Best <b>part</b> of the [...] "Bavarian Army," [...] now under Comte de Saxe, not under D'Harcourt farther, is to cease collecting victual in the Donau-Iser Countries (Deggendorf, north bank of Donau, its head-quarter); {{and to get}} on march,--circling very wide, not northward, but by the Donan, and even by the SOUTH, bank of it mainly (to avoid the hungry Mountains and their Tolpatcheries),--and, at Amberg, is to join Maillebois. This is a wide-lying game.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHemp fibres {{are using}} as {{reinforcement}} for compounds based on polymer in different industrial manufacturing (aerospace and automotive) for their interesting mechanical and ecological properties. The hemp fibres present a non-constant cross section and complex geometry {{that can have}} a high effect on their mechanical properties. In this study, a micro-traction test coupled with a numerical imaging treatment and a finite elements method are used. The mechanical tensile test allows to determinate {{the evolution of the}} traction load in function of the displacement until the fibre crack. The used fiber are incorporate in plastic material is order to obtained PP/hemp <b>reinforcement</b> composite <b>part.</b> Static and dynamic tests are proposed in order to study trhe behaviour of green material subjected to tensile load...|$|R
