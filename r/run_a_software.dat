Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to <b>run.</b> <b>A</b> <b>software</b> application on the computer acted as the radio's controls and display, which led to a flurry of third party developers, who wanted to make a PCR replacement.

Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple adapter cable. Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software.|$|E

The CMS translates machine code instructions received from programs into native instructions for the microprocessor.

50|$|Stellar is an {{open-source}} {{protocol for}} exchanging money. Servers <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> {{implementation of the}} protocol, and {{use the internet to}} connect to and communicate with other Stellar servers, forming a global value exchange network. Each server stores a record of all “accounts” on the network. These records are stored in a database called the “ledger”. Servers propose changes to the ledger by proposing “transactions”, which move accounts from one state to another by spending the account’s balance or changing a property of the account. All of the servers come to agreement on which set of transactions to apply to the current ledger through a process called “consensus”. The consensus process happens at a regular interval, typically every 2 to 4 seconds. This keeps each server’s copy of the ledger in sync and identical.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a static}} plant {{described}} by a differentiable input-output function, which is completely unknown, but whose Jacobian takes values in a known polytope in the matrix space, we consider the problem of tuning the output (i. e., driving the output to a desired value), by suitably choosing the input. To this aim, we assume to have at our disposal a discrete sequence of trials only, as it happens, for instance, when we iteratively <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>software,</b> with new input data at each iteration, {{in order to achieve}} the desired output value. In this paper we prove that, if the polytope is robustly non-singular (or has full row rank, in the general non-square case), then a suitable discrete-time tuning law drives the output to the desired point. The computation of the tuning law is based on a convex-optimisation problem to be solved on-line. An application example is proposed to show the effectiveness of the approach...|$|E
40|$|Current air {{transportation}} in the United States {{relies on a}} system born half a century ago. While demand for air travel has kept increasing over the years, technologies {{at the heart of}} the National Airspace System (NAS) have not been able to follow an adequate evolution. For instance, computers used to centralize flight data in airspace sectors <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> developed in 1972. Safety, as well as certification and portability issues arise as major obstacles for the improvement of the system. The NAS is a structure that has never been designed, but has rather evolved over time. This has many drawbacks, mainly due to a lack of integration and engineering leading to many inefficiencies and losses of performance. To improve the operations, understanding of this complex needs to be built up to a certain level.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a few {{techniques for}} booting Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches securely over an insecure network. Each {{of these techniques}} assume a different trust model. This work is being {{carried out in the}} context of the Fairisle ATM switch environment. In this environment we are envisaging an open multi-service network where ATM switches are booted with third party software, possibly using a third party booting service. Hence we are faced with an increased security threat, compared with a closed network environment, in ensuring that the switch has been booted with authorised and authenticated boot code. In this paper, we examines these threats and presents three schemes of countering the threats. 1 Introduction Most Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches do not <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> development environment. Switch software is developed on host machines before being loaded to the ATM switches. The loading process could take the form of replacing the boot PROM with a versio [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of maximizing the average hourly profit earned by a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) {{provider}} who <b>runs</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> service {{on behalf of a}} customer using servers rented from an Infrastructureas-a-Service (IaaS) provider. The SaaS provider earns a fee per successful transaction and incurs costs proportional to the number of server-hours it uses. A number of resource allocation policies for this or similar problems have been proposed in previous work. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, these policies have not been comparatively evaluated in a cloud environment. This paper reports on an empirical evaluation of three policies using a replica of Wikipedia deployed on the Amazon EC 2 cloud. Experimental results show that a policy based on a solution to an optimization problem derived from the SaaS provider’s utility function outperforms well-known heuristics that have been proposed for similar problems. It is also shown that all three policies outperform a “reactive ” allocation approach based on Amazon’s auto-scaling feature. I...|$|R
