The responsibility and honor of the position came upon him strongly as he sat there alone in this great hotel looking at the fire.

60|$|Because--and <b>really</b> <b>here</b> {{there are}} many excuses for the poor old water companies, when {{so many of them}} swerve and gib at the very mention of {{constant}} water-supply, like a poor horse set to draw a load which he feels is too heavy for him--because, to keep everything in order among dirty, careless, and often drunken people, there must be officers with lawful authority--water-policemen we will call them--who can enter people's houses when they will, and if they find anything wrong with the water, set it to rights with a high hand, and even summon the people who have set it wrong. And that is a power which, in a free country, must never be given to the servants of any private company, but only to the officers of a corporation or of the government.|$|E
6000|$|Scrymgeour's captor, who was {{no other}} than {{the owner of the}} Heathen Chinee, dragged him {{fiercely}} into the house-boat and stormed at him for five minutes. My friend shuddered as he thought of the explanations to come when he was allowed to speak, and gradually he realized that he had been mistaken for someone else--apparently for some young blade who had been carrying on a clandestine flirtation with the old gentleman's daughter. It will take an hour, thought Scrymgeour, to convince him that I am not that person, and another hour to explain why I am <b>really</b> <b>here.</b> Then the weak creature had an idea: [...] "Might not the simplest plan be to say that his surmises are correct, promise to give his daughter up, and row away as quickly as possible?" [...] He began to wonder if the girl was pretty; but saw it would hardly do to say that he reserved his defence until he could see her.|$|E

You must make him lenient to our entertainment,--the cause is so good! How {{long have you been}} in Boston? Though I don't know why I should ask that,--you may have always been in Boston! One used to know everybody; but the place is so large, now. I should like to come and see you; but I'm going out of town to-morrow, for the summer. I'm not <b>really</b> <b>here,</b> now, except ex officio; I ought to have been away weeks ago, but this Indigent Surf-Bathing has kept me. You've no idea what such an undertaking is. But you must let me have your address, and as soon as I get back to town in the fall, I shall insist upon looking you up. Good by! I must run away, now, and leave you; there are a thousand things for me to look after yet to-day."

6000|$|Moë {{has gone}} to Papeete by the command of the king, whose letter was {{addressed}} [...] "To the great Princess at Tautira. P.V." [...] P.V. stands for Pomaré 5th. Every evening, before she went, we played Van John lying in a circle on pillows {{in the middle of}} the floor with our heads together: and hardly an evening passed but it struck us afresh how very much you would like Moë, and we told her of you again. The house (<b>really</b> <b>here</b> a palace) in which we live, belongs to the sub-chief, Ori, a subject and relation of the Princess. He, and his whole family, consisting of his wife, his two little adopted sons, his daughter and her two young babies, turned out to live in a little bird-cage hut of one room. Ori is the very finest specimen of a native we have seen yet; he is several inches over six feet, of perfect though almost gigantic proportions, and looks more like a Roman Emperor in bronze than words can express. One day, when Moë gave a feast, it being the correct thing to do, we all wore wreaths of golden yellow leaves on our heads; when Ori walked in and sat down at the table, as with one voice we all cried out in admiration. His manners and I might say his habit of thought are English. In some ways, he is so like a Colonel of the Guards that we often call him Colonel. It was either the day before, or the morning of our public feast, that Louis asked the Princess if she thought Ori would accept his name. She was sure of it, and much pleased at the idea. I wish you could have seen Louis, blushing like a schoolgirl, when Ori came in, and the brotherhood was offered. So now if you please, Louis is no more Louis, having given that name away in the Tahitian form of Rui, but is known as Terii-Tera (pronounced Tereeterah) that being Ori's Christian name. [...] "Ori a Ori" [...] is his clan name.|$|E
