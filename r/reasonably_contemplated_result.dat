40|$|Subsequent to the {{formation}} of a charterparty, extraordinary events might occur. These events may radically and significantly alter the nature of the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess legal effects of such supervening events on the performance of contractual obligations. In particular, under English law, the contract may be automatically brought to an end by operation of the doctrine of frustration. Whereas, often, commercial parties <b>reasonably</b> <b>contemplate</b> change of circumstances at the time of the contracting and predetermine legal consequences for these events. This can be achieved through contractual risk allocation clauses, such as force majeure. Therefore, the study analyzed the effect of the contractual force majeure clauses and interrelation of these clauses with the frustration doctrine. The research concluded that by incorporating force majeure clauses, parties can: firstly, avoid the frustration of their contract if such clause fully covers the frustrating event; and secondly, parties can bring their contractual relations to an end in circumstances, which by itself may not be sufficient to bring the doctrine of frustration into operation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a market design for trading {{capacity}} reserves (also called Ancillary Services, AS) and to introduce a strategy for the optimal bidding problem in such a scenario. In the deregulated market, the presence of several market participants or Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) entitled for trading energy, together with the increasing integration of renewable sources and price-elastic loads, shift the focus on decentralized control and reliable forecast techniques. The main feature of the considered market design is its double-sided nature. In addition to portfolio-based supply bids and based on prediction of their stochastic production and load, BRPs are allowed to submit risk-limiting requests. Requesting capacity from the AS market corresponds to giving to the market an estimate of the possible deviation from the daily production schedule resulting from the day-ahead auction and from bilateral contracts, named E-Program. In this way each BRP is responsible for the balanced and safe operation of the electric grid. On the other hand, at each Program Time Unit (PTU) BRPs must also offer their available capacity under the form of bids. In this paper, a bidding strategy to the double-sided market is described, where the risk is minimized and all the constraints are fulfilled. The algorithms devised are tested in a simulation environment and compared to the current practice, where the double-sided auction is not <b>contemplated.</b> <b>Results</b> in terms of expected imbalances and reliability are presented...|$|R
50|$|Consent can {{be either}} {{expressed}} or implied. For example, participation in a contact sport usually implies consent to a degree of contact with other participants, implicitly agreed and often defined {{by the rules of}} the sport.

Express consent exists when there is oral or written agreement, particularly in a contract. For example, businesses may require that persons sign a waiver (called a liability waiver) acknowledging and accepting the hazards of an activity. This proves express consent, and prevents the person from filing a tort lawsuit for unauthorised actions.|$|R

40|$|A two-part {{polyurethane}} foam {{has been tested}} in the laboratory and {{in the field to}} assess its utility in controlling lost circulation encountered when drilling geothermal wells. A field test was conducted in The Geysers in January, 1988, to evaluate the chemical formulation and downhole tool used to deploy the chemicals. Although the tool apparently functioned properly in the field test, the chemicals failed to expand sufficiently downhole, instead forming a dense polymer that may be ineffective in sealing loss zones. Subsequent laboratory tests conducted under simulated downhole conditions indicate that the foam chemicals undergo severe mixing with water in the wellbore, which disturbs the kinetics of the chemical reaction more than was previously <b>contemplated.</b> The <b>results</b> indicate that without significant changes in the foam chemical formulation or delivery technique, the foam system will be ineffective in lost circulation control except under very favorable conditions...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is twofold. First, for a rather broad class of {{financial}} options a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) approach is proposed for dynamically hedging a portfolio of underlying assets. After formulating the dynamic hedging problem as a stochastic control problem with a least-squares criterion, for plain vanilla and exotic options we test its ability to replicate the payoff at expiration date. We show not only that relatively small hedging errors are obtained in spite of price realizations, but also that the approach is robust with respect to market modeling errors. The SMPC approach is then extended to hedging derivative contracts (such as plain vanilla and exotic options) {{in the presence of}} transaction costs. After proving that the least-squares approach is no longer suitable to handle this kind of market, the hedging performance obtained by three different measures is tested and compared in simulation on a European call and a barrier option. The aim {{in the second part of}} this thesis is to present a novel market design for trading energy and regulating reserves and to introduce a strategy for the optimal bidding problem in such a scenario. In the deregulated market, the presence of several market participants or Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) entitled for trading energy, together with the increasing integration of renewable sources and price-elastic loads, shift the focus on decentralized control and reliable forecast techniques. The main feature of the considered market design is its double-sided nature. In addition to portfolio-based supply bids and based on prediction of their stochastic production and load, BRPs are allowed to submit risk-limiting requests. Requesting capacity from the AS market corresponds to giving to the market an estimate of the possible deviation from the daily production schedule resulting from the day-ahead auction and from bilateral contracts, named E-Program. In this way each BRP is responsible for the balanced and safe operation of the electric grid. On the other hand, at each Program Time Unit (PTU) BRPs must also offer their available capacity under the form of bids.
