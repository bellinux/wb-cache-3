40|$|Section 404 {{is arguably}} the most {{controversial}} provision of Sarbanes-Oxley (“SOX”). The controversy focuses on whether Section 404 ’s substantial compliance costs exceed the statute’s benefits, with no consensus on Section 404 ’s cost-effectiveness. If Section 404 turns out to be cost-ineffective, the companies that are most threatened are smaller companies, as cost-ineffective regulations tend to disproportionately harm smaller companies. This Article considers whether Congress and the SEC should exempt smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> from Section 404 compliance, as that would allow for a market-based resolution to the uncertain value of Section 404 for smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies.</b> Smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> would be relieved from mandatory compliance, but would retain the ability to voluntarily choose to comply with Section 404 if they found it to be cost-effective. Rather than debate the cost-effectiveness of Section 404, Section 404 relief proposals appear to provide a definitive mechanism for answering the cost-benefit question by allowing investors to express their demand (or lack of demand) for the services provided by Section 404 through the price they pay for securities. While empowering smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> with such market-based regulatory solutions might seem appealing at first glance, this Article explains why structural factors within the public securities markets for smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> will prevent such market-based proposals from accurately determining the net effect of Section 404. Instead, exempting smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> from Section 404 is likely to significantly increase the information asymmetry between smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> and their investors. This outcome would be particularly problematic since ordinary shareholders (rather than institutional shareholders) are the predominant external shareholders for smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> and have historically demonstrated themselves to be vulnerable to just this type of information asymmetry. This Article constructs a model for analyzing the probable impact of granting Section 404 relief to smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> and concludes that making Section 404 voluntary for smaller <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> would almost certainly guarantee an insufficient amount of investment by those companies in their “internal control over financial reporting” (“ICFR”), with the cost for that insufficient dedication of resources to ICFR being borne primarily and unknowingly by unsophisticated ordinary investors...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to examine the {{economic}} consequences ofvoluntary environmental reporting on shareholders' wealth among Malaysian Listed Companies that voluntarily disclosed environmental information in their financial report. One hundred andfifty two (152) companies of Bursa Malaysia (MSE) had {{been identified as a}} sample in the current study. Seventy six (76) companies were classified as environmental <b>reporting</b> <b>companies</b> while the remaining companies were classified as non-environmental <b>reporting</b> <b>companies.</b> The classification was done {{in order to determine the}} differences between share price, profitability and market equity for both types of companies. The study hypothesizes that voluntary environmental reporting leads to an improvement in the shareholders wealth. However, the results show that there is no significant difference between cumulative abnormal return for environmental and non-environmental <b>reporting</b> <b>companies.</b> Based on the results obtained, it can also be concluded that profitability and size of the companies do not have any significant roles in deciding whether or not to produce environmental <b>reporting</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission divides {{reporting}} companies, {{those that}} file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 into different categories based on size, among other factors. [...] Smaller companies have less stringent reporting obligations, provide less historical financial information, {{are exempt from}} some provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and have more time within which to file their reports. The smallest category of company {{is known as a}} Smaller <b>Reporting</b> <b>Company.</b> A Smaller <b>Reporting</b> <b>Company</b> will qualify as such if, as of the last business day of its second fiscal quarter, they have a public float of less than $75 million. [...] Public float is defined as the shares of their publicly traded common stock that is not held by management and certain large investors. Not all companies that file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are publicly traded, and so if a company cannot calculate its public float, then an alternative way to be a Smaller <b>Reporting</b> <b>Company</b> is to have annual revenue of $50 million or less. Company’s are required to do the analysis each year following their second fiscal quarter and, after a transition period, will then be required to file accordingly.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is perhaps}} because of the {{tendency}} of economic policy in market-driven economies not to interfere with consumers' preferences that the producer-centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production: in statistics on energy, emissions, water, etc., impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries ("on-site" [...] or [...] "direct" [...] allocation) rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers.
