5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
2500|$|This type of causal {{foreseeability}} is to {{be distinguished}} from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which {{is a question of}} <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> not causation. [...] For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, {{it would be hard to}} construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage. [...] There is no novus actus interveniens. [...] However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence: The Wagon Mound (No 1) [...] AC 388 (Privy Council). [...] That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.|$|E
60|$|Yet we {{feel that}} Diderot's impetuous taunts fail to press {{to the root of}} the matter. Diderot excels in opening a subject; he places it in a new light; he furnishes telling {{concrete}} illustrations; he thoroughly disturbs and unsettles the medium of conventional association in which it has become fixed. But he does not leave the question readjusted. His mind was not of that quality which is slow to complain where it cannot explain; which does not quit a discussion without a calm and orderly review of the conditions that underlie the latest exhibition of human folly, shortsightedness, or injustice. The public condemnation of Desroches for consequences that were entirely strange to his one offence, was indefensible on grounds of strict logic. But then men have imagination as well as reason. Imagination is stronger than reason with most of them. Their imagination was touched by the series of disasters that followed Madame Desroches's abandonment of her husband. They admit no plea of <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> such as law courts allow. In a way that was loose and unreasonable, but still easily intelligible, the husband became associated with a sequel for which he was not really answerable. If the world's conduct in such cases were accurately expressed, it would perhaps be found that people have really no intention to pronounce a judicial sentence; they only mean that an individual's associations have become disagreeable and doubtful to them. They may think proper to justify the grievously meagre definition of homo as animal rationale, by varnishing their distaste with reasons; the true reason is that the presence of a Desroches disturbs their comfort, by recalling questionable and disorderly circumstances. That this selfish and rough method many a time inflicts horrible cruelty is too certain, and those to whom the idea of conduct is serious and deep-reaching will not fall into it. A sensible man is aware of the difficulty of pronouncing wisely upon the conduct of others, especially where it turns upon the intricate and unknowable relations {{between a man and a}} woman. He will not, however, on that account break down the permanent safeguards, for the sake of leniency in a given case. A great enemy to indifference, a great friend to indulgence, said Turgot of himself; and perhaps it is what we should all do well to be able to say of ourselves.|$|E

The {{test for}} <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> {{laid down in}} Hadley v Baxendale has survived {{more than a century}} and a half with {{comparatively}} little meddling from the English courts. That is not to say there has been no attempt at refinement or clarification. The recent decision in The Achilleas saw five Law Lords coming to the same conclusion as to the rule’s effect but for very different reasons. This dissertation will consider the historical development of the Hadley v Baxendale rule, its rationale, its application in the later English cases of Nettleship, Victoria Laundry and The Heron II, the approaches adopted by the House of Lords in The Achilleas, its subsequent effect in The Amer Energy and The Sylvia, the difference in approach adopted in tort and finally will conclude with a comparison of the approaches to assessing <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> in English and South African law...|$|R

5000|$|Negligence and deceit {{differ with}} respect to <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> In deceit the {{defendant}} is liable for all losses flowing directly from the tort, whether they were foreseeable or not. In Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd Lord Denning MR remarked, [...] "it does not lie {{in the mouth of}} the fraudulent person to say that they could not reasonably have been foreseen." [...] So where there is a sudden downturn in the property market, a person guilty of deceitful misrepresentation is liable for all the claimant's losses, even if they have been increased by such an unanticipated event. This is subject to a duty to mitigate the potential losses.|$|R
40|$|The {{controversial}} case Achilleas {{was submitted}} to The United Kingdom Supreme Court {{last year after}} the judgement of the Court of Appeal which was in favour of the owner. The House of Lords surprisingly overturned {{the decision of the}} lower courts and redefined the long established rules on foreseeability and <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> for breach <b>of</b> contract. This thesis is triggered by the judgements of the Achilleas case and it will analyze the important issues regarding redelivery under a time charter party arising from the Achilleas based on the principles under English contract law. At the first place, this thesis will give a general idea of charter parties and especially analyze the nature of time charters. Following this, relevant issues as charter period and the last voyage will be discussed. The practical problems of early and late redelivery under time charters will be emphasized based on English cases. And finally, different kinds <b>of</b> remedies for <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> contract breach will be discussed and the thesis is aimed at trying to provide some legal recommendations for both owners and charters...|$|R

25|$|The {{point about}} <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> under s 2(1) was {{treated in the}} {{controversial}} case of Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson. Here Mr Rogerson bought a car on hire purchase, from a Honda dealer, financed by Royscot Trust Ltd. When Mr Rogerson fell behind in his repayments and sold away the car, Royscot Trust Ltd sued the Honda dealer, because they found it had misrepresented {{the proportion of the}} deposit Mr Rogerson had put down for the car. On this basis they argued that Honda was liable for them not being able to recover the cost of the loan (Mr Rogerson had no money). Royscot Ltd argued that the loss was too remote, or that Mr Rogerson's wrongful sale was a break in the causal chain. But the Court of Appeal held that in any event the test under s 2(1) was the same as in the tort of deceit, that one should be liable for all consequences. Balcombe LJ said this followed from the clear wording of the Act.|$|R
50|$|International Shipping Co (Pty) Ltd v Bentley is an {{important}} case in South African law. It was heard in the Appellate Division on 25 and 26 September 1989, with judgment handed down on 10 November. The presiding officers were Corbett CJ, Botha JA, Hefer JA, Smalberger JA and Friedman AJA. The case is especially important in the law of delict, {{in the area of}} causation and on the question <b>of</b> the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> An auditor was sued by a financing company for loss caused by negligent misstatements contained in a report by the auditor of a group of companies. This report was misleading: It did not give an accurate picture of the bleak financial situation of the group for which the company was providing financial facilities. The court found that the auditor had acted negligently and unlawfully, and so established factual causation. On appeal, however, it was held that the company's loss was too remote for the auditor to be held liable. The judgment set out the factors relevant to determining whether or not a loss is too remote.|$|R
5000|$|The SCA has {{consistently}} {{stated that the}} causation element involves a second aspect, legal causation or <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> which is not concerned with causation so much as with restricting the causal effect of the defendant's conduct.

50|$|Most of the {{situations}} in which the courts have employed the floodgates argument have revolved around liability in tort, and in particular {{in relation to the}} liability for nervous shock or for pure economic loss.

50|$|Parsons (Livestock) Ltd v Uttley Ingham & Co Ltd 1978 QB 791 is an English {{contract}} law case, concerning <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> In it, the majority held that losses for {{breach of contract}} are recoverable if the type or kind of loss is a likely result of the breach of contract. Lord Denning MR, dissenting on the reasoning, held that a distinction should be drawn between losses for physical damage (for which the same, restrictive test as in tort applies) and economic losses (where a wider remoteness rule applies).|$|E

50|$|The Wagon Mound (No 1) test is less {{generous to}} claimants than the direct {{consequence}} test {{because it may}} impose an artificial limit on the extent <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> that can be claimed. To mitigate some of the potential unfairness of the rule, the courts have been inclined to take a relatively liberal view <b>of</b> whether <b>damage</b> is <b>of</b> a foreseeable type. In Lamb v. London Borough of Camden a water main maintained by the Council broke, which caused extensive damage to the claimant's house. Because <b>of</b> the <b>damage,</b> the claimant moved out and squatters moved in, causing further damage to the house. The {{court held that the}} secondary damage caused by the squatters was too remote. The council was liable for the damage caused by the broken water main, but the land owner is responsible for keeping trespassers at bay. Lord Denning said at p636 that <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> is just a question of policy with the element of foreseeability being determined by what is perceived to be instinctively just. This means that the reasonable foreseeability test is not always appropriate for cases where the acts of the claimant may demonstrate some fault. Nevertheless, the courts can award damages based on foreseeability where public policy requires it, e.g. in the egg-shell skull cases such as Smith v Leech Brain & Co.|$|R
50|$|Due to the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> the region, most reports <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> {{came from}} areas {{hundreds}} of {{kilometers from the}} epicenter.

Owners themselves had often little or no money, since they had fallen victim to negative equity, so mortgage lenders would pursue a valuer instead to recover some losses.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} further {{that the test}} for {{determining}} <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> (under the rubric of legal causation) was a flexible one. That meant that the existing criteria of foreseeability, directness, etcetera, should not be applied dogmatically, but in a flexible manner, {{so as to avoid}} a result which was so unfair or unjust that it was regarded as untenable. Each of the various criteria led {{to the conclusion that the}} loss suffered by the respondent was not too remote; furthermore, the conclusion that the appellant should be held liable was not untenable. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{introduce}} a new parameter of a code, {{referred to as the}} remoteness, which {{can be viewed as a}} dual to the covering radius. Indeed, the remoteness is the minimum radius needed for a single ball to cover all codewords. After giving some general results about the remoteness, we then focus on the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> permutation codes. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the minimum cardinality of a code with a given remoteness. We then study the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> permutation groups. We show that the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> transitive groups can only take two values, and we determine the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> transitive groups of odd order. We finally show that the problem <b>of</b> determining the <b>remoteness</b> <b>of</b> a given transitive group is equivalent to determining the stability number of a related graph...|$|R
