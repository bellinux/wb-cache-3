50|$|Radiation {{fields of}} ZnO quantum wells can be {{adjusted}} by coupling through localized surface plasmons. By sputtering Ag islands onto ZnO films, their band gap emission coming through the Ag island films was enhanced by threefolds, while the defect emission was quenched. The enhancement is mainly dependent on the Ag island size. photoluminescence spectra of seven samples which have different Ag island sizes are represented; #4 sample has the largest size of island, but # 1 sample has the smallest size of the island. It is revealed that sputtering time related to the island size {{have an effect on}} the enhancement of 380 nm band and 530 nm band. The PL enhancement or quenching may be due to the coupling of the light emission with the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Ag islands. When localized surface Plasmon <b>resonance</b> <b>scattering</b> dominates over the absorption process, the localized surface Plasmon energy can be recovered to free space emission, leading to the enhancement of light emission. Otherwise, light emission will be attenuated due to non-radiative dissipation of localized surface plasmon absorption.|$|E
50|$|In a 2016 {{follow up}} episode of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast #561 a letter {{forwarded}} from {{a member of}} the Carter family from Carl G. 'Jere' Justus was read giving his explanation of Carter's UFO sighting:After recently reading the book 'Georgia Myths & Legends', by Augusta Chronicle columnist Don Rhodes, specifically Chapter 5 'Jimmy Carter and the UFO', I am virtually certain that I have identified the source of what it was that President Carter saw. In the 1960s and early 70s I worked on an Air Force sponsored project that studied the upper atmosphere using releases of glowing chemical clouds, produced by rockets launched from Eglin AFB rocket range in Florida. Some of these chemical clouds, notably sodium and barium, were visible by the process of <b>resonance</b> <b>scattering</b> of sunlight. Clouds of this type had to be launched not long after sunset or not long before sunrise. This was {{due to the fact that}} the cloud had to be in sunlight at high altitude, while it was still dark enough at ground level for the cloud to be visible against the dark sky. In Carter's official 1973 UFO report, as given in the Rhodes book, he stated that he had seen the phenomenon in October, 1969, at 7:15 pm EST. However, it has been determined from Lions Club records that Carter must have seen the 'UFO' when he spoke to their Leary, GA Chapter on January 6, 1969. The report 'U.S. Space Science Program Report to COSPAR, 1970' (QB504.U54, Appendix I, page 154), documents that there was a barium cloud launched from Eglin AFB (Rocket Number AG7.626) and released on January 6, 1969 at 7:35 pm EST (January 7, 1969, 0035 UTC) stands for Committee on Space Research. The reported altitude for this cloud was 152 km. With a distance between Leary, GA and Eglin AFB, FL of about 234 km, this cloud would have appeared in the sky at an elevation of 33 degrees (consistent with Carter's estimate of a 30 degree elevation). Carter's report notes that stars were visible, so the night must have been clear. I can verify from personal experience that under clear skies, a barium cloud such as this would easily have been visible from the distance of Leary, GA. Carter reported the UFO 'appeared from West'. The direction of Eglin AFB from Leary, GA is approximately WSW. Thus this barium cloud at Eglin is consistent with Carter's reported 'UFO' as to time, elevation, AND direction. Furthermore, the appearance reported by Carter is totally consistent with a high altitude barium cloud. His report stated that it was 'bluish at first, then reddish, luminous not solid'. A neutral barium cloud would initially glow bluish or greenish, with parts of it taking on a reddish glow as some the barium becomes ionized in the high altitude sunlight. The size and brightness, reported as being about that of the moon, would also be consistent with a barium cloud at Eglin, as viewed from Leary, GA. Carter has been reported as saying that he never believed that he had seen an alien spacecraft, but that he had no idea exactly what it was. I'm interested in exploring if this information could be relayed to President Carter, so that if he wishes to, he can better understand what it was that he saw back then.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the central abundance dips found from spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of several groups and clusters of galaxies is <b>resonance</b> <b>scattering.</b> A number of the prominent iron emission lines are resonance lines. We construct a unique spectral model which takes account of <b>resonance</b> <b>scattering</b> for several thousand resonance lines, projection effects, photoelectric absorption, and allows direct spectral fitting. We apply our model to Chandra observations of two clusters with pronounced central abundance dips, Centaurus and Abell 2199. The results show that the effect of <b>resonance</b> <b>scattering</b> on emission from the centre of the cluster can be as much as 30 per cent for the Fe-K resonance lines, and 10 per cent for several Fe-L lines, if turbulence is low. The change to the metallicities obtained by fitting low resolution CCD spectra is at most 10 per cent. Accounting for <b>resonance</b> <b>scattering</b> does not remove the central dip. Allowing for internal absorption within the Centaurus significantly improves the quality of the fits, indicating the presence of absorbing material within the inner 40 kpc of NGC 4696.
