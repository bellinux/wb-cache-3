40|$|Abstract Two {{distinctly}} separate {{training facilities}} (dry-land and aquatic) are routinely used in springboard diving and pose an interesting problem for learning, given the inherent differences in landing (head first vs. feet first) {{imposed by the}} different task constraints. Although divers may practise the same preparation phase, take-off and initial aerial rotation in both environments, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that the tasks completed in the dry-land training environment are representative of those performed in the aquatic competition environment. The aim of this study was to compare the kinematics of the preparation phase of <b>reverse</b> <b>dives</b> routinely practised in each environment. Despite their high skill level, it was predicted that individual analyses of elite springboard divers would reveal differences in the joint coordination and board-work between take-offs. The two-dimensional kinematic characteristics were recorded during normal training sessions and used for intra-individual analysis. Kinematic characteristics of the preparatory take-off phase revealed differences in board-work (step lengths, jump height, board depression angles) for all participants at key events. However, the presence of scaled global topological characteristics suggested that all participants adopted similar joint coordination patterns in both environments. These findings suggest that the task constraints of wet and dry training environments are not similar, and highlight the need for coaches to consider representative learning designs in high performance diving programmes...|$|R

50|$|The second Survivor Series {{match was}} a 10-on-10 {{variation}} of tag teams where if a wrestler from a tag team was eliminated, his partner was also eliminated. The match pitted the Powers of Pain (The Warlord and The Barbarian), The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid), The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), and The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers) against WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov), The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) and The Conquistadors. Hart pinned Raymond {{with a small}} package, eliminating The Fabulous Rougeaus from the match. Zhukov hit a <b>reverse</b> <b>diving</b> crossbody on Powers and pinned him to eliminate The Young Stallions but shortly after, he was pinned by Jannetty with a sunset flip, thus eliminating The Bolsheviks from the match. Hart hit a German suplex on Blanchard but the referee saw his shoulders down, so he counted the pinfall eliminating The Hart Foundation. The Rockers began brawling with Blanchard and his partner Anderson. The Rockers and the Brain Busters were both disqualified due to brawling in the ring and were eliminated. Dynamite hit Smash on the mat {{and went to the}} top rope. He tried to hit a diving headbutt but Smash got up and clotheslined him and then pinned him to eliminate the British Bulldogs. Smash was unable to handle the powerful Barbarian of the Powers of Pain. When Mr. Fuji thought that his team could not beat the Powers of Pain, he opened the rope causing Smash to fall from the ring and get counted out, thus eliminating Demolition. Afterward, Ax confronted Fuji but when Ax turned his back, Fuji struck him with his cane. Demolition beat him and turned babyfaces. The Powers of Pain turned heels after they placed him in their corner. Moments later, the Barbarian hit Conquistador #1 with a diving headbutt and pinned him to eliminate The Conquistadors, making the Powers of Pain the survivors.

5|$|In {{light of}} Fighter Command's need for {{units in the}} south of the country, No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940.

One of his victims crashed into a river, the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down. Lock followed it down.

Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site. As he left the scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat. On the way home he saw his first victim in the river, with a dingy nearby. A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date.|$|R

40|$|Southern {{elephant}} seals (Mirounga leonina) {{are relatively}} common top predators and major consumers within the Southern Ocean. This study aimed {{to describe the}} at-sea behaviour of a small population of southern elephant seals at Marion Island and to place this behaviour into an ecological and evolutionary context. Calculations of life-time habitat use for animals from this population revealed that seals spent an average of 77. 59 % of their lives diving at sea, 7. 06 % at the sea surface, and 15. 35 % hauled out on land. Animals from this population evidently tended to dive deeper than reported for other populations. Their extreme dive behaviour, and apparent shorter reproductive lifespans than animals from some other populations led to a ‘deeper diving – shorter life’ hypothesis, suggesting that Marion Island elephant seals may carry substantial physiological costs associated with deeper diving. Mean dive depths (± SD) recorded for female seals were 560 ± 170 m {{during the day and}} 394 ± 153 m at night. Male seals dived to a mean depth of 618 ± 259 m during the day and 480 ± 272 m at night. Female seals mostly foraged pelagically on vertically migrating prey, displaying positive diel vertical migration in their dive depths. Individual variation existed though, and some females tended to display a <b>reverse</b> pattern of <b>diving</b> deeper at night, compared to daytime dives. Adult male seals displayed more individual variation in forage strategies, though the majority still favoured foraging pelagically, and not benthically as described for other populations. Subadult males tended to use dive strategies that always resulted in dive patterns that exhibited diel variation in dive depths. By implementing a refined method that combines dive type analyses with relative amounts of time spent at the bottom of forage dives, descriptions are provided of the spatial areas of increased forage effort for male and female seals. Female seals tended to concentrate their forage efforts in areas further away from the island, rarely displaying forage effort dives within a radius of ~ 250 km from Marion Island. Adult males concentrated their forage effort dives in areas in closer proximity to the island, while subadult males displayed more variation and often foraged at similar distances from the island and within similar areas as adult females. These results suggest that subadult males and adult females are more reliant on vertically migrating prey in pelagic environments than adult males from the same population. Nevertheless, competition for food resources between subadult males and adult females appears unlikely, since subadult males target deeper water layers than adult females. Due to the extreme sexual size dimorphism exhibited by southern elephant seals, it is unclear whether observed differences in dive behaviour are due to increased physiological capacity of males (when compared to females) or differences in activity budgets and foraging behaviour. By making use of mixed-effects models on dive results obtained from a sample of similarly-sized male and female elephant seals, I investigated the comparative influences of sex, body size and age on measured dive parameters. Model outputs indicated that, while individual variation accounted for substantial portions of total model variance for many response variables, differences in maximum- and targeted dive depths were always influenced by sex, and only partly by body length (used as a proxy for body size). Conversely, dive durations were always influenced by body length, while sex was not identified as a significant influence. These results support hypotheses that dive durations of elephant seals are limited by physiological capacity associated with body size. However, the influence of sex on the depths dived to indicate differences in forage selection between sexes in this species and possible avoidance of inter-sexual competition. Further investigations into the influences of various environmental variables (bathymetry, temperature at depth, Tmax below 100 m) as well as demographic and behavioural variables (migration stage, age-class, track day and vertical diel strategy) on dive behaviour indicated a consistent association between dive depths and in situ water temperature. While much individual variation was apparent and other variables also played significant roles, animals consistently dived deeper, and spent less time at targeted depths, when diving in warmer water masses. This is most likely explained by differences in suitable prey distributions at different temperatures. Predicted climate change in the Southern Ocean suggests an overall continued warming, resulting in elephant seals from Marion Island likely having to dive to deeper depths in search of suitable prey and/or shift their migration routes poleward. This may have negative consequence for this population, since animals from Marion Island are presumably already operating closer to their physiological limit compared to other populations.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{aim of this}} programme of {{work was}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the existing learning environment within the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) elite springboard diving programme. Unique to the current research programme, is the application of ideas from an established theory of motor learning, specifically ecological dynamics, to an applied high performance training environment. In this research programme springboard diving is examined as a complex system, where individual, task, and environmental constraints are continually interacting to shape performance. As a consequence, this thesis presents some necessary and unique insights into representative learning design and movement adaptations in a sample of elite athletes. The questions examined in this programme of work relate to how best to structure practice, which is central to developing an effective learning environment in a high performance setting. Specifically, the series of studies reported in the chapters of this doctoral thesis: (i) provide evidence for the importance of designing representative practice tasks in training; (ii) establish that completed and baulked (prematurely terminated) take-offs are not different enough to justify the abortion of a planned dive; and (iii), confirm that elite athletes performing complex skills are able to adapt their movement patterns to achieve consistent performance outcomes from variable dive take-off conditions. Chapters One and Two of the thesis provide an overview of the theoretical ideas framing the programme of work, and include a review of literature pertinent to the research aims and subsequent empirical chapters. Chapter Three examined the representativeness of take-off tasks completed in the two AIS diving training facilities routinely used in springboard diving. Results highlighted differences in the preparatory phase of <b>reverse</b> <b>dive</b> take-offs completed by elite divers during normal training tasks in the dry-land and aquatic training environments. The most noticeable differences in dive take-off between environments began during the hurdle (step, jump, height and flight) where the diver generates the necessary momentum to complete the dive. Consequently, greater step lengths, jump heights and flight times, resulted in greater board depression prior to take-off in the aquatic environment where the dives required greater amounts of rotation. The differences observed between the preparatory phases of <b>reverse</b> <b>dive</b> take-offs completed in the dry-land and aquatic training environments are arguably a consequence of the constraints of the training environment. Specifically, differences in the environmental information available to the athletes, and the need to alter the landing (feet first vs. wrist first landing) from the take-off, resulted in a decoupling of important perception and action information and a decomposition of the dive take-off task. In attempting to only practise high quality dives, many athletes have followed a traditional motor learning approach (Schmidt, 1975) and tried to eliminate take-off variations during training. Chapter Four examined whether observable differences existed between the movement kinematics of elite divers in the preparation phases of baulked (prematurely terminated) and completed take-offs that might justify this approach to training. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of variability within conditions revealed greater consistency and less variability when dives were completed, and greater variability amongst baulked take-offs for all participants. Based on these findings, it is probable that athletes choose to abort a planned take-off when they detect small variations from the movement patterns (e. g., step lengths, jump height, springboard depression) of highly practiced comfortable dives. However, with no major differences in coordination patterns (topology of the angle-angle plots), and the potential for negative performance outcomes in competition, there appears to be no training advantage in baulking on unsatisfactory take-offs during training, except when a threat of injury is perceived by the athlete. Instead, it was considered that enhancing the athletes' movement adaptability would be a more functional motor learning strategy. In Chapter Five, a twelve-week training programme was conducted to determine whether a sample of elite divers were able to adapt their movement patterns and complete dives successfully, regardless of the perceived quality of their preparatory movements on the springboard. The data indeed suggested that elite divers were able to adapt their movements during the preparatory phase of the take-off and complete good quality dives under more varied take-off conditions; displaying greater consistency and stability in the key performance outcome (dive entry). These findings are in line with previous research findings from other sports (e. g., shooting, triple jump and basketball) and demonstrate how functional or compensatory movement variability can afford greater flexibility in task execution. By previously only practising dives with good quality take-offs, it can be argued that divers only developed strong couplings between information and movement under very specific performance circumstances. As a result, this sample was sometimes characterised by poor performance in competition when the athletes experienced a suboptimal take-off. Throughout this training programme, where divers were encouraged to minimise baulking and attempt to complete every dive, they demonstrated that it was possible to strengthen the information and movement coupling in a variety of performance circumstances, widening of the basin of performance solutions and providing alternative couplings to solve a performance problem even when the take-off was not ideal. The results of this programme of research provide theoretical and experimental implications for understanding representative learning design and movement pattern variability in applied sports science research. Theoretically, this PhD programme contributes empirical evidence to demonstrate the importance of representative design in the training environments of high performance sports programmes. Specifically, this thesis advocates for the design of learning environments that effectively capture and enhance functional and flexible movement responses representative of performance contexts. Further, data from this thesis showed that elite athletes performing complex tasks were able to adapt their movements in the preparatory phase and complete good quality dives under more varied take-off conditions. This finding signals some significant practical implications for athletes, coaches and sports scientists. As such, it is recommended that care should be taken by coaches when designing practice tasks since the clear implication is that athletes need to practice adapting movement patterns during ongoing regulation of multi-articular coordination tasks. For example, volleyball servers can adapt to small variations in the ball toss phase, long jumpers can visually regulate gait as they prepare for the take-off, and springboard divers need to continue to practice adapting their take-off from the hurdle step. In summary, the studies of this programme of work have confirmed that the task constraints of training environments in elite sport performance programmes need to provide a faithful simulation of a competitive performance environment in order that performance outcomes may be stabilised with practice. Further, it is apparent that training environments can be enhanced by ensuring the representative design of task constraints, which have high action fidelity with the performance context. Ultimately, this study recommends that the traditional coaching adage 'perfect practice makes perfect", be reconsidered; instead advocating that practice should be, as Bernstein (1967) suggested, "repetition without repetition"...|$|E
