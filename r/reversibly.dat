5|$|At one time, stable carbenes {{were thought}} to <b>reversibly</b> dimerise through the {{so-called}} Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is a key}} {{constituent}} of high performing {{mixed oxide}} catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. The surface elemental composition changes dynamically and <b>reversibly</b> with the reaction conditions. In the presence of steam {{the surface of the}} catalyst is enriched in tellurium and vanadium which translates into the enhancement of the acrylic acid production.|$|E
5|$|The protein {{hemocyanin}} is {{the oxygen}} carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of <b>reversibly</b> binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by {{their role in the}} formation of lacquers.|$|E
5|$|Since {{irreversible}} inhibition {{often involves}} the initial {{formation of a}} non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme {{in more than one}} way. For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine mustard are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound <b>reversibly,</b> but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its nitrogen mustard group.|$|E
5|$|The major {{contribution}} of the Henri-Michaelis-Menten approach was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds <b>reversibly</b> to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. The kinetics of many enzymes is adequately described by the simple Michaelis-Menten model, but all enzymes have internal motions that are not accounted for in the model and can have significant contributions to the overall reaction kinetics. This can be modeled by introducing several Michaelis-Menten pathways that are connected with fluctuating rates, which is a mathematical extension of the basic Michaelis Menten mechanism.|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes <b>reversibly,</b> and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds <b>reversibly</b> to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E
5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates <b>reversibly</b> into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though {{it can be made}} by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride. Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can <b>reversibly</b> bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
25|$|IrCl(CO)2(η2-O2) - the dioxygen {{derivative}} {{which forms}} <b>reversibly</b> upon oxygenation of Vaska's complex.|$|E
25|$|Vaska's complex – iridium {{organometallic}} complex {{notable for}} its ability to bind to O2 <b>reversibly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Therefore, work-consuming {{devices such}} as pumps and {{compressors}} (work is negative) require less work when they operate <b>reversibly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Programmable matter {{seeks to}} design {{materials}} whose properties can be easily, <b>reversibly</b> and externally controlled though {{a fusion of}} information science and materials science.|$|E
25|$|All LAs are membrane-stabilizing drugs; they <b>reversibly</b> {{decrease}} {{the rate of}} depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes (like nociceptors). Though many other drugs also have membrane-stabilizing properties, not all are used as LAs (propranolol, for example).|$|E
25|$|Plasma polymer {{surfaces}} with tunable wettability and <b>reversibly</b> switchable pH-responsiveness {{have shown}} the promising prospects due to their unique property in applications, such as drug delivery, biomaterial engineering, oil/water separation processes, sensors, and biofuel cells.|$|E
25|$|Another {{system for}} metal-free {{hydrogenation}} {{is based on}} the phosphine-borane, compound 1, which has been called a frustrated Lewis pair. It <b>reversibly</b> accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the phosphonium borate 2 which can reduce simple hindered imines.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{furosemide}} is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors. Furosemide {{has been}} reported to <b>reversibly</b> antagonize GABA-evoked currents of α6β2γ2 receptors at µM concentrations, but not α1β2γ2 receptors. During development, the α6β2γ2 receptor increases in expression in cerebellar granule neurons, corresponding to increased sensitivity to furosemide.|$|E
25|$|Methods of {{hydrogen}} storage for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures, cryogenics, and chemical compounds that <b>reversibly</b> release H2 upon heating. Underground hydrogen storage {{is useful to}} provide grid energy storage for intermittent energy sources, like wind power, {{as well as providing}} fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine is {{reported}} to be a competitive and reversible inhibitor of several CYP450 enzymes, although mechanism-based (suicide) irreversible inhibition has also been identified for cimetidine's inhibition of CYP2D6. It <b>reversibly</b> inhibits CYP450 enzymes by binding directly with the complexed heme-iron of the active site via one of its imidazole ring nitrogen atoms, thereby blocking the oxidation of other drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{aldehyde}} or ketone {{group of}} a straight-chain monosaccharide will react <b>reversibly</b> with a hydroxyl group {{on a different}} carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal, forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and pyranose forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.|$|E
25|$|Insecticides* used in {{dogs for}} fleas and ticks {{commonly}} contain either organophosphates or carbamates. {{they can be}} absorbed through the skin, conjunctiva, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase irreversibly and carbamates inhibit cholinesterase <b>reversibly.</b> Toxicity occurs through overdosage with an appropriate product or use of an agricultural product. Signs for both include hypersalivation, vomiting, lethargy, tremors, difficulty walking, weakness, and death.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine also <b>reversibly</b> {{inhibits}} GIRK {{currents in}} Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent, voltage-independent, and time-independent manner. Kir3.1/3.2 ion channels are opened downstream of M2, α2, D2, and A1 stimulation, {{as well as}} other Gi-coupled receptors. Therapeutic concentrations of atomoxetine are within range of interacting with GIRKs, especially in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. It is not known whether this contributes to the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD.|$|E
25|$|Metal hydrides, such as MgH2, NaAlH4, LiAlH4, LiH, LaNi5H6, TiFeH2 and {{palladium}} hydride, {{with varying}} degrees of efficiency, {{can be used as a}} storage medium for hydrogen, often <b>reversibly.</b> Some are easy-to-fuel liquids at ambient temperature and pressure, others are solids which could be turned into pellets. These materials have good energy density by volume, although their energy density by weight is often worse than the leading hydrocarbon fuels.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 Dupont {{and others}} {{reported}} hydrogen-storage materials based on imidazolium ionic liquids. Simple alkyl(aryl)-3-methylimidazolium N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate salts that possess very low vapour pressure, high density, and thermal stability {{and are not}} inflammable can add <b>reversibly</b> 6–12 hydrogen atoms {{in the presence of}} classical Pd/C or Ir0 nanoparticle catalysts and can be used as alternative materials for on-board hydrogen-storage devices. These salts can hold up to 30 g L−1 of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|During the {{transcription}} cycle, the CTD {{of the large}} subunit of RNAP II is <b>reversibly</b> phosphorylated. RNAP II containing unphosphorylated CTD is recruited to the promoter, whereas the hyperphosphorylated CTD form is involved in active transcription. Phosphorylation occurs at two sites within the heptapeptide repeat, at Serine 5 and Serine 2. Serine 5 phosphorylation is confined to promoter regions and {{is necessary for the}} initiation of transcription, whereas Serine 2 phosphorylation is important for mRNA elongation and 3'-end processing.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, it was {{reported}} that exposing a thin film of azo-polymer to a light intensity (or polarization) gradient leads to spontaneous surface patterns. In essence, the polymer material will <b>reversibly</b> deform so as to minimize the amount of material exposed to the light. This phenomenon is not laser ablation, since it readily occurs at low power and the transformation is reversible. The mechanism of this surface holography seems related to a new photomechanical effect, involving azobenzene isomerization.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} the {{catalytic}} cycle is shown below for the ortho borylation of hydrosilane compounds. Kinetic data show that an observed trisboryl complex coordinated to cyclooctene rapidly and <b>reversibly</b> dissociates cyclooctene to form a 16 electron trisboryl complex. In the case of using benzyldimethylsilane as a directing group it is proposed that benzyldimethylsilane reacts with the trisboryl iridium catalyst through reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, followed by selective ortho-C–H bond activation via oxidative addition and reductive elimination.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine is {{a central}} nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} of the methylxanthine class. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly {{all parts of the}} world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it <b>reversibly</b> blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|A 3.8 GB file {{stolen from}} Adobe and {{containing}} 152 million usernames, <b>reversibly</b> encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org. LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords {{and has not}} salted them. Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery {{of a lot of}} information with very little effort. According to IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.|$|E
25|$|White {{phosphorus}}, {{yellow phosphorus}} or simply tetraphosphorus (P4) exists as molecules {{made up of}} four atoms in a tetrahedral structure. The tetrahedral arrangement results in ring strain and instability. The molecule is described as consisting of six single P–P bonds. Two different crystalline forms are known. The α form {{is defined as the}} standard state of the element, but is actually metastable under standard conditions. It has a body-centered cubic crystal structure, and transforms <b>reversibly</b> into the β form at 195.2 K. The β form is believed to have a hexagonal crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{cell cycle}} {{consists}} of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: karyokinesis, in which the cell's chromosomes are divided, and cytokinesis, in which the cell's cytoplasm divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase {{is dependent on the}} proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or <b>reversibly</b> stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence called G0 phase.|$|E
25|$|The {{iron ion}} may {{be either in}} the Fe2+ or in the Fe3+ state, but ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin) (Fe3+) cannot bind oxygen. In binding, oxygen {{temporarily}} and <b>reversibly</b> oxidizes (Fe2+) to (Fe3+) while oxygen temporarily turns into the superoxide ion, thus iron must exist in the +2 oxidation state to bind oxygen. If superoxide ion associated to Fe3+ is protonated, the hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and incapable of binding oxygen. In such cases, the enzyme methemoglobin reductase {{will be able to}} eventually reactivate methemoglobin by reducing the iron center.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel binds to microtubules <b>reversibly</b> {{with high}} {{affinity}} {{and has a}} maximum stoichiometry of 1 mole docetaxel per mole tubulin in microtubules. This binding stabilizes microtubules and prevents depolymerisation from calcium ions, decreased temperature and dilution, preferentially at the plus end of the microtubule. Docetaxel {{has been found to}} accumulate to higher concentration in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells than kidney carcinoma cells, which may contribute to the more effective treatment of ovarian cancer by docetaxel. It has also been found to lead to the phosphorylation of oncoprotein bcl-2, which is apoptosis-blocking in its oncoprotein form.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} {{spironolactone}} is urinary frequency. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because it reduces androgen levels and directly blocks androgen signaling, spironolactone can, in men, cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), and feminization in general, as well as testicular atrophy, <b>reversibly</b> reduced fertility, and sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin {{also carries}} nitric oxide (NO) in the globin {{part of the}} molecule. This {{improves}} oxygen delivery in the periphery and contributes to the control of respiration. NO binds <b>reversibly</b> to a specific cysteine residue in globin; the binding depends on the state (R or T) of the hemoglobin. The resulting S-nitrosylated hemoglobin influences various NO-related activities such as the control of vascular resistance, blood pressure and respiration. NO is not released in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes but transported by an anion exchanger called AE1 out of them.|$|E
25|$|Playing & editing {{software}} often contains tag editing functionality, {{but there are}} also tag editor applications dedicated to the purpose. Aside from metadata pertaining to the audio content, tags may also be used for DRM. ReplayGain is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file (audio normalization) in its metadata tag, enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file. MP3Gain may be used to <b>reversibly</b> modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability.|$|E
