40|$|Abstract: According {{to modern}} seismic codes, in {{concentrically}} braced frames the seismic input energy should be dissi-pated {{by means of}} the hysteretic behaviour of braces while all the other members (i. e. beams and columns) have to remain elastic. Accordingly, the design internal forces of braces are determined in these codes by elastic analysis of the structure subjected to seismic forces obtained by the design spectrum. The internal forces of the non-dissipative members, instead, are calculated by means of specified <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of capacity design principles. According to some recent nu-merical analyses, the yielding or buckling of columns may take place before braces achieve their axial deformation capac-ity.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modeling and analysis of a one-machine two-product, integrated production-inventory system. A semi-Markovian model is developed which incorporates a state dependent control system heretofore not used in integrated production-inventory models. Control optimization is achieved through the use of Markov-renewal programming. The model is exercised over a range of parameters {{in order to determine the}} characteristics of the system. An analysis of the experimental results leads to the following conjectures about the production-inventory system: 1. For the production-inventory system, the economic manufacturing quantity is greater than that seen in the deterministically derived EMQ. The increase results primarily from increases in expected overtime costs and expected setup costs rather than increases in stockout costs. This is important for applications, since overtime and setup costs are a good deal easier to quantify than stockout costs in a real system. 2. Under some conditions, deterministically derived <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of overtime have merit in a stochastic system. ...|$|E

However, accepting this standard, both in medical ethics and law, is not uniquely viewed upon {{in terms of its}} content or necessity. Starting from basic principles – human dignity and individual autonomy – UNESCO’s International Committee for Bioethics has offered in sketches of three bioethics declarations unique rules which must be followed in <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of this institute, and which were consequently adopted by consensus by all UNESCO state members. Following a short historical overview, this presentation examines the standards of patients’ consent to a medical measure or exam contained in UNESCO’s bioethics declarations, namely: Universal Declaration on Human Genome and Human Rights, International Declaration on Human Genetic Data and Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. Th e presentation will show that declarations hold only minimum standards that protect patients or participants in medical exams from self-willing treatment or research and that the authors of these documents missed the opportunity to set rigorous and explicit <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>applications</b> of this institute.

Since 2001, the CFP has set aside funding to help national authorities collect both economic and biological data related to fisheries management. Originally Council Regulation (EC) No 1543 / 2000 established a Community framework for the collection {{and management of the}} data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (“The Data Collection Regulation” - DCR), for which Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1639 / 2001 determined Community programs for the collection of data in the fisheries sector and laid down detailed <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application.</b> Despite examples clearly demonstrating the value of genetics for marine fishery management, routine use of genetic information in this field remains exceptional. A variety of reasons are responsible for the conspicuous absence of genetics. Some are historical, others arise {{due to a lack of}} communication between fish geneticists, fisheries managers and regulators. Also, integral to the problem, the current management infrastructure is not conducive to the uptake of genetics: Fish(eries) genetics remain confined largely to the academic realm, and research projects where there is a lack of long-term perspective and funding. As a result there is no central data-hub available for this type of information and it is not routinely collected and updated.

40|$|Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) is a {{technical}} language which covers the standardization for micro/macro- geometry specifications. In today’s environment of globalization, out-sourcing and sub-contracting is increasing. Geometrical specifications {{of a product}} need to be detailed to a degree where nothing is left open to interpretation. To fulfil this, and {{to meet the requirements}} of digital manufacturing, it is necessary to integrate the design and inspection process of a geometrical specification. At the technical level, many functional operator/operations are employed in a geometrical specification. These functional operators/operations are based on rigorous mathematics, and they are intricately related and inconvenient to be used directly. Consequently, it is of practical utility to build an integrated information system to encapsulate and manage the information involved in GPS. This thesis focuses on geometrical tolerancing, including form/orientation/ location tolerancing, and its integrated geometry information system. The main contributions are: Firstly, a global data expression for modelling the integration between the design and inspection process of a geometrical tolerance is presented based on category theory. The categorical data model represents, stores and manipulates all the elements and their relationships involved in design and inspection process of a geometrical tolerance, by categories, objects and morphisms, flexibly; the relationships between objects were refined by pull back structures; and the manipulations of the model such as query and closure of query are realized successfully by functor structures in category theory. Secondly, different categories of knowledge rules have been established to enhance the rationality and the intellectuality of the integrated geometry information system, such as the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of geometrical requirement, tolerance type, datum and datum reference framework and, for the refinement among geometrical specifications. Finally, the host system for drawing indication of geometrical tolerances in the framework of GPS was established based on AutoCAD 2007 using ObjectARX.

40|$|Competition law, as {{it applies}} to the {{maritime}} industry has on a global scale been subject to a "laissez-faire"-attitude. In fact, collusion has been encouraged. Collusion in the maritime industry has its historic origin in the colonial period. The evolution within this particular industry truly is a study in industrial organizational structure. This Thesis sets out to explain and analyze the current regulatory scheme of the European Union, {{as it applies}} to the maritime industry (European, as well as non-European). This is accomplished through an in-depth statutory interpretation of EU Council Regulation 4056 / 86 dated 22 / 12 1986, laying down detailed <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome to the maritime transport (Conferences), as well as the Commission Regulation 870 / 95 dated April 20, 1995 on the application of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty of Rome to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices between liner shipping companies (Consortia). This Thesis concludes that the former regulatory scheme is no longer up to date and thus requires replacement. The Thesis favours current developments within the maritime industry which call for increased co-operation and concentration among the carriers and providers of services (as well as co-operation as between the carriers and shippers), counter-balanced by restrictive regulation through the application of conditions, market share-restrictions and a limited five year application of the regulatory framework. The former regulatory scheme, Council-Regulation 4056 / 86, which remains in force, must therefore be interpreted restrictively, and in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, in particular Articles 85 and 86. Finally, this Thesis provides various solutions to soften the impact of full-scale application of the competition law of the European Union, as it will be applied in the maritime industry...|$|E
40|$|Will {{environmental}} issues challenge the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ? Calls {{for a new}} round of multilateral trade negotiations on the environment have multiplied. Environmentalists have kept up pressure to modify GATT. Industries with higher environmental costs may seek protection from imports. But the GATT, as a trade forum, is not the right place to discuss environmental solutions, contends the author. Focusing on trade will only distract attention from the true causes of environmental problems. Legitimate environmental policies conflict little with GATT rules because the source of most environmental problems is not trade but prices that do not reflect environmental cost, subsidies to environmentally damaging activities, or unclear property rights. Furthermore, the GATT imposes few constraints on the setting of domestic standards and environmental policies, so there is no environmental need to modify the GATT. On the contrary, by limiting the use of trade measures, which make for poor environmental policies, GATT rules support good environmental practice. By restricting unilateral recourse to trade sanctions, Gatt rules respect sovereignty and help contain power-based abuse of the trading system. In a number of areas, however, the rules are subject to wide-ranging interpretation and would benefit from clarification. This applies especially to GATT's relationship with international agreements and also, in some cases, to the unilateral use of trade sanctions. Industries and policy-makers also call for clearer <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of environmental policies with trade effects. Any attempt at unilateralism should be avoided. A closer look reveals some anomalies in the GATT with regard to environmental policy; these may merit further discussion. GATT rules on border adjustment may encourage the use of indirect policies, since these can be extended to competing imports. Indirect policies can lead to environmental costs being passed on to importers, or to double taxation of environmental costs. Legitimate policies may be left out for lack of specific reference to the environment Article XX. GATT subsidy rules may constrain burden sharing options for environmental policies. Clarification of the GATT rules would undoubtedly help counter increasing pressures to use trade instruments as a form of environmental policy - and would help redirect attention toward the true causes of environmental damage.

30|$|Owing to {{the above}} reasons, the design of WMSN routing {{mechanism}} with high energy efficiency is still very important and face more challenges than WSN. The design of WMSN routing concerns energy constrains, limited computing power, and memory availability of the sensor nodes. By far, the resource consumption {{is not the only}} design target, a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) is also needed to guarantee delivering multimedia content, such as communication reliability, real-time, and so on. Obviously, it is a trade-off problem that the transmission of multimedia data should meet the requirements of energy efficiency and QoS assurance, which seriously increases the difficulty of routing design. According to the status of sensor nodes in the process of network operation, routing can be divided into flat routing and clustering routing. Clustering routing first appears in cable network, and it is also adaptable for WSN on account of the good flexibility and high communication efficiency. Similar to WSN, the WMSN routing is always built on a hierarchical architecture, comprising several clusters in almost same size where each cluster has several sensor nodes and a cluster head. The obvious advantages of hierarchical architecture in WMSN are as follows. First, for a real WMSN contains hundreds or thousands of multimedia sensor nodes, hierarchical architecture is efficient to divide and <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of distributed computation and QoS management. Second, the sensory data are in high relativity because the sensor nodes are unavoidable to be distributed in redundancy. The unnecessary data transmission can be reduced by data fusion process of cluster head node. Third, most of sensor nodes can turn off radio model to reduce energy consumption and communication conflicts in a quite long period which can significant prolong the lifetime and improve the QoS of <b>the</b> whole network. <b>For</b> these reasons, <b>the</b> clustering routing is much suitable for WMSN than flat routing, specially in large scale network.|$|R
