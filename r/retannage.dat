40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use. Therefore, there are different ways of approaching the whole flammability issue. In this work, different approaches for analyzing the fire resistance of leather are examined: (i) influence {{of the type of}} tannage, (ii) influence of the type of leather, (iii) influence of the type of <b>retannage,</b> (iv) influence of the type of fatliquor, and (v) influence of the use of flame retardants. The results indicate that leather presents natural fire resistance. However, the type of leather, type of tannage, <b>retannage</b> and fatliquor effect the flammability behavior of leather. In addition, the use of flame retardants slightly improves the smouldering properties of leather. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The tanning {{industry}} generates a high quantity of solid wastes. Therefore, {{there is a}} need to create valorization [added value] options for these wastes. The main objective of the present work was to study the effect of protein hydrolysates (HP) prepared from fleshings on leather dyeing. During previous studies it was found that the application of HP products, obtained from fleshings, in leather <b>retannage</b> intensified the colour of crust leather. In this work the CIELAB colour system was used to evaluate the effect of HP on <b>retannage</b> processes. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) HP can be used instead of a dicyanodiamide resin (Fortan DC) if the colour parameters of the standard procedure are to be maintained, and (ii) the replacement of an acrylic resin (Fortan A 40) by glutaraldehyde-modified HP (GHP) results in a darker skin, and can therefore be interesting for the reduction of the quantity of dye used...|$|E
40|$|The leather {{industry}} generates waste either in solid or liquid form. Fleshing, which is {{integral part of}} a hide, is removed during leather processing as it is an unwanted material in the final product. For every ton of leather processed, about 100 - 150 kg of fleshing is generated. An alternative to disposal of these wastes is to reuse them. In this study, an experimental activity research for assessing the feasibility of the reuse of the collagen hydrolizate in the retanning/dyeing/fatliquoring phase was performed. The hydrolyzed collagen, in liquid form, is obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of fleshings. The hydrolizate has been used both in a vegetablechrome retannage/dyeing/fatliquoring and in a vegetable retannage/dyeing/fatliquoring to obtain bovine upper leather. Both in a vegetable-chrome <b>retannage</b> and in a vegetable <b>retannage,</b> the final leathers showed similar properties in terms of physical and technical properties to conventionally processed hides. The results obtained indicate {{that the use of}} the collagen hydrolizate in the retanning/dyeing/fatliquoring phase as an interesting route for recovering the fleshings...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have been}} made of the {{reactions}} which take place when zirconium compounds and vegetable tannins react with chromium tanned leather, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of the reactions which occur on <b>retannage.</b> Statistical procedures have been used in all investigations because of the variable nature of the substrate, and computer techniques have been applied to the repetitive statistical computations. Although chromium and vegetable tannages are well understood, further information on the reaction of zirconium with collagen was necessary before attempting to interpret the results of the studies of combination tannages with chromium, and this has been obtained by a comparative study of the reactions of chromium and zirconium with modified collagen. It is concluded that the mechanism of the reaction of basic zirconium sulphate with collagen is multipoint attachment of the tanning material by residual valency forces, although charge effects with basic groups may be supplementary. Zirconyl chloride reacts with carboxyl groups but does not form satisfactory, stable cross-links with collagen. Further evidence for this theory was obtained from the investigation of the reaction of zirconium compounds with chromium tanned collagen. Zirconyl sulphate does not interfere with effective chromium tannage and therefore can have little affinity for the carboxyl groups on the protein, but it displaces chromium complexes loosely held by auxiliary valencies without reducing the shrinkage temperature of the chromium leather Zirconyl chloride, although only fixed to a limited extent, apparently forms co-ordination compounds with the carboxyl groups, disrupting the chromium tannage because there is an over-all loss of hydrothermal stability. There is no evidence that zirconium co-ordinates with, or releases acid from chromium-collagen complexes, since combination chromium/zirconium tanned leathers are stable on storage. <b>Retannage</b> of chromium tanned leather with vegetable tanning materials generally results in loss of strength and a product which tends to deteriorate on ageing. Lower initial strength is probably due to the increased avidity of chromium tanned pelt for vegetable tannins, resulting from the liberation of internally neutralised reactive sites which are not normally available in vegetable tannage, and from the co- ordination of vegetable tannins and non-tannins to the chromium complex with the displacement of sulphate radicals. From a study of the <b>retannage</b> of chromium tanned modified collagen, it appears that basic groups probably play an important part in the rapid absorption of vegetable tannin. These reactions result in overloading of the fibre and an increased number of cross-links, both of which tend to produce weak leather. Deterioration with age is primarily a hydrolytic degradation of the protein which is catalysed by acid liberated from the chromium complexes by the entry of vegetable tannins, those factors which favour the formation of acid causing greater and more rapid deterioration...|$|E

A novel {{copolymer}} of {{p-hydroxybenzoic acid}} and sulfanilic acid (pHBA-SAA copolymer) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) /HB 2 BOB 2 B as initiator. The {{effects of the}} proportion of monomers, the amount of catalyst, reaction temperature and time on copolymer performance were investigated. The structure of the copolymer was characterized with FTIR, NMR and GPC. Shrinkage temperature (TBsB) of the leather tanned with the copolymer was 81. 5 °C. The thickness increment ratio of the retanned leather was 23. 23 % and meanwhile the retanned leather showed better softness and exceptionally good flexible.

40|$|Ecological {{pressures}} on chromium have now forced the leather industry {{to look for}} possible alternatives. A vegetable- aluminum combination tannage has been studied, with special attention being given to intended final product. Aluminum is mineral tanning agents that are widely used to stabilize collagens in the leather industry. In this study, the crosslinking of vegetable and aluminum, with collagens, have been explored. This kind of chrome free tannage give us leathers with shrinkage temperature around 125 oC, elongation at break 65. 6 %, tensile strength 38 N/mm 2, and tear strength 98 N/mm. The chemical properties of the combination tanned leathers {{are found to be}} quite normal. Among the combination system evaluated, a vegetable pretannage followed by <b>retannage</b> with basic aluminum sulphate was found to produce stronger leather with the durable characteristics. In contrast, pre-tanning with aluminum possibly tightens the collagen fiber network, preventing high molecular weight vegetable tannins from interacting with collagen fibres. Optimal results were obtained when 10 % (w/w) vegetable tannins (garad) and 2 % Aluminum sulphate was used...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years leather {{technology}} literature {{has been dominated}} by ways to reduce the environmental impact of leather production and techniques to reduce the discharge of chromium reagents have been a significant element in these endeavours. At present, no tanning agent is able to replace completely the basic chromium sulphate in the production of all the articles range with a comparable quality, manufacturing cost and easiness of execution. The chrome tanning processes based on partial replacement of chromium, are more realistic(1). Consequently, in addition to the metal-free tanning, that complies with the request of a limited range of leather utilization, the research must be direct towards the improvement of the chromium fixation, by its using only in the <b>retannage</b> phase on the precedently pretanned hides. - Unbound chrome in the wet tanned leather in conventional chrome tannage Altough the processes for treating residual chrome tanning float (direct recycling or precipitation and re-dissolution) are apparently satisfactory, unfortunately they do not solve the problem of chrome pollution (2).

40|$|Abstract: Over the years, {{treatment}} of tannery waste-Water put a considerable {{burden on the}} total cost of production, be it pickled, in wet-blue, crust or finished leather. After 1980 a very stringent regulation has been imposed on the quality and purity of the waste waters that go to the drain. The high amount of money charged for effluent tannery waste-water, lead most of the tanneries to close down with increasingly stringent environmental requirements, it has become necessary to reduce the pollution load in waste-water to a minimum. This has been done by treating tannery waste-water biologically with expensive undertaking as no income or revenue is obtained at the end. For these reasons, recycling of spent solutions from soaking through <b>retannage</b> has been applied in this work with a considerable saving of 40 % and 75 %, chemicals and water, as well as protection of the environment from these polluting chemicals as compared with the standard process without recycling. The {{treatment of}} tannery waste-water is done through addition of the required materials to each process and recycling of the spent solution. After the process i...|$|E

Each stripe of porogrammes has been related to elements of multilevel structure. The pores were recognized using octane as a working liquid, the results obtained by this manner {{were used to determine}} loosening-compaction and ordering-disordering at each level of the structure, which includes nanosized macromolecules, microfibrils, fibrils and primary fibres of micron size. The measurements performed in aqueous media allowed us to determine hydrophilic pores and estimate their functions, secondary fibres have been also found by this manner. As for initial skin, porometric measurements diagnosed also non-collagen hydrophobic and hydrophilic inclusions, which form their own structure between microfibrils, fibrils, primary and secondary fibres of the matrix. The structure due to these inclusions is similar to that for collagen macromolecules. Microfibrils and fibrils have been found to form both ordered and disordered structures. Contribution of porosity of each organization level into the total porosity has been estimated, changes of collagen structure caused by chemical treatment and modification of inorganic ion-exchanger have been analyzed.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{undertaken}} to utilize the used sulphide-lime unhairing liquor {{in order to reduce}} these caustic chemicals in the effluent, save the fresh water and minimize the cost of the liming processes. The chemical analyses of the used liquor indicated that a considerable amount of sulphide of 2100 mg/l was present. And as the lime has a limited solublitiy of 0. 125 %, undissolved lime always remains in solution; this undissolved lime will dissolve when its equilibrium solubility is disturbed by recycling. It has been observed that the unhairing power of the old lime liquor was more effective than the fresh liquor; {{this is due to the}} fact that the disulphide link of the hair is broken and dissolved during the liming process and consequently the sulphide content will build-up through recycling. Wet salted sheepskins were processed with the normal recipe and the once-used lime solution was analyzed for lime and sulphide content, its composition was leveled by a make-up fresh lime-sulphide liquor and recycled. The same was repeated for seven cycles, each time the recycling flow rate was leveled with a fresh make-up. The average savings were 65 % sodium sulphide, 33 % lime and 90 % water. The limed-unhaired pelts from each cycle were further processed through tannage, <b>retannage,</b> drying, and finishing. The physical and chemical properties were satisfactory. The leather produced is normal, soft, of good tensile strength, full and of good quality. This process is recommended to be applyed in all tanneries. Its application is simple.
