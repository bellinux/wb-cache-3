500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} video and noted that [...] "the crazy twitchy behavior she exhibited in 'Telephone' returns to much delight, but with a wardrobe that's pure housewife instead of cold-blooded drag-queen murderer." [...] Odell also praised the playsuits in the video, which according to here were [...] "a classier, more mature version of 'tards." [...] In another review, Odell concluded [...] "It {{would be easy to}} credit the look of Beyoncé's new video to Lady Gaga's influence." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video, writing, [...] "The retro-glam outfits, the oversized martini glass, the rolling around on the bed sobbing with eye makeup <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face... this is our favorite Bey video ever. No one else can make doing household chores (dusting Grammys!) simultaneously look this good and this sad." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised Knowles' [...] "strong look" [...] completed by lumberjack shirt, bandana and denim hotpants in the video further comparing it with Amy Winehouse's. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine described the video as a [...] "Douglas Sirk film through the eyes of David LaChapelle" [...] and noted that several scenes looked like Knowles was being photographed for Vogue magazine on the set of The Brady Bunch. He concluded that [...] "If Beyoncé was lobbying for a temptress role on Mad Men, 'Why Don't You Love Me,'... would make the perfect audition reel." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E
500|$|Sean Garrett {{appears in}} the video and Birdman, Amber Rose, and Ringmasters of Season 3 of America's Best Dance Crew make cameos. The video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on March 31, 2010 [...] The video {{comprises}} a helicopter chase and militaristic desert and jungle scenes. The music video begins with Birdman giving Minaj a stack of money to carry to an unknown area in the desert. As the song begins Minaj appears in a blonde wig with a pink background which than cuts to Minaj riding in a pink Lamborghini with Amber Rose driving as a potential new take on Thelma & Louise in a helicopter chase. Shots of desert creatures and Minaj in her Barbie wig are shown during the first hook. As the helicopter chase progresses, Minaj is seen singing to the camera in military gear and is later shown walking in an attacking line with her Harajuku Army, which are all dressed in the same gear with pink wigs under helmets. During the chorus of the song, a shirtless Garrett is shown singing into the camera while clips of the helicopter chase are interpreted. During the second verse Minaj is in the jungle as a ninja with a long pink braid <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> back as she crawls {{on the ground and}} walks around the jungle. Some clips of two men (from Ringmasters) dancing with double-jointed shoulders are also shown. During the climax of the song Minaj is still in the jungle this time with a green wig were dancing in the mud and comes out of the water, crawling through the forest. The video ends as clips of the entire video are shown and closes with Minaj and Rose escaping in the pink Lamborghini.|$|E

2500|$|Model Leilani Bishop {{is shown}} {{on the cover of}} the album, shot by {{photographer}} Ellen von Unwerth, dressed in beauty pageant attire with a tiara and a bouquet of flowers, with mascara <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> eyes in tears of joy. Courtney Love stated in an interview that she [...] "wanted to capture the look on a woman's face as she's being crowned... this sort of ecstatic, blue eyeliner running, kind of 'I am, I am—I won! I have hemorrhoid cream under my eyes and adhesive tape on my ass, and I had to scratch and claw and fuck my way up, but I won Miss Congeniality!'" [...] The band logo introduced on the front cover of the album is thought to be modeled after the '90s Mattel Barbie logo. The crown comes from the collection of Connie Parente, a popular Los Angeles based jewelry collector.|$|E
2500|$|Pryor is in tears, {{with blood}} <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> neck, in a {{videotape}} made by artist Clayton Patterson. Another video made by freelance cameraman Paul Garrin shows officers swinging clubs {{at him and}} slamming him against a wall. [...] Photographer John McBride, taking still photos of the riot that were {{to be published in}} The Village Voice, was also struck by a policeman's nightstick in the same attack taped by Garrin. Mr. Fish, a travel promoter out for an evening on the town, attempted to hail a taxi on Avenue A near Sixth Street when he was suddenly struck on the head. [...] "I was just standing there watching," [...] he said. [...] "The next thing that I remember is seeing the stick, and then a young woman who was helping me." [...] Patterson's videotape showed that no officers helped Fish until an ambulance arrived. A police helicopter hovered over the scene, contributing to a sense of chaos.|$|E

6000|$|There stood a Princess {{outside the}} gate; but oh, in what a sad plight {{she was from}} {{the rain and the}} storm! The water was <b>running</b> <b>down</b> from <b>her</b> hair and her dress into the points of her shoes and out at the heels again. And yet she said she was a true Princess! ...|$|R
60|$|The frigate came foaming along, {{the crew}} busy in taking sail off her. The instant she had passed, and was {{preparing}} to round to, the sails of the lugger flew up like magic, and she was soon tearing along almost {{in the eye of}} the wind, as if to meet the cutter, which was <b>running</b> <b>down</b> towards <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Claire {{had stopped}} timidly near the door. The change which four days {{had made in}} Walter's {{appearance}} shocked her, and she scarcely recognized, in the pale drawn face, the youth who had burst in, sword in hand, to her rescue on that terrible evening. The tears were <b>running</b> fast <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, as she approached the couch.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Miller, in his emotion, was {{squeezing}} the handkerchief hard, {{and a cold}} stream was <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> neck.|$|E
60|$|Thereupon Lady Ball got out her handkerchief, {{and her son}} {{perceived}} that real tears were <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
60|$|She {{found her}} own way out, with the tears <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face. Very gently she shut the hall door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would seem}} so, brother," [...] {{answered}} the other, [...] "as {{we found the}} moocha. Still, if so, where is Bomba who was <b>running</b> <b>her</b> <b>down?</b> And what made that blood-mark on the grass?" ...|$|R
50|$|Following a 1970s-set prologue, {{the film}} {{takes place in}} present-day Frankfurt, Germany. Miriam Kreisl (Kelly Curtis) is a young schoolteacher who {{narrowly}} misses <b>running</b> <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> car an old man carrying a box. Reluctantly, she takes in Moebius Kelly (Herbert Lom), the mysterious old man. What she doesn't know is that their meeting is no accident. Moebius is the elder of a Satanic sect {{and she has been}} chosen to give birth to the son of Satan.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{singular}} sight which met {{his eyes as}} he entered the sitting-room of the Admiral. A great sea chest stood open in the center, and all round upon the carpet were little piles of jerseys, oil-skins, books, sextant boxes, instruments, and sea-boots. The old seaman sat gravely amidst this lumber, turning it over, and examining it intently; while his wife, with the tears <b>running</b> silently <b>down</b> <b>her</b> ruddy cheeks, sat upon the sofa, her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon her hands, rocking herself slowly backwards and forwards.|$|R
60|$|Her voice {{made him}} look up, and he saw that her mouth was set hard and tears were <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Phyllis {{stretched}} out her hands, {{and the little}} dog, <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> back, resumed its perch on the window-sill, close to the blind cord.|$|E

50|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to Cindy, Ben {{returned}} to Hollyoaks Village. Nearly <b>running</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> again, Anna remembered that Ben {{had been in the}} car that knocked <b>her</b> <b>down</b> the first time. Ben tried to apologise to her but his apologies fell on deaf ears. However, he proved to be a good friend to Anna when she was pregnant and the two shared a bond.|$|R
6000|$|Soames, {{moving to}} {{the well of the}} staircase, saw June go, and drew a breath of satisfaction. But why didn't Fleur come? They would miss their train. That train would bear her away from him, yet he could not help fidgeting at the thought that they would lose it. And then she did come, <b>running</b> <b>down</b> in <b>her</b> tan-coloured frock and black velvet cap, and passed him into the drawing-room. He saw her kiss her mother, her aunt, Val's wife, Imogen, and then come forth, quick and pretty as ever. How would she treat him at this last moment of her girlhood? He couldn't hope for much! ...|$|R
60|$|Stewart {{lifted her}} out of the saddle, and as their hands parted she felt {{something}} moist and warm. Blood was <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> arm and into the palm of her hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{tears were}} <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face. Something startled him, {{and he was}} {{looking up at her}} with his hateful, hard, bright eyes, hard and unchanging as a bird of prey.|$|E
60|$|This was {{interspersed}} with little Humfrey's eager outcries that little sister was come again, and Mrs. Talbot, the tears <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, hastened to summon her one woman-servant, Colet, {{to bring the}} porringer of milk.|$|E
60|$|While in this {{position}} two smacks came so near to the Evening Star, on opposite sides, that they seemed bent on <b>running</b> <b>her</b> <b>down.</b> David Bright did not concern himself, however. He knew they were well {{able to take care}} of themselves. They both sheered off to avoid him, but after doing so, ran rather near to each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, {{it will be}} very kind," [...] said Raymond, <b>running</b> <b>down</b> before <b>her,</b> {{and meeting}} Susan {{waddling}} out in a fringe of curl-papers, for some mysterious instinct or echo had conveyed to her and her mistress that there was fire somewhere--perhaps at home. Mrs. Poynsett was not a nervous woman, and from the time she saw her eldest son come in, all fright was over, and she could have borne to hear that the house over her head was burning, in the perfect trust that he would save her from all peril; nor had he any difficulty in committing her to Rosamond, when he hurried away to finish dressing and repair to the spot.|$|R
50|$|On 9 September 2004, Lloyd and Arscott {{were eating}} a meal at the S & S Restaurant in Kanchanaburi, owned by Mr. Wisetsingh, an off duty {{policeman}} when a heated argument ensued. Lloyd and Arscott left the restaurant but {{were followed by}} Wisetsingh who shot Mr. Lloyd then chased Ms. Ascot in his car for before <b>running</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> and shooting <b>her.</b> Lloyd was shot tree trimes and Arscott twice and both were declared dead at the hospital.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gudrun!' she cried, {{the tears}} <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. And {{she took her}} sister in her arms. Gudrun hid her face on Ursula's shoulder, but still she could not escape the cold devil of irony that froze her soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have nothing}} to regret; but oh! Mary, I have--so much--so much;" [...] and then she began kissing her boy, whom her caresses had roused from his slumbers. When she raised her head, Mary saw that the tears were <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|Little Boy Blue sprang {{over the}} stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother, her face white and drawn with suffering, and tears of anguish <b>running</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. For she had slipped upon the stile and fallen, and her leg was broken! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{she wrote}} to me about it," [...] replied Milly, with an amused smile. [...] "You mean, I suppose, the {{reckless}} youth who, after <b>running</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> had the cowardice to run away and leave her lying flat on the pavement? Mother has more than once written about that event with indignation, and rightly, I think. But how came you to know about it, John?" ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as I {{had broken}} up this unpromising tete-a-tete and settled Reginald where he could watch the croquet players losing their tempers, I wandered off to find my hostess and renew the kitten {{negotiations}} {{at the point where}} they had been interrupted. I did not succeed in <b>running</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> at once, and eventually it was Mrs. McKillop who sought me out, and her conversation was not of kittens.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{delicate}} piece of duty, Captain Parker," [...] he commenced, [...] "which I wish entrusted to yourself. You {{must know that}} we handled the ship which escaped us this morning by <b>running</b> <b>down</b> into <b>her</b> own line, pretty roughly, in every respect; besides cutting two of her masts out of her. This ship, {{as you may have}} seen, has got up jury-masts, already; but they are spars that can only be intended to carry her into port. Monsieur de Vervillin is not the man I take him to be, if he intends to leave the quarrel between us where it is. Still he cannot keep that crippled ship in his fleet, any more than we can keep our prize, and I make no doubt he will send her off to Cherbourg as soon as it is dark; most probably accompanied by one of his corvettes; or perhaps by a frigate." ...|$|R
