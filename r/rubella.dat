5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, <b>rubella,</b> Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|When the Marlborough term began, an {{arrangement}} was made whereby City of London boys had lessons during games for Marlborough College pupils and vice versa. The difficulties at the Marlborough location ranged from finding a study for Headmaster Dale to finding enough kitchen staff to prepare food for both schools. Resources were limited and outbreaks of influenza and <b>rubella</b> were common. Like many other schools evacuated into the countryside, the City of London School's enrolment fell from 700 to 430 during the war, although no pupil was killed or injured {{as a direct}} result of enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including <b>rubella</b> and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and <b>rubella.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and <b>rubella.</b> Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> {{can cause}} {{congenital}} <b>rubella</b> syndrome in the newborn. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the <b>rubella</b> virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory defects. It may also cause prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. The risk of major defects or organogenesis is highest for {{infection in the}} first trimester. CRS {{is the main reason}} a vaccine for <b>rubella</b> was developed.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, 15,000 {{cases of}} <b>rubella</b> and 43 cases of {{congenital}} <b>rubella</b> syndrome {{were reported to}} the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases between October 15, 2012, and March 2, 2014 during the 2012–13 <b>rubella</b> outbreak in Japan. They mainly occurred in men of ages 31 to 51 and young adults aged 24–34.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in the mid-eighteenth century. Friedrich Hoffmann made the first clinical description of <b>rubella</b> in 1740, which was confirmed by de Bergen in 1752 and Orlow in 1758.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{pandemic}} of <b>rubella</b> between 1962 and 1965, starting in Europe and spreading to the United States. In the years 1964–65, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million <b>rubella</b> cases. This led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital <b>rubella</b> syndrome. Of these, 2,100 died as neonates, 12,000 were deaf, 3,580 were blind, and 1,800 were mentally retarded. In New York alone, CRS affected 1% of all births.|$|E
25|$|Vaccination has {{interrupted}} {{the transmission of}} <b>rubella</b> in the Americas: no endemic case has been observed since February 2009. Since the virus can always be reintroduced from other continents, the population still need to remain vaccinated to keep the western hemisphere free of <b>rubella.</b>|$|E
25|$|Screening for <b>rubella</b> {{susceptibility}} {{by history}} of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States {{for all women}} of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital <b>rubella</b> syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant {{women of childbearing age}} should be offered <b>rubella</b> vaccination. Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period.|$|E
25|$|A {{licensed}} {{vaccine to}} prevent measles first became available in 1963, and an improved one in 1968. Vaccines for mumps and <b>rubella</b> became available in 1967 and 1969, respectively. The three vaccines (for mumps, measles, and <b>rubella)</b> were combined in 1971 {{to become the}} measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> {{can affect}} anyone {{of any age}} and is {{generally}} a mild disease, rare in infants or those {{over the age of}} 40. The older the person is the more severe the symptoms are likely to be. Up to 60% of older girls or women experience joint pain or arthritic type symptoms with <b>rubella.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> virus {{specific}} IgM antibodies {{are present}} in people recently infected by <b>rubella</b> virus, but these antibodies can persist for over a year, and a positive test result needs to be interpreted with caution. The presence of these antibodies along with, or a short time after, the characteristic rash confirms the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{there remains}} a large {{population}} of men susceptible to <b>rubella</b> {{who have not been}} vaccinated. Outbreaks of <b>rubella</b> occurred amongst many young men in the UK in 1993 and in 1996 the infection was transmitted to pregnant women, many of whom were immigrants and were susceptible. Outbreaks still arise, usually in developing countries where the vaccine is not as accessible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> is {{preventable}} {{with the}} <b>rubella</b> vaccine {{with a single}} dose being more than 95% effective. Often it is given {{in combination with the}} measles vaccine and mumps vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine. With a population vaccination rate of less than 80%, however, more women might make it to childbearing age without developing immunity and issues could increase. Once infected there is no specific treatment.|$|E
25|$|Universal {{immunisation}} {{producing a}} high level of herd immunity is important in the control of epidemics of <b>rubella.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 15 October 1941, Gregg {{delivered}} a paper, Congenital Cataract following German Measles in the Mother, to the Ophthalmological Society of Australia in Melbourne which published {{it in its}} journal, Transactions. Following press coverage of his paper, Gregg was contacted by two mothers who had contracted <b>rubella,</b> and whose children suffered from deafness, and he subsequently issued a further paper detailing Further Observations on Congenital Defects in Infants following Maternal <b>Rubella.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> is {{a disease}} that occurs worldwide. The virus tends to peak during the spring in {{countries}} with temperate climates. Before the vaccine to <b>rubella</b> was introduced in 1969, widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 6–9 years in the United States and 3–5 years in Europe, mostly affecting children in the 5-9 year old age group. Since the introduction of vaccine, occurrences have become rare in those countries with high uptake rates.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{infectious}} diseases can be transmitted either congenitally (before or at birth), and can cause serious neurodevelopmental problems, as for example the viruses HSV, CMV, <b>rubella</b> (congenital <b>rubella</b> syndrome), Zika virus, or bacteria like Treponema pallidum in congenital syphilis, which may progress to neurosyphilis if it remains untreated. Protozoa like Plasmodium or Toxoplasma which can cause congenital toxoplasmosis with multiple cysts {{in the brain and}} other organs, leading to a variety of neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> {{infection}} {{of children and}} adults is usually mild, self-limiting and often asymptomatic. The prognosis in children born with CRS is poor.|$|E
25|$|When World War II began, Gregg was a {{paediatric}} ophthalmologist, at a {{time when}} most doctors had joined the army and he was one of few eye doctors in Sydney. Gregg noticed a high incidence of congenital cataracts in infants arriving at his surgery – two to three times the normal rate that would be expected from hereditary factors. He overheard a conversation between several mothers whose babies had cataracts, in which they mentioned that they had suffered from German measles (<b>rubella)</b> during pregnancy. Investigating the medical records of children with similar conditions, Gregg discovered that out of 78 affected children, 68 had been exposed to <b>rubella</b> in utero. There had been an outbreak of <b>rubella</b> and meningitis in Australian army camps in 1941, which had been transmitted to the wider community when the men returned to their families.|$|E
25|$|Coryza in <b>rubella</b> may {{convert to}} {{pneumonia}}, either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{spread by}} droplet {{transmission}} include respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus), Bordetella pertussis, pneumococci, diphtheria, and <b>rubella.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 1943, while {{pregnant}} with Daria, Tierney contracted <b>rubella</b> (German measles), likely from a fan ill with the disease. Daria was born prematurely in Washington, DC, weighing three pounds, two ounces (1.42kg) and requiring a total blood transfusion. The <b>rubella</b> caused congenital damage: Daria was deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely mentally disabled. She was institutionalized {{for much of}} her life. This entire incident was inspiration for a plot point in the 1962 Agatha Christie novel The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella</b> has {{symptoms}} {{that are similar}} to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of <b>rubella</b> virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
25|$|The most {{specific}} laboratory {{marker of}} MS reported to date, as of 2016, is the intrathecal MRZ (Measles, <b>Rubella</b> and Varicella) reaction showing 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity.|$|E
25|$|Management for ocular {{congenital}} <b>rubella</b> syndrome (CRS) {{is similar}} to that for age-related macular degeneration, including counseling, regular monitoring, and the provision of low vision devices, if required.|$|E
25|$|Mattingly never {{contracted}} <b>rubella</b> and {{was assigned}} after the mission as Command Module Pilot to Young's crew, which later flew Apollo 16, the fifth mission {{to land on}} the Moon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubella,</b> {{also known}} as German measles or three-day measles, is an {{infection}} caused by the <b>rubella</b> virus. This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are sick. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads {{to the rest of}} the body. The rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital <b>rubella</b> syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Rubella</b> component, Meruvax, was {{developed}} in 1967 through propagation using the human embryonic lung cell line WI-38 (named for the Wistar Institute) that was derived 6 years earlier in 1961.|$|E
25|$|During the {{epidemic}} in the U.S. between 1962–1965, <b>rubella</b> virus infections during pregnancy were {{estimated to have}} caused 30,000 stillbirths and 20,000 children to be born impaired or disabled {{as a result of}} CRS.|$|E
25|$|The appellant, Alexia Harriton, was a 25-year-old {{woman with}} severe {{congenital}} disabilities {{that had been}} caused by her mother's infection with the <b>rubella</b> virus while pregnant with her. These disabilities left Harriton unable to care for herself.|$|E
25|$|As measles and <b>rubella</b> cause upper {{respiratory}} disease {{that leads to}} complications of pneumonia and bronchitis which are also caused by varicella, MMR vaccine is beneficial to control exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma.|$|E
25|$|The {{immunisation}} {{program has}} been quite successful. Cuba declared the disease eliminated in the 1990s, and in 2004 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that both the congenital and acquired forms of <b>rubella</b> had been eliminated from the United States.|$|E
25|$|Beacham was {{involved}} in launching the Sense-National Deafblind and <b>Rubella</b> Association Fill in the Gaps campaign which aims to give the elderly the support they need to maintain a good quality of life. She also attended the Parliamentary launch of the campaign in June 2006.|$|E
