500|$|Weak {{steering}} currents kept Cristobal's {{forward motion}} slow and erratic, and the storm remained heavily affected by shear, with most deep convection displaced from the center. On August25, the system {{turned toward the}} north-northeast {{in response to a}} mid-level trough to the north. Despite a <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> pattern characterized by an exposed low-level center and a distinct lack of banding features, Cristobal intensified into a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC on August26, as indicated by aircraft observations. The newly upgraded hurricane headed along a general northward path, and for the next couple days, pockets of dry air kept prevented further intensification. Convection fluctuated in intensity and coverage, and early on August27 the National Hurricane Center remarked that [...] "the satellite presentation resembles a subtropical cyclone". However, later that same day, the hurricane showed signs of increased development while located midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. In particular, its cloud pattern became much more symmetric, and some cloud tops cooled to 70°C (95°F). Around the same time, Cristobal accelerated toward the northeast as it became embedded within the mid-latitude westerlies ahead of an advancing shortwave trough.|$|E
60|$|He {{pointed to}} a lurid, <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> right ahead of them. As if in response, a low, {{growling}} rumble sounded overhead.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the latter}} who {{suggested}} that they should picnic upon the summit of a lofty hill, from which there was a striking view; and as this met {{with the approval of}} Mrs. Chisholm, who excused herself from accompanying them, they set out an hour later. The day was bright, with glaring sunshine, and a moderate breeze drove up wisps of <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> that dappled the hills with flitting shadow.|$|E
5000|$|Cumulus fractus clouds {{actually}} look like <b>ragged</b> cumulus <b>clouds.</b> They may originate from dissipated cumulus clouds, appearing in this case as white <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> located at significant distances from each other. Cumulus fractus in particular form on the {{leading and trailing edges}} of summer storms in warm and humid conditions. [...] Observing fractus gives an indication of wind movements under the parent cloud.|$|R
60|$|The raw morning {{had broken}} ere the hot spiced ale had been served round {{and the last}} {{farewell}} spoken. A cold wind blew up from the sea and <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> drifted swiftly across the sky.|$|R
2500|$|Supplementary cloud {{formations}} {{detached from}} the main cloud are known as accessory clouds. [...] The heavier precipitating clouds, nimbostratus, towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the pannus feature, low <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.|$|R
6000|$|... "If ever I {{catch you}} here again," [...] muttered Schwartz, coming, half frightened, {{out of the}} corner--but before he could finish his {{sentence}} the old gentleman had shut the house door behind him with a great bang, and there drove past {{the window at the}} same instant a wreath of <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> that whirled and rolled away down the valley in all manner of shapes, turning over and over in the air and melting away at last in a gush of rain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on then," [...] {{and the two}} sallied out, bearing {{with them}} the various {{sections}} of their machine. The moon was shining cold and clear though an occasional <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> drifted across her face. All was still and silent upon the Downs. They stood and listened before they entered the barn, but not a sound came to their ears, save the dull murmur {{of the sea and}} the distant barking of a dog. Pericord journeyed backwards and forwards with all that they might need, while Brown filled a long narrow sack with bricks.|$|E
60|$|It was Mabel who {{suggested}} that they should picnic upon the summit of a lofty hill, from which there was a striking view; and as this met {{with the approval of}} Mrs. Chisholm, who excused herself from accompanying them, they set out an hour later. The day was bright, with glaring sunshine, and a moderate breeze drove up wisps of <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> that dappled the hills with flitting shadow. Towering crag and shingly scree showed blue and purple through it and then flashed again into brilliancy, while the long, grassy slopes gleamed with silvery gray and ocher.|$|E
60|$|Malcolm's {{prediction}} as to {{the weather}} was speedily verified. The wind rose rapidly, <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> hurried across the sky, and the waves got up fast, and by nightfall the sea had become really heavy, dashing in sheets {{high in the air}} every time the bluff bowed craft plunged into it. Long before this Ronald had gone below prostrate with seasickness.|$|R
60|$|Anthea shoved {{over her}} tiller; but the Sorata did not swing into the cove as Jimmy had {{expected}} her to do, for a blast that set the pines roaring fell from the hillside and drove her out from the shore. Jimmy let more chain run, and stood still looking about him, when he felt the anchor grip. The sunlight had faded, obscured by <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds,</b> the tall pines swayed above him, and the Sorata had swung well out athwart the stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "In fact, the Battle hangs now upon a hair; the Battle {{is as good}} as lost, thinks Marechal de Saxe. His battle-lines torn in two in that manner, {{hovering}} in <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> over the field, what hope is there in the Battle? Fontenoy is firing blank, this some time; its cannon-balls done. Officers, in Antoine, are about withdrawing the artillery,--then again (on new order) replacing it awhile. All are looking towards the Scheld Bridge; earnestly entreating his Majesty to withdraw. Had the Dutch, at this point of time, broken heartily in, as Waldeck was urging them to do, upon the redoubts of Antoine; or had his Royal Highness the Duke, for his own behoof, possessed due cavalry or artillery to act upon these <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds,</b> which hang broken there, very fit for being swept, were there an artillery-and-horse besom to do it,--in either of these cases the Battle was the Duke's. And a right fiery victory it would have been; to make his name famous; and confirm the English in their mad method of fighting, like Baresarks or Janizaries rather than strategic human creatures. [See, in Busching's Magazin, xvi. 169 ("Your illustrious 'Column,' at Fontenoy? It was fortuitous, I say; done like janizaries;" [...] and so forth), a Criticism worth reading by soldiers.] ...|$|R
60|$|Though it {{was nearly}} eleven o’clock at night, the light had not quite gone and the sea glimmered about the sloop as she rose and fell at her {{moorings}} by the wreck. To the north the sky was barred with streaks of <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> and {{the edge of the}} sea-plain was harshly clear; to the east the horizon was hidden by a cold, blue haze, and the tide was near the lowest of its ebb. An angry white surf broke along the uncovered shoals with a tremulous roar, and the swell, though smooth as oil on its surface, was high and steep. No breath of wind touched the water, but Jimmy agreed with Moran that there was plenty on the way.|$|E
60|$|To the eastward, {{the pale}} silver sickle of a {{crescent}} moon hung {{low in the}} sky, but westward a wide band of flaring crimson and saffron still burned beneath dusky masses of <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> and the uncovered sands gleamed blood-red in the fading glow. A cold wind stirred the pines to an eerie sighing, and the splash of a tiny surf came up faintly from {{the outer edge of}} the sands. The whole scene struck Frank as very forbidding and desolate, and he fancied that there was a threat of wind in the sky. Something in the loneliness troubled him, and for no particular reason he felt half sorry that he had come. He realized that it would have been much more cozy in the sloop's cabin than upon that dreary beach, and he said something about the weather to Harry.|$|E
60|$|They {{had breakfast}} while they waited, {{but the wind}} did not come, and it was several hours later when a pale coppery disc became visible and the haze grew thinner. Then they swung a boat out hastily, for {{it would not be}} very long before the light died away again. Two white men and an Indian dropped into the boat and they pulled across half a mile of sluggishly heaving water, crept up an opening, and {{presently}} vanished among the ice. Soon afterward the low sun went out, and wisps of <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> crept up from the westward, while smears of vapor blurred the horizon, and the swell grew steeper. There was no wind at all, but blocks and canvas banged and thrashed furiously at every roll, until they lowered the mainsail and lashed its heavy boom to the big iron crutch astern. The boat remained invisible, but its crew had been given instructions to push on as far as possible if they found clear water, and Dampier, who did not seem uneasy about the men, paced up and down the deck while the afternoon wore away.|$|E
60|$|The black chateau lay {{in front}} of them. The moon had shone out between two rain-clouds, and threw the old house into silver and shadow. It was shaped like an L, with a low arched door in front, and lines of small windows like the open ports of a man-of-war. Above was a dark roof, {{breaking}} at the corners into little round overhanging turrets, the whole lying silent in the moonshine, with a drift of <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> blackening the heavens behind it. A single light gleamed {{in one of the}} lower windows.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} her hand, {{and kept the}} glove with the dark grease stain. Then, seeing {{there was no more}} to be said, she looked about. <b>Ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> rolled up from the Southwest, and the {{disturbed}} swell that splashed about the dock gates indicated wind down channel. A shower beat upon the engine skylights and Barbara moved beneath the bridge. A great rope rose out of the water as the men at the winch hauled up the clumsy hulk. Two or three others, dragging a thin, stiff wire rope, floundered unsteadily across the deck.|$|R
60|$|Lister {{seized the}} slanted rails. The {{lightship}} had vanished, but a bright beam pierced the haze astern. Ahead {{the sea was}} empty; gray water rolled beneath low and <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds.</b> Spray flew about the plunging bows, and the tug rolled uneasily. Lister turned and left the bridge, but stopped {{for a few moments}} at the engine-room door. Barbara had stood just opposite, where the iron funnel-stay ran down. Her rich furs gave her girlish figure a touch of dignity, the color was in her face, and her eyes shone.|$|R
50|$|Fractus clouds (scuds) are small, <b>ragged</b> <b>cloud</b> {{fragments}} {{that are}} usually found under an ambient cloud base. They form or have broken off from a larger cloud, and are generally sheared by strong winds, giving them a jagged, shredded appearance. Fractus have irregular patterns, appearing much like torn pieces of cotton candy. They change constantly, often forming and dissipating rapidly. They do not have clearly defined bases. Sometimes they are persistent and form very near the surface. Common kinds include scud and cloud tags.|$|E

60|$|A funeral is a {{depressing}} affair {{under the best}} circumstances, but a funeral in a lonely farm-house in March, the roads full of slush, the <b>ragged</b> gray <b>clouds</b> leaping the sullen hills like eagles, is tragic.|$|R
60|$|I {{rose and}} flung the hall {{door open to}} admit the fresh breeze of the night. <b>Ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> swept across the sky, and the moon peeped out at times between their hurrying fringes, bathing the whole {{countryside}} in its cold, white radiance. From where I {{stood in the doorway}} I could see the edge of the Cloomber wood, though the house itself was only visible from the rising ground some little distance off. At my sister's suggestion we walked together, she with her shawl over her head, as far as the summit of this elevation, and looked out {{in the direction of the}} Hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{sat down}} and {{examined}} the mountain with the glasses. Above the crags, a snowfield ran up {{to the foot of}} the last sharp ridge, but we did not see how we could reach it. <b>Ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> drove across the ridge and blowing snow streamed about the peak like mist. Lucy, however, was keen on going on, and by and by one of the guides picked out a coulee that might take us up. Coulee's good French-Canadian, but Alpinists call it a couloir. It looked like a thin, white, perpendicular streak on the face of the dark rock. But perhaps I'm boring you with these particulars." ...|$|R
50|$|The term {{gets its}} name from scud, {{which is used to}} {{describe}} small, <b>ragged,</b> low <b>cloud</b> fragments that are unattached to a larger cloud base, and often seen with and behind cold fronts and thunderstorm gust fronts.|$|R
5000|$|A rotor cloud is {{sometimes}} formed downwind {{and below the}} level of the ridge. It has the appearance of the <b>ragged</b> cumulus <b>cloud</b> type but it is caused by a turbulent horizontal vortex, i.e. the air is very rough.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on a}} gray {{afternoon}} in the lull of a three days' gale that had left the Southern Ocean tumbling heavily upon our ship, under a sky hung with <b>rags</b> of <b>clouds</b> {{that seemed to have}} been cut and hacked by the keen edge of a sou'-west gale.|$|R
60|$|Such {{were the}} {{arguments}} of that Voice of the river, the old, familiar arguments of desolation and despair. I leant over the parapet; in another moment I should have been gone, when I became aware that some one was standing near to me. I {{did not see the}} person because it was too dark. I did not hear him because of the raving of the wind. But I knew that he was there. So I waited until the moon shone out for a while between the edges of two <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds,</b> the shapes of which I can see to this hour. It showed me Jorsen, looking just as he does to-day, for he never seems to change--Jorsen, on whom, to my knowledge, I had not set eyes before.|$|R
60|$|Terrier's regular lurch {{and roll}} {{indicated}} {{that she was}} steaming along the coast, in some shelter from the wind that blew obliquely off the land. By and by, however, the lurches got violent, and when Lister heard the thud of water on deck he went up, and opening {{the door on the}} lee side, looked out. Water splashed against the ledge that protected the engine-room; the stack of coal worked and he heard big lumps fall. Spray blew across the bulwarks and fell in heavy showers from a boat on the skids. For a few moments this was all he could distinguish, and then he saw slopes of water slanting away from the tug's low side. A half-moon shone for a few moments between <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> and was hidden.|$|R
60|$|The day {{continued}} lowering and gloomy; the slovenly, <b>ragged,</b> spongy <b>clouds</b> drifted heavily along; {{there was}} no variety even in the rain: it was one dull, continued, monotonous patter--patter--patter, excepting that now and then I was enlivened {{by the idea of}} a brisk shower, from the rattling of the drops upon a passing umbrella.|$|R
6000|$|Godfrey {{was fond}} of poetry; it bored Isobel. His tendencies were towards {{religion}} though of a very different type from that preached and practised by his father; hers were anti-religious. In fact {{she would have been}} inclined to endorse the saying of that other schoolgirl who defined faith as [...] "the art of believing those things which we know to be untrue," [...] while to him on the other hand they were profoundly true, though often enough not {{in the way that they}} are generally accepted. Had he possessed any powers of definition at that age, probably he would have described our accepted beliefs as shadows of the Truth, distorted and fantastically shaped, like those thrown by changeful, <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> behind which the eternal sun is shining, shadows that vary in length and character according to the hour and weather of the mortal day.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} blustering, {{and the wind}} that blew the <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> {{across the face of}} the moon, swooped in sudden gusts upon the bridge, and the deluge rolling under it and hoarsely washing against its piers. Belsky leaned over the parapet and looked down into the eddies and {{currents}} as the fitful light revealed them. He had a fantastic pleasure in studying them, and choosing the moment when he should leap the parapet and be lost in them. The incident could not be used in any novel of his, and no one else could do such perfect justice to the situation, but perhaps afterwards, when the facts leading to his death should be known through the remorse of the lovers whom he had sought to serve, some other artist-nature could distil their subtlest meaning in a memoir delicate as the aroma of a faded flower.|$|R
6000|$|... "I call it so; though {{other men}} may {{possibly}} {{know better than}} I, who have only followed the water five-and-thirty years. Then, here is the sea getting up, in an unaccountable manner! and look at these <b>rags</b> of <b>clouds,</b> which darken the heavens! {{and yet there is}} light enough, coming from the ocean, for a good scholar to read by!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had turned}} towards {{the window as}} he rose, and saw {{one of those little}} surprises by which Nature {{relieves}} the monotony of life in these islands. The sun had gone, a <b>ragged</b> slate-coloured <b>cloud</b> was drifting up from over the river, and the rain was falling with a soft persistency which is more fatal than the most boisterous shower. There would be no more cricket that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{storm was}} over before the morning. There wasn't a <b>rag</b> of <b>cloud</b> {{left in the}} sky when the dawn came, and all along the beach there were bits of plank scattered--which was the disarticulated skeleton, so to speak, of my canoe. However, that gave me {{something}} to do, for, taking advantage {{of two of the}} trees being together, I rigged up a kind of storm-shelter with these vestiges. And that day the egg hatched.|$|R
60|$|Three rough days in June {{had been}} succeeded by one calm and {{peaceful}} one. There {{was not a}} breath of air that evening. The sun sank down in the west behind a line of purple clouds, and the smooth surface of the bay was gashed with scarlet streaks. Along the beach the pools left by the tide showed up like gouts of blood against the yellow sand, as if some wounded giant had toilfully passed that way, and had left these red traces of his grievous hurt behind him. As the darkness closed in, certain <b>ragged</b> <b>clouds</b> which had lain low on the eastern horizon coalesced and formed a great irregular cumulus. The glass was still low, and I {{knew that there was}} mischief brewing. About nine o'clock a dull moaning sound came up from the sea, as from a creature who, much harassed, learns that the hour of suffering has come round again. At ten a sharp breeze sprang up from the eastward. At eleven it had increased to a gale, and by midnight the most furious storm was raging which I ever remember upon that weather-beaten coast.|$|R
60|$|As the cab {{disappeared}} from my sight, I {{looked up at}} the sky. It was growing very dark. The <b>ragged</b> black <b>clouds,</b> fantastically parted from each other in island shapes over the whole surface of the heavens, were fast drawing together into one huge, formless, lowering mass, and had already hidden the moon for, good. I went back to the street, and stationed myself in the pitch darkness of a passage which led down a mews, situated exactly opposite to the hotel.|$|R
