40|$|A new {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} 3 DOF 2 D mechanical system “transported cross-beam, two moving bridge cranes” has been proposed. Small system oscillations have been derived through the introduction of Lagrange equations. The numerical estimation of 3 DOF system motion {{has been carried out}} with equation-based Modelica language. The present article uses the Lagrange method and numerical and optimization methods, realized with JModelica. org and Optimica freeware. The absolute swaying of the cross-beam with respect to the displacement of the two moving <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes</b> was estimated. The phase portraits of the 3 DOF system for linear and angular coordinates were presented. An open loop optimal control problem was posed for the motion of the <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes.</b> A “bang-bang” control strategy was implemented for the derivation of an optimal control solution, which enables the travel of two <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes</b> at a prescribed distance for minimum time and minimum swaying of a heavy cross-beam.

40|$|Crane motion induces payload {{oscillation}} {{that makes}} accurate {{positioning of the}} payload a challenging task. As the payload size increases, {{it may be necessary}} to utilize multiple cranes for better control of the payload position and orientation. However, simultaneously maneuvering multiple cranes to transport a single payload increases the complexity and danger of the operation. This thesis investigates the dynamics and control of dual-hoist <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes</b> transporting distributed payloads. Insights from this dynamic analysis were used to design input shapers that reduce payload oscillation originating from various crane motions. Also, studies were conducted to investigate the effect input shaping has on the performance of human operators using a dual-hoist <b>bridge</b> <b>crane</b> to transport distributed payloads through an obstacle course. In each study, input shaping significantly improved the task completion time. Furthermore, input-shaping control greatly decreased operator effort, as measured by the number of interface button pushes needed to complete a task. These results clearly demonstrate the benefit of input-shaping control on dual-hoist <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes.</b> In addition, a new system identification method that utilizes input shaping for determining the modal frequencies and relative amplitude contributions of individual modes was developed to aid in the dynamic analysis of dual-hoist <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes,</b> as well as other multi-mode systems. This method uses a new type of input shaper to suppress all but one mode to a low level. The shaper can also be used to bring a small-amplitude mode to light by modifying one of the vibration constraints. M. S...|$|R
