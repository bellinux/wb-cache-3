The ionizing radiation-induced stress response is very complex and involves many cellular processes. Dr. Chaudry is investigating the involvement of small non-coding micro-RNA in the response of human cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding single-stranded RNAs of ~22 nucleotides that function as negative gene regulators. miRNA negatively regulate their targets either by binding with perfect or nearly perfect complementarity to protein coding mRNA sequences to induce the <b>RNA-mediated</b> <b>interference</b> (RNAi) pathway. Most miRNAs do not cleave their mRNA targets as a mechanism of gene regulation. These miRNAs bind to imperfect complementary sites within the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of their mRNA targets. In this case the target-gene repression occurs post-transcriptionally at the level of translation resulting in reduced protein levels but the mRNA levels remain unaffected. A single miRNA has the capability to bind to as many as 200 diverse gene targets ranging from transcription factors, secreted factors, receptors and transporters, thus potentially controlling the expression of about one-third of human mRNAs. Research has identified cell type specific modulation of several miRNA in gamma radiation and X-ray-treated human cells. Other studies from our laboratory showed that the expression of many miRNA markedly differ within the same cell line after exposure to either low or high doses of radiation. His work also identified radiation-induced modulation of miRNA in cells with altered DNA repair capability. These studies have provided evidence that miRNA are involved in the response to ionizing radiation exposure in human cells.|$|E

Phenotypes associated with the RNAi of 240 genes identify many specific defects in the process of regeneration and define the major categories of defects planarians display following gene perturbations. We assessed the effects of inhibiting genes with RNAi on tissue homeostasis in intact animals and stem cell (neoblast) proliferation in amputated animals identifying candidate stem cell, regeneration, and homeostasis regulators.

In search of factors that might associate with SCR to control its activity and/or specificity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. A Drosophila homologue of the regulatory subunit (B′/PR 61) of serine-threonine protein phosphatase  2 A (dPP 2 A,B′) specifically interacted with the SCR homeodomain. The N-terminal arm within the SCR homeodomain was shown to be a target of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and protein phosphatase  2 A, respectively. In vivo analyses revealed that mutant forms of SCR mimicking constitutively dephosphorylated or phosphorylated states of the homeodomain were active or inactive, respectively. Inactivity of the phosphorylated mimic form was attributed to impaired DNA binding.

Here we report a genome-scale <b>RNA-mediated</b> <b>interference</b> screen in HeLa cells designed to identify human genes {{that are important}} for cell division. We have used a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs for gene silencing and have used DNA content analysis to identify genes that induced cell cycle arrest or altered ploidy on silencing. Validation and secondary assays were performed to generate a nine-parameter loss-of-function phenoprint {{for each of the}} genes. These phenotypic signatures allowed the assignment of genes to specific functional classes by combining hierarchical clustering, cross-species analysis and proteomic data mining. We highlight the richness of our dataset by ascribing novel functions to genes in mitosis and cytokinesis.

During postembryonic life, Caenorhabditis elegans {{is surrounded by a}} collagenous exoskeleton termed the cuticle. From a screen for mutants defective in cuticle secretion, we identified and characterized a sec- 23 mutant of C. elegans. By sequence homology, C. elegans has only the single sec- 23 gene described herein. In addition to the cuticle secretion defect, mutants fail to complete embryonic morphogenesis. However, they progress through the earlier stages of embryogenesis, including gastrulation, and achieve substantial morphogenesis before death.

To test the hypothesis that Hsp 27 decreases apoptosis by inhibiting Bax, Hsp 27 expression was manipulated in renal epithelial cells before transient metabolic stress, an insult that activates Bax, induces mitochondrial injury, and causes apoptosis. Compared with control, enhanced Hsp 27 expression inhibited conformational Bax activation, oligomerization, and translocation to mitochondria, reduced the leakage of both cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, and significantly improved cell survival by > 50 % after stress. In contrast, Hsp 27 down-regulation using <b>RNA-mediated</b> <b>interference</b> promoted Bax activation, increased Bax translocation, and reduced cell survival after stress. Immunoprecipitation did not detect Hsp 27 -Bax interaction before, during, or after stress, suggesting that Hsp 27 indirectly inhibits Bax. During stress, Hsp 27 expression prevented the inactivation of Akt, a pro-survival kinase, and increased the interaction between Akt and Bax, an Akt substrate. In contrast, Hsp 27 <b>RNA-mediated</b> <b>interference</b> promoted Akt inactivation during stress. Hsp 27 up- or down-regulation markedly altered the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase), a major regulator of Akt. Furthermore, distinct PI 3 -kinase inhibitors completely abrogated the protective effect of Hsp 27 expression on Akt activation, Bax inactivation, and cell survival.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern and the function of WEE 2 during oocyte maturation in a nonhuman primate species, the rhesus macaque. Among 11 macaque tissues examined, WEE 2 transcript is predominantly expressed in the ovary and only weakly detectable in the testis. Within the ovary, WEE 2 mRNA is exclusively localized in the oocyte and appears to accumulate during folliculogenesis, reaching the highest level in preovulatory follicles.

The planarian Pax 6 homologs do not show any clear orthology to the Drosophila duplicated Pax 6 genes, eyeless and twin of eyeless, which suggests an independent Pax 6 duplication in a triclad or platyhelminth ancestor.

Pax 6 B follows a similar pattern, but shows a lower level of expression. Pax 6 A and Pax 6 B transcripts are detected in visual cells only at the ultrastructural level, probably because a limited amount of transcripts is present in these cells.

We previously demonstrated a host-dependent role of the actin cytoskeleton in inducing restriction during the early phases of NWS infection. Furthermore, we showed the differential infectious entry of NWS virus in the above mentioned cell models. Methodology/Principal Findings: By first employing a panel of microtubule-modulators, we evidenced that microtubule-stabilization negatively interferes with NWS replication in LLC-MK 2 but not in MDCK cells. Conversely, microtubule-depolymerization improves NWS growth in LLC-MK 2 {{but not in the}} MDCK model. By using immunofluorescence labelling and Western blotting analyses upon NWS infection in mammalian kidney cells, it was observed that the occurrence of alpha-tubulin hyperacetylation- a post-translational modified form suggestive of stable microtubules- was significantly delayed in LLC-MK 2 when compared to MDCK cells. Furthermore, mock-infected LLC-MK 2 cells were shown to have higher levels of both acetylated alpha-tubulin and microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP 4), the latter being essential for the maintenance of normal microtubule polymer levels in interphase epithelial cells.

Adult Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites express three importin � proteins, IMA- 1, IMA- 2, and IMA- 3, {{each with a}} distinct expression and localization pattern. IMA- 2 was expressed exclusively in germ line cells from the early embryonic through adult stages. The protein has a dynamic pattern of localization dependent {{on the stage of}} the cell cycle. In interphase germ cells and embryonic cells, IMA- 2 is cytoplasmic and nuclear envelope associated, whereas in developing oocytes, the protein is cytoplasmic and intranuclear. During mitosis in germ line cells and embryos, IMA- 2 surrounded the condensed chromosomes but was not directly associated with the mitotic spindle. The timing of IMA- 2 nuclear localization suggested that the protein surrounded the chromosomes after fenestration of the nuclear envelope in prometaphase. Depletion of IMA- 2 by <b>RNA-mediated</b> gene <b>interference</b> (RNAi) resulted in embryonic lethality and a terminal aneuploid phenotype. ima- 2 (RNAi) embryos have severe defects in nuclear envelope formation, accumulating nucleoporins and lamin in the cytoplasm. We conclude that IMA- 2 is required for proper chromosome dynamics in germ line and early embryonic mitosis and is involved in nuclear envelope assembly at the conclusion of mitosis...|$|R
40|$|Axonal {{degeneration}} {{represents one}} of the earliest pathological features in motor neuron diseases. We here studied the underlying molecular mechanisms in progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn) mice mutated in the tubulin-specific chaperone TBCE. We demon-strate that TBCE is a peripheralmembrane-associatedprotein that accumulates at theGolgi apparatus. Inpmnmice, TBCE is destabilized and disappears from the Golgi apparatus of motor neurons, and microtubules are lost in distal axons. The axonal microtubule loss proceeds retrogradely in parallel with the axonal dying back process. These degenerative changes are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by transgenic TBCE complementation that restores TBCE expression at theGolgi apparatus. In culturedmotor neurons, the pmn mutation, <b>interference</b> <b>RNA-mediated</b> TBCE depletion, and brefeldin A-mediated Golgi disruption all compromise axonal tubulin rout-ing. Weconclude thatmotor axons criticallydependonaxonal tubulin routing fromtheGolgi apparatus, aprocess that involvesTBCEand possibly other tubulin chaperones.
