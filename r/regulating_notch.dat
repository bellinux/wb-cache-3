Deltex 1 is highly induced by Notch signaling in thymocytes, and overexpression of Deltex 1 in T-cell progenitors can block Notch signals, suggesting that Deltex 1 may {{play an important role}} in <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> signals during T-cell development. A recent report found that T cells develop normally in mice carrying a targeted deletion in the Deltex 1 gene (S. Storck, F. Delbos, N. Stadler, C. Thirion-Delalande, F. Bernex, C. Verthuy, P. Ferrier, J. C. Weill, and C. A. Reynaud, Mol. Cell. Biol. 25 : 1437 - 1445, 2005), suggesting that other Deltex homologues may compensate in Deltex 1 -deficient T cells. We generated mice that lack expression of both Deltex 1 and Deltex 2 by gene targeting and further reduced expression of Deltex 4 in Deltex 1 /Deltex 2 double-deficient T-cell progenitors using RNA interference. Using a sensitive in vitro assay, we found that Notch signaling is more potent in cells expressing lower levels of Deltex proteins. Nevertheless, we were unable to detect any significant defects in thymocyte maturation in Deltex 1 /Deltex 2 double-knockout mice. Together these data suggest that Deltex can act as a negative regulator of Notch signals in T cells but that endogenous levels of Deltex 1 and Deltex 2 are not important for <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> signals during thymocyte development...|$|E

Here we demonstrate that conditional mouse mutants with deletion of numb and numblike in developing sensory ganglia show a severe reduction in axonal arborization in afferent fibers, but no deficit in neurogenesis. Consistent with these results, expression of Cre recombinase in sensory neurons from numb conditional mutants results in reduced endocytosis, {{a significant increase}} in nuclear Notch 1, and severe reductions in axon branch points and total axon length. Conversely, overexpression of Numb, but not mutant Numb lacking α-adaptin-interacting domain, leads to accumulation of Notch 1 in markedly enlarged endocytic–lysosomal vesicles, reduced nuclear Notch 1, and dramatic increases in axonal length and branch points.

However, a role for Numb in <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> trafficking has not been defined. Here we show that mammalian Notch 1 is constitutively internalized and trafficked to both recycling and late endosomal compartments, and we demonstrate that changes in Numb expression alter the dynamics of Notch 1 trafficking. Overexpression of Numb promotes sorting of Notch 1 through late endosomes for degradation, whereas depletion of Numb facilitates Notch 1 recycling. Numb mutants that do not interact with the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, Itch, or that lack motifs important for interaction with endocytic proteins fail to promote Notch 1 degradation.

Organ rotation {{is a crucial}} developmental process to establish the left–right patterning during animal development. However, the molecular basis of how organ rotation is regulated is poorly understood. Here we report that Drosophila UV-resistance associated gene (UVRAG), a tumor suppressor that regulates autophagy and endocytosis, plays unexpected roles in controlling organ rotation. Loss-of-function mutants of UVRAG show seriously impaired organ rotation phenotypes, which are associated with defects in endocytic trafficking rather than autophagy. Blunted endocytic degradation by UVRAG deficiency causes endosomal accumulation of Notch, resulting in abnormally enhanced Notch activity. Knockdown of Notch itself or expression of a dominant negative form of Notch transcriptional co-activator Mastermind is sufficient to rescue the rotation defect in UVRAG mutants. Consistently, UVRAG-mutated heterotaxy patient cells also display highly increased Notch protein levels. These results suggest evolutionarily conserved roles of UVRAG in organ rotation by <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> endocytic degradation...|$|E

Accordingly, Cbx 8 is overexpressed in human breast cancer and correlates with poor survival. Our genomic analyses revealed that Cbx 8 positively <b>regulates</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling by maintaining H 3 K 4 me 3 levels on Notch-network gene promoters. Ectopic expression of Notch 1 partially rescues tumorsphere formation in Cbx 8 -depleted cells.

Here, we report the D-cbl mutant phenotypes in the Drosophila eye. D-cbl mutants display overgrowth, inhibition of apoptosis, differentiation defects and increased ommatidial spacing. Many of these phenotypes are caused by lack of down-regulation of the Drosophila EGFR signaling. However, not all D-cbl phenotypes can be explained by inappropriate EGFR activity. We found that D-Cbl also negatively <b>regulates</b> <b>Notch</b> activity during eye and wing development. D-cbl produces two isoforms by alternative splicing. Strikingly, the long isoform, D-CblL, preferentially regulates the EGFR, whereas the short isoform, D-CblS, preferentially <b>regulates</b> <b>Notch.</b> Taken together, these data suggest that D-Cbl controls at least two signaling pathways, EGFR and Notch, through production of two alternatively spliced isoforms during development in Drosophila. ...|$|R

To test this hypothesis, we ablated Fn 1 in the neural crest (NC), a population of multi-potent progenitors expressing high levels of Fn 1. We found that Fn 1 synthesized by the NC mediated morphogenesis of the aortic arch artery and differentiation of NC cells into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling.

In an independent RNAi screen in Drosophila, two TspanC 8 genes were identified as Notch regulators. Functional analysis of the three Drosophila TspanC 8 genes (Tsp 3 A, Tsp 86 D, and Tsp 26 D) indicated that these genes act redundantly to promote Notch signaling. During oogenesis, TspanC 8 genes were up-regulated in border cells and regulated Kuzbanian distribution, Notch activity, and cell migration. Furthermore, the human TspanC 8 tetraspanins Tspan 5 and Tspan 14 positively regulated ligand-induced ADAM 10 -dependent Notch 1 signaling.

In {{a search for}} factors that <b>regulate</b> <b>Notch</b> activation in endosomes, we isolated mutants in Drosophila genes that encode subunits of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump. Cells lacking V-ATPase function display impaired acidification of the endosomal compartment and a correlated failure to degrade endocytic cargoes. V-ATPase mutant cells internalize Notch and accumulate it in the lysosome, but surprisingly also show a substantial loss of both physiological and ectopic Notch activation in endosomes. V-ATPase activity is required in signal-receiving cells for Notch signaling downstream of ligand activation but upstream of γ-secretase-dependent S 3 cleavage. These data indicate that V-ATPase, probably via acidification of early endosomes, promotes not only the degradation of Notch in the lysosome but also the activation of Notch signaling in endosomes.

40|$|Notch {{is crucial}} for {{multiple}} stages of T cell development, including the CD 4 +CD 8 + double positive (DP) to CD 8 + single positive (SP) transition, but regulation of Notch activation is not well understood. In this thesis, I explored the potential of p 53, endocytosis, and Cbl-b to regulate Notch activation. p 53 regulates Presenilin 1 (PS 1) expression, and PS 1 cleaves Notch, releasing its intracellular domain (NIC), leading to the expression of downstream targets, e. g. the HES 1 gene. One aim of this thesis {{was to determine if}} p 53 regulates Notch activity during T cell development. I found that Notch 1 expression and activation were negatively regulated by p 53 in several thymoma lines. Additionally, NIC was elevated in Trp 53 −/− thymocytes as compared to Trp 53 +/+ thymocytes. To determine if elevated Notch 1 activation in Trp 53 −/− thymocytes had an effect on T cell development, CD 4 and CD 8 expression were analyzed. The CD 4 + SP:CD 8 + SP T cell ratio was decreased in Trp 53 −/− splenocytes and thymocytes. This alteration in T cell development correlated with the increased Notch 1 activation observed in the absence of p 53. These data indicate that p 53 negatively regulates Notch 1 activation during T cell development. Skewing of T cell development toward CD 8 + SP T cells in Trp 53 −/− mice is reminiscent of the phenotype of NIC-overexpressing mice. Thus, I suggest that p 53 plays a role in T cell development, in part by <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> 1 activation. In the second aim of my thesis I present preliminary data showing that endocytosis {{does not appear to be}} involved in mammalian Notch activation although there is evidence in Drosophila for a positive endocytic role in Notch activation. The ability of Cbl-b to regulate Notch activation was the final aim of this thesis. Cbl-b, like Notch, has been shown to play a role in regulating the T cell signaling threshold. With this aim, I wanted to address the possibility of Cbl-b regulating T cell signaling via <b>regulating</b> <b>Notch</b> activation. Due to technical difficulties I was only able to obtain preliminary data suggesting that Cbl-b does positively regulate Notch activation in peripheral T cells. In this dissertation I have shown that Notch activation is regulated by controlling the expression of cellular components needed for cleavage, not just by encountering ligand on neighboring cells. ...|$|E

Developing T cells provide an excellent context to address this issue. Notch 1 signals initiate T-cell development and increase in intensity during maturation of early T-cell progenitors (ETP) to the DN 3 stage. As DN 3 cells undergo β-selection, during which cells expressing functionally rearranged TCRβ proliferate and differentiate into CD 4 +CD 8 + progeny, Notch 1 signaling is abruptly down-regulated. In this report, we investigate the mechanisms that control Notch 1 expression during thymopoiesis. We show that Notch 1 and E 2 A directly <b>regulate</b> <b>Notch</b> 1 transcription in pre-β-selected thymocytes. Following successful β-selection, pre-TCR signaling rapidly inhibits Notch 1 transcription via signals that up-regulate Id 3, an E 2 A inhibitor. Consistent with a regulatory role for Id 3 in Notch 1 down-regulation, post-β-selected Id 3 -deficient thymocytes maintain Notch 1 transcription, whereas enforced Id 3 expression decreases Notch 1 expression and abrogates Notch 1 -dependent T-cell survival. These data provide new insights into Notch 1 regulation in T-cell progenitors and reveal a direct link between pre-TCR signaling and Notch 1 expression during thymocyte development.

Examination of a panel of individual or clustered lysine mutants demonstrated that lysine 613 (K 613) in the cytoplasmic tail of Dll 1 is a key residue necessary for transcellular activation of Notch signaling. Multi-ubiquitination of the Dll 1 mutant Dll 1 -K 613 R was altered compared to wild type Dll 1, and the K 613 R mutation blocked the ability of Dll 1 to interact with Notch 1. Finally, mutation of K 613 {{did not affect the}} stability of Dll 1 or its ability to traffic to recycle to the plasma membrane, but did enhance the fraction associated with lipid rafts. Collectively these results suggest that the transcellular defect in Notch signaling attributed to residue K 613 in cytoplasmic tail of Dll 1 may result from altering its multi-ubiquitination and increasing its retention in lipid rafts...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAberrant {{upregulation}} of NOTCH 3 gene plays {{a critical}} role in cancer pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. We tested here the hypothesis that aberrant epigenetic modifications in the NOTCH 3 promoter region might account for its upregulation in cancer cells. We compared DNA and histone methylation status of NOTCH 3 promoter region in human normal blood cells and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines, differentially expressing NOTCH 3. We found that histone methylation, rather than DNA hypomethylation, contributes towards establishing an active chromatin status of NOTCH 3 promoter in NOTCH 3 overexpressing cancer cells. We discovered that the chromatin regulator protein BORIS/CTCFL {{plays an important role in}} <b>regulating</b> <b>NOTCH</b> 3 gene expression. We observed that BORIS is present in T-ALL cell lines as well as in cell lines derived from several solid tumors overexpressing NOTCH 3. Moreover, BORIS targets NOTCH 3 promoter in cancer cells and it is able to induce and to maintain a permissive/active chromatin conformation. Importantly, the association between NOTCH 3 overexpression and BORIS presence was confirmed in primary T-ALL samples from patients at the onset of the disease. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the determinants of NOTCH 3 overexpression in cancer cells, by revealing a key role for BORIS as the main mediator of transcriptional deregulation of NOTCH 3...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila putzig was {{identified}} {{as a member of the}} TRF 2 –DREF complex that is involved in core promoter selection. Additionally, putzig <b>regulates</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling, however independently of DREF. Here, we show that Putzig associates with the NURF complex. Loss of any NURF component including the NURF-specific subunit Nurf 301 impedes binding of Putzig to Notch target genes, suggesting that NURF recruits Putzig to these sites. Accordingly, Putzig can be copurified with any NURF member. Moreover, Nurf 301 mutants show reduced Notch target gene activity and enhance Notchmutant phenotypes. These data suggest a novel Putzig–NURF chromatin complex required for epigenetic activation of Notch targets...|$|R

In turn, MESP2 is <b>regulated</b> by <b>Notch</b> signaling. Paraxis is regulated by processes involving the cytoskeleton.|$|R
40|$|Notch receptors {{and their}} ligands have crucial roles in {{development}} and tumorigenesis. We present evidence demonstrating {{the existence of}} an antagonistic relationship between Notch 4 and Trp 53, which is controlled by the Mdm 2 -dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of the Notch receptor. We show that this signal-controlling mechanism is mediated by physical interactions between Mdm 2 and Notch 4 and suggest the existence of a trimeric complex between Trp 53, Notch 4 and Mdm 2, which ultimately <b>regulates</b> <b>Notch</b> activity. Functional studies indicate that Trp 53 can suppress NICD 4 -induced anchorage-independent growth in mammary epithelial cells and present evidence showing that Trp 53 has a pivotal role in the suppression of Notch-associated tumorigenesis in the mammary gland...|$|R
