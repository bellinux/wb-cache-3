This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for Large Combustion Plants concerns the following activities specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU: - 1. 1 : Combustion of fuels in installations with a total <b>rated</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> of 50 MW or more, only when this activity takes place in combustion plants with a total <b>rated</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> of 50 MW or more. - 1. 4 : Gasification of coal or other fuels in installations with a total <b>rated</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> of 20 MW or more, only when this activity is directly associated to a combustion plant. - 5. 2 : Disposal or recovery of waste in waste co-incineration plants for non-hazardous waste with a capacity exceeding 3 tonnes per hour or for hazardous waste with a capacity exceeding 10 tonnes per day, only when this activity takes place in combustion plants covered under 1. 1 above. In particular, this document covers upstream and downstream activities directly associated with the aforementioned activities including the emission prevention and control techniques applied. The fuels considered in this document are any solid, liquid and/or gaseous combustible material including: - solid fuels (e. g. coal, lignite, peat); - biomass (as defined in Article 3 (31) of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU); - liquid fuels (e. g. heavy fuel oil and gas oil); - gaseous fuels (e. g. natural gas, hydrogen-containing gas and syngas); - industry-specific fuels (e. g. by-products from the chemical and iron and steel industries); - waste except mixed municipal waste as defined in Article 3 (39) and except other waste listed in Article 42 (2) (a) (ii) and (iii) of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the Large Combustion Plants sector are the emissions to air of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and fluoride, organic compounds, dust, and metals including mercury; emissions to water resulting especially from the use of wet abatement techniques for the removal of sulphur dioxide from the flue gases; resource efficiency and especially energy efficiency. This BREF contains 12 Chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the Large Combustion Plants industrial sector and on the industrial processes used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and general information concerning the environmental performance of installations within the sector in terms of water consumption, the generation of waste and general techniques used within this sector. It also describes in more detail the general techniques to prevent or, where this is not practicable, to reduce the environmental impact of installations in this sector that were considered in determining the BAT. Chapters 4 to 9 provide the following information given below on specific combustion processes (gasification, combustion of solid fuel, combustion of liquid fuel, combustion of gaseous fuel, multi-fuel combustion and waste co-incineration).

40|$|The new {{paradigm}} of smart city includes the topics of land consumption and climate change adaptation thus bringing to the fore the role of open spaces system in the strategic development of urban areas (Gill et al., 2007; Gargiulo & Zucaro, 2015). In this context, the study of different characteristics of urban settlements and {{the focus on the}} relationship between full and empty urban spaces, could provide an important set of information for an energy saving based design of open spaces (Jones et al., 2001; Papa et al., 2014). In particular, within the relations between the elements composing the urban physical space, green spaces play a major role thanks to the many positive effects they produce on the urban environment. Vegetation, in fact, {{in addition to being a}} key component of quality of life, has an important role to make cities more sustainable and resilient, through the so-called "oasis effect", significant for reducing the energy consumption due to the use of air conditioning in summer (Coronel & Alvarez, 2001; Zhang et al., 2014). This paper intends to propose a methodology for measuring the impact of the green areas in different types of urban fabric, in terms of temperature mitigation and energy consumption reduction in order to contribute to the scientific debate on the definition of new instruments able to integrate climate and energy aspects in the design of green space networks. This work, in particular, represents a development of a previous research aimed at effectively localizing, dimensioning and distributing green spaces, starting from data related to a heterogeneous urban pattern for density and presence of green in the municipality of Naples.

40|$|Aspergillus parasiticus (NRRL 2999) {{was grown}} under cycling {{temperature}} conditions on rice and nutmeat substrates. Under conditions of diurnal and nocturnal time-temperature sequencing, total heat input {{is an important}} factor of toxin production. When expressed in degree hours per day, <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> becomes more definitive and provides a finite number, which can be related to observable changes in the culture such as sporulation and toxin biosynthesis. Three well-defined levels of response were observed in relation to heat input: no growth was detected at <b>thermal</b> <b>inputs</b> of less than 208 degree hours/day; mycelial growth as well as copious amounts of an orange pigment were observed at <b>thermal</b> <b>inputs</b> between 208 and 270 degree hours/day; sporulation and aflatoxin biosynthesis occurred above 270 degree hours/day. Between the optimum and minimum <b>thermal</b> <b>input,</b> cycling temperatures significantly reduced the period of the trophophase over cultures receiving equal heat input at a constant rate. Cycling temperatures at the low and high extremes of the temperature range had little or no effect upon the growth pattern of the culture. Regardless of how temperature was manipulated, these responses were consistent with the heat input received by the culture. A. parasiticus did not compete well when mixed with natural fungal isolates from nutmeats and was easily overgrown by the wild isolates even at relatively high <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> and when present in superior numbers. This factor and heat input generally below that required for toxin biogenesis at harvest time appear to be two significant factors that limit occurrence of aflatoxin on nut crops of the Willamette Valley.

40|$|A low-swirl burner (LSB) {{developed}} for laboratory {{research has been}} scaled to the <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> levels of a small industrial burner. The purpose was to demonstrate its viability for commercial and industrial furnaces and boilers. The original 5. 28 cm i. d. LSB using an air-jet swirler was scaled to 10. 26 cm i. d. and investigated up to a firing rate of Q 586 kW. The experiments were performed in water heater and furnace simulators. Subsequently, two LSBs (5. 28 and 7. 68 cm i. d.) configured to accept a novel vane-swirler design were evaluated up to Q 73 kW and 280 kW, respectively. The larger vane-LSB was studied in a boiler simulator. The results show that a constant velocity criterion is valid for scaling the burner diameter to accept higher <b>thermal</b> <b>inputs.</b> However, the swirl number needed for stable operation should be scaled independently using a constant residence time criterion. NOx emissions from all the LSBs {{were found to be}} independent of <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> and were only a function of the equivalence ratio.

In principle, the heat to electricity {{conversion efficiency}} of thermoelectric element {{has been defined as}} the electrical output power of the element divided by its <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> power. Due to the heat loss by convection and radiation heat transfer the test result of the heat to electricity conversion efficiency has a large errors. The authors present a test method for heat to electricity conversion efficiency of thermoelectric unicouple. The <b>thermal</b> <b>input</b> power of thermoelectric unicouple has been divided into the electrical output power plus thermal output power out of the cold end of the unicouple.
