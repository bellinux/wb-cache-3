5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was felt he had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey.

5|$|Rockefeller {{would support}} Baptist missionary activity, fund universities, and heavily engage in <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> at his Cleveland, Ohio church. While {{traveling}} the South, he would donate {{large sums of}} money to churches belonging to the Southern Baptist Convention, various Black churches, as well as other Christian denominations. One time, he paid for a slave's freedom and donated to a Roman Catholic orphanage. As he grew rich, his donations became more generous, especially to his church in Cleveland; nevertheless, it was demolished in 1925, and replaced with another building.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> {{is associated with}} risk behaviors, concurrently and developmentally among urban African American adolescents. Seven hundred and five African American youths were interviewed annually during high school. Retention rates for the study exceeded 90 %. Frequency of <b>religious</b> <b>activity,</b> sexual intercourse, and alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use were assessed at each wave. Growth curve analyses found negative concurrent associations between <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> {{and each of the}} four risk behaviors. The developmental effects of <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> varied by gender. Higher levels of <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> in 9 th grade predicted smaller increases in marijuana use among males and cigarette use among females. In addition, larger decreases in <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> during high school were associated with greater increases in alcohol use among males and sexual intercourse among females. During high school, <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> limits the development of certain types of risk behavior among African American youth, even after controlling for reciprocal effects...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{documented}} a positive and robust relationship between <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> and health outcomes. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the relationship between <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> participation and self-rated health (SRH) among older population in Indonesia. Data were obtained from 2, 915 respondents 60 years and older from the Indonesian Family Life Survey 4 (2007). SRH was assessed by a single-item health measure with four options: “very healthy,” “somewhat healthy,” “somewhat unhealthy,” and “unhealthy”. Logistic regression were used to examine the relationship of the <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> participation and SRH. Bivariate analysis revealed that <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> participation was significantly associated with SRH. Multivariate analysis shows that among participants who participated in <b>religious</b> <b>activity,</b> the likehood of a better SRH is increased (OR = 1. 422; 95 % CI = 1. 203 to 1. 682) after controlling for sociodemographic variables, socio-economic status (SES), health behaviour and number of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). This findings suggest that <b>religious</b> <b>activity</b> participation has an important effect on self-rated health status. Longitudinal studies are needed to help elucidate mechanisms and the order and direction of effects...|$|R

5|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} the Cofradía de San José {{who lived in the}} vicinity of Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw, continued with their <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> and were known as colorums, a corruption of the Latin phrase in saecula saeculorum ("unto the ages of ages") which was used at Mass to end prayers. During the American colonial era, the term colorum was applied to all the cults and insurgent groups characterized by Roman Catholic devotion, folk superstition, and hero worship. Some of these groups are still active today in various provinces in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|After the campaign, Daniel {{continued}} his temperance activism, remaining {{head of the}} state party until 1888. He organized the Prohibition Camp Meeting association in 1889, which later purchased land in Glyndon, Maryland for their meetings. He also kept up his law practice, training many law students in his office, including Orlando Franklin Bump, who also serve as Daniel's law partner for several years. He also served as a trustee of Dickinson College, his alma mater, and in other charitable and <b>religious</b> <b>activities,</b> including the Young Men's Christian Association. On October 13, 1897, he died suddenly of heart failure at his home in Mount Washington, Baltimore, survived by his wife and their adopted son, Clarence Adreon. He was buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples {{focused more on}} popular <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> such as oracles, animal cults, and prayer. New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E

5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} Kerala is {{composite}} and cosmopolitan {{in nature and}} it {{is an integral part of}} Indian culture. It is synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people. It has been elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures. However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions. Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar, a solar calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, finds common usage in planning agricultural and <b>religious</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
5|$|The major <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> (or pujas) {{performed}} every morning are mahabhishek (ablution), abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, {{while in the}} evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practiced during all the rituals. After aarti, the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.|$|E

5|$|The {{psychiatric}} incarceration {{of certain}} individuals {{was prompted by}} their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden <b>religious</b> <b>activities.</b> The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, {{was considered to be}} a form of mental illness that required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds. Highly classified government documents which have become available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.|$|E
5|$|After their {{original}} <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.|$|E
25|$|According to the Watch Tower Society, the taxed {{contributions}} include donations for {{the support}} of humanitarian relief efforts in Rwanda in 1994. French law makes a distinction between normal non-profit associations (whose donations for humanitarian aid are not tax-exempt), non-profit associations of public usefulness (whose donations for humanitarian aid are tax exempt), and associations supporting <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> (whose donations are tax exempt). Humanitarian aid is not considered to support <b>religious</b> <b>activities</b> and thus, accordingly, is not considered to be tax-exempt under the rules governing associations supporting <b>religious</b> <b>activities.</b> Typically, religious organizations in France providing humanitarian aid found a separate association devoted to that purpose; it may then be declared of public usefulness.|$|E
