However, the Gunslinger is a product of experiments by Jex to win a civil war on his planet, and the Doctor is unsure of what is the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this was the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do someday.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests it was the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E

Other authors have characterized wisdom as [...] "knowing the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do" [...] and [...] "the {{ability to make}} sound judgments and decisions apparently without thought".Wisdom involves using knowledge for the greater good. Because of this, wisdom is deeper and more uniquely human. It requires a sense of good and bad, right and wrong, ethical and unethical.|$|R
50|$|Customer value {{maximization}} (CVM) is a real-time service model that, proponents say, {{goes beyond}} basic {{customer relationship management}} (CRM) capabilities, identifying and capturing maximum potential from prospects and existing customers. Proponents claim that a well-devised CVM program helps companies offer the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> people at the right time. The CVM framework uses creative, technology, media and process along with robust measurement systems to help marketers maximize returns from their marketing investments.|$|R
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E

There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.|$|E

50|$|Some properties, such as hardness, {{roundness}} and dampness, {{are clearly}} natural properties. We encounter {{them in the}} real world and can perceive them. On the other hand, other properties, such as being good and being right, are not so obvious. A great novel {{is considered to be a}} good thing; goodness may be said to be a property of that novel. Paying one's debts and telling the truth are generally held <b>to</b> be <b>right</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do; rightness may be said to be a property of certain human actions.|$|R

25|$|On 13 October 2005 Straw took {{questions}} {{from a public}} panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special {{on the subject of}} Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.|$|E
25|$|The school's mascot is an Indian. In 2004, {{there was}} a major {{controversy}} at the school about the appropriateness of the mascot. The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force was the <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. After months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions {{from both sides of the}} issue, a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E

40|$|In these {{difficult}} times, health care institutions need leaders, not simply managers. Leaders' breadth {{of skills and}} perspective come from understanding the values involved in health care delivery; managers know the <b>right</b> way <b>to</b> do <b>things,</b> but leaders know which are the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do. Schools of public health are moving away from their potential contribution to leadership development in health services administration. The result {{is a lack of}} accountability to the community.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{sustainability}} {{is tied to}} the future of our ability to manage interconnectedness and interdependence, and thus to our abilities to engage in cooperative, value-creating public deliberations and negotiations.

We need better to understand the differences between dialogue, debate, and negotiation, as well as the corresponding work of facilitating a dialogue, moderating a debate, and mediating an actual negotiation. Contrasting processes and practical attitudes of dialogue, debate, and negotiation can teach us, in the context of creating a sustainable future, that we must devise discursive and conversational political processes and institutions that explore possible commitments so that we not only know the <b>right</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do but actually bring ourselves and one another <b>to</b> do those <b>right</b> <b>things...</b>|$|R
