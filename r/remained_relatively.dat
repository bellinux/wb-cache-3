5|$|The Ghadar Party, {{suppressed}} {{during the}} war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs. Although sidelined in California, it <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> stronger in East Asia, where it allied {{itself with the}} Chinese Communist Party.|$|E

5|$|Browne was {{eventually}} exchanged for American general William Alexander (Lord Stirling), and was roundly criticized for {{his handling of}} the whole affair. Nassau <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> poorly defended and was again subjected to American rebel threat in January 1778. It was then seized by Spanish forces under Bernardo de Gálvez in 1782, and returned to British control after the war.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> small, no longer ranking {{among the major}} cities of Korea. During the early 20th century, many archaeological {{excavations}} were conducted, particularly inside the tombs which had remained largely intact over the centuries. A museum, the forerunner of the present-day Gyeongju National Museum, was inaugurated in 1915 to exhibit the excavated artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The period also {{witnessed}} {{a number of}} rebellions starting with the 1806 Vellore Mutiny. The rebellion of Velu Thambi and Paliath Achan and the Poligar Wars were other notable insurrections against the British rule, but the Madras Presidency <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> undisturbed by the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.|$|E

5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Dawson <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> lawful, {{protected}} by the Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E

5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E
5|$|From there, {{the order}} <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> {{constant}} with Hamilton {{going on to}} take his 34th Grand Prix win. He was followed by Rosberg, Vettel, Massa and Nasr. Completing the point-scorers were Ricciardo, Nico Hülkenberg, Ericsson, Sainz and Pérez. In all, only eleven cars finished the race with Button's McLaren being the only car to finish outside the points and everyone from sixth position down lapped.|$|E

5|$|In the 2016 UCI World Tour season-long competition, the top 10 of {{the standings}} <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> {{unchanged}} after the race. Sagan {{was still on}} top, 49 points ahead of Alberto Contador. Vanmarcke moved up from eighth to fifth, while Stannard moved into tenth place. Tinkoff remained ahead of Team Sky in the team rankings; in the nations' rankings, Australia moved back into the lead, with Belgium moving into second and pushing Spain into third.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, Colonel David E. Lownds {{took over}} as {{commander}} of the 26th Marine Regiment. There were sporadic actions in the vicinity during the late summer and early fall, the most serious {{of which was the}} ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March. During December and early January there were numerous sightings of NVA troops and activities in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> quiet.|$|E
5|$|The 4th North Korean Division in the {{meantime}} was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food, equipment, ammunition and, weapons. Conscripts from local South Korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses. There was also virtually no provision for the wounded in the division, and the North Korean forces began to come apart under these stresses. Still, the division's morale <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> high and General Lee refused to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Melitene profoundly {{shocked the}} Muslim world: {{for the first}} time, a major Muslim city had fallen and been {{incorporated}} into the Byzantine Empire. Kourkouas followed this success by subduing parts of the district of Samosata in 936 and razing {{the city to the}} ground. Until 938, the East <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> calm. Historians suggest that the Byzantines were likely preoccupied with the full pacification of Melitene, and the Arab emirates, deprived of any potential support from the Caliphate, were reluctant to provoke them.|$|E
5|$|The {{most visible}} way for {{graduates}} of Texas A to recognize {{each other is}} by the Aggie Ring. The Aggie Ring is worn by current students and alumni, {{and is one of}} the most well-known symbols of the Aggie Network. The first Aggie Ring was designed by E. C. Jonas in 1894, and the design has <b>remained</b> <b>relatively</b> unchanged since- the only major change came when the school's name was changed from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A University in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien began devising the {{language}} around 1910 and restructured the grammar several times until Quenya reached its final state.

The Finnish language had been a major source of inspiration, but Tolkien was also familiar with Latin, Greek, and ancient Germanic languages when he began constructing Quenya.|$|E
