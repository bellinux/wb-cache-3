50|$|Significant {{conditions}} are recognized by an appropriate device called a <b>receiver,</b> <b>demodulator,</b> <b>or</b> decoder. The decoder translates the actual signal received into its intended logical value {{such as a}} binary digit (0 or 1), an alphabetic character, a mark, or a space. Each significant instant is determined when the appropriate device assumes a condition or state usable for performing a specific function, such as recording, processing, or gating.|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} {{elegance of}} the ring modulator {{is that it is}} bidirectional: the signal flow can be reversed allowing the same circuit with the same carrier to be used either as a modulator <b>or</b> <b>demodulator,</b> for example in low-cost radio transceivers.|$|R

40|$|This {{software}} implements {{software-defined radio}} procession over multicore, multi-CPU systems {{in a way}} that maximizes the use of CPU resources in the system. The software treats each processing step in either a communications or navigation modulator <b>or</b> <b>demodulator</b> system as an independent, threaded block. Each threaded block is defined with a programmable number of input or output buffers; these buffers are implemented using POSIX pipes. In addition, each threaded block is assigned a unique thread upon block installation. A modulator <b>or</b> <b>demodulator</b> system is built by assembly of the threaded blocks into a flow graph, which assembles the processing blocks to accomplish the desired signal processing. This software architecture allows the software to scale effortlessly between single CPU/single-core computers or multi-CPU/multi-core computers without recompilation. NASA spaceflight and ground communications systems currently rely exclusively on ASICs or FPGAs. This software allows low- and medium-bandwidth (100 bps to approx. 50 Mbps) software defined radios to be designed and implemented solely in C/C++ software, while lowering development costs and facilitating reuse and extensibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{an improved}} SPICE model of memristor using dependent sources and switches. The proposed SPICE model with two parameters in dependent current source has ideal frequency and amplitude characteristics. We simulate two circuits with memristor. The results {{demonstrate that the}} memristor can “remember ” last resistance value when no current passes through it, the Amplitude Modulation (AM) circuit with memristor and op-amp is simulated under the condition of high frequency. Since the memristor has great performance in frequency {{there might be a}} possible application of the memristor to be used as modulator <b>or</b> <b>demodulator</b> in wireless communication...|$|R
