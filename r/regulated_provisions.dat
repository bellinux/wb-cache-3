40|$|We {{examined}} the provisioning strategy of a long-lived seabird {{to test the}} prediction from life-history theory that adults should preferentially allocate resources towards their own needs rather than towards their offspring, and to test the abilities of adults to <b>regulate</b> <b>provisioning</b> according to the chick needs. The individual provisioning behaviour of Yellow-nosed Albatrosses Diomedea chlororhynchos was studied, costs of flight being increased by adding a weight handicap to foraging parents, {{and needs of the}} chicks being increased by induced regurgitation (underfed chicks) or decreased by food supplementation (overfed chicks). Control birds were found to <b>regulate</b> <b>provisioning</b> in relation to the nutritional status of the chick and to the mass of the adult. As a result of increased foraging costs, and possibly of reduced foraging ability, handicapped adults spent more time foraging and delivered smaller meals. Unlike control birds, they were unable to <b>regulate</b> <b>provisioning</b> and lost slightly more mass than control birds, but they had similar survival to the next breeding season. The behaviour of parents rearing underfed chicks was similar to that of control birds, but adults rearing overfed chicks delivered smaller meals, at the same frequency as control birds. Thus, although parent Yellow-nosed Albatrosses can perceive the nutritional status of the chick and <b>regulate</b> <b>provisioning</b> accordingly, they are unable to increase the provisioning rate significantly. They primarily keep resources for themselves, their own body condition determining the level of investment in the chick. Most albatrosses and petrels behave so that primarily adult body condition is protected often at the expense of chick provisioning. Regulation abilities differ between species probably according to several factors such as foraging strategies, distance to feeding zones or body size. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{how it is}} possible for firms in controversial sectors, which are often marked by social taboos and moral debates, to act in socially responsible ways, and whether a firm can be socially responsible if it produces products harmful to society or individuals. It contends that a utilitarian justification can be used to sup-port the legal and <b>regulated</b> <b>provision</b> of goods and services in these areas, and the <b>regulated</b> and legal <b>provision</b> of these areas produces less harm than the real alternative— illegal and unregulated supply. Utilitarianism is concerned as much with harm minimisation as good maximisation, and both are equally important when it comes to maxi-mising welfare (Bentham 1789, 1970; Mill [1863] 1964). Any adequate theory of CSR must, therefore, have the capacity to handle a business that minimises harm as well as those that more straightforwardly maximise good. In this paper we therefore attempt two tasks. First, we argue that the legal but <b>regulated</b> <b>provision</b> of products and services may be better from an overall utilitarian perspective than a situation in which these harmful or immoral goods and services are illegal but procurable via a black market. Porter and Kramer’s (2006) strategic CSR framework is then presented to describe how firms in these controversial sectors can act in socially responsible ways. This model highlights the importance of firm strategy in selecting areas of socially responsible behaviours that can be acted upon by firms in each industry...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} been equivocal in {{determining}} whether long-lived seabirds are {{able to respond to}} chick nutritional status and <b>regulate</b> <b>provisioning</b> rates accordingly. With some exceptions, albatrosses and petrels that feed their chicks every 1 - 3 days seem able to respond to variability in chick condition. In contrast, those with longer overall feeding periodicity and that frequently show a dual foraging strategy, mixing short trips (which most benefit the chick) with longer, pelagic feeding excursions (during which time adults recover lost condition), tend not to <b>regulate</b> <b>provisioning.</b> We used a combined observational and experimental approach to determine whether feeding rates in grey-headed albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma) were determined by parental foraging proficiency and (or) offspring demand. The results indicated that both factors were important. Adults showed consistent differences in provisioning characteristics, but chick satiation and solicitation also influenced the mass of the meal delivered when adults returned. Given a provisioning schedule characterised by relatively frequent colony visits and with no means of assessing the feeding success of their partner in the interim, the adjustment of meal mass upon arrival appears to be a simple means of tailoring prey delivery to changing chick requirements and is likely to be as effective as alternative strategies suggested for other species of Procellariiform...|$|R

In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, <b>regulating,</b> <b>provisioning</b> and cultural services.|$|R

Wild dolphin provisioning at Tangalooma, Moreton Island, Australia has been occurring since 1992. Each evening, up to eight dolphins are provided with fish in a <b>regulated</b> <b>provisioning</b> program. In this paper, calf survival at the Tangalooma provisioning program is reported and contrasted with that from wild populations and from a similar provisioning program at Monkey Mia, Western Australia.

Possible explanations for the high calf survival rate are explored. These include site attributes such as isolated location and high water quality, aspects of foraging ecology likely to benefit calves of provisioned mothers, and the management regime used in the provisioning program (e. g., duration and timing of provisioning; quality of provisioned fish) ...|$|R
