40|$|ObjectivesThe primary {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts reduces the time from a clinical event to a clinical decision in response to arrhythmias, cardiovascular (CV) disease progression, and device issues compared to patients receiving standard in-office care. A secondary {{objective was to}} compare the rates of CV health care utilization between patients in the remote and in-office arms. BackgroundIn addition to providing life-saving therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators collect advanced diagnostics on the progression of the patient's heart disease. Device technology has progressed to allow wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts to replace some scheduled in-office visits. MethodsThe CONNECT (Clinical Evaluation of <b>Remote</b> <b>Notification</b> to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision) study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized evaluation involving 1, 997 patients from 136 clinical sites who underwent insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (including cardiac resynchronization therapy devices) and were followed up for 15 months. Health care utilization data included all CV-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and clinic office visits. ResultsThe median time from clinical event to clinical decision per patient was reduced from 22 days in the in-office arm to 4. 6 days in the remote arm (p < 0. 001). The health care utilization data revealed a decrease in mean length of stay per CV hospitalization visit from 4. 0 days in the in-office arm to 3. 3 days in the remote arm (p = 0. 002). ConclusionsWireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts as compared with standard in-office follow-up significantly reduced the time to a clinical decision in response to clinical events and was associated with a significant reduction in mean length of CV hospital stay.

40|$|Dragonfly {{networks}} arrange network routers in a two-level hierarchy, {{providing a}} competitive cost-performance solution for large systems. Non-minimal adaptive routing (adaptive misrouting) is employed to fully exploit the path diversity {{and increase the}} performance under adversarial traffic patterns. Network fairness issues arise in the dragonfly for several combinations of traffic pattern, global misrouting and traffic prioritization policy. Such unfairness prevents a balanced use of the resources across the network nodes and degrades severely the performance of any application running on an affected node. This paper reviews the main causes behind network unfairness in dragonflies, including a new adversarial traffic pattern which can easily occur in actual systems and congests all the global output links of a single router. A solution for the observed unfairness is evaluated using age-based arbitration. Results show that age-based arbitration mitigates fairness issues, especially when using in-transit adaptive routing. However, when using source adaptive routing, the saturation of the new traffic pattern interferes with the mechanisms employed to detect remote congestion, and the problem grows with the network size. This makes source adaptive routing in dragonflies based on <b>remote</b> <b>notifications</b> prone to reduced performance, even when using age-based arbitration.

40|$|Parallel and multinode {{computing}} {{systems are}} becoming widespread and grow in sophistication. Besides simulation, rapid prototyping becomes important in designing and evaluating their architecture. We present an FPGA-based {{system that we}} developed and use for prototyping and measuring high speed processor-network interfaces and interconnects; it is an experimental tool for research projects in architecture. We configure FPGA boards as network interfaces (NI) and as switches. NI’s plug into the PCI-X bus of commercial PC’s, and use 4 links of 2. 5 Gb/s/link as network connections; we can bundle these links together, at the byte or packet level, offering 10 Gb/s of network throughput. NI’s implement DMA on the PCI-X side, and remote DMA and <b>remote</b> <b>notification</b> (interrupt or flag-setting) on the network side. We configured the switch boards as buffered crossbars operating directly on variable-size packets and featuring credit-based flow control for lossless communication. Multiple, parallel switches can serve the NI links using multipath routing; NI’s resequence the out-of-order packet arrivals. All boards provide extensive support for monitoring, debugging, and measurement. Colleagues adapted the Linux OS for this platform, and used it for remote disk I/O experiments [1]. We report here on the platform architecture, its design cost and complexity, latency and throughput parameters, and buffered crossbar performance. We now work on remote queues and synchronization mechanisms. ...|$|E
40|$|Legislative {{changes to}} {{regulations}} surrounding {{the use of}} traps and other capture devices have unambiguously impacted {{the manner in which}} these devices can be used. In many cases the revisions to trapping legislation have resulted in shortened trap check intervals. This change has increased the costs of using capture devices and decreased the efficiency of Wildlife Services (WS) specialists working in the field. The use of trap monitors may result in cost savings and increased efficiency. Trap monitor systems function as a <b>remote</b> <b>notification</b> system that can identify trap status. These monitor systems can be used as an alternative to visually inspecting the trap, potentially reducing costs. A benefit-cost analysis is an economic method {{that can be used to}} evaluate the efficiency of the use of trap monitors by comparing the costs of the trap monitor system to the benefits of reduced specialist time and resources used. This paper describes a method to estimate cost savings associated with the use of trap monitor systems by the WS program and discusses potential scenarios where trap monitors would provide cost savings. This type of analysis aides in legislative decision-making processes through the identification of trapping situations in which the use of trap monitor systems are economical and through quantifying the return per dollar invested in trap monitor systems...|$|E
40|$|Incapacitation of {{dangerous}} individuals has conventionally entailed {{the exercise of}} physical control over an actual body: the state confines the person in jail. But advances in technology have changed that convention. A variety of new technologies-such as GPS tracking bracelets, biometric scanners, online offender indexes, and DNA databases-give the government power to control dangerous persons without relying on any exertion of physical control. The government can track {{the location of a}} person in real time, receive <b>remote</b> <b>notification</b> that an individual has ingested alcohol, or electronically zone someone into a home or out of a public park. It can prove conclusively that a particular person wore a hat or took a sip from a discarded soda can, or identify a single face in a ten thousand-person crowd. In this day and age, restraint of the dangerous can be as much about keeping people out of a place {{as it used to be}} about locking them up in one. But whereas physical incapacitation {{of dangerous}} persons has always invoked some measure of constitutional scrutiny, virtually no legal constraints circumscribe the use of its technological counterpart. Across legal doctrines, courts erroneously treat physical deprivations as the archetypal 2 ̆ 2 paradigm of restraint, 2 ̆ 2 and thus largely overlook the significant threat to liberty posed by technological measures. Similarly, little academic attention has been paid to the state 2 ̆ 7 s use of targeted forms of non-physical control. Much scholarly interest has focused on the increased use of physical incapacitation as a means of exerting regulatory control over, for example, illegal immigrants, pretrial detainees, or the mentally ill. And an equally vibrant debate surrounds the protection of information privacy in general society. Yet nearly no attention has been paid to the connection between these two developments. This Article examines the generally unheeded intersection between two well-documented trends: the state 2 ̆ 7 s increasing desire to preventively regulate targeted classes of individuals, and its increasing capacity to use innovative technologies, rather than physical incapacitation, to realize that desire. This Article identifies four loosely grouped emerging technologies of control: DNA databasing, electronic monitoring, electronic indexing, and biometric scanning. It then reviews the legal landscape on which they operate and demonstrates that, across the range of doctrines, courts unduly focus on the physical world as the relevant metric against which all restraints are judged. As a result, technologies of restraint are imposed without necessary procedural safeguards. This Article then outlines four concerns peculiar to these kinds of restraints and illustrates how significant concerns are wholly overlooked when the physical world is the determinant referent of comparison. The Article closes by urging greater judicial scrutiny of technological restraint and by laying out a series of potential inquiries that might aid in such an effort...|$|E

Advantages of CMC include opportunity for group to exhibit “collective intelligence”, asynchronous support of communication process, self-tailoring of communication structures by users and groups, and the integration into the communication system of other computer resources and information systems. The main advantage of using CMC is in the very fundamental nature of the communication medium. The asynchronous approaches to group problem solving free individuals to deal with problems in those cognitive processes at which they excel. Seven asynchronous group process factors are also presented. A CMC metaphor is also presented. The metaphor components discussed are conferences, messages, activities and notifications. A conference can be tailored according to activities. An activity can be attached to any communication item. When triggered, it will execute a program or procedure in the local or <b>remote</b> host. <b>Notification</b> functions include alerting, closure and tracking. The concepts of roles, privileges, and tickets are also discussed. Finally, the components of two CMC systems are presented.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the area of}} inter-tool communication in CAD environments. These environments were characterized, leading to {{the identification of the}} functional and non-functional communication requirements. The limitations of the current solutions motivated {{the development of a new}} communication service. For the fulfilment of the functional requirements, three services are offered, through a uniform interface: multicast of <b>notifications,</b> <b>remote</b> data access/remote invocation, and point-to point communication. The first two services use the policy of "sending to whom it might concern" and are supported by group communication mechanisms. The novelty of the work done resides mainly in the strategies used in the design and implementation. The CAD environment was modelled according to the group orientation paradigm, being the messages sent and delivered in the scope of groups. Conceptually, the communication service is based on an entity responsible for contents based message delivery in groups. For the fulfilment of the non functional requirements, this entity has a distributed architecture, having agents in each tool and node of the environment. Using the characteristics of this particular architecture, it was possible to build lightweight and very efficient group communication mechanisms.

Currently available methods rely mostly on analogue approach (booklets), requiring the clinical test participant to fill in health state daily. Such approach often can be biased by unpunctual, not precise reporting. The mobile device can support this process by automatic scheduling and recording an actual time of reports {{and most of all}} it can record the inertial and biometric sensor data during the survey process.

40|$|This {{report has}} two objectives: 1. To {{confirm that the}} Fire and Life Safety Systems of a project {{building}} satisfy applicable prescriptive code requirements, and 2. To evaluate how the Fire and Life Safety Systems perform when challenged by a credible fire scenario. The three‐story, 31, 430 sq. ft. project building is the regional office for an oil and gas company operating in Western Canada. The building includes an atrium which extends from the ground level, main floor to the third floor. The Fire and Life Safety Systems {{within the scope of}} this study, include: Fire Detection and Alarms Systems (FDAS) Egress Components Water‐Based Fire Protection Systems Structural Fire Protections Systems Prescriptive Analysis Analysis of the FDAS confirmed that the building is equipped with modern Fire Alarm System (FAS), code compliant, UL listed detection devices and notification appliances. The single stage FAS is augmented by a <b>Remote</b> Supervising Station. <b>Notification</b> appliances include audible and visual alarms which have proven effective in building response exercises. The building egress elements were found to be designed and installed in compliance with the Life Safety Code. However, {{it was found that the}} building occupants have installed items which have eroded the building life safety features. Corridor width has been reduced to less than that required by the LSC by the installation of shelving and other items. In addition, combustible materials are being stored in the east exit stairway enclosure which may present a hazard to building occupants. The building water supply was found to meet the design demand. The building owner has implemented effective programs for ongoing inspection, testing and maintenance the water‐based fire protection system. Furthermore, processes are in place to track fire protection system impairment and ensure the system is returned to a fully operational status in a timely manner. The occupancy classification of the project building was found to be Group B (Business) which requires Type II‐A construction. It was confirmed that the building meets the International Building Code requirements for Type II‐A construction. Performance Based Analysis The performance of the building Fire and Life Safety Systems when challenged by a design fire was assessed. The objective was to confirm that occupants could exit the building before they are exposed to untenable environmental conditions. Two credible fire scenarios are evaluated; a trash bag fire in the east exit stairway enclosure and a chair fire located in the third floor, open‐office area. The design fires are believed to be realistic with respect to their initial location, fire growth rate and smoke generation. For the trash bag fire, it was concluded that the building water‐based fire protection and fire detection and alarm systems work effectively when challenged. The Available Safe Egress Time (ASET) was found to be greater than the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) and occupants could be expected to safely evacuate from the building. In contrast, it was found that the heat release rate from the chair fire may be insufficient to activate detection systems before untenable smoke conditions develop. The ASET was found to be less than the RSET and occupants may not be able to safely evacuate from the building. The chair fire was proposed to be ignited by the unauthorized use of an electric space heater. Recommendations The following recommendations are made to ensure the building life safety systems are maintained and occupants can safety exit the building in the event of a fire. 1. Continue to support the fire detection and water‐based fire protection system through an ongoing ITM program executed by certified technicians. 2. Implement a third‐party audit program to provide assurance that the fire detection and water‐ based fire protection system ITM program continues to meet NFPA requirements. 3. Remove items such as shelving from the second and third floor corridors. These items were not in the building initial design and have reduced the corridor width to less than that required by the LSC. 4. Remove combustible janitorial supplies from the east exit stairway enclosure. These items present a hazard to building occupants should a fire occur. 5. Review the building policy which prohibits the use of portable, electric space heaters at the next company safety meeting...|$|R
