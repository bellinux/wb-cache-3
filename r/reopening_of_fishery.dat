40|$|The {{assessment}} of many fish {{stocks in the}} North Atlantic are based on age-structured models like XSA or ADAPT. The abundances and fishing mortalities provided by these models are of main interest and their errors are calculated analytically from the catchability relationship. Assumptions on this relationship are explored by Monte Carlo simulation of a XSA analysis of Flemish Cap cod tuned with survey abundance indices for which variance-covariance was previously calculated by bootstrap. Two different Monte Carlo simulations were carried out: with and without covariance among those abundance indices. The {{results show that the}} XSA applied to the Flemish Cap cod is quite robust against these assumptions, but the errors are best evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation, which provides more accurate and precise results. Covariance of indices does not promote different results but correlation of the results should be taken into account on short-term projections. The Monte Carlo simulation, or stochastic XSA, also provides directly the probability profile for spawning stock biomass if variance estimates of the maturity ogive and stock weight at age are included. This probability profile could be an important tool to evaluate the risk <b>of</b> <b>reopening</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{in the context of a}} precautionary approach...|$|R
50|$|After German re-unification {{there was}} much {{consideration}} <b>of</b> the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> the lines in the vicinity, including the Jerxheim-Dedeleben line to provide a connection between Halberstadt and Helmstedt and Brunswick, but this did not proceed. Since the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> the Halberstadt-Vienenburg line in 1996 and {{the closure of the}} line to Dedeleben in 2001, the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> the line is no longer under discussion.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} years, {{the city and}} German government put {{a great deal of}} effort into restoring and reunifying the S-Bahn and U-Bahn networks in Berlin. The U-Bahn system reached its pre-wall status in 1995 with the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> Warschauer Straße on U1. The S-Bahn system reached a preliminary completion in 2002 (with the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> the ring), even though there are still disused sections of lines closed {{in the aftermath of the}} wall. Decisions on <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> some of these sections are still to be made.|$|R
