40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} structural oil price shocks on the covariance of U. S. stock market <b>return</b> <b>and</b> stock market volatility. We construct from daily data on <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility the covariance of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility at monthly frequency. The measures of daily volatility are realized-volatility at high frequency (normalized squared return), conditional-volatility recovered from a stochastic volatility model, and implied-volatility deduced from options prices. Positive shocks to aggregate demand and to oil-market specific demand are associated with negative effects on the covariance of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility. Oil supply disruptions are associated with positive effects on the covariance of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility. The spillover index between the structural oil price shocks and covariance of stock <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility is large and highly statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained following the testing of five hypotheses regarding conditional <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility of the most listed European stocks in the steel & iron subsector. The following elements of the stocks are analysed: time variation of volatility, seasonality of <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility, relationship between <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility and volatility asymmetry. The results obtained confirm for all the analyzed stocks the existence of volatility variation in time, the lack of correlation between <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility, the existence of asymmetry phenomenon of volatility and the presence in some stocks of the seasonality effect both for <b>return</b> <b>and</b> volatility...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{autoregression}} with exogenous variables (and its transformed error-correction model), we investigate relationships between realized <b>return</b> <b>and</b> risk measured by realized volatility. The empirical results obtained from analysing the German Stock Index (DAX) and the Dow Jones Index (DJ) show a {{negative relationship between}} the realized <b>return</b> <b>and</b> risk and also between changes of the realized <b>return</b> <b>and</b> risk for both monthly and quarterly frequencies. There is also some weak evidence of a negative impact of large volatility on changes of the return that can be detected. ...|$|R

The study also investigates the factors that cause the shock to stock <b>return</b> <b>and</b> excess stock <b>return.</b> We further examine the responses of stock market to cash-flow news, expected stock return news, expected excess stock <b>return</b> news <b>and</b> interest rate news. Last, we examine the reaction of market liquidity, liquidity risk and abnormal trading volume to cash-flow news, expected stock return news, expected excess stock <b>return</b> news <b>and</b> interest rate news. Our main findings are summarized as follows: first, cash-flow news is the main driver of stock <b>return</b> <b>and</b> excess stock <b>return</b> in stock market. Second, the dividend payout ratio is able to predict stock <b>return</b> <b>and</b> excess stock <b>return.</b> Third, under the model of stock return variance, unexpected market liquidity and unexpected liquidity risk are negatively related to expected stock return news, but not related to cash-flow news. Fourth, under the model of excess stock return variance, unexpected market liquidity and unexpected liquidity risk are negatively related to cash-flow news, expected excess stock <b>return</b> news, <b>and</b> interest rate news. ...|$|R
