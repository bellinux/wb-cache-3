2500|$|Ancient Mesoamericans {{were the}} first people to invent <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> (...) , {{sometime}} before 1600 BCE, and used them in a variety of roles. The Mesoamerican ballgame, for example, employed various sizes of solid <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> and balls were burned as offerings in temples, buried in votive deposits, and laid in sacred bogs and cenotes.|$|R
25|$|In {{informal}} games, {{either a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>ball</b> or tennis ball {{is used as}} an alternative. The <b>rubber</b> <b>ball</b> is not suitable for the variety of surfaces made use of in informal games; it is too bouncy on cement and concrete and barely bounces at all on grass or soil. An unmodified tennis ball is light, but it is incapable of gaining sufficient speed. By covering a tennis ball with electrical tape, the ball's weight and traction are increased, which in turn leads to greater bounce and speed. A tape ball {{can also be used}} to mimic a seaming cricket ball by adding an extra layer of tape around the circumference like a seam, the sides can be roughened to mimic conventional swing of a cricket ball. The tape ball is thus a sound compromise between safety and sincerity to the sport.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{hockey and}} its various {{precursor}} games utilized balls {{until the late}} 19th century. By the 1870s, 'flat' pucks were made of wood as well as rubber. At first, pucks were square. The first recorded organized game of ice hockey used a wooden puck {{to prevent it from}} leaving the rink of play. The rubber pucks were first made by slicing a <b>rubber</b> <b>ball,</b> then trimming the disc square. The Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal is credited with making and using the first round pucks in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|Tennis is {{a racket}} sport {{that can be}} played {{individually}} against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow <b>rubber</b> <b>ball</b> covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.

The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Apple {{switched}} {{back to a}} more elliptical {{shape and}} monochromatic black and white design. The <b>rubber</b> <b>ball</b> tracking mechanism was updated with a solid-state optical system, and its single button was moved out of sight {{to the bottom of}} the mouse. Keeping up with the technological trends Apple went wireless in 2003 and two years later, though maintaining its iconic design style, broke its most controversial implementation in the mouse concept and for the first time released a “none button” mouse with five programmable electrostatic sensors and an integrated scroll ball. Though the Macintosh aftermarket had provided these options to discerning users for decades, Apple itself only made them complementary with its offerings after the passage of much time.|$|E
25|$|A {{judge from}} Barcelona is {{currently}} investigating the accusations of police violence {{made by the}} Generalitat against the national police and the civil guard. According to the judge there were 218 persons injured on that day, 20 of which were agents. According to various sources previously reported figures for civilians and police may have been exaggerated. According to the Generalitat de Catalunya, 844 people requested the services of the Catalan emergency health service, this number includes people with irritation by gas and anxiety attacks. Of those injured, most were minor, but four people were hospitalised by the emergency health service and of those two were in serious condition, one due to impact from a <b>rubber</b> <b>ball</b> in the protests, the other for unrelated causes. According to the Ministry of the Interior 431 Guardia Civil agents were injured, 39 of them required immediate medical treatment and the remaining 392 had injuries by bruises, scrapes, kicks and bites.|$|E

25|$|Overall, 893 {{civilians were}} injured {{according}} to the Catalan health ministry, and 431 members of the National Police Corps and the Guardia Civil were injured {{according to the}} Spanish interior ministry.

The Catalan Ministry of Education calculated that the damage inflicted by the police raids to schools and hospitals, which were used as polling stations, will cost 314,000 euros to fix.|$|E
500|$|The {{object of}} the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a {{lacrosse}} stick or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid <b>rubber</b> <b>ball</b> in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact. [...] The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal. It is sometimes referred to as the [...] "fastest sport on two feet".|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, {{variety and}} music hall theatres became more popular, and jugglers were in demand to fill time between music acts, {{performing}} {{in front of}} the curtain while sets were changed. Performers started specializing in juggling, separating it from other kinds of performance such as sword swallowing and magic. The Gentleman Juggler style was established by German jugglers such as Salerno and Kara. Rubber processing developed, and jugglers started using <b>rubber</b> <b>balls.</b> Previously, juggling balls were made from balls of twine, stuffed leather bags, wooden spheres, or various metals. Solid or inflatable <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> meant that bounce juggling was possible. Inflated <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> made ball spinning easier and more readily accessible. Soon in North America, vaudeville theatres employed jugglers, often hiring European performers.|$|R

It was in 1963 that he decided to play as a leg spin bowler. His idea proved to be right as he was soon selected for the national side.|$|E
50|$|In {{the on-line}} process, the {{cleaning}} body {{moves through the}} tubes with the conveying medium and cleans them by means of its oversize compared to the tube diameter. In the range of diameters of up to 50 mm these cleaning bodies consist of sponge rubber, in larger diameters up {{to the size of}} oil pipelines {{it is a matter of}} scrapers or so-called pigs. Sponge <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> are applied mainly for cooling water, like sea, river, or cooling tower water. For the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, specially adapted cleaning bodies are imaginable but the conveying media flows are so weak that off-line processes are employed in most cases. Given the fact that the cleaning bodies are not allowed to remain in the conveying medium they have to be collected after passing through the tubes. In the case of sponge <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> this is done through special strainer sections; for scrapers or pigs an outward transfer station is provided. According to the Taprogge process, the sponge <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> are re-injected upstream of the system to be cleaned by a corresponding ball recirculating unit whereas the scraper or pig is mostly taken out by hand and re-injected into another collector. Sponge <b>rubber</b> <b>balls</b> therefore safeguard a continuous cleaning while the scraper or pig system is discontinuous.|$|R
