50|$|White {{primaries}} were primary elections {{held in the}} Southern {{states of}} the United States of America in which only white voters were permitted to participate. White primaries were established by the state Democratic Party units or by state legislatures in many Southern states after 1890. The white primary was one method used by white Democrats to disenfranchise most black and other minority voters. They also passed laws and constitutions with provisions to <b>raise</b> <b>barriers</b> to voter registration, completing disenfranchisement from 1890 to 1908 in all states of the former Confederacy.|$|E
5000|$|After the American Civil War, black {{slaves in}} the South were emancipated and granted {{citizenship}} and the franchise through constitutional amendments.

In addition, these white-dominated southern legislatures passed laws imposing racial segregation in public facilities, and Jim Crow customs ruled. Most rural blacks worked as sharecroppers on white-owned land, and were seldom able to get free themselves from poverty.|$|E
50|$|In {{a county}} {{with a high}} {{proportion}} of people of color, both Native Americans and African Americans were oppressed by the Jim Crow system established in the state after white conservative Democrats regained power following the Reconstruction era. The state legislature passed laws to <b>raise</b> <b>barriers</b> to voter registration and disfranchise minorities. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration (which worked against sharecroppers and tenant farmers), and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, who were white and applied it subjectively) and prepayment of a poll tax (difficult for poor people to raise who did not use much cash). A grandfather clause exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867. The effect in North Carolina was the complete elimination of black and mixed-race voters from voter rolls by 1904. Contemporary accounts estimated that 75,000 black male citizens across the state lost the vote.|$|E

50|$|This {{legislative}} key-surrender tactic can be circumvented using automatic rekeying of secure channels through rapid {{generation of}} new, unrelated {{public and private}} keys at short intervals. Following rekeying, the old keys can be deleted, rendering previously used keys inaccessible to the end-user, and thus removing the user's ability to disclose the old key, {{even if they are}} willing to do so. Technologies enabling this sort of rapidly rekeyed encryption include public-key cryptography, hardware PRNGs, perfect forward secrecy, and opportunistic encryption. Many apps commonly in use today on mobile devices around the world employ such encryption. The only ways to stop this sort of cryptography is to ban it completely (any such ban would be unenforceable for any government that is not totalitarian, as it would result in massive invasions of privacy, such as blanket permission for physical searches of all computers at random intervals), or otherwise <b>raise</b> <b>barriers</b> to its practical use (be they technological or legal). Such barriers represent a difficulty and risk to the users of such cryptographic technology which would limit and potentially prevent its widespread adoption. Generally, it is the threat of prosecution which limits the use and proliferation of a technology more so than the ease-of-use of a technology in and of itself.|$|E

30|$|The other vital factor, {{particularly}} in context of FVCs {{pertains to the}} ethnicity of the team members. Evidence from China suggests that while investing in geographically distant destinations, FVCs consciously hire local professionals to manage their regional offices (Huang et al., 2013; Ahlmstrom et al., 2007). The resulting homophily sentiment is likely to facilitate the networking process. The impact of homophily resulting from similar experiences, organizational structures and goals has already been found to aid VC syndication (Sorenson and Stuart, 2008). Moreover, among the various known forms of homophily, the tendency to form ties based on ethnic/racial background has been acknowledged to be the strongest (Miller et al., 2001). Cultural distance {{has been found to}} <b>raise</b> <b>barriers</b> to information sharing, trust, and accordingly increasing the transaction costs (Li et al., 2014).

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this {{contribution}} is money laundering in professional football. First, it is clarified why the professional football sector is so appealing to persons and organisations for laundering their criminally acquired assets. Then it is examined how these risks have materialised in practice, based on two cases. The first case relates to an ongoing investigation into financial mismanagement within the Dutch football club FC Twente. The focus of this case study is on third-party ownership of football players {{and the lack of}} knowledge about the origins of investments. The second case is based on thorough investigative journalism into money laundering activities in the top of English football. This case is centred on the financial adventures of Birmingham FC. In both cases we will not only highlight the malpractices that took place, but we will also look for starting points to <b>raise</b> <b>barriers</b> against financial misconduct and criminal practices...|$|E
40|$|Gas-fired {{power plants}} are {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} production of electricity, which in turn makes them a relevant part of the gas demand. In this paper, we investigate whether the current designs of gas and power markets are robust to the relatively new link between industries. Specifically, we study the cross-industry efficiency losses associated with designs aimed at increasing liquidity by limiting the amount of network services allocated through markets. In the short run, reducing the set of transmission services priced in one market (say gas) affects the use of transmission in the other market (say power). This may result in inefficiencies that should be accounted for when deciding on the network services to be allocated through market arrangements in each industry. We also identify long-term effects of such design strategies: the allocation of gas pipeline storage and transmission services without preference representation may weaken localization signals for power plants investment. In addition, lack of harmonization of market designs may <b>raise</b> <b>barriers</b> to network investment...|$|E
