2500|$|Substantial similarity, in US {{copyright}} law, is {{the standard}} used {{to determine whether a}} defendant has infringed the <b>reproduction</b> <b>right</b> of a copyright. The standard arises out of the recognition that the exclusive right to make copies of a work would be meaningless if copyright infringement were limited to making only exact and complete reproductions of a work. Many courts also use [...] "substantial similarity" [...] in place of [...] "probative" [...] or [...] "striking similarity" [...] to describe the level of similarity necessary to prove that copying has occurred. A number of tests have been devised by courts to determine substantial similarity. They may rely on expert or lay observation or both and may subjectively judge the feel of a work or critically analyze its elements.|$|E

5000|$|The first-sale {{defense is}} a common law {{principle}} derived from Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus (1908) and codified in Section 109(a) of the Copyright Act. The first-sale doctrine provides that a copyright owner [...] "exhausts his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution" [...] once {{he or she has}} sold the copyrighted item. In ReDigi, the court held that the first-sale defense did not apply to ReDigi because first-sale only affects the copyright holder's distribution right, not <b>reproduction</b> <b>right.</b> Since ReDigi was held to have violated Capitol's <b>reproduction</b> <b>right,</b> the court reasoned that the first-sale defense did not protect ReDigi from liability for unauthorized reproduction.|$|E

50|$|Fox {{contended that}} through Dish Anywhere {{the company has}} {{publicly}} performed Fox’s copyrighted programming by streaming over the Internet. The district court held that Dish Anywhere does not infringe Fox’s public performance right because the service can only be used by subscribers {{to get access to}} their own recordings. The recording and the later transmission depend on the subscribers to engage in a volitional action. Therefore, there is no direct infringement from Dish. Neither there is a secondary infringement of the company because Dish’s users do not publicly perform by using Dish Anywhere. Dish has license from Fox that allow it to transmit Fox’s programing to its subscribers. When a user transmits programing from one device to another, she access in a different device to a something that already is in her possession, this action is not a public performance within the meaning of the statue. The court ruled that PTAT and Hopper Transfers do not directly infringe Fox’s <b>reproduction</b> <b>right</b> because Dish does not engage in a volitional conduct. The recording is made in exclusive response to the user’s command. While Dish sets some parameters of the PTAT service, the service operates automatically upon user request. The setting of the parameters is not enough to consider that Dish engage in a volitional conduct. In the case of Hopper Transfers, Dish has even less control. Neither the court found distribution right infringement by the act to make available the programing, because there is not actual dissemination of the programing (the copy does not change of hands). Finally, the court rejected Dish’s secondary liability and held that PTAT and Hopper Transfers use by Dish’s subscribers is fair use according Sony. The district court referred to its prior decision and deemed again as too speculative the potential market harm alleged by Fox for the use of PTAT.Fox contended that AutoHop infringes on its <b>reproduction</b> <b>right</b> by skipping Fox’s own commercials. The district court held that AutoHop neither copies nor distributes anything, it just skips ads and therefore does not infringe Fox's copyright. Fox contended that QA copies infringe its <b>reproduction</b> <b>right.</b> Following its preliminary injunction decision analysis, the district court agreed with Fox. The district court pointed out that Fox would negotiate a licensing agreement or royalty payment for the right to copy Fox programming in any manner. Dish QA copies would impair Fox’s ability to monetize that use. Therefore, Dish was held liable for direct copyright infringement for the reproduction of the QA copies.|$|E

For each song reproduced or distributed, the infringement had to be assessed as willful or non-willful, and damages assessed accordingly. The jury was not allowed to be specific in its verdict about which rights (distribution or reproduction) were infringed, and the judge did not attempt to define distribution in the second trial.|$|E
