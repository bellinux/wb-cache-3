Although there is increasing interest in different biometric markers to support this entry-to-country process (including fingerprint scanning, <b>retina</b> <b>scanning,</b> iris recognition, finger geometry, voice recognition, DNA matching and gait analysis), the most prevalent means of identification is still from the verification of facial photo-ID.

There are many biometric characteristics by which one can have own identity like face recognition, fingerprint detection, iris inspection and <b>retina</b> <b>scanning</b> [2]. Voice reorganization and signature verification are the upcoming technologies for the human identity. Human signature can be handling as the image and can be recognized by using the computer vision and neural network. With the help of the modern technology there is possibility to develop such algorithm with help of which one can able to recognize and verify the human signature. This paper deals with the off-line signature recognition & verification using neural network in which the human signature is captured and presented in the image format to the system.

Jones et al. performed a survey of respondents to determine what, if any, technologies were familiar and acceptable to respondents as a potential authenticator [50]. They found that biometrics such as fingerprints were nearly as acceptable to users as passwords (67 % for fingerprints compared to 70 % for passwords), but that smart cards, other tokens and biometrics such as iris and <b>retina</b> <b>scans</b> were far less acceptable (32 %, 27 % and 44 %, respectively).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Authentication is any {{protocol}} {{or process}} that permits one entity {{to establish the}} identity of another entity. It relies on three factors: 1) Something a user knows, such as a password or PIN 2) Something a user has, such as a key, a card, or another kind of token 3) Something a user is, such as a <b>retina</b> <b>scan,</b> or fingerprint. We can increase the reliability and security of the authentication mechanism by combining multiple authentication factors into a single model. The two factors together provide a much higher confidence in the authentication. This paper reviews various two-factor authentication schemes...|$|R

Their applications in biomedical physics are mainly in the fields, where lasers are used for diagnostics or treatment, especially in opthalmology. In a number of applications, e. g. <b>retina</b> <b>scanning,</b> the imaging performance is limited by temporal aberration fluctuations. A fast Hartmann-Shack sensor in combination with an adaptive micro-mirror allows real-time correction of these aberrations. Hartmann-Shack sensors consist of a lenslet array, which splits the aperture of interest into a matrix of subapertures and an image detector in the focal plane. The wavefront is calculated from the lateral shifts of the focal spots. We present application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), which perform the required image acquisition and processing in the 1 kHz range. The presented ASIC’s detect the spots and their position and can substitute slow standard CCD camera-chips to allow real-time processing.
