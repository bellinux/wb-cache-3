25|$|A typical {{formulation}} for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion.|$|E
25|$|For {{large-scale}} {{preparation of}} mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process typically {{begins with the}} dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once emulsified, the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> are then added and vigorously mixed until completely hydrated and evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly {{as it can be}} absorbed. Though {{only a small part of}} the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation. These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small liquid volume, which can cause difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest phases of the production process. Though, as technology in the food industry advances, processing has been shortened drastically, allowing roughly 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Preparation {{involves}} {{combining the}} sugar, lemon juice, and soda water, dissolving the sugar, pouring the drink {{into a glass}} with finely-shaved or crushed ice and then adding the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients.</b> The drink is then stirred and may be garnished {{with a variety of}} fruits.|$|E

50|$|The paskha {{can either}} be cooked or {{uncooked}} (raw). Cooked paskha {{is made in the}} form of an egg custard, to which the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> are folded in. An uncooked paskha is made simply of the raw curd and the other ingredients mixed at room temperature. Since uncooked curd cannot be conserved for a long period of time, these paskhas are typically made smaller.|$|E
50|$|Many {{variations}} of this cake are made, {{but the basic}} recipe is to mix softened butter at room temperature with sugar; egg yolks are then added, and once combined, the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> are added: finely minced almonds, chocolate melted via bain-marie, and whipped egg whites. After baking, the cake has a thin hard shell covering a moist interior. It is usually covered with a light dusting of fine powdered sugar. It is sometimes made {{with a small amount}} of Strega or other liqueur.|$|E

We then show that the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredient,</b> namely, MCMC for calculating the integrand at each point in the path, may be seriously flawed, leading to wrong estimates of Bayes factors. We provide a new method of Path Sampling (with Small Change) that works much better than standard Path Sampling {{in the sense of}} estimating the Bayes factor better and choosing the correct model more often. When the more complex factor model is true, PS-SC is substantially more accurate. New MCMC diagnostics is provided for these problems in support of our conclusions and recommendations. Some of our ideas for diagnostics and improvement in computation through small changes should apply to other methods of computation of the Bayes factor for model selection.

50|$|Angel food cake {{requires}} {{egg whites}} whipped {{until they are}} stiff; cream of tartar {{is added to the}} mixture to stabilize the egg whites. <b>Remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> are gently folded into the egg white mixture. For this method of leavening to work well, it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat; cake flour is generally used because of its light texture. The softer wheat and the lack of fat causes angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste.|$|E
50|$|Slowing the {{set time}} of plaster of Paris {{products}} (most {{widely used in}} gypsum plaster wall work and artwork casting) is typically achieved by the simple introduction of almost any acid diluted into the mixing water.

50|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} the Sazerac is its method of preparation, which commonly involves two chilled old-fashioned glasses. The first glass is swirled with a wash of absinthe for its flavor and strong scent.

Various anisettes such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable.

50|$|The label {{states that}} Nutella {{does not need}} to be refrigerated. This is because the large {{quantity}} of sugar in the product acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. More specifically, the sugar acts as a preservative by binding the water in the product, which prevents the microorganisms from growing. In fact, refrigeration causes Nutella to harden because it contains fats from the hazelnuts. When nut fats are placed in cold temperatures they become too hard to spread. Hazelnuts contain almost 91 percent monounsaturated fat, which are known to be liquid at room temperature and solidify at refrigerator temperatures. Room temperature allow the product to have a smooth and spreadable consistency because the monounsaturated oils from the hazelnut are liquid at this state. In addition, the palm oil used in Nutella does not require refrigeration because it contains high amounts of saturated fat and resists becoming rancid. Therefore, Nutella can be stored at room temperature in the cabinet without going rancid before the Best Before date. The <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> in Nutella, such as cocoa, skimmed milk powder, soy lecithin, and vanillin also do not require refrigeration. Hence, Nutella {{does not need to}} be put in the refrigerator after opening.|$|E

5000|$|The meat-based raw {{materials}} used in the pudding are sourced from the producers who farm within a six-mile (10 km) radius of the factory at Timoleague whereas {{most of the other}} ingredients used (cereals, onions, casings) are sourced outside the immediate area. One of the cardinal features of this pudding is the cereal is soaked in fresh pig's blood the night before preparation of the pudding. The following morning, the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients</b> are minced together {{in a large bowl and}} blended into the blood mixture before being placed in the casings. Once filled, the puddings are boiled in water for 15 minutes. After boiling, the puddings are taken out and left to cool. [...] The pudding is brown in colour, is a long cylindrical sausage shape which forms naturally into rings and is made from fresh pigs' blood, pork trimming, cereal, fresh onions, seasonings, spices and natural casings. It comes in weights of between 750 and 1000 grams (1.7-2.2 lb). Due to the inclusion of fresh blood, the taste of the pudding can be described as very clean and rustic. The process of pre-soaking pig's blood in oatmeal is a continuation of the traditional west Cork method of combining blood and cereal in a pudding to give it its distinctive regional texture and taste.|$|E
50|$|Another use of Atropa baetica in {{the folk}} {{medicine}} of Morocco is {{as one of}} the constituent plants in a polyherbal, abortifacient preparation. This is employed by local Traditional birth attendants in the Rif and takes the form of an orally administered decoction of the following plant species (all of which are considered locally to be toxic and/or narcotic): Cannabis sativa, Atropa baetica, Nerium oleander, Ruta montana, Agave americana, and Drimia maritima. The decoction, drunk on an empty stomach, is reported to be effective in the termination of pregnancy at a stage of 2-3 months. The traditional medical practitioners who employ such herbal abortifacients stress that they are dangerous and have caused numerous fatalities. Agave americana is undoubtedly the least toxic of the plant ingredients, although it sometimes causes the condition Purpuric agave dermatitis and could thus be acknowledged to possess some irritant properties. Of the <b>remaining</b> <b>ingredients,</b> Ruta species cause photosensitivity and can be abortifacient in their own right, Nerium and Drimia (syn. Urginea) contain dangerous cardiac glycosides,Cannabis is a well-known and relatively non-toxic hallucinogen and Atropa, while also a hallucinogen, is better known as a poison. Even without taking into account complex drug interactions, such a 'cocktail' of dangerous plants could indeed prove fatal, not only to a fetus but also to the pregnant woman carrying it.|$|E
