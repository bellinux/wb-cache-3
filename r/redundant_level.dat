30|$|Similar {{to power}} rate control, the {{technique}} of transmit rate control is sometimes presented as a possible means to overcome the VANET scalability problem. When applying a higher transmit rate in the VANET, {{the capacity of the}} wireless communication channel is increased, which could (partly) resolve the channel congestion under high-density traffic circumstances. However, the downside of increasing the transmit rate is that at the receiver side, the SNR value of the message has to be higher for successful packet reception. Hence, the communication range of the nodes is decreased. At higher rates, the wireless link is also more sensitive to node mobility (see Section 4.6) since in that case, the PHY layer applies more sensitive modulation techniques and less <b>redundant</b> <b>levels</b> of error correcting coding. These effects can negatively influence VANET end-to-end performance. Identifying the appropriate balance in this rate control trade-off is a challenge.|$|R

30|$|Second, {{the method}} of node {{retransmission}} also affects delay. If the node transmit power is fixed, the data transmission reliability is fixed. At this time, some mechanism {{needs to be taken}} to ensure the data transmission meets the requirements of the application. The most commonly used measure are the following categories: (a) Retransmission mechanism [34]. The retransmission mechanism {{is one of the most}} important ways to guarantee the reliability of the network transmission. The principle of retransmission mechanism is once the data packet is sent, the sender uses some mechanism to determine whether the packet is successfully received by the receiver and, if successfully received by the receiver, send the next packet, otherwise retransmitting the current packet. In this method, the receiver sends an ACK to the sender after receiving the packet, which presents data packet was successfully received. The sender does not receive the expected ACK within a fixed time then resends the data packet. The above process continues until the receiver has successfully received the data packet or the number of retransmissions exceeds the maximum predetermined number of retransmissions [34]. The disadvantage of this method is sending of one data packet ends with the ACK signal received by the sender or the number of retransmissions exceeds the set threshold to abandon the sending of this packet. The waiting time between each transmission needs to be more than round-trip time (RTT). Thus, in a link with high packet error rates, multiple retransmission causing its network delay is large [34]. There are many more methods to improve this approach as in Ref. [30]. (b) Network coding techniques are an effective and reliable guarantee mechanism based on redundant coding [34]. In network coding techniques, the source node encodes the packets with some <b>redundant</b> <b>level.</b> The destination node decodes the packets to retrieve the original packets. Because the data sent by the source node is redundant, thus, even if some data is lost in the lossy nature of wireless channels, it will not affect the destination node correctly receiving the data. Network coding techniques have the advantage that the source node can send the data at once and the destination node can be received with high reliability and so, compared with retransmission mechanism, can reduce the delay. But the cost is that the nodes need to encode and decode and the data that is transmitted is redundant, resulting in higher computation and energy consumption for nodes. (c) Multiple transmission mechanism. This mechanism is generally used less and mainly used to protect the safety of data transmission. In this method, the data packets are sent through multiple paths at the same time. As long as any one path successfully reaches the destination, the data transmission is successful [61]. The advantage of this approach is that the delay is small, whereas the disadvantage is that the energy consumption of the network is high.|$|E

The {{characters of}} nitrate reductase-deficiency and nitrate tolerant nodulation in pea (Pisum sativum L.) were combined crossing the nitrate reductase-deficient A 317 and A 334 with the supemodulating nod 3 mutant. Filial generations were screened for the extent of nodulation and nitrate reductase activity or for leaf necrosis in the presence of rhizospheric nitrate. Conditions for assaying in vivo leaf nitrate reductase activity of pea were optimised with respect to environmental and plant factors as well as the composition of the incubation medium. The character of nitrate reductase (NR) deficiency was shown to be an incompletely recessive feature, with a locus located on a chromosome separate to that of the supernodulating gene and thus inherited independently. The development of necrosis on leaves of the NR-deficient A 317 supplied nitrate was shown to be a reliable method of screening for this mutant, particularly at lower photosynthetic photon flux densities. However, the double mutant A 317 -nod 3 developed only slight necrosis. Nitrate uptake by the NR-deficient mutants equalled that of its wild-type parent. While specific NR activity in the mutant A 317 was only 5 % that of the wild-type, it nevertheless reduced 68 % of the nitrate absorbed over a 7 -day period, compared to 83 % {{in the case of the}} wild-type. Nitrate reductase would thus appear to be present in <b>redundant</b> <b>levels</b> in the wild-type. Short-term (2 days) alleviation of nitrate inhibition of nitrogenase activity in the NR-deficient A 317 was confirmed. A positive and significant correlation was found between nitrate reduction and the extent to which nitrogenase activity was inhibited during the first four days of nitrate treatment. No correlations were found between either nodule starch levels or photosynthetic rate and nitrogenase activity. A combination of the NR deficiency and supernodulating characters did not result in symbioses that were tolerant to nitrate, although such double mutants were less likely to exhibit necrosis in the presence of nitrate. Ammonium nitrate was found to be more inhibitory of nitrogenase activity than nitrate alone. These results are consistent with a product feedback mechanism for the inhibitory effects of nitrate on nitrogenase activity. Selection for mutants deficient in nitrate uptake rather than nitrate reduction would thus appear to be a superior strategy for creating a legulne-rhizobia symbiosis that is insensitive to nitrate...|$|R

Considering multiple-bit quantization before digital transmission, we develop maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) with both known and unknown channel state information (CSI).

It implicitly uses the training symbols to estimate the channel coefficients and exploits the estimated CSI in an optimal way. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose suboptimal estimators. These estimators exploit both signal and data <b>level</b> <b>redundant</b> information to improve the estimation performance. The proposed MLEs reduce to traditional fusion based or diversity based estimators when communications or observations are perfect. By introducing a general message function, the proposed estimators can be applied when various analog or digital transmission schemes are used. The simulations show that the estimators using digital communications with multiple-bit quantization outperform the estimator using analog-and-forwarding transmission in fading channels.

The last train to use the station was in February 1968, a tracklifting train hauled by a Class 33 diesel locomotive. As the footbridge at the low-level platforms had been demolished in Summer 1965, passengers used the high level station as a short-cut between platforms, thereby avoiding the need to go around a local housing estate.

30|$|Due to the {{heterogeneity}} of covariates that are spatially correlated, but unknown, or only insufficiently available, {{in many cases the}} response data are autocorrelated. Haining et al. ([2009]) presented a simple conditional autoregressive model to deal with autocorrelated count data which results in the estimation of spatially correlated random effects. Fahrmeir and Echavarrı ([2006]) introduce an extensive methodology using structured additive regression models STAR for overdispersed and zero-inflated count data. These models make it possible to model non-linear covariate effects, individual or cluster-specific uncorrelated random effects, spatially correlated random effects or 2 -dimensional spatial trend surfaces simultaneously. The methodology employed in our investigation (Wood [2006]) offers similar technical possibilities for the Poisson and negative binomial distributions and, in combination with Rigby and Stasinopoulos’s ([2005]) methods, for the zero-inflated Poisson distribution. The inventory plots are located exactly via coordinates, and hence a 2 -dimensional spatial trend function is fitted instead of spatially correlated random effects for distinct areas. The observations at the 4 subplots were aggregated due to their proximity, which makes the estimation of uncorrelated random effects at the plot <b>level</b> <b>redundant.</b> Overall, the approach adopted combines an appropriate distribution assumption for count data with non-linear effects of causal covariates and an advanced method for covering spatial autocorrelation.|$|R

It is far too expensive to develop a single system with such high reliability. Using three redundant units would require only that each have a failure probability of one in ten over the mission. Since the system development cost is inverse to the failure probability, this would cut cost {{by a factor of}} one hundred. Using replaceable subsystems instead of full systems would further cut cost. Using full sets of replaceable components improves reliability more than using complete systems as spares, since a set of components could repair many different failures instead of just one. Replaceable components would require more tools, space, and planning than full systems or replaceable subsystems. However, identical system redundancy cannot be relied on in practice. Common cause failures can disable all the identical <b>redundant</b> systems. Typical <b>levels</b> of common cause failures will defeat redundancy greater than two.

In the studies reported here, we have examined the role of the sexual differentiation genes transformer (tra) and doublesex (dsx) in regulating the activity of the somatic signaling pathway. We asked whether ectopic somatic expression of the female products of the tra and dsx genes could feminize the germline of XY animals. We find that Tra(F) is sufficient to feminize XY germ cells, shutting off the expression of male-specific markers and activating the expression of female-specific markers. Feminization of the germline depends upon the constitutively expressed transformer- 2 (tra- 2) gene, but does not seem to require a functional dsx gene. However, feminization of XY germ cells by Tra(F) can be blocked by the male form of the Dsx protein (Dsx(M)). Expression of the female form of dsx, Dsx(F), in XY animals also induced germline expression of female markers. Taken together with a previous analysis of the effects of mutations in tra, tra- 2, and dsx on the feminization of XX germ cells in XX animals, our findings indicate that the somatic signaling pathway is <b>redundant</b> at the <b>level</b> tra and dsx.

40|$|In {{difficult}} listening situations, e. g. in {{a cocktail}} party scenario, speech signal that a listener is interested in decoding is often masked by unwanted noise, disrupting bottom-up signalling. A normal hearing (NH) listener is able to withstand {{a reasonable amount of}} such disruption and can still achieve good speech perception. This is possible partially because the information encoded in human speech is <b>redundant</b> at various <b>levels</b> like phonetic, morphemic, sentential, discourse, etc. In addition, NH listeners employ various cognitive mechanisms to reconstruct the lost information from disrupted speech signal. Some of these mechanisms are: application of the knowledge of the speaker’s language and its grammatical conventions, expectation formulated {{on the basis of the}} information collected previously in the discourse, tracking the auditory information within the speech stream, etc. As a result, (i) some loss of information can be tolerated without loss of meaning, and (ii) some information can be reconstructed on the basis of the leftover information. A cochlear implant (CI) is an implantable electronic device that partially reconstructs hearing for individuals with profound or total sensorineural hearing loss. CI users have greater difficulty in understanding speech than NH listeners in challenging listening scenarios where target speech signals are disrupted, e. g. with multiple individuals talking simultaneously or in noisy surroundings. This thesis explores if various factors inherent to the signal, and deficits of hearing impairment and/or characteristic of CI signal transmission may be at least partially responsible for the CI users having reduced ability of understanding speech in difficult listening scenarios. I conclude in the thesis that CI users can effectively use top-down restoration mechanisms but the nature and/or extent of the working of these mechanisms may be different in CI users than in NH listeners due to certain factors that may themselves vary among the CI users...|$|R

Furthermore, how the existence of these counties affect the Danish political structure (statsopbygning). The motivation behind this investigation is the 2007 political reform (Strukturreformen), which changed the political structure. The reform entailed that 13 counties (amter) got reduced to five. Hence, the division of labour between the state-, regional- and municipality level changed. The result is that the counties are left with healthcare as their primary responsibility. In 2009 the county of Midtjylland decided to place a new hospital near Gødstrup, this decision caused political turmoil and became a nationwide issue, when the then Government and their supporting party, Danish Peoples Party (Dansk Folkeparti), included the hospital {{as a part of the}} negotiations of the Finance Bill; a decision that clearly is within the jurisdiction of the counties. This questions {{the legitimacy of}} the counties and is the motivation for this project. Additionally this points to the significance of this particular political level, being a part of the Danish political structure. Firstly, the input- and output legitimacy of the counties is analysed with David Eastons theory on political systems as a starting point. Secondly, the counties’ position in the political structure is analysed, applying Jean-Jaques Rousseau and James Madison and their notions on the considerations and principles behind political structure respectively. Lastly, the difficult position alongside the possible future of the counties is discussed and reflected upon. The project concludes that the counties, in their current form, are more or less <b>redundant</b> as a <b>level</b> in the Danish political structure. This denotes that the counties either should be broaden in the sense of more responsibility or be decommissioned. At the current moment we find that the national politicians highly disagrees upon the existence of the counties.

On the other hand, merely taking advantage of the sampled spectrum of individual HSI data point may produce inaccurate results due to the mixed nature of raw HSI data, such as mixed pixels, optical interferences and etc. Fusion strategies are widely adopted in data processing to achieve better performance, especially in the field of classification and clustering. There are mainly three types of fusion strategies, namely low-level data fusion, intermediate-level feature fusion, and high-level decision fusion. Low-level data fusion combines multi-source data that is expected to be complementary or cooperative. Intermediate-level feature fusion aims at selection and combination of features to remove <b>redundant</b> information. Decision <b>level</b> fusion exploits a set of classifiers to provide more accurate results. The fusion strategies have wide applications including HSI data processing. With the fast development of multiple remote sensing modalities, e. g. Very High Resolution (VHR) optical sensors, LiDAR, etc., fusion of multi-source data can in principal produce more detailed information than each single source. On the other hand, besides the abundant spectral information contained in HSI data, features such as texture and shape may be employed to represent data points from a spatial perspective. Furthermore, feature fusion also includes the strategy of removing redundant and noisy features in the dataset. One of the major problems in machine learning and pattern recognition is to develop appropriate representations for complex nonlinear data. In HSI processing, a particular data point is usually described as a vector with coordinates corresponding to the intensities measured in the spectral bands. This vector representation permits the application of linear and nonlinear transformations with linear algebra to find an alternative representation of the data. More generally, HSI is multi-dimensional in nature and the vector representation may lose the contextual correlations. Tensor representation provides a more sophisticated modeling technique and a higher-order generalization to linear subspace analysis. In graph theory, data points can be generalized as nodes with connectivities measured from the proximity of a local neighborhood. The graph-based framework efficiently characterizes the relationships among the data and allows for convenient mathematical manipulation in many applications, such as data clustering, feature extraction, feature selection and data alignment. In this thesis, graph-based approaches applied in the field of multi-source feature and data fusion in remote sensing area are explored. We will mainly investigate the fusion of spatial, spectral and LiDAR information with linear and multilinear algebra under graph-based framework for data clustering and classification problems...|$|R
40|$|The most densely {{populated}} and economical most valuable areas in The Netherlands lie below mean sea level. These areas are protected against the sea by a coastal dune system. The vital {{importance of this}} dune system {{is reflected in the}} extensive collection of Dutch legal regulations that ensure the safety level of the dunes. Current safety assessment method for dunes, prescribed by these regulations, is based on conducting large numbers (thousands) of simulations to estimate dune erosion at individual locations along the Dutch coast. With the use of more complex dune-erosion models (i. e. Xbeach; Roelvink et al. (2009)) in the safety assessment, the method gets computationally more intensive. This means that conducting large numbers of simulations for a dune safety assessment are not feasible. Therefore new probabilistic approaches (e. g., Bayesian approach) are needed in order to apply state-of-the-art insights and models for dune erosion in a safety assessment. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain an insight in the applicability of the Bayesian network approach for dune safety assessment against extreme storm events on the Dutch coast. First a database was generated that serves as input to the Bayesian network. The content of this database is obtained in a way similar to current assessment method. This means, data-sources (wave conditions, bottom profiles) and the dune-erosion model (duros+; Vellinga (1986), van Gent et al. (2008)) to simulate the dune erosion process were equal. Qualitatively the Bayesian network is represented by nodes (variables) and arrows (relations). Variables and relations were selected such, they were physically related to the dune erosion process and could be obtained out of the database. Quantitatively the Bayesian network is described by a conditional probability table defined by a expectation-maximization training algorithm. For this training process, cases (a case is a record in the database and represents a storm event) out of the dataset were selected. Sensitivity analysis of the required number of training data, as well the determining variable of this Bayesian network were made. Results show the Bayesian network is capable of reproducing the dune erosion process (given this set of data) for 89 %. The loss in skill is a consequence of the discretization of the variables in the Bayesian network. The number of training-cases needed to make reliable predictions that are more accurate then predictions made with the use of the prior probability, is approximately 5, 000 cases. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicates water level information is a determining term regarding the prediction skill. However, when other hydraulic conditions (wave height, peak period) were known the water <b>level</b> was <b>redundant.</b> Indicating water <b>level</b> information is captured by the variables wave height and/or peak period. Dune erosion volumes predictions for locations at the Holland coast, shows a high amount of uncertainty and results in unreliable predictions (negative log-likelihood ratio) when using a Bayesian network trained on cases representing the Wadden coast. Indicating coastal features between both coastal regions are too diverse. Furthermore, a Bayesian network is a useful tool to improve insight into data. Expected relations between variables can be investigated and visualized in the Bayesian network immediately. Coastal EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
