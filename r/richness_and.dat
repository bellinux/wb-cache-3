5|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa <b>Richness</b> <b>and</b> the EPT Taxa Richness are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa {{observed}} in a sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity Index value ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic <b>richness</b> <b>and</b> evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96.|$|E

40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} the relative explanatory power of source faunas and geographical variables for butterfly incidence, frequency, <b>richness,</b> rarity, <b>and</b> endemicity on offshore islands. Location The western Italian offshore islands (Italy and Malta). Methods Thirty-one islands were examined. Data {{were taken from}} our own field surveys and from the literature. Two approaches were undertaken, described as island-focused and species-focused, respectively. Offshore islands were allocated to their neighbouring source landmasses (Italian Peninsula, Sicily and Sardinia - Corsica) and compared {{with each other for}} faunal attributes, source and island geography. Generalized linear and stepwise multiple regression models were then used to determine the relationships of island species <b>richness,</b> rarity <b>and</b> endemicity with potential geographical predictors <b>and</b> source <b>richness,</b> rarity, <b>and</b> endemicity (island-focused). Species frequency and incidence were assessed in relation to geographical and source predictors using stepwise linear and logistic regression, and inter-island associations were examined using K-Means clustering and non-metric scaling (species-focused). Results The analysis reveals firm evidence for the influence of the nearest large landmass sources on island species assemblages, <b>richness,</b> rarity <b>and</b> endemicity. A clear distinction in faunal affinities occurs between the Sardinian islands and islands lying offshore from the Italian mainland and Sicily. Islands neighbouring these three distinct sources differ significantly in <b>richness,</b> rarity <b>and</b> endemicity. Source <b>richness,</b> rarity, <b>and</b> endemicity have explanatory power for island <b>richness,</b> rarity, <b>and</b> endemicity, respectively, and together with island geography account for a substantial part of the variation in island faunas (richness 59...|$|R

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are highly sensitive to pollution and readily accumulate {{high levels of}} mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position {{at the top of}} the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use.

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was Pomerania. It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural <b>richness</b> <b>and</b> diversity. Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as Wolin, Pyrzyce or Szczecin. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the Velunzani ("Uelunzani") and Pyritzans ("Prissani") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite {{the high level of}} economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies, except for the Wolin city-state.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the biophysical factors controlling invertebrate communities on rocky intertidal areas in Batemans Marine Park, NSW. The biophysical factors of wave aspect, wave exposure, rock type and sub habitat diversity, and Marine Park zoning, affect invertebrate species <b>richness,</b> abundance <b>and</b> diversity in a hierarchical manner. The biophysical factors influence biological processes such as recruitment and settlement, and physical stressors such as thermal stress and sun exposure, which affect invertebrate species <b>richness,</b> abundance <b>and</b> diversity on rocky intertidal areas. Rocky intertidal areas are exposed {{to a range of}} anthropogenic pressures, such as urban development and recreational and commercial activities. As these anthropogenic pressures increase, the need to protect <b>and</b> conserve species <b>richness,</b> abundance <b>and</b> diversity on rocky intertidal areas increases. Understanding the drivers of species <b>richness,</b> abundance <b>and</b> diversity on rocky intertidal areas provides a scientific basis for the conservation and management of rocky intertidal areas. This study characterised the biophysical factors of wave aspect, wave exposure, rock type and sub habitat diversity on rocky intertidal areas across Batemans Marine Park. Invertebrate species <b>richness,</b> abundance, <b>and</b> diversity were analysed in relation to wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity. Non-liner mixed effects modelling was used to investigate species <b>richness,</b> species diversity <b>and</b> the abundance of Austrolittorina unifasciata, Nerita atramentosa, Tesseropora rosea, Morula marginalba and Bembicium nanum in relation to wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to investigate species abundance in relation to wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity. The key findings of the analyses of species <b>richness,</b> abundance <b>and</b> diversity in relation to the biophysical factors of wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity showed the hierarchical link between invertebrate communities and biophysical factors. Wave aspect influenced species <b>richness,</b> diversity, abundance, <b>and</b> the abundance of A. unifasciata, N. atramentosa, T. rosea, M. marginalba and B. nanum directly; and indirectly through the interaction between wave aspect and wave exposure, and wave aspect and sub habitat diversity. Sub habitat diversity was significantly related to species <b>richness,</b> diversity <b>and</b> abundance of A. unifasciata, N. atramentosa, T. rosea, M. marginalba and B. nanum independently of wave aspect and wave exposure. The relationship between invertebrate communities and sub habitat diversity demonstrates that a diverse range of sub habitats enables a wide range of invertebrates to inhabit rocky intertidal areas.

Species richness peaks at around 40Â° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean.

5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species <b>richness</b> <b>and</b> geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species <b>richness</b> <b>and</b> {{diversity}} across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006â€“2007.

A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased.

5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species <b>richness</b> <b>and</b> endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E

5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-LÃ©ognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly FumÃ©, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of <b>richness</b> <b>and</b> complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality.
