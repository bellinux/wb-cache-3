Instead, the Apache project published a workaround for users, leaving the vulnerability in the download. Former PMC chair Andrea Pescetti volunteered as <b>release</b> <b>manager</b> in July 2015 and version 4.1.2 was released in October 2015.|$|E

40|$|Version control {{branching}} allows {{an organization}} to parallelize its development efforts. Releasing a software system developed {{in this manner}} requires <b>release</b> <b>managers,</b> and other project stakeholders, {{to make decisions about}} how to integrate the branched work. This group decision-making process becomes very complex in the case of large-scale parallel development. To better understand the information needs of <b>release</b> <b>managers</b> in this context, we conducted an interview study at a large software company. Our analysis of the interviews provides a view into how <b>release</b> <b>managers</b> make integration decisions, organized around ten key factors. Based on these factors, we discuss specific information needs for <b>release</b> <b>managers</b> and how the needs can be met in future work.

30|$|Michlmayr et al. [50, 52] {{argue that}} a set of clear {{policies}} and deadlines, which are followed and enforced, helps build trust in complex FOSS projects. Hence, {{it is important to}} follow and enforce policies and deadlines, otherwise the effect may be the opposite: the loss of trust {{in the work of the}} <b>release</b> <b>managers.</b> As an example of such enforcement, according to Michlmayr [52], <b>release</b> <b>managers</b> can proactively omit or postpone unfinished features.|$|R

500|$|Some events {{disturbed}} {{the project}} {{while working on}} Sarge, as Debian servers were attacked by fire and hackers. One {{of the most memorable}} was the Vancouver prospectus. After a meeting held in Vancouver, <b>release</b> <b>manager</b> Steve Langasek announced a plan {{to reduce the number of}} supported ports to four in order to shorten future release cycles. There was a large reaction because the proposal looked more like a decision and because such a drop would damage Debian's aim to be [...] "the universal operating system".|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam's {{contract}} with Epic Records had ended in 2003, but {{the band was}} not ready to release an album without label backing. Independent label Epitaph Records was considered, but the band wanted a company that would guarantee a wide <b>release.</b> <b>Manager</b> Kelly Curtis signed a one-record deal with J Records - which ironically during production became, like Epic, a subsidiary of Sony Music after said company merged with J's parent company BMG. J had approached Pearl Jam as early as 2001, and had its first experiments with the band issuing the live album Live at Benaroya Hall in 2004. Vedder said J was picked as they searched for [...] "somebody who'll allow us to be who we are and respects how we do things" [...] and contributed with the [...] "facilitation of getting the music out there". Gossard added the label did not input any time or creative constraints upon the band - [...] " [...] We didn't play them much music until it was basically done, and they were pleased. They weren't expecting us to do something that was unnatural for us." ...|$|E

30|$|From our {{analysis}} and interviews, we identified {{the four major}} challenges that <b>release</b> <b>managers</b> face in the GNOME ecosystem, they: (1) need to coordinate projects and teams of volunteers without direct power over them (2) keep the build process manageable (3) monitor for unplanned changes, and (4) test the GNOME release.|$|R
