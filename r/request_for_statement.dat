5000|$|Most U.S. states {{prohibit}} plaintiffs from {{demanding a}} specific {{amount of money}} in the [...] section of a complaint initiating a civil action for personal injury or wrongful death. This is to prevent unethical attorneys from gaining undue publicity for their cases (and prejudicing the due process rights of defendants) by demanding outrageous amounts that they cannot possibly prove at trial. This is why such complaints simply demand [...] "pecuniary loss" [...] or [...] "monetary damages in an amount according to proof." [...] Of course, at some point the defendant needs to get some idea of what amount of money the plaintiff actually wants, so the defendant can usually serve interrogatories directed to that issue or a formal <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>statement</b> of damages as part of the discovery process.|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{research}} development in recent years, backchannel responses have been {{expanded to include}} sentence completions, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification, brief <b>statements,</b> and non-verbal responses and now fall into three categories: non-lexical, phrasal, and substantive. A non-lexical backchannel is a vocalized sound that {{has little or no}} referential meaning but still verbalizes the listener's attention. In English, sounds like [...] "uh-huh" [...] and [...] "hmm" [...] serve this role. Phrasal backchannels most commonly assess or acknowledge a speaker's communication with simple words or phrases (for example, [...] "Really?" [...] or [...] "Wow!" [...] in English). Substantive backchannels consist of more substantial turn-taking by the listener and usually manifest as asking for clarification or repetitions.|$|R

However, his unfocused style {{for the rest of}} the debate (including asking the moderator to repeat one question because he didn't have his hearing aid turned on) made him appear confused and almost disoriented. An unflattering recreation of the moment on Saturday Night Live later that week, with Phil Hartman as Stockdale, cemented a public perception of Stockdale as slow-witted. He was also often parodied for his repeated use of the term [...] "gridlock" [...] to describe slow governmental policy.|$|R

In This study, the writer will discuss the meaning of particles in a conventional implicature in three local languages, namely Javanese, Betawi, and Banjarese. This research is a type qualitative descriptive research. The method used is observation method by recording technique, and literature review. Data were analyzed by using relevance theory that proposed by Sperber and Wilson. The results showed that the category of particles in Javanese, Betawi and Banjarese indicate some implicatures in the context of the sentence that are being analyzed. Some of these implicature is an expression of pique, affirmation, surprise, pride, admiration, disappointment, regret, distrust, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> follow the <b>statements,</b> convincing, and expression of the blaming. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} utilises the {{quantitative}} methodology research approach to achieve two objectives. These include; firstly, {{to identify the}} main acceptance banking services at Tafila governorate, and secondly, to identify {{the nature of the}} relationship between the cost of different banking services and their acceptance by customers. The results revealed that the most five accepted services include; ATM withdrawal service, balance checking using ATM, counter deposit service, fund transferring using counter, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> account <b>statement</b> using ATM respectively. When banking services taken as categories, the result reveal that the traditional-counter banking services still occupied the first place among the customer of commercial banks located at Tafila region. These results indicate that customers of such region still give a big deal to the security and give no trust to the electronic tools to perform such services. In respect to the effect of costs of the three main banking services (i. e. e-banking services, traditional-counter banking services and lending services) and their acceptance by customers. The results indicate that the cost of each category of services does contribute significantly toward the acceptance of such category of services. This unexpected result was justified based on many factors such as the financial behaviour of customers and their income level...|$|R
40|$|This case {{involved}} [Sir Gareth, Sir Tristan, Sir Bedivere, Sir Gawain, Sir Caradoc, and Sir Percival], {{a group of}} suitemates who entered into a prank war that culminated in an incident involving a hidden noisemaker, and the incident’s impact {{on one of the}} students, Sir Gareth. The noisemaker periodically made horrormovie inspired noises, including whispering “Can you hear me?” Sir Gareth has unilateral hearing loss, which exacerbated the negative impact that the noisemaker had on him. Throughout the trial, Sir Gareth emphasized the profound impact that the noisemaker had had on his physical and mental wellbeing. The initial confrontation occurred {{at the beginning of the}} fall semester. Sir Gareth confronted his suitemates upon learning that the noises he had been hearing in his room had been caused by a noisemaker. He explained the extent to which the noises had affected his wellbeing and how upset he was. However, he felt this discussion was not enough because while his friends seemed to feel bad and they apologized to him, they did not seem to take responsibility for whatthey had done. Therefore, he decided to bring the case to Honor Council. Well over a month passed between Honor Council receiving the statements and the convening of the Joint StudentAdministrative Panel (Joint Panel). Both the confronting and confronted parties found the time between the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>statements</b> and the beginning of the Joint Panel incredibly stressful. The confronting party asked Council to let the members of the confronted party know that he did not want to discuss with them his decision to involve Council, as he did not yet feel ready for another dialogue with them. Unfortunately, because of complications explained below, it took over a month for the trial to begin. The parties were heavily involved on campus in related activities, so attempting to avoid each other significantly affected their lives and ultimately proved impossible. Additional tension throughout the trial process came from the fact that several of the parties had been involved in an incident culminating in a physical altercation as a result of the case being brought to Honor Council. This incident was adjudicated outside of the Honor Council proceeding. In addition, the parties were part of a shared larger social circle on campus. Each party repeatedly blamed the other for breaking confidentiality to mutual friends. All of these conflicts greatly impacted the parties’ relationships with each other, and constituted relevant circumstantial information, but were beyond the direct scope of this Joint Panel...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of a form of international accounting standard {{has been well documented}} over the past twenty years. In the area of research the predominant focus has been on the measurement of the degree of harmonisation between countries. This research, whilst qualitative in nature, has, in the main, relied on a quantitative assessment of accounting practices in the countries being reviewed. In doing this, reliance has been placed on surveys, questionnaires and reviews of financial statements. Each has its own set of problems. This is all illustrated and highlighted in the literature survey where argument and counter argument is evident over twenty years. In all this, little has been done to review the foundation from which the data is extracted and it is argued that the very aspect of a qualitative work has been ignored completely in favour of the more high profile quantitative research. The research sets out to investigate whether, in point of fact, {{there is a need to}} undertake a more searching and detailed examination of accounting practices in each country before any attempt is made of a measurement study or a classification study. Clearly the answer is that this must be done as only in so doing can the playing field be levelled and can the very basis for measurement or classification be fully understood in advance. It was necessary to undertake a full sampling of groups of companies in the three member states and to draw the smaller sample from those final lists. This was to prevent any aspect of bias being present and to ensure that only random sampling was undertaken in the final selection.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the accounting and reporting practices of professional and honorary societies that are tax exempt under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, the study is intended to improve the form and content of information flowing to interested groups that use the economic and financial data of these organizations. ^ There are two distinct stages to the study. Stage one is normative and conceptual in nature since it seeks to ascertain which accounting and reporting practices can best be used by professional and honorary societies. This stage is necessitated by the lack of promulgated standards and practices for professional and honorary societies. The second stage of the research consists of utilizing the information gathered in the first stage. ^ Information obtained in the first stage emanates from two sources. Literature pertaining to the nonprofit sector provides one source of information, and it is reviewed to determine the current state of nonprofit accounting. A second source of information is provided through the collection, description, and evaluation of empirical data obtained from professional and honorary societies. A questionnaire and a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> financial <b>statements</b> were mailed to 170 different societies. ^ Analysis of the gathered information revealed inconsistencies in the application of accounting principles among, and within, these organizations. Analysis also found confusion on the part of professional and honorary societies in meeting compliance requirements of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ Information gathered in stage one provides a foundation {{for the development of a}} model of accounting and reporting practices appropriate for professional and honorary societies. Recommendations relative to the accounting systems of these organizations, the compliance requirements that they must meet, and model financial <b>statements</b> <b>for</b> both national organizations and local chapters are presented. ^ Although developed specifically for professional and honorary societies that are tax exempt as 501 (c) (3) organizations, other nonprofit entities (especially social fraternities and sororities) with similar organizational structures should find the model a beneficial guide in formulating practices that are appropriate for their specific needs. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{data set}} that records banks’ ongoing {{requests}} {{of information from}} small commercial borrowers, we examine when banks use financial statements to monitor borrowers after loan origination. We find that banks <b>request</b> financial <b>statements</b> <b>for</b> half the loans and this variation is related to borrower credit risk, relationship length, collateral, {{and the provision of}} business tax returns, but in complex ways. The relation between borrower risk and financial statement requests has an inverted U-shape; and tax returns can be both substitutes and complements to financial statements, conditional on borrower characteristics and the degree of bank–borrower information asymmetry. Frequent financial reporting is used to monitor collateral, but only for non–real estate loans and only when the collateral is easily accessible to lenders. Collectively, our results provide novel evidence of a fundamental information demand for financial reporting in monitoring small commercial borrowers and a specific channel through which banks fulfill their role as delegated monitors...|$|R

According to recent research in Turkiye % 56 of 1470 internet users with avarege age 23, has indicated they become victims of cyberbullying {{at least once in}} their lifetime. The results have shown that the issue of cyberbullying should be considered as a problem that should be investigated. In this study, cyberbullying scale had been given to the university students aged between 18 - 29. Also, Spielberger's Trait Anger&Anger Styles Scale and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale had been given {{to examine the relationship between}} cyberbullying and aggression and social anxiety. Social anxiety and avoidance scores were significantly different between genders. The correlations between 10 indexes of cyberbullying behaviors and social anxiety scores together with anger (trait anger, anger-in, anger-out and anger control) scores were analyzed. Correlations were found between sending rude, vulgar or threating messages and anger-in scores, creating fake profile or web page statement and social anxiety, social avoidance, trait-anger and anger-out scores respectively, publishing photographs or videos of someone without consent and anger-in scores, sending online <b>request</b> <b>for</b> sexual relation <b>statement</b> and anger-out and anger control scores, hacking someone's web profile statement and anger-out and anger control scores, publishing fake statues or check-in notifications and anger-in and anger-out scores...|$|R
