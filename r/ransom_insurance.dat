40|$|The {{transportation}} of oil {{represents one of}} the most strategically important movements of energy resources in the global economy (Rodrigue, 2004). However, shipping of crude oil between the Middle East and Europe and between the Middle East and the USA is moving through some of the world’s most pirate-infested waters, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean being the most significant. This research project presents a study on the effect on operational cost of Somali piracy on crude oil shipping. The study quantifies the direct operational cost for owners, charterers and cargo owners. This includes <b>ransoms,</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums, security measures and rerouting of vessels. Creating an understanding of the operational impact that Somali piracy has on ship owners, charterers and cargo owners in the crude oil market is important for several reasons. • The global economy is highly dependent on oil (Green et. al., 2002). • The oil price and oil consumption are highly correlated with economic growth (Lee & Chiu. 2011) • Transport time has a significant impact when an oil importer selects export markets (Rodrigue, 2004). The operational cost of Somali piracy in this vital corridor for crude oil is thus important considerations when shaping government policies. For stakeholders such as oil companies, ship owners, cargo owners, and energy companies the quantification of the piracy-triggered cost is important in order to formulate appropriate strategies and operational practices (Fu et. al., 2010). The study area has been limited to crude oil shipping from the Middle East Gulf to Europe and to USA. The broader Middle East {{is the single most important}} oilproducing region in the world, while Europe and USA are major exporters and consumers (Rodrigue, 2004). IMO and IMB data have been thoroughly examined and sorted to establish a valid data sample of ship movements. Fixtures on the relevant route have also been thoroughly examined to establish commercial practices that can be relevant to include. Qualitative interviews with ship owners and charterers have been conducted and analysed. 5 This paper suggests that the piracy-triggered increase in direct economic cost to ship owners, charterers and cargo owners is significant. However it is hard to find an absolute quantification. Plymouth Business Schoo...|$|R

Because of the extremely high rate of kidnappings in Mexico City for ransoms, wealthy businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) hires Creasy through Rayburn to guard his nine-year-old daughter [...] "Pita" [...] (Dakota Fanning). However, Samuel is having money problems and intends to keep Creasy on {{only long enough to}} satisfy the requirements to renew his kidnap and <b>ransom</b> <b>insurance</b> on Pita. Creasy suffers from alcoholism, depression and severe guilt {{as a result of his}} former black ops work. Drinking heavily, Creasy attempts suicide with his pistol, but the cartridge fails to fire when he pulls the trigger. He calls Rayburn, who says that [...] "a bullet always tells the truth." [...] At first, Creasy distances himself from Pita, but soon he becomes a surrogate father to the girl, allowing him to stop drinking and find a purpose in his life.|$|E
