2500|$|High <b>rupturing</b> <b>capacity</b> fuses can {{be rated}} to safely {{interrupt}} up to 300,000 amperes at 600 V AC. [...] Special current-limiting fuses are applied ahead of some molded-case breakers {{to protect the}} breakers in low-voltage power circuits with high short-circuit levels.|$|E
50|$|Arcing {{is a risk}} in DC ELV systems, {{and some}} fuse types which can cause {{undesired}} arcing include semi-enclosed, rewireable and automotive fuse types. Instead high <b>rupturing</b> <b>capacity</b> fuses and appropriately rated circuit breakers are the recommended type for RAPS. Cable termination and connections must be done properly to avoid arcing also, and soldering is not recommended.|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} of any electrical installation {{is one of}} the most important considerations in the field of electrical engineering. The electrical installation should be protected against hazards such as overload current and short circuit current conditions. The protection devices studied in this paper are the Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) and the High <b>Rupturing</b> <b>Capacity</b> (HRC) Fuse. Using a new tool known as the 3 -AND Convergence Classifier, it was observed that the MCB is the most reliable in terms of offering protection against the damage caused by overload currents and the destruction caused by short circuit currents...|$|E
2500|$|Good quality {{multimeters}} {{designed to}} meet CAT II and above standards include High <b>Rupture</b> <b>Capacity</b> ceramic fuses typically rated at more than 20kA capacity; [...] these are {{much less likely to}} fail explosively than more common glass fuses [...] [...] They will also include high energy overvoltage MOV (Metal Oxide Varistor) protection, and circuit over-current protection {{in the form of a}} Polyswitch.|$|R
2500|$|The {{breaking}} capacity is the maximum current that can safely be {{interrupted by the}} fuse. [...] This should be higher than the prospective short-circuit current. Miniature fuses may have an interrupting rating only 10 times their rated current. Some fuses are designated High <b>Rupture</b> <b>Capacity</b> (HRC) and are usually filled with sand or a similar material. Fuses for small, low-voltage, usually residential, wiring systems are commonly rated, in North American practice, to interrupt 10,000 amperes. Fuses for commercial or industrial power systems must have higher interrupting ratings, with some low-voltage current-limiting high interrupting fuses rated for 300,000 amperes. Fuses for high-voltage equipment, up to 115,000 volts, are rated by the total apparent power (megavolt-amperes, MVA) of the fault level on the circuit.|$|R
40|$|The {{urinary bladder}} is a musculomembranous sac which {{functions}} as a short term reservoir for the urine produced in the kidneys. Various diseases including congenital malformations (e. g., myelomeningocele) and postnatal diseases (e. g., bladder cancer) of the lower urinary tract affect approximately 400 million people worldwide. Current surgical treatments for these disorders rely {{on the use of}} autologous intestinal segments and xenografts such as small intestinal submucosa, which suffer from various complications including mechanical mismatch and graft shrinkage. Tissue engineering approaches have been explored where the urinary bladder has been successfully engineered in-vitro and implanted in humans by Atala and colleagues who reported successful outcomes implanting collagen-PGA based tissue engineered neo-bladders in both dogs and humans. However, Phase II clinical trials of the same approach by Tengion Inc. using the autologous cell-seeded collagen-PGA/PLGA scaffold for patients suffering from neuropathic bladders demonstrated multiple adverse events such as bowel obstruction and bladder <b>rupture,</b> without improving <b>capacity</b> or compliance which resulted i...|$|R
40|$|The use of shallow {{embedment}} anchors {{in concrete}} {{is essential for}} retrofit applications; however, the combination of steel anchors, chemical adhesive, and concrete acting as a single tensile mechanism creates uncertainties in anchor strength and failure modes. Differences in concrete compressive strengths and in specifications of adhesives between manufacturers increases uncertainty further. In addition to these issues, prior research conducted by others examines the behavior of such anchors with respect to cracked versus uncracked concrete, partial bonding of the embedded length, and strength reductions due to anchor proximity to edges. While it is understood, anchors require a proper installation detail, {{the goal of this}} research is to understand the failure mechanisms and capacity when such conditions cannot be met. One example of a limiting case is a retrofitted bridge where shallow anchors are the only option. For this application, experiments were conducted to determine the failure modes and capacities for a 4. 75 inch embedment depth anchors of No. 4 reinforcement bars in accordance with a retrofit special provision. Additional experimental investigations were conducted to determine what, if any, differences existed between these provisions and specifications that included partially bonded anchors, anchors installed within an edge condition, and the differences between reinforcement surface coatings (epoxy vs plain or black). Excluding the edge tests which exhibited poor performance, most anchors exhibited a combined failure mode of concrete cone with steel <b>rupture</b> and reached <b>capacities</b> of 11. 5 to 12. 5 kips. No discernable difference in strength capacity was observed when the anchor embedment depth was reduced from 4. 75 inches to 3. 5 inches...|$|R
