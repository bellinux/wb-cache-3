40|$|When {{designing}} a usability evaluation, key decisions {{must be made}} regarding methods and techniques for <b>data</b> collection and <b>analysis.</b> Although {{there is a strong}} body of research within human-computer interaction regarding the appropriate choices of data collection methods and techniques, much less research has been conducted examining and comparing methods and techniques for analyzing the collected data. This paper presents a <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> technique which allows usability evaluations to be conducted, analyzed and documented in a day; Instant <b>Data</b> <b>Analysis</b> (IDA). The use of this technique is exemplified through a usability evaluation of a software product for a large hospital for which traditional video <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> and Instant <b>Data</b> <b>Analysis</b> were applied independently through a controlled experiment. Among our key findings, the experiment revealed that in only 10 % of the time required to do the video <b>data</b> <b>analysis,</b> Instant <b>Data</b> <b>Analysis</b> identified 85 % of the critical usability problems in the system being evaluated.

40|$|Abstract—Data {{preparation}} {{is an important}} and critical step in neural network modeling for complex <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> {{and it has a}} huge impact on the success {{of a wide variety of}} complex <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> tasks, such as data mining and knowledge discovery. Although data preparation in neural network <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> is important, some existing literature about the neural network data preparation are scattered, and there is no systematic study about data preparation for neural network <b>data</b> <b>analysis.</b> In this study, we first propose an integrated data preparation scheme as a systematic study for neural network <b>data</b> <b>analysis.</b> In the integrated scheme, a survey of data preparation, focusing on problems with the data and corresponding processing techniques, is then provided. Meantime, some intelligent data preparation solution to some important issues and dilemmas with the integrated scheme are discussed in detail. Subsequently, a cost-benefit analysis framework for this integrated scheme is presented to analyze the effect of data preparation on complex <b>data</b> <b>analysis.</b> Finally, a typical example of complex <b>data</b> <b>analysis</b> from the financial domain is provided in order to show the application of data preparation techniques and to demonstrate the impact of data preparation on complex <b>data</b> <b>analysis.</b> Index Terms—Data preparation, neural networks, complex <b>data</b> <b>analysis,</b> cost-benefit analysis. ...|$|R
