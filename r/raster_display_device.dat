40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>raster</b> <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> for the <b>display</b> of {{graphics}} causes {{problems of}} aliasing when edges or lines are produced. This can be significant in those psychophysical experiments where the orientational {{properties of the}} stimulus are important. We have assessed the perceived orientation of a selection of abased lines by comparing them with the orientation of pairs of dots. It is found that the perceptual orientation is modelled well by a least-squares metric on the pixels that compose the line. Small deviations from this metric were found, and were also found in a control experiment employing anti-aliased lines. They appear {{to be due to}} range effects. Averaged across subjects, orientational acuity was only slightly lower for aliased lines...|$|R

The algorithm operates in screen coordinates, is pixel exact and renders any continuous function from any viewpoint. The worst-case time {{complexity of the}} algorithm is linear {{in the number of}} facets and less than linear {{in the size of the}} viewport. Our experiments show that for dense grids it provides high-quality images at very low cost.

40|$|The {{definition}} of a best approximation for circles introduced by McIlroy [7] is generalized for general ellipses (i. e. ellipses not aligned with the coordinate axes) on integer grids. For any given ellipse this definition yields {{a unique set of}} grid points, which is connected, thin, and does not contain sharp corners except at octant changes. The definition is octant independent and solves the problems of ambiguity and octant changes. The best approximation of an elliptical arc is equal to the union of the best approximations of its subarcs. For circles it is equivalent to the {{definition of}} McIlroy. An incremental and robust algorithm is given which efficiently computes the best approximation of general ellipses according to this definition. Hardware implementations of this algorithm will be able to compete with all ellipse-rendering algorithms known so far.

40|$|This paper revisits the {{classical}} hemicube and proposes {{a new form}} factor algorithm for radiosity solutions. The algorithm substantially reduces aliasing problems inherent in the hemicube method without giving up several {{of the advantages of}} the hemicube. The algorithm has its basis in the technique of area anti-aliasing in image rendering. Unlike other methods we explicitly consider the effect of the relative order of partial visibility in a hemicube cell when recording form factor computations. The method can be embedded in several existing radiosity algorithms such as progressive refinement and adaptive substructuring radiosity. The related area anti-aliasing scan conversion algorithm can also be used in applications other than radiosity (such as image rendering of complex scenes on a <b>raster</b> <b>display</b> <b>device).</b> We provide quantifiable error bounds for our algorithm, and provide experimental empirical results...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of scanning and measuring hardware for medical imaging and for scientific experiments, {{the introduction of}} animation techniques into common use have created the need to understand n-dimensional raster geometry, where n ? 3. After {{a brief review of}} continuous geometry in R n, this paper presents the discrete regular structure called a hyperlattice used for defining n-dimensional raster geometry. The concept of neighbourhood in hyperlattices is studied in detail, introducing a new definition which extends existing definitions by taking into account the border of the Voronoi sets associated with neighbouring lattice points. A general definition of discrete curves based on these new definitions is then introduced. Finally a general definition of rasterization onto hyperlattices is given, and algorithms for rasterizing straight lines onto n-dimensional lattices are presented. A detailed analysis of line-drawing algorithms onto hyperlattices is then presented. C. R.

25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the <b>raster</b> on the <b>display</b> <b>device.</b> Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|R

40|$|Color {{computer}} graphics techniques were investigated {{as a means}} of rapidly scanning and interpreting large sets of transient heating data. The data presented were generated to support the conceptual design of a heat-sink thermal protection system (TPS) for a hypersonic research airplane. Color-coded vector and <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> of the numerical geometry used in the heating calculations were employed to analyze skin thicknesses and surface temperatures of the heat-sink TPS under a variety of trajectory flight profiles.

The color-coded (<b>raster)</b> surface <b>displays</b> are a very efficient means for displaying surface-temperature and heating histories, and thereby the more stringent design requirements can quickly be identified.

Substantial {{research has been done}} on providing dialogue systems with characteristics that make them more suitable for use, given the (current) lack of intelligence in computer behavior., Such dialogues are csi linear in nature, and composed of a time-ordered WMS sequence of tokens, statements, and/or queries. The time sequencing is used to provide the context in which input can be interpreted either by amode or by syntax rules. A mode maintains the context <b>Displays</b> input <b>Devices</b> {{over an extended period of}} time; syntax rules maintain the context over shorter times. Although we know that people form plans of action to achieve some goal, we are not sure that we know enough about the process to identify all the sequences that may be needed to carry out the user's plans. This situation is exacerbated when the goals themselves are ill-defined, for example, during exploratory work. New technologies such as <b>raster</b> <b>displays</b> and pointing <b>devices</b> provide several independent and orthogonal pieces of information simultaneously. Workstation capabilities are being extended to provide 3 D imaging in real time, with color, texture, and depth cues. At the same time, more flexible input devices are being developed, for example pressure-sensitive touch tablets? Many evolutionary developments fail to exploit this parallelism. Such data as mouse position is encoded as a special character sequenceembedded in the otherwise linear input stream. More sophisticated developments such as Smalltalk, use the 2 D nature of the display surface and pointing device to provide multiple, concurrent dialogue streams. Each dialogue stream, however, often retainsmuch of its time-sequential nature. This approach, while greatly extending the expressive power of the dialogue, adds a layer of complexity in the user's mentalmodelofthe system. As the scale of the independent dialogues becomes small, and the number of them correspondingly larger, the state of the total dialogue becomes so complex it cannot be wholly remembered or comprehended. Techniques are available to palliate this...|$|R

40|$|TEX is a public-domain {{typesetting}} program {{developed by}} Donald Knuth of Stanford University. It produces output in a device independent form called DVI, {{which is then}} run through a device driver to produce hard copy. Often, getting a document in the TEX language to the desired version takes many iterations. Printing each version on a hardcopy device such as a laser printer to provide the feedback correction {{for the next generation}} wastes both time and paper. The Displaying TEX Files on Graphics Terminals, DVIVIEW, program previews output from TEX. It will allow the user to specify a range of pages to be viewed, to change the magnification of the document, and to view each page in seven different modes affecting page size and orientation. DVIVIEW uses vector-specified fonts speed-loaded into memory using a VMS system call which can then be used at a variety of magnifications. The fonts used were originally drawn from the Hershey character set and heavily modified. The fonts most closely resembling the TEX fonts have been used. For some TEX fonts not all characters are present because they were not represented in the Hershey set and have not yet been designed. The terminals supported include VT 100, VT 220, VT 240, Tektronix 4010 / 4014, MacIntosh, and Pericom. The VT 100 and VT 220 refer to those terminals with Selanar boards installed.
