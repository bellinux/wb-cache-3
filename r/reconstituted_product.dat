40|$|Acne vulgaris affects up to 80 % {{of people}} 11 to 30  years of age, and {{scarring}} can occur {{for up to}} 95 % of these patients. Scarring may be pitted or hypertrophic in nature, although in most cases it is atrophic. Atrophic acne scarring follows dermal collagen and fat loss after moderate to severe acne infection. Injectable poly-L-acid (PLLA) is a biocompatible, biodegradable, synthetic polymer device that is hypothesized to enhance dermal volume via the endogenous production of fibroblasts and, subsequently, collagen. The gradual improvements in cutaneous volume observed after treatment with injectable PLLA have been noted to last up to 2  years. The case studies presented describe the use of injectable PLLA to correct dermal fat loss in macular atrophic acne scarring of the cheeks. Two female patients underwent three treatment sessions with injectable PLLA over a 12 -week period.

40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of bleeding episodes in hemophilia with high titer inhibitors (HTI) remains a challenge, {{despite the fact}} that the therapeutic armamentarium has expanded considerably over the past few years. Treatment safety has improved with the availability of porcine factor VIII (FVIII) and bypassing products such as recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), and plasma-derived activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (aPCCs) that are virally inactivated. The major drawbacks of rFVIIa and aPCCs are their unpredictable hemostatic effect, lack of laboratory assays to monitor efficacy and dosing frequency, and the risk of thrombosis. The proceedings of a one-day workshop of physicians who specialized in treating patients with hemophilia held in Vienna on May 13, 2000 have been summarized. In making a decision regarding the choice of product, physicians often consider the type of bleeding episode (life or limb threatening), age of the patient, volume of the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>product,</b> previous exposure to plasma derived products, cost, efficacy, and safety. For plasma naïve patients, to achieve rapid hemostasis a majority of the panelists used porcine FVIII (for patients who lack porcine inhibitory antibodies) or rFVIIa. For patients previously treated with plasma derived factors, in addition to the above concentrates, aPCCs were recommended. Although no data exists regarding safety and efficacy, switching products was routinely practiced either because of availability or cost. Furthermore, the panelists were uncertain about the efficacy of bypassing agents in the prevention of joint disease in inhibitor patients.

The powders had higher bulk density and faster rehydration times, consisting of smooth, spherical and smaller particles than in FMFD powders.

These values yield increases of core histone binding to 5 S DNA (Ka) of 1. 4 -, 1. 6 -, and 2. 5 -fold, compared with undamaged DNA.

Contemporary resource management and rural development planning increasingly emphasize {{the integration of}} raw material production with forward-linked processing activities. Furthermore, the tacit acceptance of joint production of both wood and amenity-based recreation often pits the forward linked sectors of wood processing and tourism against one another as development strategies. Empirical studies suggest that both wood processors and tourism businesses locate proximate to forest resources. Assessing the regional firm location decisions of wood processors has raised important and complex issues of sectoral heterogeneity and regional economic performance. This study addresses {{the question of the}} relative importance of alternative forest uses in supporting rural economic vitality. Specifically, we initiate analysis of firm location in three wood processing sub-sectors through descriptive location quotients of primary, secondary, and <b>reconstituted</b> wood <b>products</b> manufacturing sectors and compare the presence of tourism sector activity to that of the timber sector. Explanatory variables that support these sectoral specific location quotients include proxies for raw material inputs and output markets. Our work on rural resource dependency expands this into metrics associated with income, unemployment, poverty, and regional economic diversity. Results suggest that important differences exist in locational dependency attributes between wood products sub-sectors and that dependence on joint forest resource outputs is clearly associated with unique attributes of regional socioeconomic structure...|$|R
