50|$|The <b>resting</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Lutzomyia sand flies, {{like many}} other aspects of their biology, is {{important}} to understand for targeted, vector-based control methods to reduce transmission of Leishmaniasis. For example, residual spraying of insecticides can be targeted at known resting sites to increase effectiveness. Lutzomyia sand flies generally rest outdoors, with the type of resting site varying between species and in response to the seasons and the availability of particular microhabitats. The largest resting microhabitat is the forest floor, but sand flies will also rest in a variety of other areas, such as in the nests and burrows of mammals, within the trunks of hollow trees and inside bat caves. The resting position adopted by Lutzomyia sand flies is characteristic to the genus, with wings angling above the abdomen.|$|E
5000|$|Logging is a {{behaviour}} that whales exhibit when at rest and appear like [...] "logs" [...] at the surface. It {{is defined as}} lying without forward movement at {{the surface of the}} water with the dorsal fin or parts of the back are exposed. Whales often rest for periods of time under the surface in order to sleep in mainly horizontal positions, although sperm whales also rest vertically. However, as they consciously need to breathe at the surface, they can rest only one-half of their brain at a time, known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. This sleep pattern has been identified in all five cetacean species that have been tested for it thus far. Cetaceans intermittently come to the surface in order to breathe during these sleep periods and exhibit logging behaviour. Logging can occur interchangeably with surface <b>resting</b> <b>behaviour</b> when cetaceans are travelling slowly, which is particularly common in mother-calf pairs, as the young tire quickly during swimming. Logging is common, particularly in right whales, sperm whales, pilot whales and humpback whales. Another behaviour that may be mistaken for logging is milling, where a group of cetaceans at the surface have little or no directional movement but instead socialise with each other. This behaviour is particularly common in large groups of pilot whales.|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of music on the anxiety of patients on mechanical ventilation, as assessed by objective parameters and a subjective validated anxiety scale. Background. Mechanical ventilation, although sometimes lifesaving, is often associated with levels of anxiety requiring sedatives, which has inevitable implications on costs and complications. Design. A randomized controlled trial design. Methods. A total of 64 subjects was randomly assigned to undergo either 30 minutes of music intervention or a rest period. The subjects were asked to answer the Chinese State Trait Anxiety Inventory scale before and after the study period and physiological indices and <b>resting</b> <b>behaviours</b> were recorded before and after the study period in both groups. The subjects' satisfaction with music was also obtained after music intervention. Results. The findings indicate that patients on mechanical ventilation that listened to a single 30 -minute session of music appeared to show greater relaxation as manifested by a decrease in physiological indices and an increase in comfortable <b>resting</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Conclusion. Music can provide an effective method of reducing potentially harmful physiological responses arising from anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients. Relevance to clinical practice. As indicated by the results of this study, music therapy can act as a simple and safe nursing intervention to allay anxiety and promote patient comfort. Interest and comments on music therapy provided as a relaxation technique should be elicited from both nurses and patients. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{behaviour}} {{of animals}} in the wild is fundamental to conservation efforts. Advances in bio-logging technologies have offered insights into the behaviour of animals during foraging, migration and social interaction. However, broader application of these systems has been limited by device mass, cost and longevity. Here, we use information from multiple logger types to predict individual behaviour in a highly pelagic, migratory seabird, the Manx Shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). Using behavioural states resolved from GPS tracking of foraging during the breeding season, we demonstrate that individual behaviours can be accurately predicted during multi-year migrations from low cost, lightweight, salt-water immersion devices. This reveals a complex pattern of migratory stopovers: some involving high proportions of foraging, and others of <b>rest</b> <b>behaviour.</b> We use this technique to examine three consecutive years of global migrations, revealing the prominence of foraging behaviour during migration {{and the importance of}} highly productive waters during migratory stopover...|$|R

5000|$|One {{physiological}} {{characteristic of}} sleep {{goes by the}} name of [...] "homeostatic regulation". This is the notion that animals need a more or less constant amount of sleep every day, so that if a subject is deprived of sleep one day, the amount of sleep tends to [...] "rebound" [...] (increase) the next few days. This has been observed in zebrafish. At night, zebrafish appear to float in the water column, either horizontally or with the head slightly up. Their frequency of mouth and gill movement is reduced by almost half and they are twice as hard to arouse as during the day. If they are deprived of this sleep-like behaviour, the sleep bouts thereafter are longer and the arousal threshold is higher than usual, suggesting a rebound effect.

We investigated the response of Diana monkeys to increased predation risk by looking at behavioural changes associated with male long-distance calls, which are reliably given to certain predators. After male long-distance calls, group spread and nearestneighbour distance decreased whilst travel and association rates for the group increased. The average height and exposure level of individuals in the group did not change after calls. Individual Diana monkeys changed their behaviour and {{were more likely to be}} vigilant or travel and less likely to engage in social or <b>resting</b> <b>behaviours</b> after long-distance calls. In addition, movement rates increased with the number of species the Diana monkeys were associated with. Diana monkey long-distance calls facilitate the joining of groups of other species.

In this context, {{the aim of this}} study was to understand the bottlenose dolphin’s habitat use within the bay, and to consider how this information could be used in prospective management strategies. Particularly, we aimed at using the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to map the intensity of space use for essential behavioural patterns. To this end, we collected behavioural information on dolphins during 25 boat-based surveys in the bay in 2011. The habitat use of the bay was heterogeneous: some areas were more intensely used than others. Dolphins spent most of their time traveling and diving. Variables associated to <b>resting</b> <b>behaviours,</b> e. g. school size and depth, indicated that the SAB would be a safer place compared to other known residency areas, confirming its suitability for conservation purposes. KDE analyses showed that behaviours are not evenly distributed inside the bay. Bottlenose dolphins being more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances while engaged in <b>resting</b> or socializing <b>behaviours,</b> it is crucial to locate these behaviours. In SAB, the KDE shows that resting and socializing areas are located in the Northern part of the bay, indicating that it should constitute a priority protected area in potential future management strategies.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of the mosquito and parasite life-history traits that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity are temperature sensitive. In most cases, the process-based models used to estimate malaria risk and inform control and prevention strategies utilize measures of mean outdoor temperature. Evidence suggests, however, that certain malaria vectors can spend large parts of their adult life resting indoors. Presentation of hypothesis If significant proportions of mosquitoes are resting indoors and indoor conditions differ markedly from ambient conditions, simple use of outdoor temperatures will not provide reliable estimates of malaria transmission intensity. To date, few studies have quantified the differential effects of indoor vs outdoor temperatures explicitly, reflecting a lack of proper understanding of mosquito <b>resting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and associated microclimate. Testing the hypothesis Published records from 8 village sites in East Africa revealed temperatures to be warmer indoors than outdoors and to generally show less daily variation. Exploring {{the effects of these}} temperatures on malaria parasite development rate suggested indoor-resting mosquitoes could transmit malaria between 0. 3 and 22. 5 days earlier than outdoor-resting mosquitoes. These differences translate to increases in transmission risk ranging from 5 to approaching 3, 000 %, relative to predictions based on outdoor temperatures. The pattern appears robust for low- and highland areas, with differences increasing with altitude. Implications of the hypothesis Differences in indoor vs outdoor environments lead to large differences in the limits and the intensity of malaria transmission. This finding highlights a need to better understand mosquito <b>resting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the associated microclimate, and to broaden assessments of transmission ecology and risk to consider the potentially important role of endophily. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} round-pen {{training}} on the behaviour and physiological response (plasma Cortisol concentration and heart rate) of 24 horses was examined using a stocks restraint stress test before, after and 3 weeks after round-pen training was carried out. Horses were allocated to treatment groups according to their ease of handling. Three treatment groups were formed, Control, Round-Pen Easy and Round-Pen Difficult (RP-D). Before the treatment (round-pen training or control) {{there were no significant}} differences between the three treatment groups for plasma Cortisol concentration and heart rate. Restraint in the stocks caused an elevation in plasma Cortisol concentrations in all horses. The increase in plasma Cortisol concentration was greater in the RP-D horses. A single round-pen training session was used as a treatment for the RP treated horses (Hasy or difficult). Post-treatment most horses had a significant decrease in the time to enter the stocks, however, treatment had no significant effect on the plasma Cortisol response, heart rate or behaviour of horses in each of the three treatment groups. Round-pen training sessions were observed to see if the ease of round pen training was affected by either dominance rank or the behaviours observed during round-pen training. Despite the individual variation between horses, all horses followed a similar pattern of behaviour during round-pen training. There was no significant effect of social status on the ease of round-pen training. The effect of dominance rank on the ease of handling, behaviours observed in the stocks and the plasma Cortisol concentration during the pre-treatment stocks tests were examined. Horses that occupied the lower ranks were less easy to handle during the pre-treatment stocks test.

Their occurrence is synchronized with the seasonal haul out of Southern elephant seals, but the seasonality of King, Rockhopper and Macaroni penguins {{is also likely to}} influence their occurrence. The largest herds occur in October, the month during which mean group size is also largest. Sex and age composition are given, adult males being significantly more numerous than adult females, while 36 ' 3 % of the latter had calves. Hunting activity appears to be greatest between 15. 00 and 17. 00 hrs, and most Killer whales were seen within 100 m of the shore. Aspects of hunting, attacking, feeding and <b>resting</b> <b>behaviour</b> are discussed. The body measurements of a young mal...|$|E

The former has a wider distribution and occurs In higher densities with longer seasonal prevalence {{and is therefore}} {{considered to be the}} most important malaria vector in the country. Previous studies showed that An. mtntmus breeds in grassy edges of perennial hill streams, in slow running irrigation channels and terraced rice fields while 0 MR teams, in addition, found it breeding in small puddles in stream beds {{together with}} An. maculatus. At Phado, An. minimus uas found to constitute 50. 5 % and monsoon, cool/dry and seasons respectively. Prevalence of An. minimus in relation to distance from forest was presented. Biting, <b>resting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and host preference studies were carried out and the results presented. Man-biting rate and vectoria] capacities in relation to rainfall for each month over a year are also presented.

40|$|Coastal dolphin {{populations are}} exposed to non-consumptive human {{activities}} that can pose conservation challenges. Consequently, effective management strategies, using rigorous scientific assessments of exposed populations, are needed to mitigate any potential negative impacts of these activities. To inform management decisions {{for the conservation of}} the Hawaii Island spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) stock, I: (i) estimated abundance and survival rates; (ii) measured the effectiveness of various sampling scenarios to detect changes in abundance; (iii) identified important spinner dolphin resting habitats; and (iv) measured cumulative exposure to human activities. Between September 2010 and March 2013, boat-based and land-based sampling was undertaken to collect dolphin photo-identification, group behaviour and acoustic data from both inside and outside four important spinner dolphin resting bays on the Kona Coast of Hawaii Island. Between years, independent survival rate estimates were similar (0. 97 ± 0. 05 SE), and abundance estimates of 631 (95 % CI 524 - 761) and 668 (95 % CI 556 - 801; CV = 0. 09) were very consistent. At this precision, and with 95 % power and a monitoring interval of three years, a 5 % change in abundance would not be detected for 12 years. I documented that should resting spinner dolphins be displaced from resting bays, they are unlikely to engage in <b>rest</b> <b>behaviour</b> elsewhere. When <b>resting</b> inside bays, dolphins were most likely to rest between 10 : 00 - 14 : 00, and over sandy substrates. Individual spinner dolphins spent between 49. 5 % and 69. 4 % of daytime resting (mean = 61. 7 %). Dolphins were chronically and repeatedly exposed to human activities during daytime hours (> 82 % of time), with a median duration of only ten min between interactions. The short interval between interactions may prevent recovery from disturbance and deprive individuals of rest and change their sleep state from “deep” to “light”. Rest deprivation and the disruption of sleep can lead to impaired cognitive abilities and ultimately effect population viability. These data provide a firm baseline for urgent consideration by managers to evaluate the risks to the spinner dolphins of Hawaii Island, potential pathways for mitigating human interactions and ways to measure the success of management interventions...|$|R
