50|$|Fichte {{was born}} in Rammenau, Upper Lusatia. The son of a <b>ribbon</b> <b>weaver,</b> he came of peasant stock which {{had lived in the}} region for many generations. The family was noted in the {{neighborhood}} for its probity and piety. Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station. It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother.|$|E
50|$|The son of James Watts, a <b>ribbon</b> <b>weaver,</b> he {{was born}} at Coventry, Warwickshire, on 24 March 1818. At five years of age he {{suffered}} partial paralysis of his left side, and could not take a manual job. After leaving elementary school, he {{became a member of}} the local Mechanics' Institution, where from age of 13 to 20 he acted as assistant secretary and librarian. He then went into trade, but adopted communist principles, and became a lecturer on Robert Owen's views. He visited many towns, and in Scotland attended lectures at the Andersonian University.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, aged 22 years, Shelton {{moved to}} Coventry, {{where he found}} lodgings in Thomas Street and began work as a drayman for the London and North Western Railway. He {{attended}} and was Sunday School teacher at the Wesleyan Chapel in Warwick Lane, now Methodist Central Hall, where he met Catherine Ashton at the Young People's Bible Class. In 1899, the Marriage Register of Warwick Lane recorded that John Bailey Shelton, aged 24, Drayman, living at 39 Greyfriars Lane, married Mary Catherine Ashton, aged 20, Spinster, <b>Ribbon</b> <b>Weaver,</b> of 30 Albion Street. Their son, Bailey, was born in their home in Cow Lane, and they later moved to Sackville Street where Kathleen, their daughter was born.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the help}} of the IWW, Paterson silk workers were able to put {{together}} a general strike by recruiting thousands of workers. Two weeks into the strike, all types of weavers united to create a list of demands directed to mill owners and employers, ranging from minimum age restrictions to protect children to abolishing the multiple-loom systems to ensure the presence of jobs. [...] It became clear that the protesters had different roles based on which job they were striking against. The <b>ribbon</b> <b>weavers</b> were skilled workers who, having previous militant struggles, helped to educate the strikers on their rights. <b>Ribbon</b> <b>weavers</b> were also advocates for higher wages, as they believed that since they were being more productive with the introduction of the looms, and thus their productivity rate was also higher, they should be getting paid more. They {{even went so far as}} to demand that the three and four-loom systems be completely removed from the mills. The workers believed that the introduction of these mills was stealing jobs away from them and was also lowering their wages. Furthermore, socialism had long been a strong belief of the <b>ribbon</b> <b>weavers,</b> directly clashing with the capitalistic manufacturers and bosses. This resentment finally bubbled over in 1913 during the strikes under the ribbon workers rule of their then-current spokesman, Louis Magnet. Manufacturers responded with a seven-part statement regarding the economic unviability of the demands, among other concerns.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} town of Coventry, England, was the centre of a ribbon weaving industry. Thomas Stevens was born in Foleshill, just {{to the north of}} Coventry, in 1828 to a {{relatively}} poor family. Stevens worked for Pears and Franklin, a local <b>ribbon</b> <b>weavers</b> in Coventry, and by 1854 had created his own ribbon firm. In 1860, however, the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty was signed; this free trade treaty introduced new competition into the industry, leading to a collapse in the local ribbon economy and a huge loss of employment in Coventry.|$|R
5000|$|William {{was born}} to John and Martha Gadsby at Attleborough, Warwickshire on or around 3 January 1773. He was born into poverty and only briefly {{attended}} Nuneaton church school, starting work as a <b>ribbon</b> <b>weaver</b> at age 13. By age 17 he had forgotten how to read. His conversion to Christianity was also at this age: [...] "But when the Lord was graciously pleased to quicken my soul, being then just 17 years of age, and showed me something of what sin really was, I really feared it then, and a turn in my mind took place of a very different kind... I was then solemnly and blessedly led to believe in God's free mercy and pardon." [...] He joined the Cow Lane Baptist Church in Coventry where he was baptized on 29 December 1793.|$|E
5000|$|Some modern weavers thread each card individually, {{but this}} is time consuming. The {{traditional}} threading method is to put all the threads through the holes of an entire deck. Then, starting at the pair of cards farthest from the bobbins, the threads are pulled from between each pair of cards out {{to the length of}} the warp, and hooked or tied on each end. If the cards remain [...] "paired", so that alternate cards twist in opposite directions, continuous turning does not twist the <b>ribbon.</b> Some <b>weavers</b> in some patterns flip alternate cards, [...] "unpairing" [...] them. This makes it easier to turn individual cards.|$|R
