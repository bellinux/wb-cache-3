25|$|In 1959, Wurlitzer {{released}} an electro-mechanical drum machine called the Side Man, {{which was the}} first-ever commercially produced drum machine. The Side Man {{was intended as a}} percussive accompaniment for the Wurlitzer organ range. The Side Man offered a choice of 12 electronically generated, predefined rhythm patterns with variable tempos. The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10 preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a rotating wiper arm with contact brushes on it that swept around a phenolic panel with corresponding contacts arranged in a pattern of concentric circles across its face; these were spaced in certain patterns to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular rhythmic patterns of the day, e.g. waltzes, fox trots etc. These combinations were selected by a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> {{on the top of the}} Side Man box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that increased the speed of rotation of the wiper arm. The Side Man had a panel of 10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Side Man was housed in a mahogany cabinet that contained the sound-generating circuitry, amplifier and speaker.|$|E
500|$|A typical {{test setup}} with a {{waveguide}} slotted line {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4). [...] This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage. [...] The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a crystal detector. [...] The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a matched load (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide. [...] The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test. [...] It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line. [...] The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> (11) which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{implementation}} of ADSR {{can be found}} on the Hammond Novachord in 1938 (which predates the first Moog synthesizer by over 25 years). [...] A seven-position <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> set preset ADS parameter for all 72 notes; a pedal controlled release time. [...] The notion of ADSR was specified by Vladimir Ussachevsky (then head of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center) in 1965 while suggesting improvements for Bob Moog's pioneering work on synthesizers, although the earlier notations of parameter were (T1, T2, Esus, T3), then these were simplified to current form (Attack time, Decay time, Sustain level, Release time) by ARP.|$|E
5000|$|The Monster GO-DJ has two LCD touch screens, one {{on either}} side of a {{physical}} interface comprising <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and a cross-fader.

It also has a built in speaker on the right side. The 'high/low' variations of the voices is omitted, but on this machine you can actually blend the voices together.|$|R
50|$|The HP-HIL (Hewlett-Packard Human Interface Link) is {{the name}} of a {{computer}} bus used by Hewlett-Packard to connect keyboards, mice, trackballs, digitizers, tablets, barcode readers, <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> touchscreens, and other human interface peripherals to their HP 9000 workstations. The bus was in use until the mid-1990s, when HP substituted PS/2 technology for HIL. The PS/2 peripherals were themselves replaced with USB-connected models.|$|R
50|$|In response, several luxury brands had {{switched}} to <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> control devices, {{with the aim}} to simplify cabin layout and consolidate multiple controls with a single device. The BMW iDrive, Audi MMI, and Mercedes-Benz COMAND APS interfaces operated using a circular center knob which can be rotated side to side, and pressed to select items, with the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> scrolling through on-screen menus. Of these systems, some reviewers praised their ability to simplify the dash layout, while others levied criticism for reputed complexity and user difficulty, particularly with iDrive.|$|E

5000|$|Simpler systems {{allow the}} driver to control the valve or door {{directly}} (usually {{by means of a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>knob,</b> or a lever). More complicated systems use a combination of electromechanical actuators and thermistors to control the valve or doors to deliver air at a precise temperature value selected by the user.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997 Clavia {{released}} the Nord Modular, a virtual analog modular synthesizer. Called a [...] "landmark in synthesis" [...] it allowed you to essentially {{build your own}} virtual analog synthesizer. It too was later upgraded with the 2004 release of the Nord Modular G2, that gave it the same endless <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> as the Nord Lead 3 and a larger keyboard with aftertouch.|$|R

50|$|KVM {{switches}} {{were originally}} passive, mechanical devices based on multi-pole switches {{and some of}} the cheapest devices on the market still use this technology. Mechanical switches usually have a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> to select between computers. KVMs typically allow sharing of two or four computers, with a practical limit of about twelve machines imposed by limitations on available switch configurations. Modern hardware designs use active electronics rather than physical switch contacts with the potential to control many computers on a common system backbone.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of Remote Touch, Lexus {{interiors}} were typically equipped with touchscreen interfaces. Although this system was regarded by many reviewers as easier to use than conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> controllers, the need to place the touchscreen within easy reach limited design possibilities for the interior (by forcing placement of the screen in the center dash and {{in close proximity to}} the steering wheel). The enhanced technology trend in the automotive industry also resulted in a plethora of ever-increasing buttons and switches on many luxury vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The player uses a flight-style {{joystick}} to move {{a spaceship}} around a dark starfield, a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> to orient it, and a trigger on the stick to fire. Planets appear {{at the start of}} a level and begin growing. They can be destroyed prior to reaching full size and sprouting moons. Once a planet has moons, it's shielded until all its moons have been launched at the player's ship. A planet that has lost all of its moons becomes angry and charges the player.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} use of multi-touch {{gestures}} in {{the use of}} interactive music apps run on mobile devices. With the growing popularity of mobile, multi-touch devices such as the iPad, more and more people have the chance to interact with music in a creative setting. However, many of these apps are based on traditional analogue music equipment, employing metaphors to physical interaction elements such as <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and faders. User preference for musical interaction is researched. Three apps were developed for this investigation: two apps employ skeuomorphic UI elements (<b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and faders), and the third employs multi-touch gestures. All three apps allow the user to interact with a granular synthesizer. User tests show that if users want an app {{that will allow them to}} explore music in a manner they would describe as “intuitive, interactive, creative, and playful”, then a multi-touch gestural app is the preferred option. However, if users want to be able to intricately modify and edit music, then an app implementing a skeuomorphic design paradigm is the preferred option...|$|R
30|$|For what it {{concerns}} HMI devices this scenario has {{the consequence of}} a growing number of displays and new input devices as buttons, <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and touch screens on the dashboard and the steering wheel but there is a general attempt, confirmed also by the results of the aforementioned research projects COMUNICAR and AIDE, to integrate the information and its management to optimize and rationalize the dialogue between the driver and the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The channel input strips {{are usually}} {{a bank of}} {{identical}} monaural or stereo input channels. Each channel has <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> buttons and/or faders for controlling the gain and equalization (e.g., bass and treble) of the signal on each channel. Depending on the mixer, a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes, turn on an attenuator [...] "pad", or activate other features.|$|R
50|$|Newer Minitor pagers can scan two {{channels}} {{by selecting}} that function via a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> on the pager; in this mode when using a Minitor III or IV the user will hear all traffic, {{even without the}} correct tones being sent. If the activation tones are transmitted in this monitor mode, the pager alerts as normal. Minitor Vs {{have the option to}} remain in monitor mode or in selective call mode when scanning two channels. Minitor IIIs and IVs only have the option to remain in monitor mode when scanning two channels.|$|E
50|$|Unveiled by Lexus at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show in November of that year, Remote Touch became Lexus {{entry into}} the realm of non-touchscreen human-machine interfaces. Introduced on the third {{generation}} Lexus RX, the Remote Touch system differs from previous interfaces in being the first to use a computer mouse (or trackball)-based concept, instead of the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> model. The system allows the operator to freely move the on-screen cursor across any part of the screen. The cursor replaces the role of the drivers hand on the previous touchscreen interface.|$|E

5000|$|Logic Control (and now MCU) allows {{control of}} almost all Logic {{parameters}} with hardware faders, buttons and [...] "V-Pots" [...] (<b>rotary</b> <b>knobs).</b> Its touch-sensitive, motorized faders react to track automation. All transport functions and wheel scrubbing are also available. The unit also controls plug-in parameters. Visual feedback including current parameters being edited, parameter values, project location (SMPTE time code or bars/beats/divisions/ticks) are conveyed by a two-line LCD and red 7-segment LED displays.|$|R
50|$|MIDI {{keyboards}} are a {{very common}} feature of a recording studio, and any DAW setup. Most include a transpose function {{and the ability to}} set different octaves. Many MIDI keyboards have pitch bend and modulation wheels. Some also have extra sets of assignable <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and/or buttons for sending custom MIDI messages to the synthesiser, sampler or DAW software. Devices with extra features (also including rhythm input, instrument selection, transport control) are sometimes called keyboard controllers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Clavia {{released}} the Nord Lead. Called [...] "a magic piece of electronics" [...] by Sound on Sound it popularized the virtual analog type of synthesis. In 1997 the Nord Lead 2 was released, with many improvements, including increasing polyphony from 4 to 16 notes. The Nord Lead 3 {{was released in}} 2001, with a reworked sound engine, better D/A converters and monophonic aftertouch. The most striking aspect of the Nord Lead 3 was that all the sound editing knobs had been replaced with infinite <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> where {{the value of the}} parameter was indicated by a LED 'collar' around the <b>knob.</b> The <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> LED collars and keyboard with aftertouch made the Nord Lead 3 an [...] "absolute delight" [...] but because of its higher price, the Nord Lead 2 remained in demand. And as some of the parts of the Nord Lead 3 were getting harder to source, Clavia released an updated version of the Nord Lead 2, called the Nord Lead 2x, with faster processors, better D/A converters and an upgraded polyphony to 20 voices. The Nord Lead 3 was discontinued in 2007, but the Nord Lead 2x remains in production.|$|R
50|$|ZunZun Block (ズンズンブロック lit. ZunZun Burokku) is an arcade game {{released}} in 1979 by Taito.

50|$|Field Goal (フィールドゴール Fīrudo Gōru) is an arcade game {{released}} in 1979 by Taito Corporation. It is a clone {{of the game}} Breakout, where the player must use the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> to control a paddle and hit {{the ball into the}} red, yellow and blue helmets on the screen. Each time a row of helmets is cleared out, a new row will appear in its place. If the player hits the orange area towards the top of the screen, it will decrease the size of the player's paddle. Sometimes a football player will appear, and if the ball hits him, the player will earn bonus points. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2007 as part of Taito Memories II Gekan.|$|E
50|$|The first HR-3300 was {{released}} in 1976. These early units used two large <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> for tuning television signals for recording, one for VHF and another for UHF.
