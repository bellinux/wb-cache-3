25|$|The <b>residual</b> <b>strength</b> occurs {{for some}} soils where {{the shape of}} the {{particles}} that make up the soil become aligned during shearing (forming a slickenside), resulting in reduced resistance to continued shearing (further strain softening). This is particularly true for most clays that comprise plate-like minerals, but is also observed in some granular soils with more elongate shaped grains. Clays that do not have plate-like minerals (like allophanic clays) do not tend to exhibit residual strengths.|$|E
25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} shear stress that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of shear stress. The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the shear stress and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or <b>residual</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

The peak shear strengths rapidly decrease after the first cycle and tend to remain unchanged close to the <b>residual</b> <b>strengths</b> through the tenth cycle. Degradation of the first order asperities largely occurs after the first cycle.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, low-velocity impact {{characteristics}} and <b>residual</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of {{carbon fiber composite}} lattice core sandwich structures are investigated experimentally and numerically. Low-velocity impact tests and <b>residual</b> tensile <b>strength</b> tests are simulated by the FE (finite element) software, ABAQUS/Explicit and its subroutine (VUMAT). In order to give more detailed description about the impact damage of the structure and improve modeling accuracy, multi-steps analysis method is employed to simulate impact process and <b>residual</b> tensile <b>strength</b> test in one analysis model. The calculation results computed by the FE model have been compared {{to the value of}} experiments, the difference of impact process simulation is about 3. 3 % and that of tensile strength test simulation is about 12. 9 %. The calculation error of computation model is acceptable, since unavoidable damage could be introduced in the courses of manufacture, processing and transportation of composite materials, and these damages are determinated difficultly in the computation programs. Next, the degradation tendency chart of <b>residual</b> tensile <b>strength</b> and impact energy threshold 0 U of carbon fiber composite lattice core sandwich structures are obtained by the computation value of <b>residual</b> tensile <b>strength</b> after impacted with different impact energy. Previously, this threshold can only be obtained by experiment tests. After the contact force which is bigger than the threshold 0 U impact on the sandwich structures, the <b>residual</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of structures are degraded greatly. This conclusion is significant for the design and application of carbon fiber composite lattice core sandwich structures...|$|R

40|$|The mudded weak {{interlayer}} is a geotechnical sandwich material exhibiting {{strain softening}} behavior, which {{plays an important}} part in the slope stability. The present work primarily focuses on the shear strength of the mudded weak interlayer in rock slopes. To determine the peak and <b>residual</b> shear <b>strengths</b> of the mudded weak interlayers, the particle flow code (PFC) is used to simulate the failure behavior during the direct shear tests. Laboratory investigations including uniaxial compression test, SEM, and 3 D deformation measurement are employed to calibrate the essential micro parameters of the mudded weak interlayer during the simulation process in PFC. The numerical model is built based on these parameters and both the peak and <b>residual</b> shear <b>strengths</b> can be predicted from the model. The prediction results show that the peak and residual internal friction angle are 19. 36 ° and 14. 61 °, while the peak and residual cohesion are 22. 33 [*]kPa and 2. 73 [*]kPa, respectively.
