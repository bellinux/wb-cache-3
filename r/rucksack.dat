5|$|During the {{training}} expedition, Shaw's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near Watern Tor in the north-east of Dartmoor. According to evidence given at Shaw's inquest in 2009, the group {{believed they had}} to cross because the alternative route would add at least four miles to the trek. Another {{member of the group}} got into difficulties crossing the stream, which, due to heavy rain, had swollen to approximately five times its normal size. The other group member removed her <b>rucksack</b> and passed it to Shaw. As Shaw, the last member of the group on her side of the stream, was throwing the <b>rucksack</b> across, she slipped and fell into the water.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen <b>rucksack</b> to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
5|$|Lace {{confessed to}} the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a {{statement}} to police that he had stolen a <b>rucksack</b> and cash on 4December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth {{where he had been}} living and then walked to Southampton. He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E

On 7 July 2005, he made his {{preparation}} when boarding a train in the Edgware Road tube station. As he sat down, because another man had been [...] "spilling over" [...] his seat, Tulloch moved closer to Mohammed Sidique Khan, who had two <b>rucksacks</b> containing explosives. Just as Tulloch was about to stand up, the explosives in Khan's <b>rucksacks</b> exploded, killing seven people and critically injuring Tulloch, who sustained swollen and cut eyes, and shrapnel embedded in his head.|$|R

25|$|In Barking, East London, 20-year-old Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli {{was beaten}} and then robbed twice by looters {{emptying}} his <b>rucksack.</b> Footage {{of the second}} mugging, which appears to show {{the second set of}} muggers pretend to help him then proceed to ransack his <b>rucksack,</b> was uploaded onto YouTube. He suffered a broken jaw, requiring surgery. On 2 March 2012, two men, John Kafunda of Ilford and Reece Donovan of Romford, were found guilty of the robbery of Rossli and also violent disorder by a jury at Wood Green Crown Court. The sentences were quashed by the Court of Appeal on 29 November 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{knapsack}} problem or <b>rucksack</b> {{problem is a}} problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is {{less than or equal to}} a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.|$|E

25|$|On 18 September 2002, nude {{human remains}} were {{discovered}} by mushroom pickers in Yateley Heath Woods near Yateley, Hampshire. They were later confirmed through dental records as Dowler's. Due to {{the severity of}} the decomposition, the cause of death could not be ascertained. Neither Dowler's clothes, nor any of the possessions—the purse, <b>rucksack</b> or mobile phone—she had with her {{at the time of her}} disappearance have ever been recovered. The discovery of the body led the police to reclassify the case from a missing person to a homicide investigation. Undertaken by Surrey Police, the investigation was code-named Operation Ruby.|$|E
25|$|Nicole {{left her}} grandmother's house at 05:15 on Friday, 6 October 1995, to cycle to the bakery in , {{where she was}} working a holiday job, and never arrived. At 18:00, police found her bicycle in the river Dommel. Between then and 17 October, the police searched the river and a nearby forest, and on 19 October, her <b>rucksack</b> was found near Eindhoven's canal; the canal and its south bank were searched the {{following}} day. Between 28 and 29 October, these areas were searched again. Nicole's stepfather Ad denied the hypothesis that she had run away to Germany, where her extended family lived. By 20 November, police had received around 300 leads.|$|E
25|$|Since 1991 an {{outhouse}} at {{the back}} of the lodge has been maintained by Dundee University <b>Rucksack</b> Club as an open bothy – it is a good base for climbing Lochnagar. Equipped with a stove and a composting toilet (as well as a candelabra) it used to be a storeroom and is now available to anyone free of charge for overnight stays. However, there is no electricity, the water supply is from the Glas Allt very near by, and there is no fuel unless it has been left by previous users. When royal parties are visiting the lodge backpackers are still allowed to stay in the bothy but they are asked to keep discretely out of the way.|$|E

25|$|Backpacks are a {{standard}} {{part of the}} load-bearing equipment of soldiers, especially infantry, in most countries, and military-style packs are regularly available to civilians in military surplus stores. Well-known examples include the United States ALICE field pack and the British Army PLCE <b>rucksack</b> attachment, {{both of which are}} widely available to civilian markets both as actual military surplus (new or used) and as replicas. Such packs are often, though not always (e.g. the USMC's ILBE pack), external-frame packs, with the pack itself lashed or pinned to a metal or plastic carrying frame. For units that are entering combat situations, packs may be loaded heavily and can weigh in excess of 100lbs. Each soldier may carry extra weapons, ammunition, rations, medical supplies, tents or other shelter material, and extra clothing.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood {{had been found in}} the snow near the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school <b>rucksack</b> had been found upon the opposite bank of the river {{at the end of the}} street (indicating the girl had been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive. Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko who, as a teenager, had served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the blood type was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.|$|E
500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} nightdress, 75 {{feet down}} at the bottom of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives after the 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas <b>rucksack</b> and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her eyes had been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.|$|E

500|$|For {{the landing}} each man carried a <b>rucksack</b> {{weighing}} [...] containing extra ammunition, for the Brens, mortars, Vickers K guns and PIATs. This {{was on top}} of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was the man next to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{was subject}} to anxieties {{bordering}} on paranoia throughout her life. She {{had good reason to}} be concerned about Reggie, however, who travelled from Romania to Greece on the German Lufthansa airline – Lufthansa planes were sometimes diverted to Axis countries. He arrived safely, however, bringing a <b>rucksack,</b> a suitcase full of books, but no appropriate clothes for work. Reggie relaunched his hectic social life, but his wife interacted little with the expatriate community, focussing instead on her writing. Nevertheless, this was a happy time for Manning; [...] "Romania is abroad," [...] said Manning, [...] "but Greece is home". Manning had her admirers, including Terence Spencer, a British Council lecturer who acted as her companion while Reggie was busy with other activities – he later appeared as the character Charles Warden in Friends and Heroes, the third book of The Balkan Trilogy. Soon after their arrival, Greece entered the war against the Axis. [...] In spite of early successes against invading Italian forces, by April 1941 the country was at risk of invasion from the Germans; in a later poem Manning recalled the [...] "horror and terror of defeat" [...] of a people she had grown to love. The British Council advised its staff to evacuate, and on 18 April Manning and Reggie left Piraeus for Egypt on the Erebus, the last civilian ship to leave Greece.|$|E
500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a gas or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some <b>rucksack</b> runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed {{until the end of the}} exercise. This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E
50|$|The teams {{must also}} carry all {{equipment}} needed {{to complete the}} expedition. <b>Rucksacks</b> can often weigh in the range 12 to 22 kilogrammes. This equipment can include tentage, sleeping gear, clothes, cooking equipment, first aid equipment, fuel, water, stationary, and whatever food has been purchased from the budget.|$|R
