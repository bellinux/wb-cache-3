25|$|The total {{estimated}} {{amount of oil}} in an oil reservoir, including both producible and non-producible oil, is called oil in place. However, because of reservoir characteristics and limitations in petroleum extraction technologies, {{only a fraction of}} this oil can be brought to the surface, and it is only this producible fraction that is considered to be reserves. The ratio of reserves to the total amount of oil in a particular reservoir is called the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor.</b> Determining a <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> for a given field depends on several features of the operation, including method of oil recovery used and technological developments.|$|E
25|$|Volumetric methods {{attempt to}} {{determine}} the amount of oil in place by using the size of the reservoir as well as the physical properties of its rocks and fluids. Then a <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> is assumed, using assumptions from fields with similar characteristics. OIP is multiplied by the <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> to arrive at a reserve number. Current recovery factors for oil fields around the world typically range between 10 and 60 percent; some are over 80 percent. The wide variance is due largely to the diversity of fluid and reservoir characteristics for different deposits. The method is most useful early {{in the life of the}} reservoir, before significant production has occurred.|$|E

The organoleptic features of extracts obtained in this way closely match those of the honey samples. <b>Recovery</b> <b>factors</b> obtained for a large number of chemicals highlight the critical impact of parameters such as oxygen level, extraction time, and cold finger temperature.

30|$|Depletion {{of oil and}} gas {{reservoirs}} {{is known}} to be accompanied with fracture closure, {{which is one of the}} reasons for notoriously low <b>recovery</b> <b>factors</b> in naturally fractured reservoirs (e.g. <b>recovery</b> <b>factors</b> down to 10 – 15  % in some fractured carbonates). A recent study suggests that stress-dependent fracture permeability can reduce the cumulative ten-year production from an unconventional gas field by 10  % (Aybar et al. 2014). Designing hydrocarbon production from and fluid injection into such fields requires a good grasp of the basic mechanisms affecting fracture behaviour during depletion and injection. It also calls for quantitative estimates of fracture permeability as a function of drawdown (reservoir pressure reduction).|$|R

In this framework, an original extraction procedure {{based on the}} use of Amberlite XAD- 16 was developed. <b>Recovery</b> <b>factors</b> were determined and compared with those obtained with another resin (XAD- 2). This was done for different model media and various norisoprenoids. In aqueous or alcoholic solutions, the efficiency of both resins proved very high. As expected, addition of honey decreased the adsorption of nonpolar compounds. This effect was much more pronounced with the lower-porosity XAD- 2 support. Sugar addition markedly improved the <b>recovery</b> <b>factors</b> obtained with the XAD- 16 resin in the case of more polar norisoprenoids...|$|R
40|$|In many {{petroleum}} basins, {{and especially}} in more mature areas, most reserve additions consist of the growth over time of prior discoveries, a phenomenon termed reserve appreciation. This paper concerns crude oil reserve appreciation in both the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. It examines the change in reserves attributed to North Sea fields over time, seeking to reveal patterns of reserve appreciation both for individual fields and for groups of fields classified by potentially relevant common elements. These include field size, year of production start-up, geological age, gravity, depth and depletion rate. The paper emphasises the statistical analysis of reserve appreciation. It contrasts the Norwegian and UK experience. An important distinction is drawn between appreciation of oil-in-place and changes in <b>recovery</b> <b>factors.</b> North Sea oil reserve appreciation between production start-up and the last observation year (usually 1996) {{is found to be}} substantial, but it generally lacks a consistent profile. Appreciation recorded for the Norwegian fields on average is considerably greater than for the UK. Most UK appreciation is seemingly accounted for by oil-in-place; in Norway, from increases in <b>recovery</b> <b>factors.</b> However, UK <b>recovery</b> <b>factors</b> commence at much higher levels than those for Norway.

A Delphi approach was utilized to allow a large sample of service users to be anonymously consulted about their views on recovery. Service users were invited {{to take part in a}} 3 -stage consultation process. A total of 381 participants gave their views on recovery in the main stage of this study, with 100 of these taking part in the final review stage. The final list of statements about recovery included 94 items, which were rated as essential or important by> 80 % of respondents. These statements covered items which define <b>recovery,</b> <b>factors</b> which help <b>recovery,</b> <b>factors</b> which hinder <b>recovery,</b> and <b>factors</b> which show that someone is recover-ing. As far as we are aware, it is the first study to identify areas of consensus in relation to definitions of recovery from a service user perspective, which are typically reported to be an idiosyncratic process.

Protective factors that can be quantitatively measured include: celebrations, hardiness, time together, routines, traditions, communication, financial management, and health. These factors have been most important when starting to understand the protective factors of resilience, versus the <b>recovery</b> <b>factors,</b> which are employed when the crisis or challenge has already occurred and the family needs to adapt. <b>Recovery</b> <b>factors</b> include: coping, social support, family support, esteem building, optimism, recreation, control, organization, flexibility, and hope.

In short, it is difficult to measure family resilience.|$|R

Diagenetic processes in the middle Bakken are complex and vary across several scales. Early carbonate cementation exerts the primary control on porosity loss in the middle Bakken. Detailed petrographic examination by electron microscopy reveals multiple textural phases of calcite and dolomite, each of which contributes to changes in the reservoir quality. Cementation by calcite and dolomite has resulted in the low porosity and low permeability in the middle Bakken. Depositional facies have been defined within the middle Bakken. Cementation by carbonate minerals exert a key control on reservoir quality at scales below that of a facies. Porosity in the middle Bakken varies from 2 - 10...|$|R
