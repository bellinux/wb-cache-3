The <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> is generally calculated using a wheel calculator.

50|$|Calculation of <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> of a {{cancelled}} {{insurance policy}} is often done using a cancellation method called pro rata.

40|$|We revisit {{findings}} that returns are {{negatively related to}} financial distress intensity and leverage. These are puzzles under frictionless capital markets assumptions but are consistent with optimizing firms that differ in their exposure to financial distress costs. Firms with high costs choose low leverage to avoid distress, but they retain exposure to the systematic risk of bearing such costs in low states. Empirical {{results are consistent with}} this explanation. The <b>return</b> <b>premiums</b> to low leverage and low distress are significant in raw returns, and even stronger in risk-adjusted returns. When in distress, low-leverage firms suffer more than high-leverage firms as measured by a deterioration in accounting operating performance and heightened exposure to systematic risk. The connection between <b>return</b> <b>premiums</b> and distress costs is apparent in subperiod evidence. Both are small or insignificant prior to 1980 and larger and significant thereafter.

40|$|The study investigates how the {{coexistence}} of extreme returns and volumes predicts future stock returns {{and how the}} high-volume <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> {{is affected by the}} coexistent extreme returns.   It also examines the patterns of returns, volatility, and skewness around extreme trading volumes.   We find that stocks exhibit different return and volatility patterns prior to and after extreme volumes. We also find that the high-volume <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> only exists among small size stocks which simultaneously experience extremely low prior returns. The high-volume <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> disappears for larger size stocks experiencing extremely low prior returns.    Regardless of the firm size, the high-volume <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> only lasts for a very short time period for stocks simultaneously experiencing extremely high prior returns.   The existence of extreme volumes cancels out any potential gains from contrarian or momentum investing strategies.  </p...|$|E

The High Volume <b>Return</b> <b>Premium</b> and the Investor Recognition Hypothesis: International Evidence and Determinants We examine the high volume <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> across countries as a test of the investor recognition hypothesis. Our cross-country tests are consistent with the hypothesis in that we find the magnitude of the premium is associated with market characteristics that relate to the importance of a stock’s visibility, including proxies for information dissemination, investor confidence, and investor demographics. Further, we find that the high volume <b>return</b> <b>premium,</b> first documented by Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin (2001) for the United States, is a persistent phenomenon found in almost all developed equity markets and in emerging equity markets as well. The High Volume <b>Return</b> <b>Premium</b> and the Investor Recognition Hypothesis: International Evidence and Determinants The investor recognition hypothesis implies that incomplete information diffusion across investors affects their trading behavior and the resulting security values.

40|$|Institute, and Tilburg University for helpful {{discussions and}} comments. Part of this {{research}} was conducted while I was visiting M. I. T. Local return factors and turnover in emerging stock markets The paper shows that the factors that drive cross-sectional differences in expected stock returns in emerging equity markets are qualitatively similar to those that have been found in developed equity markets. In a sample of more than 1700 firms from 20 countries, I find that emerging market stocks exhibit momentum, small stocks outperform large stocks, and value stocks outperform growth stocks. There is no evidence that high beta stocks outperform low beta stocks. A Bayesian analysis of the <b>return</b> <b>premiums</b> shows that the combined evidence of developed and emerging markets strongly favors the hypothesis that similar return factors are present in markets around the world. Finally, the paper documents a strong cross-sectional correlation between the return factors and share turnover.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study is to explore {{short-term}} reversal effects in public securities markets. The basis {{of this study}} is to take into consideration prior work done by economists, paying particularly attention to periods specifically before and after the decimalization of the stock market in 2001. This study finds that from years 1980 - 2000, there is a monthly <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> of - 0. 0552 % or 5. 5 basis points, which is quite significant with a t-statistic of 11. 08. Following decimalization in 2001 through year 2012, this monthly <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> drops 44 % to - 0. 031 % or 3. 1 basis points, again with a high t-statistic of 4. 50.

40|$|Fama and French (1995, 1996) {{argue that}} the high-minus-low (HML) book-tomarket (B/M) factor in their 1993 three-factor model is a proxy for a distress-risk <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> and that the model is {{consistent}} with rational pricing. Alternative views are that the HML premium is caused by irrational behaviour or market inefficiencies. Dichev (1998) finds that high distress-risk firms have low, not high, B/M and earn low returns. He also finds a systematic relation between the distress-risk characteristic and return, independent of the B/M characteristic. The effect of differences in the methodology used by Fama and French (1995) and Dichev (1998) has not been examined. In addition, {{there is no evidence}} of whether a distress-risk <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> is important in describing returns. Examination of the characteristics and returns of sorted distress-risk portfolios shows that most high distress-risk, positive book-equity NYSE-AMEX firms do have high B/M. However, for both the NYSE-AMEX and NASDAQ, small firms with high distress-risk have low B/M ratios. A positive relation between distress-risk and return is not found for either NYSE-AMEX or NASDAQ firms. A distress-minus-solvent (DMS) <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> constructed using Fama and French (1993) methodology is negative and significant. Regression results show that both the HML and the DMS factors are important in describing the time-series of returns. However, the HML factor is of only marginal importance when examining sorted distress-risk portfolio returns. In addition, the HML coefficients are related to the B/M characteristic, rather than distress-risk, when both sorted distress-risk and characteristic-balanced portfolio returns are examined. The combined evidence suggests that HML cannot be interpreted as a <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> related to financial distress. However, a systematic relation does exist between distress-risk and return. The evidence supports a market inefficiency or irrational behaviour, rather than a risk based explanation of asset returns. Investors pay too much for financially distressed firms and subsequently earn low returns...|$|E
