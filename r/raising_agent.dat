25|$|Many, on {{the other}} hand, follow John Knox in celebration of the Lord's supper on a {{quarterly}} basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one's own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament {{as a means of}} grace. Some churches use bread without any <b>raising</b> <b>agent</b> (whether leaven or yeast), in view of the use of unleavened bread at Jewish Passover meals, while others use any bread available.|$|E

2500|$|Heat {{can also}} by itself cause sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{to act as}} a <b>raising</b> <b>agent</b> in baking because of thermal decomposition, releasing carbon dioxide. When used this way on its own, without the presence of an acidic component (whether in the batter or by the use of a baking powder containing acid), only half the available CO2 is released. Additionally, in the absence of acid, thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate also produces sodium carbonate, which is strongly alkaline and gives the baked product a bitter, [...] "soapy" [...] taste and a yellow color. To avoid an over-acidic taste from added acid, non-acid ingredients such as whole milk or Dutch-processed cocoa are often added to baked foods.|$|E

5000|$|A Victoria sponge is {{made using}} one of two methods. [...] The {{traditional}} method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and <b>raising</b> <b>agent</b> into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. [...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra <b>raising</b> <b>agent,</b> and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture {{one of the most}} popular for children and people in a hurry.

50|$|Food {{is placed}} inside the {{pressure}} cooker {{with a small}} amount of water or other liquid such as stock. Food is either cooked in the liquid or above the liquid to be steamed; the latter method prevents the transfer of flavors from the liquid. The lid is closed, the pressure setting is chosen and the pressure cooker is placed on a stove on the highest heat (less than high for induction cooking to allow air to be vented - see the section below for an explanation). Once the cooker reaches full pressure, the heat is lowered to maintain pressure; timing the recipe begins at this point. Recipes for foods using <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> such as steamed puddings call for gentle pre-steaming, without pressure, in order to activate the <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> prior to cooking and achieve a light, fluffy texture.|$|R

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{competition}} generally determines both {{the location and}} the extent of distortions due to information asymmetries. When agents have private information, increased competition <b>raises</b> <b>agent</b> welfare at the expense of uninformed principals. Nevertheless, increased competition among principals may lower total surplus: the losses sustained by principals as a group exceed the benefits realized by agents as a group when there is a sufficiently large proportion of agents with high cost of agent effort. These results are independent of the correlation between the agent's marginal cost and the principal's marginal benefit of agent effort. Copyright 1993 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

50|$|In Europe, soda breads {{began to}} appear in the mid-19th century when {{bicarbonate}} of soda first became available for use as a <b>raising</b> <b>agent.</b> Breads, griddle cakes and scones with bicarbonate of soda, plus cream of tartar or tartaric acid became popular in Austria, Britain, Ireland and Poland. Traditional soda bread, eaten in Serbian cuisine, also uses bicarbonate of soda, particularly the traditional česnica (Serbian Cyrillic: Чесница), a soda bread made at Christmas.|$|E
50|$|The thick batter {{contains}} eggs, flour, milk, and a <b>raising</b> <b>agent</b> such as baking powder. The batter {{can have}} ingredients such as buttermilk, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, apples, chocolate chips, cheese, or sugar added. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg {{can also be}} used. Yogurt {{may be used to}} give the pancakes a relatively moist consistency. Pancakes may be ⅓ inch (1 cm) thick and about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which {{is as simple as}} it is unpredictable. Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven. CO2 generation, on its own, is too small to account for the rise. Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the CO2 generation is stopped.|$|R
40|$|Acrylamide is an {{undesirable}} carcinogenic {{component of}} thermally processed foods being formed from reducing saccharides and asparagine. In this work, {{the effect of}} ammonium and sodium <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> themselves or in their combination with L-asparaginase enzyme catalyzing the conversion of asparagine into aspartic acid resulting in the reduction of acrylamide in gingerbreads was studied. Also, the influence of selected inorganic salts {{on the content of}} acrylamide in a model matrix simulating a composition of cereal products was observed. Simultaneously, the impact of these salts on activity of L-asparaginase was examined to find optimal conditions for its application in cereal technology. Based on experiments it was found, that addition of L-asparaginase reduces acrylamide content by 40 % while inorganic salts addition decreases acrylamide content in the range of 30 - 99 % when the most effective compounds were NH 4 Cl and CaCl 2...|$|R
50|$|The natural release method {{allows the}} {{pressure}} to drop slowly; this is achieved by removing the pressure cooker from the heat source and allowing {{the pressure to}} lower without action. It takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes (possibly longer) for the pressure to disappear before the lid can be opened. On many pressure cookers, a coloured indicator pin will drop when the pressure has gone. This natural release method is recommended for foods that foam and froth during cooking, such as rice, legumes, or recipes with <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> such as steamed puddings. The texture and tenderness of meat cooked in a pressure cooker can be improved by using the natural release method. The natural release method finishes cooking foods or recipes that have longer cooking times because {{the inside of the}} pressure cooker stays hot. This method is not recommended for foods that require very short cooking times, otherwise the food overcooks.|$|R
5000|$|A leaven , {{often called}} a {{leavening}} agent [...] (and {{also known as}} a <b>raising</b> <b>agent),</b> is any {{one of a number of}} substances used in doughs and batters that cause a foaming action (gas bubbles) that lightens and softens. An alternative or supplement to leavening agents is a mechanical action by which air is incorporated. Leavening agents can be biological or synthetic chemical compounds. The gas produced is often carbon dioxide, or occasionally hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|Prospective {{studies of}} {{cardiovascular}} risk-factors {{have shown that}} reduced plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol are associated with increased risk of coronary-disease. Experimental and translational studies have revealed several potential anti-atherogenic effects of HDL, including protective effects of HDL on endothelial cell functions. HDL has been suggested to protect endothelial cell functions by preventing oxidation of LDL and its adverse endothelial effects. Moreover, HDL from healthy subjects can directly stimulate endothelial cell production of nitric-oxide, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic effects, and endothelial-repair processes. Recent clinical-trials using HDL-cholesterol <b>raising</b> <b>agents,</b> such as torcetrapib, dalcetrapib and niacin, could not observe significant reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary-disease. Growing evidence suggests that vascular effects of HDL are highly heterogenous and vasoprotective properties of HDL are altered in patients with coronary-disease. Notably, in recent studies no clear association of higher HDL-cholesterol levels with reduced risk of cardiovascular events was observed in patients with established coronary-disease. Greater understanding of mechanisms of action of HDL and its altered vascular effects is therefore crucial {{within the context of}} HDL-targeted therapies. In this review, we will address different effects of HDL on endothelial cell functions potentially relevant to atherosclerotic vascular disease and explore molecular mechanisms leading to dysfunctional HDL...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Gluco-incretin hormones {{increase}} the glucose competence of pancreatic beta-cells by incompletely characterized mechanisms. Methods: We searched for genes that were differentially expressed in islets from control and Glp 1 r 2 / 2; Gipr 2 / 2 (dKO) mice, which show reduced glucose competence. Overexpression and knockdown studies; insulin secretion analysis; analysis of gene expression in islets from control and diabetic mice and humans {{as well as}} gene methylation and transcriptional analysis were performed. Results: Fxyd 3 was the most up-regulated gene in glucose incompetent islets from dKO mice. When overexpressed in beta-cells Fxyd 3 reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion by acting downstream of plasma membrane depolarization and Ca++ influx. Fxyd 3 expression was not acutely regulated by cAMP <b>raising</b> <b>agents</b> in either control or dKO adult islets. Instead, expression of Fxyd 3 was controlled by methylation of CpGs present in its proximal promoter region. Increased promoter methylation reduced Fxyd 3 transcription as assessed by lower abundance of H 3 K 4 me 3 at the transcriptional start site and in transcription reporter assays. This epigenetic imprinting was initiated perinatally and fully established in adult islets. Glucose incompetent islets from diabetic mice and humans showed increased expression of Fxyd 3 and reduced promoter methylation...|$|R
