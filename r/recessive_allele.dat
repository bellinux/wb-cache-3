5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|The white lion {{is not a}} {{distinct}} subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism, that causes paler colouration akin {{to that of the}} white tiger; the condition is similar to melanism, which causes dark skin. They are not albinos, but have normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lion individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity, where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is caused by a <b>recessive</b> <b>allele.</b> Reportedly, they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.|$|E
50|$|There are two alleles in this series: the <b>recessive,</b> {{wildtype}} <b>allele</b> ch and {{the dominant}} CH. The CH allele represents the T63R SLC36A1 mutation.|$|R
50|$|It wasn’t until 1910 that W. E. Castle and C. C. Little {{confirmed}} Cuénot’s work, further {{demonstrating that}} {{one quarter of}} the offspring were dying during embryonic development. This was the first documented example of a <b>recessive</b> lethal <b>allele.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{the mapping}} of the cream gene, this locus was titled C for [...] "color". There are two alleles in the series: the <b>recessive,</b> {{wildtype}} <b>allele</b> C and the incomplete dominant CCr. The CCr allele represents the N153D MATP mutation.|$|R
25|$|However, a {{recessive}} black gene also {{occurs in}} a few domestic dog breeds (notably in all black German Shepherds, but also in some black Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Belgian Shepherds). This <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> is a <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> in the Agouti gene in dogs (R96C arginine to cysteine mutation at codon 96).|$|E
25|$|These chimeras arise by {{spontaneous}} or {{induced mutation}} {{of a nuclear}} gene to a dominant or <b>recessive</b> <b>allele.</b> As a rule one character is affected {{at a time in}} the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.|$|E
25|$|Peach and {{nectarines}} are {{the same}} species, {{even though they are}} regarded commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, nectarines are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); genetic studies suggest nectarines are produced due to a <b>recessive</b> <b>allele,</b> whereas peaches are produced from a dominant allele for fuzzy skin.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the {{monohybrid}} cross {{is used to}} determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele's</b> phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|R
40|$|A {{defect in}} {{apoptotic}} signal transmission through CD 95 {{is an essential}} genetic mechanism for lymphoproliferation and autoimmunities in lpr or gld mice. However, disease manifestations are largely affected by the host genetic background. To identify and map such host genes modifying lpr gene effect, ie, the lpr modifier (Lprm) genes, 82 MRL/lpr x (MRL/lpr x C 3 H/lpr) F 1 mice were subjected to immunopathological and genetical analyses. High-grade vasculitis and glomerulonephritis among backcross mice were observed in separate groups of mice. Microsatellite analysis revealed {{that there were two}} host genes affecting the occurrence of vasculitis, Lprm 1 (chromosome 4) and Lprm 2 (chromosome 3). A <b>recessive</b> MRL <b>allele</b> at Lprm 1 enhanced vasculitis to occur in both sexes, whereas that of Lprm 2 inhibited its development selectively in females. Genotype combinations of these two genes explained the severity of vasculitis in crosses of MRL/lpr and C 3 H/lpr mice and also the vasculitis-prone recombinant inbred strain McH 5 /lpr. A <b>recessive</b> MRL <b>allele</b> at Lprm 3 (chromosome 14) suppressed glomerulonephritis. The weight of the spleen was increased by a <b>recessive</b> MRL <b>allele</b> at Lprm 4 (chromosome 5) yielding a logarithm of odds score of 2. 02 in a quantitative trait locus analysis. In contrast, the weight of axillary lymph nodes was increased by a <b>recessive</b> MRL <b>allele</b> at a locus on chromosome 2, but its presence was not supported by the quantitative trait locus analysis. The titer of anti-dsDNA autoantibody was controlled by the locus Lprm 5 on chromosome 16, which had an logarithm of odds score of 3. 41. Possible candidate genes for Lprm genes deduced from their map locations are discussed and compared with the autoimmunity genes reported thus far. In conclusion, autoimmune disease manifestations by the lpr mutation are affected by multiple host genes separately...|$|R

25|$|One {{example of}} the founder effect {{is found in the}} Amish {{migration}} to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two {{of the founders of the}} colony in Pennsylvania carried the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Because the Amish tend to be religious isolates, they interbreed, and through generations of this practice the frequency of Ellis–van Creveld syndrome in the Amish people is much higher than the frequency in the general population.|$|E
25|$|The gene HIC (high carbon dioxide) encodes a {{negative}} regulator {{for the development}} of stomata in plants. perception to stomatal development | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | pages = 713–716 }} Research into the HIC gene using Arabidopsis thaliana found no increase of stomatal development in the dominant allele, but in the ‘wild type’ <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> showed a large increase, both in response to rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere. These studies imply the plants response to changing CO2 levels is largely controlled by genetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele for red hair, and the mother has two copies for brown hair, all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for red hair and one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} dominant allele, and the allele that is overridden is called the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele.</b> In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she ends up with brown hair.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the genetics and molecular biology of orange flesh colour in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). To this end the natural diversity in three genes of the carotenoid pathway was assessed by SNP analyses. Association analysis was performed between SNP haplotypes and flesh colour phenotypes in diploid and tetraploid potato genotypes. We observed that among eleven beta-carotene hydroxylase 2 (Chy 2) alleles only one dominant allele has a major effect, changing white into yellow flesh colour. In contrast, none of the lycopene epsilon cyclase (Lcye) alleles {{seemed to have a}} large effect on flesh colour. Analysis of zeaxanthin epoxidase (Zep) alleles showed that all (diploid) genotypes with orange tuber flesh were homozygous for one specific Zep allele. This Zep allele showed a reduced level of expression. The complete genomic sequence of the <b>recessive</b> Zep <b>allele,</b> including the promoter, was determined, and compared with the sequence of other Zep alleles. The most striking difference was the presence of a non-LTR retrotransposon sequence in intron 1 of the <b>recessive</b> Zep <b>allele,</b> which was absent in all other Zep alleles investigated. We hypothesise that the presence of this large sequence in intron 1 caused the lower expression level, resulting in reduced Zep activity and accumulation of zeaxanthin. Only genotypes combining presence of the dominant Chy 2 allele with homozygosity for the <b>recessive</b> Zep <b>allele</b> produced orange-fleshed tubers that accumulated large amounts of zeaxanthi...|$|R
25|$|Since SSI is {{determined}} by a diploid genotype, the pollen and pistil each express the translation products of two different alleles, i.e. two male and two female determinants. Dominance relationships often exist between pairs of alleles, resulting in complicated patterns of compatibility/self-incompatibility. These dominance relationships also allow the generation of individuals homozygous for a <b>recessive</b> S <b>allele.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{effect of}} linkage between roan and {{chestnut}} is readily observed. If a horse possesses one chromosome with the wildtype non-chestnut allele and the dominant roan allele (E and Rn), {{while the other}} chromosome contains the <b>recessive</b> chestnut <b>allele</b> and the <b>recessive</b> non-roan <b>allele</b> (e and rn), he will outwardly appear blue roan, barring the influence of other genes. Normally, the chestnut and roan alleles would be separated during chromosomal crossover, but these two linked genes will usually remain together. Such a horse will produce sex cells that are either E/Rn or e/rn. Mated to chestnut non-roan partners (e/rn), the horse would produce primarily blue roans, or chestnut non-roans, but few chestnut roans and few black non-roans. If, on the other hand, the recessive e and dominant Rn {{were on the same}} chromosome, the horse would be expected to produce primarily chestnut roans and non-chestnut non-roans with chestnut, non-roan partners.|$|R
25|$|The {{existence}} of white Siberian tigers {{has not been}} scientifically documented, despite occasional unsubstantiated reports of sightings of white tigers in the regions where wild Siberian tigers live. It {{may be that the}} white mutation does not exist in the wild Siberian tiger population: no white Siberian tigers have been born in captivity, {{despite the fact that the}} subspecies has been extensively bred during the last few decades (with much outbreeding between the different Siberian lineages for purposes of conservation genetics); a <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> should occasionally turn up in a homozygous state during such breeding, and in this particular case yield white tigers from normally-colored parents, but no such animals have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The progeny in {{this case}} {{received}} two dominant alleles linked on one chromosome (referred to as coupling or cis arrangement). However, after crossover, some progeny could have received one parental chromosome with a dominant allele for one trait (e.g. Purple) linked to a <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> for a second trait (e.g. round) with the opposite being true for the other parental chromosome (e.g. red and Long). This {{is referred to as}} repulsion or a trans arrangement. The phenotype here would still be purple and long but a test cross of this individual with the recessive parent would produce progeny with much greater proportion of the two crossover phenotypes. While such a problem may not seem likely from this example, unfavourable repulsion linkages do appear when breeding for disease resistance in some crops.|$|E
25|$|Now {{imagine that}} this woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the <b>recessive</b> <b>allele.</b> Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E

Though fuzzy peaches and nectarines are regarded commercially as different fruits, with nectarines often erroneously believed to be a crossbreed between peaches and plums, or a [...] "peach with a plum skin", nectarines belong to the same species as peaches.

40|$|The seed of all wild Glycine accessions {{have black}} or brown {{pigments}} {{because of the}} homozygous <b>recessive</b> i <b>allele</b> in combination with alleles at the R and T loci. In contrast, nearly all commercial soybean (Glycine max) varieties are yellow due {{to the presence of}} a dominant allele of the I locus (either I or i) that inhibits pigmentation in the seed coats. Spontaneous mutations to the <b>recessive</b> i <b>allele</b> occur in these varieties and result in pigmented seed coats. We have isolated a clone for a soybean dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) gene using polymerase chain reaction. We examined expression of DFR and two other genes of the flavonoid pathway during soybean seed coat development in a series of near-isogenic isolines that vary in pigmentation as specified by combinations of alleles of the I, R, and T loci. The expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and DFR mRNAs was similar in all of the gene combinations at each stage of seed coat development. In contrast, chalcone synthase (CHS) mRNA was barely detectable at all stages of development in seed coats that carry the dominant I allele that results in yellow seed coats. CHS activity in yellow seed coats (I) was also 7 - to 10 -fold less than in the pigmented seed coats that have the homozygous <b>recessive</b> i <b>allele.</b> It appears that the dominant I allele results in reduction of CHS mRNA, leading to reduction of CHS activity as the basis for inhibition of anthocyanin and proanthocyanin synthesis in soybean seed coats. A further connection between CHS and the I locus is indicated by the occurrence of multiple restriction site polymorphisms in genomic DNA blots of the CHS gene family in near-isogenic lines containing alleles of the I locus...|$|R

This is called [...] "ghost striping". Melanistic and non-melanistic animals can be littermates. It is thought that melanism may confer a selective advantage under certain conditions since it is more common in regions of dense forest, where light levels are lower. Recently, preliminary studies also suggest that melanism might be linked to beneficial mutations in the immune system.|$|E
2500|$|... {{determined}} by a simple dominant gene in Rana limnocharis, Rana ridibunda, Rana sylvatica and Rana arvalis; that means the individuals both homozygtes by allele determining the presence of stripe and heterozygotes have the stripe, whereas only the individuals homozygotic by <b>recessive</b> <b>allele</b> are non-striped. The proportions of striped specimens in populations of some frogs show clinal variations. For example, the proportion of striped Rana sylvatica in North America generally increases towards the west and north. The variations {{in the proportion of}} different color may relate to either genetic-stochastic processes. or their adaptive importance. For different colour morphs of Acris crepitans, the hypothesis about the direct adaptive value of different colour morphs (for escaping predation) competes with the hypothesis that these morphs correlate with thermotolerance. Striped specimens Rana sylvatica, striped specimens better perform in open areas. Differences in the proportion of striped frogs in Rana arvalis are explained with physiological differences between the morphs. Striped recently metamorphosed frogs have a relatively large liver, in comparison with unstriped ones, and their weight increases more rapidly. Tadpoles of striped Rana arvalis need more time for completing metamorphosis but, after metamorphosis, their growth is faster than that of unstriped froglets. In a frog widespread in Turkey and the Caucasus, Rana macrocnemis, the proportion of frogs with the stripe increases with the altitude in mountains of the Lesser Caucasus, but not in the Greater Caucasus. Given the same altitude, non-striped frogs from the Greater Caucasus grow slower and maturate later than the striped frogs from the Lesser Caucasus, which provides them selective advantage in high mountains, but their tadpoles are likely to be less resistant to overheating than those of the non-striped frogs.|$|E
