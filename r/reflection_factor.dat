40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> of affine Toda field theories on the half-line x ≤ 0. First, we consider the classical background configurations of low rank a,(^(1)) affine Toda theories with a boundary, constructed by the analytic-continuation of soliton solutions of the corresponding imaginary-coupling theories. We show {{that only a small}} subset of such solutions provide acceptable vacuum configurations. These are classified according to the integrable boundary conditions they obey and their classical <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> are considered. We next consider the quantum theories, where we aim to provide evidence for or against exact <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> proposed in the literature. We do this by explicit calculation of the low-order coupling dependence of the <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> via perturbation theory. Two particular examples are considered in detail. The first is the O(β(^ 2)) calculation for a(_ 2) (^ 1) affine Toda field theory with the boundary condition. This will be a good example to study since it is the subject of many conjectured exact <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> and also demonstrates the renormalisation of the boundary potential required to retain quantum integrability. The second example will be the O(β(^ 4)) calculation for sinh-Gordon theory. In light of the added complexity of the higher-order calculation we consider only the Neumann boundary condition. Finally we look at the renormalisation of sinh-Gordon theory and its duality properties...|$|R

The requirements of boundary unitarity and boundary crossing symmetry are then used to find overall scalar factors which lead to consistent reflection matrices. Using the boundary bootstrap equations we also compute the <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> for scalar bound states (breathers).

50|$|Despite {{the use of}} {{aluminum}} in generic mirrors, aluminum is not always used as the reflective layer for a solar mirror. The use of silver as the reflective layer is claimed to lead to higher efficiency levels, {{because it is the}} most reflective metal. This is because {{of aluminum}}'s <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> in the UV region of the spectrum. Locating the aluminum layer on the first surface exposes it to weathering, which reduces the mirror's resistance to corrosion and makes it more susceptible to abrasion. Adding a protective layer to the aluminum would reduce its reflectivity.|$|E
50|$|The above {{discussion}} merely {{illustrates a}} simple picture of mode and ray theory. More detailed treatments require a large computer program. In particular, {{it is difficult}} {{to solve the problem of}} the horizontal and vertical inhomogeneities of the waveguide. The effect of the Earth's curvature is, that near the antipode the field strength slightly increases. Due to the influence of the Earth' magnetic field, the medium becomes anisotropic so that the ionospheric <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> in reality is a matrix. This means that a vertically polarized incident wave after reflection at the ionospheric D-layer converses to a vertically and a horizontally polarized wave. Moreover, the geomagnetic field gives rise to a nonreciprocity of VLF waves. Waves propagating from east to west are more strongly attenuated than vice versa. There appears a phase slipping near the distance of the deep interference minimum of eq. (3). During the times of sunrise and/or sunset, there is sometimes a phase gain or loss of 360° because of the irreversible behavior of the first sky wave.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} quantum <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> of the sinh-Gordon model under {{boundary}} conditions consistent with integrability. First, we review the affine Toda field theory in Chapter One. In particular, the classical and quantum integrability {{of the theory}} are reviewed on the whole line and on the half-line as well, that is, {{in the presence of}} a boundary. We next consider the sinh-Gordon model which is restricted to a half-line by boundary conditions maintaining integrability in Chapter Two. A perturbative calculation of the <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> is given to one loop order in the bulk coupling and to first order in the difference of the two parameters introduced at the boundary. The result provides a further verification of Ghoshal's formula. The calculation is consistent with a conjecture for the general dependence of the <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> on the boundary parameters and the bulk coupling. In Chapter Three, quantum corrections to the classical <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> of the sinh-Gordon model are studied up to second order in the difference of boundary data and to one loop order in the bulk coupling. Chapter Four deals with the quantum <b>reflection</b> <b>factor</b> for the sinh-Gordon model with general boundary conditions. The model is studied under boundary conditions which are compatible with integrability and in the framework of the conventional perturbation theory generalised to the affine Toda field theory. It is found that the general form of a subset of the related quantum corrections are hypergeometric functions. Finally, we sum up this thesis in Chapter Five along with some conclusions and suggestions for further future studies.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> (R Xi Deltapr/DeltapI) for weak-shock reflections from various surfaces.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectrum}} of the scaling Lee-Yang model on a finite interval from two points of view: via a generalisation of the truncated conformal space approach to systems with boundaries, and via the boundary thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. This allows <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> to be matched with specific boundary conditions, and leads us to propose a new (and non-minimal) family of <b>reflection</b> <b>factors</b> to describe the one relevant boundary perturbation in the model. The equations proposed previously for the ground state on an interval must be revised in certain regimes, and we find the necessary modifications by analytic continuation. We also propose new equations to describe excited states, and check all equations against boundary truncated conformal space data. Access to the finite-size spectrum enables us to observe boundary flows when the bulk remains massless, {{and the formation of}} boundary bound states when the bulk is massive.
