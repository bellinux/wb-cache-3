5|$|Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim {{have shown}} a {{relationship}} between maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child <b>recklessness,</b> separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E
5|$|Michael's <b>recklessness</b> makes a {{complete}} mess {{of the warehouse}} while jeopardizing the employees' safety. Michael's plans to hold his own seminar backfire when the warehouse workers' gripe session leads to them deciding to form a union. Jan intimidates them into reconsidering, citing a liquidation of the branch {{if it were to}} unionize.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional <b>recklessness</b> exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1854 a capsized ship's boat {{bearing the}} name Bella was {{discovered}} off the Brazilian coast, together with some wreckage but no personnel, and the ship's loss with all hands was assumed. The Tichborne family were told in June that Roger must be presumed lost, though they retained a faint hope, fed by rumours, that another ship {{had picked up}} survivors and taken them to Australia. Sir James Tichborne died in June 1862, at which point, if he was alive, Roger became the 11th baronet. As he was by then presumed dead, the title passed to his younger brother Alfred, whose financial <b>recklessness</b> rapidly brought about his near-bankruptcy. Tichborne Park was vacated and leased to tenants.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's <b>recklessness</b> and disobedience during the {{invasion}} of France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, {{with the}} support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was {{appointed}} an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing the uniform of a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Ch√¢teau d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for <b>recklessness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ted Harbison (Kevin Kaine) {{is found}} dead in a park. Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) investigates into his death and whilst investigating, it is {{revealed}} Ted had surgery just before he died, and Megan finds three surgical staples that weren't closed fully, causing him to bleed out internally, causing Megan to think that Ted was murdered. Megan visits her old hospital, where she was once a neurosurgeon. Ted's surgeon, Doctor Chandler (Marc Blucas) {{has a reputation for}} <b>recklessness</b> whilst performing surgeries and Megan finds out that the video was never turned on, meaning the surgery was never recorded. Whilst at the hospital, Megan meets her old friend and the hospital administrator Gwen Baldwin (Carolyn McCormick) and whilst there Gwen reveals her son died of an overdose. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis (Windell Middlebrooks) autopsy Jessica Archer (Christina Hendricks), with both Ethan and Curtis unsure how she died. Jessica's twin sister arrives, Karen (Hendricks), and she and Ethan are attracted to each other.|$|E
5|$|The prize, a 24-gun {{corvette}} named Utile, {{was taken}} into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796. Macnamara's later service with Nelson included the capture of Portoferraio, the evacuations of Caprera and Corsica, and expeditions against Piombino and Castiglione. Macnamara had already developed a reputation for intrepidity bordering on <b>recklessness,</b> and he displayed these qualities again in {{an attack on the}} 18-gun Spanish brig Corso in a strong gale under enemy shore batteries. The first attempt to capture her failed, with only one man, the coxswain, getting on board. Macnamara tried again, managing to place 30 men aboard the Spanish ship, at which she surrendered. Having done so the weather prevented any further attempt to make contact with the prize. One of Macnamara's last acts in support of the Mediterranean Fleet was {{to take part in the}} Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, in which Southampton formed part of the centre of the line as a repeating frigate.|$|E
5|$|Where his {{political}} and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, Julia Flavia, but Domitian was adamant in his love for Domitia Longina, {{going so far as}} to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself. Despite its initial <b>recklessness,</b> the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes <b>recklessness</b> and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child <b>recklessness,</b> separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E
25|$|The {{new laws}} {{more than double}} the maximum penalty for sedition from three years {{imprisonment}} to seven, and allow certain convictions relating to the use of force or violence on the basis of <b>recklessness</b> rather than proven intent.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 2006, {{the court}} found Zuma not guilty of rape, agreeing with Zuma that the sexual act in {{question}} was consensual. Judge van der Merwe lambasted the accuser for lying to the court, but also censured Zuma for his <b>recklessness.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the Iranian government, the {{shooting}} down of IR 655 by Vincennes was an intentionally performed and unlawful act. Even {{if there was}} a mistaken identification, which Iran has not accepted, it argues that this constituted gross negligence and <b>recklessness</b> amounting to an international crime, not an accident.|$|E
25|$|Affective {{disorders}} {{have long}} been recognised as a complication of AAS use. Case reports describe both hypomania and mania, along with irritability, elation, <b>recklessness,</b> racing thoughts and feelings of power and invincibility that {{did not meet the}} criteria for mania/hypomania. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance.|$|E
25|$|P - Psychoticism/Socialisation: Psychoticism is {{associated}} {{not only with}} the liability to have a psychotic episode (or break with reality), but also with aggression. Psychotic behavior is rooted in the characteristics of toughmindedness, non-conformity, inconsideration, <b>recklessness,</b> hostility, anger and impulsiveness. The physiological basis suggested by Eysenck for psychoticism is testosterone, with higher levels of psychoticism associated with higher levels of testosterone.|$|E
25|$|The {{privatization}} programme {{came with}} great surrounding controversies with lacked competition as the programme was largely controlled by favored insider. The <b>recklessness</b> and favoritism shown in privatization {{of the industrial}} and banking units by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif was to become the hallmark {{and the rise of}} strong business oligarch who have concentrated enormous assets, further increasing the wealth gap in Pakistan and contributing to the political instability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Recklessness</b> {{among the}} boatmen was common. Many {{accidents}} {{were due to}} excessive speed. Aqueduct #3 (Catoctin) had a sharp bend at the upstream end, had been {{the site of a}} number of collisions from boatmen going too fast. In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless boatmen in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.|$|E
25|$|An inquiry {{was held}} under The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 into the {{circumstances}} of the loss of Hilda. It was held at the Caxton Hall, Caxton St, London with the Court of Inquiry sitting on 1, 2 and 8 February 1906. The inquiry found that the ship was seaworthy, with lifesaving equipment provision meeting the legislated standard of the time. There was no finding of <b>recklessness</b> or negligence on the part of Captain Gregory.|$|E
25|$|Roj Blake, {{played by}} Gareth Thomas (commander of the Liberator crew for series 1‚Äì2). Blake is a {{long-term}} political dissident who uses the Liberator to wage war on the Federation. He is passionately opposed to the Federation's injustice and corruption, and prepared to accept loss of life in pursuit of its destruction. He thinks nothing of placing himself in danger to protect his crew or advance his cause. Although respected by many of his crew members, Avon accuses him of fanaticism and <b>recklessness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{reviewed}} R v Quick, {{which had}} dealt with an allegation of assault occasioning actual bodily harm not requiring proof of specific intent. That decision suggested {{that even if the}} hypoglycaemia was induced by some action or inaction by the accused, his defence will not necessarily fail. However, the judge in Bailey's trial had not directed the jury to consider that situation. The court also pointed out that self-induced incapacity, as in Bailey's case, may be evidence of <b>recklessness</b> sufficient to attach guilt for crimes of basic intent.|$|E
25|$|John Bell Hood (June 1 or June 29, 1831 ‚Äì August 30, 1879) was a Confederate general {{during the}} American Civil War. Hood had a {{reputation}} for bravery and aggressiveness that sometimes bordered on <b>recklessness.</b> Arguably one of the best brigade and division commanders in the Confederate States Army, Hood gradually became increasingly ineffective as he was promoted to lead larger, independent commands late in the war; his career and reputation were marred by his decisive defeats leading an army in the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign.|$|E
25|$|Tarleton's {{apparent}} <b>recklessness</b> {{in pushing}} his command so hard {{in pursuit of}} Morgan that they reached the battlefield {{in desperate need of}} rest and food may be explained by the fact that, up until Cowpens, every battle that he and his British Legion had fought in the South had been a relatively easy victory. He appears to have been so concerned with pursuing Morgan that he quite forgot that it was necessary for his men to be in a fit condition to fight a battle once they caught him, though Cornwallis himself did press Tarleton to take aggressive action.|$|E
25|$|On the outside, Victoria is a {{typically}} fragile lady of her era, frequently screaming {{when faced with}} the creatures the Doctor and his companions encounter in their travels, such as the Cybermen and the Yeti. However, this exterior hides an inner strength that crops up when needed. Victoria may be young, but she has an instinct for when she is being lied to, and her sensibility is a contrast to the <b>recklessness</b> of Jamie and the curiosity of the Doctor. Jamie, in particular, is very protective towards and fond of Victoria, and is heartbroken when she chooses to leave.|$|E
25|$|Judge Perry offered jurors three {{conviction}} options: {{second-degree murder}} (with {{a sentence of}} 15 years to life in prison), voluntary manslaughter (3 to 11 years), or involuntary manslaughter (2 to 4 years); in addition the jury could have decided to acquit. Prosecutor Michael O'Brien said that by shooting Grant, Mehserle inherently committed a crime. Intention meant murder or voluntary manslaughter, and an accident indicated <b>recklessness</b> on Mehserle's part and thus involuntary manslaughter. Judge Perry gave two interpretations of Mehserle's shocked reaction after shooting Grant: either Mehserle had intended to use his Taser or he realized that many people were witnesses to his action.|$|E
25|$|<b>Recklessness,</b> greed, and overoptimism {{played a}} part in the early-20th-century {{financial}} crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the Palliser Triangle, a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments.|$|E
25|$|The son of pirate {{parents who}} abandon him at age ten, , nicknamed , is taken in as an {{apprentice}} by a shipwright who secretly holds the plans for a devastating ancient weapon. Franky's <b>recklessness</b> eventually {{provides an opportunity for}} World Government agents seeking these plans. Attempting to rescue his master, Franky suffers severe injuries and only survives by rebuilding parts of his body using pieces of scrap metal, turning himself into a cola-powered cyborg with super-human strength. After gaining notoriety as , and to fulfill his dream of sailing a ship he built around the world, he constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{intoxication}} on criminal responsibility varies by jurisdiction and offense. The criminal code in question may require proof of {{various levels of}} intent. This may range from premeditation, through various degrees of intent or willingness to commit a crime, general <b>recklessness,</b> and finally no intent at all in some instances of strict liability. Intoxication {{may serve as a}} defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes hinge on whether the defendant's intoxication was voluntary or involuntary: the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.|$|E
25|$|Beowulf's {{fight with}} the dragon has been {{described}} variously {{as an act of}} either altruism or <b>recklessness.</b> In contrast with the previous battles, the {{fight with the}} dragon occurs in Beowulf's kingdom and ends in defeat, whereas Beowulf fought the other monsters victoriously in a land distant from his home. The dragon fight is foreshadowed with earlier events: Scyld Shefing's funeral and Sigmund's death by dragon, as recounted by a bard in Hrothgar's hall. Beowulf scholar Alexander writes that the dragon fight likely signifies Beowulf's (and by extension, society's) battle against evil. The people's fate depend on the outcome of the fight between the hero and the dragon, and, as a hero, Beowulf must knowingly face death.|$|E
25|$|Jerad Dwain Miller (January 3, 1983 ‚Äì June 8, 2014) {{was born}} in Pasco, Washington. He was arrested for {{multiple}} offenses in Indiana and Washington, starting in 2001. In 2007, {{he was sentenced to}} a diversion program after pleading guilty to a felony criminal <b>recklessness</b> charge. In 2009, Jerad {{was arrested and charged with}} battery, but was acquitted later that year. In 2011, he was sentenced to two years of probation and drug counseling after pleading guilty to felony drug charges. That same year, he met Amanda Woodruff, with whom he applied for a marriage license in Tippecanoe County, Indiana in August. They later married on September 22. Prior to the shooting, he worked as a street performer.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} team just eight {{days after the}} sale, as star forward Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in a one-car {{accident}} that seriously injured both himself and Thrashers center Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw and arm, a sprained wrist and a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL); Snyder died five days later due to septic shock from his injuries. The Thrashers dedicated their entire 2003‚Äì04 season to Snyder's memory, and Thrashers players wore black patches with Snyder's number, 37, on their jerseys for the season. Heatley's blood alcohol content was below the legal limit, but his combination of speeding (he was driving an estimated 80 miles per hour) and <b>recklessness</b> led to criminal charges, which were later dropped. He eventually received three years' probation and community service.|$|E
25|$|The {{privatisation}} programme {{came as a}} direct response to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Peoples party led by Benazir and, for instance, Sharif's spontaneous {{privatisation programme}} was swift as nationalisation programme of peoples party in the 1970s. However Prime minister Sharif lacked the charisma and personality of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but countered Bhutto's ideology with full force, by imitating him. During the period of 1990‚Äì93, around 115 nationalised industries were put under private-ownership management but this programme came with highest surrounding controversies with lacked competition as the programme was largely controlled by favoured insider. The <b>recklessness</b> and favouritism shown in privatisation of the industrial and banking units by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif was to become the hallmark {{and the rise of}} strong business oligarch who have concentrated enormous assets, further increasing the wealth gap in Pakistan and contributing to the political instability.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1665, he {{was called}} upon to fight again, being given a joint {{commission}} with Prince Rupert against the Dutch in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The whole burden of the preparations fell upon him. On 23 April 1666 the admirals joined the fleet, and on 1 June 1666 began the great Four Days' Battle, in which Monck showed not only all his old coolness and skill, but also a reckless daring which had seemed hitherto foreign to his character. As this <b>recklessness</b> had cost the English many ships, command of the fleet was taken from him and given to Rupert, whom he would accompany in the St. James's Day Battle, the last battle at sea {{in which he would}} participate. Later in the same year he maintained order in the city of London during the Great Fire of London.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is <b>recklessness.</b> It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E
25|$|The Spartan hoplite {{followed}} a strict laconic code of honor. No soldier was considered superior to another. Suicidal recklesness, berserkery, and rage were prohibited in a Spartan army, as these behaviors endangered the phalanx. <b>Recklessness</b> {{could lead to}} dishonor, {{as in the case}} of Aristodemus. Spartans regarded those who fight, while still wishing to live, as more valorous than those who don't care if they die. They believed that a warrior must not fight with raging anger, but with calmed determination. By the laconic way of life, Spartans must walk without any noise, and speak only with few words. Other ways for Spartans to be dishonored were dropping the shield (rhipsaspia), failing to complete the training, and deserting in battle. Dishonored Spartans were labeled outcasts, and were forced to wear different clothing for public humiliation. In battle, stories of valor were told to inspire troops and, before a major confrontation, they sang soft songs to calm the nerves.|$|E
25|$|As Kenway, {{the player}} must unravel a {{conspiracy}} between high-ranking Templars within the British and Spanish empires who, {{under the guise}} of cleaning up piracy in the Caribbean, have used their positions to locate the Sage‚Äîlater identified as Bartholomew Roberts‚Äîwho is the only man that can lead them to the Observatory, a First Civilization device which can monitor anyone anywhere in the world when provided a blood sample, which they intend to use to spy on and blackmail world leaders. Kenway becomes an unwitting player in their plot when he kills a rogue Assassin, Duncan Walpole. Seeing an opportunity for profit, Kenway takes Walpole's place at a meeting of Templars in Havana, where he meets Woodes Rogers as well as Cuban Governor, and Templar Grandmaster, Laureano Torres. His <b>recklessness</b> endangers the entire Assassins' Order, prompting him to pursue the Sage and the conspirators from the Yucat√°n Peninsula to Jamaica, eventually catching Roberts on the island of Pr√≠ncipe off of the African coast.|$|E
