5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the <b>revised</b> <b>form</b> ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those who support it.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its <b>revised</b> <b>form,</b> marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E

The Safety and Health Program Assessment Worksheet (<b>Revised</b> OSHA <b>Form</b> 33) is the instrument used by consultants to assess an organization’s OHSMS and provide feedback on how to improve a system. A survey was developed to determine the usefulness of the <b>Revised</b> OSHA <b>Form</b> 33 from the perspective of Colorado OSHA consultation clients. One hundred and seven clients who had received consultation services within a six-year period responded to the survey. The vast majority of respondents indicated that the <b>Revised</b> OSHA <b>Form</b> 33 accurately reflected their OHSMS and that information provided on the <b>Revised</b> OSHA <b>Form</b> 33 was helpful for improving their systems. Specific outcomes reported by the respondents included increased safety awareness, reduced injuries, and improved morale. The results indicate that the OHSMS assistance provided by OSHA consultation is beneficial for clients and that the <b>Revised</b> OSHA <b>Form</b> 33 can be an effective tool for assessing and communicating OHSMS results to business management. Detailed comments and suggestions provided on the <b>Revised</b> OSHA <b>Form</b> 33 are helpful for clients to improve their OHSMS...|$|R

25|$|While {{assembling}} the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor {{was unable to}} find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by Prince, he played all the instruments except drums himself. Reznor has continued in this role on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians, assistants, drummers and rhythm experts. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1988 as Purest Feeling and many of these songs appeared in <b>revised</b> <b>form</b> on Pretty Hate Machine, Reznor's first official release under the Nine Inch Nails name.|$|E
25|$|The last general {{revision}} of the General Roman Calendar was in 1969 and was authorized by the motu proprio Mysterii Paschalis of Pope Paul VI.

This contained also the official document Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, and the list of celebrations of the General Roman Calendar.

During this period, Italy had been able to recapture the record, achieving a recorded maximum altitude of 51,364ft (15,656m). In response, on 30 June 1937, Flight Lieutenant M.J. Adam undertook a 2¼-hour flight in which he achieved a record altitude, later certified as 53,937ft (16,440m). Despite the canopy cockpit suffering a major crack during this pioneering flight, Adam was protected from injury by his pressure suit and helmet.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1940s {{to the early}} 1970s, {{compulsory}} military training (CMT) was twice established by a National Party government (the {{first time on the}} basis of a referendum) and then abolished by a Labour Party government. On 3 August 1949 a national referendum was held in regards to instituting CMT, and conscription into the Territorial Force of the New Zealand Army. The vote was 553,016 in favour of conscription and 152,443 against. More than 60,000 young New Zealanders completed the 18 weeks of training. The second Labour government abolished the programme in 1958, but it was reinstated in <b>revised</b> <b>form</b> after Labour lost power. About 3,000 young 18-year-olds were selected annually by a ballot of birthdates. The scheme was abolished by the third Labour government on 31 December 1972. Since that date, all service in the New Zealand Armed Forces has been voluntary. Conscripts were never sent to battle zones in this period, although many opted to continue their military careers and fight in Malaysia, Vietnam and other theatres of conflict.|$|E

500|$|After 1716–17, Rinaldo was {{not seen}} on the London stage until 1731, when it was revived in its <b>revised</b> <b>form</b> at the King's Theatre.

The 1731 production of Rinaldo received six performances, bringing the London total for the work to 53 in Handel's lifetime, the most for any of his operas. After 1731 Handel had fewer stage successes, and performances of his operas became rarer.

In response to pressures from TVT Records for a follow-up to Nine Inch Nails' commercially successful debut, Reznor began recording the Broken extended play in secret.

500|$|In 1689, the Royal Mint {{began using}} a {{design for the}} reverse of the four low-denomination silver coins {{depicting}} a crowned numeral. The designer is unknown (Richard Lobel, in his catalogue of British coins, suggests the artist was George Bower, {{an employee of the}} Royal Mint whose medals bear similar characteristics) but his work has endured, in a <b>revised</b> <b>form,</b> for over 300 years. In 1822 an amended reverse was introduced, and has been struck every year since then in all four denominations. The 1822 reverse design, which places the crowned numeral within an oak wreath, was created by Jean Baptiste Merlen. This design is still struck each year, though the crown was altered in 1888, as was the appearance of the numeral [...] "2" [...] on the twopence. These changes were made by Royal Mint engraver Leonard Charles Wyon. A proposal by the Royal Mint in 1950 to return to the pre-1888 [...] "2" [...] as more artistic was refused by George VI, who felt the current numeral was stylistically similar to the numerals on the other coins, and the pre-1888 [...] "2" [...] was not.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, Trent Reznor played {{keyboard}} in a Cleveland {{band called}} the Exotic Birds, then managed by John Malm, Jr. Reznor and Malm became friends, and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds {{to work on}} music of his own, Malm informally became his manager. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios, in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him [...] "just a little wear on [...] tape heads". While completing the early recordings, Reznor {{was unable to find}} a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series.

Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in <b>revised</b> <b>form</b> on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989).
