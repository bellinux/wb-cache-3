Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the medications.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the single and joint associations of maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) with pregnancy outcomes in Tianjin, China. METHODS: Between June 2009 and May 2011, health care records of 33, 973 pregnant women were collected and their children were measured for birth weight and birth length. The independent and joint associations of prepregnancy BMI and GWG based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines with the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were examined by using Logistic Regression. RESULTS: After adjustment for all confounding factors, maternal prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean delivery, preterm delivery, large-for-gestational age infant (LGA), and macrosomia, and inversely associated with <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> small-for-gestational age infant (SGA) and low birth weight. Maternal excessive GWG was associated with increased <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean delivery, LGA, and macrosomia, and decreased <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> preterm delivery, SGA, and low birth weight. Maternal inadequate GWG was associated with increased <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> preterm delivery and SGA, and decreased <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> LGA and macrosomia, compared with maternal adequate GWG. Women with both prepregnancy obesity and excessive GWG had 2. 2 - 5. 9 folds higher <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> GDM, pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean delivery, LGA, and macrosomia compared with women with normal prepregnancy BMI and adequate GWG. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal prepregnancy obesity and excessive GWG were associated with greater <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean delivery, and greater infant size at birth. Health care providers should inform women to start the pregnancy with a BMI in the normal weight category and limit their GWG to the range specified for their prepregnancy BMI...|$|R

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} risk for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE risk is thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation {{is estimated to be}} between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE risk is long-term anticoagulation a common consideration. Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.|$|E
