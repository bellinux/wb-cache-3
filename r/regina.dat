5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in her teens, <b>Regina</b> {{traveled}} to Germany {{to visit her}} brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and <b>Regina</b> had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence of anti-Semitism under Stalin prompted <b>Regina</b> to go with Joan to Paris, where <b>Regina</b> became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan {{to go to the}} United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. <b>Regina</b> and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.|$|E

Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, <b>Regina</b> encourages Emma to leave town. <b>Regina</b> meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells <b>Regina</b> that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E

5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. <b>Regina</b> survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may die. If <b>Regina</b> chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells <b>Regina</b> that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes {{him to the}} medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick. Later, <b>Regina</b> and the team manage to locate Kirk and {{apprehend}} him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape. <b>Regina</b> and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex {{in the way of}} getting to it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and <b>Regina</b> ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot out of his hand by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E
5000|$|The third known {{species is}} E. <b>reginae,</b> which, {{like the other}} known species, is known from a single female {{specimen}} preserved in amber. E. <b>reginae</b> is {{the largest of the}} three species at 0.80 mm in length. Noted to be closely related to E. inclusus, the anal lobes of E. <b>reginae</b> are not as well developed but do possess four setae each. The well-developed legs of E. <b>reginae</b> also have some setae present. Like E. abductus the E. <b>reginae</b> female was preserved in the mandibles of an Acropyga glaesaria ant, this one a queen. In reference to this the specific epithet <b>reginae</b> comes from the Latin [...] meaning [...] "belonging to a queen".|$|R

5|$|In Granny's Cafe, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) throws darts at {{a picture}} of a deer very accurately. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrives but leaves {{immediately}} because she has not forgiven him for hiding his relationship with <b>Regina</b> (Lana Parrilla). Emma attempts to avoid conversation, but Graham is insistent on explaining to her he feels nothing for <b>Regina.</b> He kisses Emma and suddenly sees a vision of a wolf, only to have Emma push him away. Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham later sleeps with <b>Regina.</b> During the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf. When Graham tells <b>Regina</b> that the dream felt like a memory, <b>Regina</b> tries to convince him to stay, but Graham leaves. As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold suggests to him that dreams are memories from another life.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{she ought to be}} sheriff, but <b>Regina</b> (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects <b>Regina</b> is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so <b>Regina</b> declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. <b>Regina</b> is furious that Gold would work against her.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya. During the Italo-Turkish War <b>Regina</b> Mergherita {{was assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron, along with her sister and the two s. She joined the squadron on 5 October, a week after the war started. On 13 April 1912, <b>Regina</b> Margherita {{and the rest of the}} Squadron sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to rendezvous with the 1st Squadron. The two squadrons met off Stampalia on 17 April. The next day, the fleet steamed into the northern Aegean and cut several Turkish submarine cables. Most of the ships of the Italian fleet then bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles in an unsuccessful attempt to lure out the Turkish fleet. While they were doing this, <b>Regina</b> Margherita, Benedetto Brin, and two torpedo boats were detached to cut additional cables between Rhodes and Marmaris. On 18 May, <b>Regina</b> Margherita bombarded Marmaris. While debarking troops on the island of Scarpanto in the Aegean, the ship's anchor chain accidentally slipped loose and killed the ship's executive officer, Captain Proli; five other men were injured in the accident. In July, <b>Regina</b> Margherita and the rest of the division had withdrawn to Italy to replace worn-out gun barrels, along with other repairs. In 1912, the ship had four 3-inch guns added, increasing her battery from 20 to 24 pieces.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that <b>Regina</b> was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses <b>Regina</b> of threatening Archie, but <b>Regina</b> says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one <b>Regina</b> found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and <b>Regina</b> have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E

5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, <b>Regina</b> Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, <b>Regina</b> told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, <b>Regina</b> concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
