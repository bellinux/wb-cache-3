25|$|The {{rules for}} {{unregistered}} land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor {{is entitled to}} apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the <b>registered</b> <b>title</b> holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.|$|E

[...] This principle was embodied by the Latin maxim nullum tempus occurrit regi ("no time runs against the king"). [...] In the United States, this privilege was carried over to the federal and state governments; government land is immune from loss by adverse possession.

40|$|Undertaking a Cochrane {{systematic}} review {{can be an}} incredibly rewarding experience. It is however a challenging and time-consuming task. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 1 provides an essential resource to help reviewers navigate the often complex methodological issues of {{systematic review}} research. Additional guidelines {{have been developed for}} those undertaking reviews of public health topics, 2 and Cochrane Centres throughout the world offer invaluable training opportunities. This emphasis on training and methodological rigour has helped Cochrane reviews {{become one of the most}} respected sources of synthesized research available. Even with the assistance available, however, many authors with good intentions <b>register</b> <b>titles</b> and prepare protocols but fail to publish the completed review. Data extracted from Cochrane’s Information Management System (Archie) in June 2010 showed that there were 1, 301 <b>titles</b> <b>registered</b> more than two years ago that have not been published as a full review. 3 Of these <b>registered</b> <b>titles,</b> 697 have had protocols published (25 are no longer active) while 604 have not even progressed to this stage (154 are no longer active). There are also 146 protocols that have been published for more than two years without being converted into completed reviews.

The last batch of 90 buildings (the most potentially profitable, rentable properties) was split in May 2009. As a result, after 680 objects {{were assigned to the}} city and 424 to federal authorities, at the end of May 2009 Saint Petersburg had only 13 listed buildings, all former churches, including Saint Isaac's Cathedral and Church of the Savior on Blood. in legal limbo.

50|$|In the USA Vehicle {{ownership}} is documented on {{a certificate of}} title. In the USA, each state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Registry of Motor Vehicles issues such documents when a vehicle is <b>registered.</b> <b>Title</b> deeds vary by design but always include vehicle-specific information {{at the front of}} the document (such as year, make, model, VIN, color, etc.) and several boxes for transaction information at the back where information about change of {{ownership is}} recorded (such as sale date, odometer reading, seller and buyer names and signatures, etc.). In-state vehicle sales are recorded at the back of the title as long as there are unused reassignment boxes. If a vehicle is sold out-of-state the new owner must apply for a new title at the local DMV office.|$|E
50|$|The Land Registry is {{obliged to}} notify the {{registered}} proprietor of the land that an application for possessory title has been made. The registered proprietor then has 65 days to object to the registration. The objection may dispute the applicant's right to be registered as owner or, more usually, the registered proprietor will claim {{the benefit of the}} process found in paragraph 5 of Schedule 6. This provides that a registered proprietor who objects has a further two years to evict the adverse possessor. It will be enough to secure eviction within these two years that the registered proprietor relies on their <b>registered</b> <b>title.</b> No other reason need be given. Failure to secure the eviction of the adverse possessor within these two years gives the adverse possessor the right to re-apply to be registered and such a second application will be successful.|$|E

Since 13 October 2003 it has not been possible to apply for first registration of a title of a manor, however dealings in previously <b>registered</b> <b>titles</b> remain subject to compulsory registration with HM Land Registry.

5000|$|The team's <b>registered</b> <b>title</b> was [...] "The New Zealand All Black Rugby Football Team" [...] and it {{was most}} often {{referred}} to as the All Blacks on the tour, the same name which had been given to The Original amateur rugby union team on their tour of Great Britain in 1905. Like the Originals they were sometimes referred to in the press as New Zealand or other names such as Maorilanders and Colonials. Less favourable members of the press referred to them as the All Golds or Pro Blacks — highlighting the fact that the team was playing for money. The term All Golds was first coined by the Sydney Morning Herald in 1907 as a headline. However colloquially the players would have probably referred to themselves as the All Blacks or the New Zealand rugby team.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most recent}} set of cases appear, however, to have moved further. In Stack v Dowden a couple with four {{children}} {{who lived together}} for 18 years had registered a house in both their names. However, Ms Dowden had contributed more money. She claimed that the presumption of equal ownership should be displaced and that she should therefore have a share that was greater than half, and the House of Lords agreed that she owned 65% of the beneficial interest. Although not concerning the same point, Lord Walker noted that the law since Lord Bridge's decision in Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset [...] "has moved on", regarding {{the question of what}} matters in quantifying people's shares in a home. The majority also remarked that in family situations, constructive trusts provided more utility where the court had greater flexibility to quantify people's interests free from tangible financial contributions, and that resulting trusts were more appropriate to commercial relationships, where the quantification of a person's interest would more match financial contributions. Furthermore, in Kernott v Jones, Ms Jones and Mr Kernott had had two children and were both on the <b>registered</b> <b>title.</b> However, from 1993 to 2008, Mr Kernott had moved out, and Ms Jones was raising the children, paying the mortgage and the house expenses. In TLATA 1996 section 14 proceedings, Court of Appeal upheld his claim for 50% of the property, arguing that with absolutely no evidence of any intention otherwise, it could not be the courts' role to [...] "impute" [...] the intentions of the parties. The Supreme Court reversed this, finding that Ms Jones did indeed own 90% of the home's equity, and this could readily be inferred from all the circumstances. In the Privy Council, in Abbott v Abbott Baroness Hale more squarely affirmed that the [...] "parties' whole course of conduct in relation to the property {{must be taken into account}} in determining their shared intentions as to its ownership." [...] However, it still remains unclear to what extent (and why) the law on cohabiting couples, after four decades, remains different from that for married couples under the 1970 and 1973 Acts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{content of}} English land law relates to property rights {{that derive from}} common law, equity and the registration system. Ordinarily, ownership of land is acquired by a contract of sale, and to complete a purchase, the buyer must formally register their interest with HM Land Registry. Similar systems run in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Around 18 per cent of land in England and Wales remains unregistered, so property disputes are still determined by principles developed by the courts. Human rights, like {{the right to a}} family life and home under ECHR article 8 and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions, under article 1 of the First Protocol, apply for everyone. Aside from sale contracts, people may acquire interests in land through contributions to a home's purchase price, or to family life, if the courts can find evidence of a common intention that this should happen. The law acknowledges a [...] "resulting" [...] or [...] "constructive trust" [...] over the property, and in recognition of people's social interests in their homes, as with a lease under 7 years length, these {{do not need to be}} registered. Third, people can acquire land through proprietary estoppel. If someone is given an assurance that they will receive property, and they rely on this to their detriment, a court may acknowledge it. Fourth, adverse possession allows people who possess land, without formal objection by the owner for at least 12 years, to take <b>registered</b> <b>title.</b> Multiple people can be interested in land, and it can be used in multiple ways. There could be a single freeholder, or people can own land jointly. The law closely regulates the circumstances under which each may sever or sell their share. Leases, and to some degree licenses, allocate the use of land to new owners for a period of time. Mortgages and other forms of security interest are usually used to give moneylenders the right to seize property in the event that the debtor does not repay a loan. Easements and covenants involve rights and duties between neighbours, for instance with an agreement that a neighbour will not build on a piece of land, or to grant a right of way.|$|E
