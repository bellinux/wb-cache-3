5|$|While on course, JG 6 {{approached}} the airfield of Heesch {{and some of}} its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield. It is unlikely that the Heesch strip, built in October 1944, was known to the Luftwaffe. No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on recce missions early that morning so the majority of its units were airborne. Its 401 Squadron was <b>readying</b> <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> when JG 6 appeared at 09:15. Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield, concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude. 401 Squadron scrambled. Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage, while the main body continued to search for Volkel. Stab., and II./JG 6 stumbled on another strip at Helmond, which contained no aircraft. Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked, losing several of their number to ground fire. II./JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond. Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond.|$|R
50|$|These TDYs {{became a}} heavy burden for both SAC as well as Military Air Transport Service (MATS), which had to {{transport}} thousands of personnel and tons of material {{to and from the}} United States {{in just a few days}} to support these rotations. In 1958, it was decided that these rotational TDYs would be replaced by a new system of overseas deployments called Reflex. From then on, rather than being deployed for a few months, a permanent SAC presence would be established at bases with aircraft being deployed for three weeks from several SAC bases, being kept on full alert status <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> instant <b>takeoff</b> at their 'Reflex Bases'.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 it {{was decided}} the TDY postings would be {{replaced}} by a new system of overseas deployments called Reflex. The ninety-day deployments were replaced by twenty-one day deployments of aircraft and crews instead of entire bomber wings. In this way a permanent SAC presence would be established at bases with aircraft being deployed for three weeks from several SAC bases, being kept on full alert status <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> instant <b>takeoff.</b> The Stratojets were based at RAF Brize Norton (3920th Strategic Wing), RAF Fairford (3919th Combat Support Group), RAF Greenham Common 3909th Combat Support Group, RAF Mildenhall 3910th Combat Support Group, and RAF Upper Heyford (3918th Strategic Wing). In 1960 SAC withdrew from RAF Lakenheath and released the base to USAFE for the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing relocating from France.|$|R

40|$|Flyover noise {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the noise reductions achievable by modifying the engines and nacelles of DC- 9 - 30 airplanes. The two stage fan of the JT 8 D- 9 engine was replaced with a larger diameter, single stage fan and sound absorbing materials were incorporated in the engines and nacelles. The noise levels were determined to be 95. 3 EPNdB at the sideline, 96. 2 EPNdB for a full thrust takeoff, 87. 5 EPNdB <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> with thrust cutback, and 97. 4 EPNdB for landing approach. The noise reductions relative to the hardwall JT 8 D- 9 were 8. 2 EPNdB <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> with cutback and 8. 7 EPNdB for landing. The 90 EPNdB noise contour areas were reduced by 40 % for missions requiring maximum design takeoff and landing weights. For typical mission weights, the reductions were 19 % <b>for</b> full thrust <b>takeoff</b> and 34 % <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> with cutback. The 95 EPNdB contour areas were reduced by 50 % <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> and 30 % <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> with cutback <b>for</b> both missions...|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was scheduled to}} ferry 13 empty cargo pallets to be filled at Jeddah then returned to Kano. The flight was nearly canceled because only five pallets were loaded onto the aircraft, and the employee who had keys to the cargo pallet storage area did not report for work that day. The captain nearly cancelled the flight until arrangements were made for seven more cargo pallets to be added. The aircraft took at approximately 17:00 UTC and arrived in Jeddah a few minutes past 22:00 UTC. The turnaround time would have normally taken {{an hour and a}} half, but it took {{two and a half hours}} since the cargo pallets had to be loaded after arrival in Jeddah. The {{aircraft was}} <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>takeoff</b> at 00:30 UTC, but during the engine start up procedure engine number 4 would not start. Engine number 4 was repaired and the flight took off at 13:48 UTC en route to Kano and was expected at Kano at 18:19 UTC. The captain was not warned about any classified or hazardous material aboard. The flight engineer sensed a strange odor in the cockpit at flight level 35 as the aircraft approached N'Djamena, at about 17:00 UTC. The rest of the crew as well as the ground engineer and the load-master confirmed the smell had persisted for a while. The two passengers traced to odor to pallet 11 and which appeared to be misty. After being handed a fire extinguisher the applied it to the pallet and when they returned they were breathing heavily. Afterwards the smoke evacuation procedure was followed and the smell temporarily ceased. The flight was cleared to descend at 18:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards the master warning followed a minute later by a fire warning sounded. With smoke entering the cabin, the flight went into a descent of nearly 3000 feet per minute. Control of the pitch trims was lost. The flight engineer started a radio transmission to the airline at 1804:57 UTC that ended suddenly at 1805:04, the same time the cockpit voice recordings stopped. The two survivors both reported that the first explosion tripped the autopilot and the aircraft rocked sharply. The aircraft descended slowly in the grasses but rolled upon contact with the water.|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins]: Thursday 1130 Dear Mom, I got the cigs honey, thanks ever so much. I {{missed my}} old Fleetwoods. They’re just about gone now, but I’ve {{found a place}} in town where I can buy them, so I’ll keep supplied. This morning I shot 90 ° stages. These involve landing the ship on a certain spot on the field after a regular traffic pattern around the field. I got 6 good ones out of 6 ! I have another period of these then I go on to 180 ° side, and 360 ° side and {{overhead}} approaches. They’re a lot of fun. The instructor goes over {{with one of the}} cadets and the other three fly over solo. (To Haley Field) There we line up the ships <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>takeoff,</b> and the instructor signals us with a greenlight one by one when it is all clear for the takeoff. We’re graded on everything, glide approach, turns in the pattern, takeoff, and landing. They’re {{a hell of a lot}} of fun. I saw “The Hour Before Dawn,” it was good, wasn’t it. Last night I had a date with a sharp girl. She reminds me of Pat Ward, my old flame back home, remember? Saturday she and I and Bill Cross and her sister are going to the Paramount Club. She’s a swell girl, really a lot of fun, plenty of personality, too. I’ve got two hours in the Link now. Boy that’s some machine. It costs 17, 000 ! The damn thing is uncanny, it stalls, spins, and does everything a real ship can do. But they’re hell to fly, stiff and very touchy. They don’t handle like a plane. The stick will stay in any position instead of returning to neutral, as it does in the P. T. ’s. I’m glad Bob and Ronnie are O. K. That’s a sharp name. I’m going to call them Romulus 2 ̆ 6 Rhemus [sic]. I sure wish I could see those boys, and the rest of my sweet family. I love you all so much. Give my love to Bob.
