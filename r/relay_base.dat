30|$|We propose in {{this article}} an {{architecture}} called trusted timely attacks-tolerating communication architecture (3 TCA) designed for mobile multihop relay (MMR) networks. The 3 TCA architecture is based on trusted components providing trusted time-related and security-related services along with an intrusion-related service while guaranteeing QoS compensation. 3 TCA components are implemented at access nodes such as relay stations (RSs) and multihop <b>relay</b> <b>base</b> stations (MR-BSs) {{in order to achieve}} trusted QoS-aware handover management while guaranteeing intrusion tolerance. In particular, we provide QoS guarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth and jitter for the MMR networks while addressing group mobility through performing handover disturbance compensation for mobile RSs. Meanwhile, we tolerate particular timely-based and DoS attacks through compensating their impact on the already agreed QoS level. Simulations show that adopting compensation is suited for the MMR context although it induces additional complexity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel relaying-based {{approach}} for managing mobility in dense cellular networks. Dense deployment of base stations will have small cells, necessitating frequent handovers. Moreover, small cell solutions such as femtocells may lack low-delay backhaul {{connections to the}} operator core’s network where handover procedures are coordinated. As a result, handover delays can be large, impacting signal quality severely. The proposed relay-based hierarchical mobility scheme forwards data over-the-air to other base stations close to mobile as the mobile moves but before the network point of attachment can be switched. Hybrid ARQ and randomized beamforming are used to opportunistically gain the benefits of relays with no explicit coordination between the <b>relay</b> <b>base</b> stations and the source or mobile. Thus, the protocol is attractive for high-speed dynamic environments and can be implemented with minimal messaging overhead. A simulation of the protocol in a 3 GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular system with dense cells and high-speed mobiles shows {{the ability of the}} protocol to mitigate short-term rate outages during handover with significant improvements for delay sensitive applications.

40|$|Abstract: In mobile {{multihop}} relay (MMR) networks, Relay multicast rekeying algorithm (RMRA) {{is meant}} to ensure secure multicast communication and selective updating of keys in MMR networks. However, in RMRA, the rekeying is carried out after a specific interval of time, which cannot ensure the security for multicast communication on joining the member. Secondly, the rekeying scheme generates a huge communication overhead on the serving multihop <b>relay</b> <b>base</b> station (MR-BS) on frequent joining of members. Lastly, there is nothing about when a member left the group communication. Thus, the rekeying scheme of RMRA fails to provide forward and backward secrecy and also is not scalable. To solve this problem, an improved rekeying scheme based on broadcasting a new seed value on joining and leaving of a member for updating the ongoing key management is proposed. The proposed scheme solves the issue of forward and backward secrecy and the scalability in a very simplified way. The forward and backward secrecy of the proposed scheme has been extensively validated by formal method using rank theorem. Furthermore, mathematical derivation showed that the proposed scheme out-performed the RMRA in terms of communication cost and complexity...|$|E

40|$|Mobile Multihop Relay (MMR) {{network is}} an {{attractive}} and low-cost solution for expanding service coverage and enhancing throughput of the conventional single hop network. However, mobility of Mobile Station (MS) in MMR network might lead to performance degradation in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Selecting an appropriate Relay Station (RS) that can support data transmission for high mobility MS to enhance QoS {{is one of the}} challenges in MMR network. The main goal of the work is to develop and enhance relay selection mechanisms that can assure continuous connectivity while ensuring QoS in MMR network using NCTUns simulation tools. The approach is to develop and enhance a relay selection for MS with continuous connectivity in non-transparent relay. In this approach, the standard network entry procedure is modified to allow continuous connectivity with reduced signaling messages whenever MS joins RS that is out of Multihop <b>Relay</b> <b>Base</b> Station (MRBS) coverage and the relay selection is based on Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The QoS performances of the proposed relay selections are in terms of throughput and average end-to-end (ETE) delay. The findings for the proposed relay selection in non-transparent relay shows that the throughput degradation between low mobility MS (30 m/s) and high mobility MS (50 m/s) is only about 2. 0 %.

Two protocols, i. e., Simultaneous and Successive relaying, associated with two possible relay orderings are proposed.

For the successive relaying protocol: (i) a Non-Cooperative scheme based on the Dirty Paper Coding (DPC), and (ii) a Cooperative scheme based on the Block Markov Encoding (BME) are considered.

The multicast and broadcast services in IEEE 802. 16 are efficient and power saving mechanisms, which no doubt also provide subscribers with strong and powerful security protection from the theft of service by encrypting broadcast connections between subscriber station (SS), relay station (RS), non-transparent relay station (NRS) and Multihop <b>relay</b> <b>base</b> station (MR-BS).

30|$|The {{last years}} have been marked by a growing need for {{ubiquitous}} access to multimedia and real time applications at the metropolitan scale. Mobile subscribers are becoming very particular {{about the quality of}} the provided services and the resulting cost. The wireless technology which will succeed in providing the best QoS at the minimum cost while being interoperable with existing technologies will probably gain popularity. The traditional point to multi-point access is not able to achieve high throughput when the mobile subscriber moves away from the base station. Adopting the mesh technology to increase the coverage has its drawbacks since it induces complexity in routing, network management, QoS provision and security guarantees. Recently, the mobile multihop relay (MMR) networks emerged as an optional deployment that can be adopted to enhance the coverage and the performance in an access network. MMR networks specification is detailed within the IEEE 802.16 j- 2009,[1], which is the new amendment to IEEE 802.16 - 2009, [2]. A MMR network encompasses a multihop <b>relay</b> <b>base</b> station (MR-BS), one or more fixed or mobile relay stations (rSs) managed by the network operator and subscriber stations (SSs). The RS relays traffic and signaling between the SS and the MR-BS when needed and in more than two hops system, traffic and signaling between an access RS and MR-BS may be relayed through intermediate RSs. Multihop relay networks can be seen as a specialization of mesh networks that intends to reduce the complexity of the mesh mode while enhancing the wireless coverage and performance.|$|E

40|$|Communication speed {{by radio}} wave has been enhanced, and wired {{communications}} {{have been replaced}} by wireless communications because of their convenience. We often hear someone talk “Why are high speed communications needed?”. He or she thinks that present wireless communications are sufficiently speedy, however, higher speed is still needed. When we consider how informations are efficiently transfered in the limited frequency resources, speeding up is equivalent to high-efficiency. Of course, speeding up is needed for transferring movie, music and image quickly, however, the needs of the speeding up also can be discussed in the view of high-efficiency. In LTE-Advanced, it is considered that “Heterogeneous network” will be configured. “Heterogeneous network” indicates the combinational network of pico, femto, macrocell, and <b>relay</b> <b>base</b> station. Among them, femtocell base station (BS) is an attractive technology. In femtocell, the coverage area is tens of meter radius, and the BS is located in indoor environments. Since the number of mobile terminals (MTs) accessing femtocell BS is small, comfortable communications without reduction of the speed and without losing connections are achieved. On the other hand, since line capacity is not sufficient for the increase of users in urban area, cellular phone operators want to disperse loads of 3 G lines on public W-LAN, which is available in station, airport, cafe and fast food restaurants. Thus, to configure future wireless networks, small-area wireless communications in indoor environments attract much attention. Then, in LTE and LTE-Advanced, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology. MIMO technology can enhance communication speed by using multiple antennas on transmitting and receiving sides without expanding frequency band. Hence, it can transmit data efficiently with narrow frequency band. The study of MIMO has been shifted to MU-MIMO, MIMO mesh network, and multihop. However, those researches seem to be at the initiative of software and system, and then {{it is also important to}} look toward hardware such as antennas and circuits. This dissertation targets hardware applied to multi-antenna systems, and discussions are focused on single user’s communi cations, which are the basis for develop researches. As mentioned before, since communications in indoor environments typified by femtocell and W-LAN is an indispensable way to disperse traffic, this dissertation deals with such scenario. Among them, this dissertation specially focuses on indoor base stations and describes the multi-antenna technologies using radiation patterns wisely to improve the performance without increasing the number of streams. In Chapter 3, channel capacity is introduced as a evaluation factor of MIMO performance, and the relationship between channel capacity, spatial correlation, SNR, received power imbalance, and eigenvalues of spatial correlation matrix are discussed by theory, simulation and measurement. Then, as one example, spatial correlation reduction and channel capacity enhancement by multi-polarization is described. Moreover, just a concept of channel capacity enhancement by SNR increment is shown in this chapter, and the discussion is connected to chapter 4. Chapter 4 describes the MIMO antenna configuration methodology by using radiation patterns effectively. The discussion is mainly focused on indoor BSs, and the target is enhancement of MIMO performance using fixed radiation patterns. Here, two types of BS positions are assumed, which are BS mounted in the vicinity of wall and at the center of the ceiling. For the former, this dissertation reveals that narrow HPBW of 60 ?- 80 ? pointed to the corner of the room is effective to obtain large channel capacity by ray-tracing propagation analysis. Based on the design guidelines, a patch antenna array with dual-feeds is fabricated, and then the measurement is conducted in the small room of 6. 2 m × 5. 8 m × 2. 7 m. The results shows that the 4 × 4 MIMO channel capacity is enhanced by about 20 % at two out of three typical MT positions, compared to that for sleeve antenna configurations. On the other hand, for the latter, this dissertation presents a low-profile dual-polarized directional MIMO antenna with a thickness of 0. 24 λ. The antenna is also designed based on guidelines by ray-tracing propagation analysis, and is configured by four cavity-backed slot and four printed dipole antenna elements. Slot and dipole elements radiate vertical and horizontal polarizations, and uni-directional radiation patterns with downward tilt angles are obtained in each polarization. By channel measurements in an actual environment, the SNR and channel capacity are compared with those of the sleeve antenna configuration. The place averaged SNR of the proposed antenna is 14. 1 dB, and the improvement factor is 2. 6 dB. The place averaged channel capacity of the proposed antenna is 7. 1 bits/s/Hz, and improvement factor is 16. 2 %. The results of this study reveal that the MIMO capacity performance is the same or better than that of the sleeve antenna configuration. Chapter 5 proposes a novel feeding circuit with switching function of shapes and directions of radiation patterns. First, a technique to realize cardioid and figure of eight radiation patterns is presented. Then, as the modified version, techniques to realize omni-directional and directive radiation patterns are presented. Those techniques are based on array antenna theory, and multi-radiation pattern is generated by switch of feed elements and phase difference feeding (0 ?, 180 ?, - 90 ? and 90 ?). For the former circuit, the array factors derived from the output signals at 2 GHz shows that two cardioid and two figure of eight radiation patterns are achieved when mutual coupling effects are ignored. When mutual coupling effects are considered, uni-directional with more than 10 dB F/B ratio and bi-directional radiation patterns are obtained. Moreover, the measurement results show that the averaged losses between 1. 85 and 2. 21 GHz are less than 1. 8 dB, and the phase differences agree with simulation data in the vicinity of 2 GHz in the proposed feeding circuit. For the latter, the proposed circuit has five operation modes, and can switch feed to two elements with the phase differences of 0 ?, 180 ?, - 90 ? and 90 ? and feed to a single element. The simulation results show that in all the modes, mismatch losses are less than 0. 5 dB, and desired phase differences are obtained at 2 GHz. The output signals lead to the array factor of two cardioid, two figure of eight, and omni-directional radiation patterns. Then, this dissertation reveals that uni-, biand omni-directional radiation patterns are obtained in consideration of a combination with a three-element linear monopole array. The variations in the radiation patterns as a function of the frequency are small at 1. 88, 2 and 2. 06 GHz. Then, since the effect of switching circuits has not been considered in the above simulation and measurement, the design procedures are showed, and the measurement results of the fabricated switching circuit is evaluated. Although frequency shift is caused, good insertion loss and isolation characteristics are observed. Chapter 6 presents an antenna selection criterion that is suitable for indoor LOS scenarios for two-stream MIMO systems. Since the selection criterion can be applied to algorithm for switching the appropriate radiation patterns, this section is ranked as the system level consideration of chapter 5. In chapter 6, this dissertation demonstrates that the criterion using the square of the absolute value of the determinant of the channel matrix is the most effective one for both BER performance and computational load in an indoor LOS scenario. The investigations of this chapter employ ray-tracing propagation analysis taking into consideration variations in both the amplitude and phase of the channel matrix depending on the selected antenna subsets. The criterion based on the determinant of the channel matrix can be applied to various scenarios, and the effectiveness of the criterion for BER performance is also empirically verified in an actual environment. The computational complexity is lower than criterion based on second eigenvalue, which is target for comparison, and the BER performance is comparable to that. 横浜国立大学, 平成 24 年 3 月 23 日, 博士(工学), 甲第 1459...|$|E

For intelligent relay deployments studied in [29, 30] RSs are already cost efficient if the costs are 88 % {{of the costs of}} a micro-BS. Without intelligent deployment the RS cost should be only 6.5 % of the BS costs [31].|$|R
