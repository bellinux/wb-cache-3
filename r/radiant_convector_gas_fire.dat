40|$|AbstractAbsorption cooling {{technologies}} have been researched for many years. The <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption chiller is stable and high-efficient but has high gas consumption. The solar hot water driven absorption chiller {{is clean and}} energy saving but hard to work steady and continuously. In this paper, a system for cooling and heating based on an absorption chiller that can be driven by both <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> and solar hot water was proposed and built. The system is a hybrid capable of solar cooling in single effect and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> cooling in double effect and also thus a combination. It has the advantages of both solar driven and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption systems. This system works in solar driven mode (single effect) when the solar energy is enough. It works in <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> mode (double effect) when solar energy is not enough or solar hot water temperature is low. The design and operation strategy is to use solar at first and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> as a backup, thus fossil energy saving is obvious. Year round operation of the system was recorded and analyzed in a commercial 5 star hotel. Compared with the <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption system, the gas/solar driven absorption system can save 49. 7 % of the gas consumption...|$|R

The digital reconstruction has assisted in understanding how the technology worked. The later design of the tunnel kiln enabled continuous firing thereby minimising delays while waiting for it to cool before loading and unloading. The product was slowly passed through a central chamber using <b>gas</b> to <b>fire</b> it.|$|R
