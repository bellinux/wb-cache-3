5|$|Optical {{transitions}} {{are rather}} sharp (~10meV) and strong. Consequently, it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> selectively excite nanotubes having certain (n,m) indices, {{as well as}} to detect optical signals from individual nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E

30|$|This {{form of the}} {{advection}} {{equation is}} linear and is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> deal with (LeVeque 2004). In solving this kind of hyperbolic PDEs, different capturing schemes have been developed which can be classified as classical or traditional and modern techniques.|$|R

5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can be {{separated}} from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be confused with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the two.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Lithium deuteride was {{the fusion}} fuel {{of choice in}} early {{versions}} of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, {{was responsible for the}} runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material.|$|E
30|$|Factor 3 : The {{concepts}} about {{contradictions in}} TRIZ are <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> be understood for the engineers in China. And {{there is a}} systematic process and knowledge to solve contradictions in TRIZ. Many cases in different domains are analogies for engineers to solve their own contradictions (Tan, 2007).|$|R
40|$|The Inclusion-Exclusion(I. E.) {{principle}} {{is an important}} counting concept in combi-natorics. It is also very important {{in the study of}} the distribution of prime numbers. In this paper, we introduce an equivalent- and in some cases a <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> apply- form of the concept. We also provide some applications. ...|$|R
50|$|If energy A is <b>{{relatively}}</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> {{convert to}} energy B but energy B is relatively harder {{to convert to}} energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being {{higher than that of}} B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).|$|R
5|$|The Mongol army {{administered}} the Yam. The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean. The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administrated by the Mongols. This highly sophisticated system {{of communication and}} travel made it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time. As {{a result of the}} relatively lucid communication and ease of movement, the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively, thus ensuring political and economic stability.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, {{as it is}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly {{over the last few}} decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{enters the}} subaerial subphase {{once it is}} tall enough to escape the water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava {{released}} in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often runny, blocky, slow, and <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> predict; the USGS tracks where it {{is most likely to}} run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava.|$|E
50|$|The binding ligand affinities for the {{different}} transporters is skewed somewhat {{in favor of the}} DAT; there may be some bias in the data. The reason for this could be that WIN35428 is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> displace from the DAT versus paroxetine from the SERT, because of the higher binding constant of the former compound.|$|R

50|$|A {{value-added}} tax, {{like the}} GST, also has several features {{that make it}} attractive. A tax on consumption, not income, the tax system inherently encourages savings and investments instead of consumption. The tax also has a self-policing mechanism that discourages evasion, unlike a retail sales tax system or an income tax system, which would be <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> evade.|$|R
5|$|These {{properties}} make it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish a {{light metal}} like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of}} the characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead {{have some of the}} characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E
5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with {{a small fraction of}} heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's design aims were {{to create}} a well-balanced, {{high-performance}} bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting {{the power of the}} Merlin engine, while being <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fly. At the time, with France as an ally, and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain, enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single-engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields; to carry out the mission of home defence, the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers.|$|E
50|$|A naturalistic planned {{language}} is a constructed language specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary {{from a group of}} closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> use passively -- in many cases, without prior study -- by speakers of one or more languages in the group.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} routing and flow control in a {{computer}} communication network is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The Lagrangian relaxation method is used to decompose the problem into subproblems that are <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> solve than the original problem. An algorithm is then developed which can obtain an optimal solution to the problem...|$|R
30|$|First, {{most of the}} {{participants}} found phone call, location, app, music, and battery charging based questions <b>to</b> be <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> recall (mode 4 median 4, mode 5 median 4, mode 4 median 4, mode 5 median 4 and mode 5 median 4 respectively) compared to SMS and Activity based questions (mode 4 median 3.5 and mode 3 median 3 respectively), as expected.|$|R
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a docile {{breed of}} dog and {{is fond of}} playing with {{children}} and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However {{it can also be}} used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content {{with a small amount of}} space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.|$|E
5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E
5000|$|An {{employer}} is liable, {{as is the}} case for many other acts, for the actions of their employees during the course of employment. Though it would be <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> prove that a manager or supervisor to the recipient could be guilty of harassing [...] "during the course of employment", it may require more proof if the harasser is in a subordinate position.|$|R

5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|R
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get to the crest, but it was {{difficult}} to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
5|$|A motte-and-bailey castle is a {{fortification}} with {{a wooden}} or stone keep situated on a raised earthwork called a motte, accompanied by an enclosed courtyard, or bailey, surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade. <b>Relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> build with unskilled, often forced, labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By {{the end of the}} 13th century, the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E
