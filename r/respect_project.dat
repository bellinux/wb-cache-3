The school has a vocational education programme. Facilities for delivery in this area include a hospitality suite, hairdressing salon, call centre and recording studio.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of Respect - The Unity Coalition marked an upswing {{in the importance}} of the Weekly Worker. The CPGB was initially divided whether to embrace the organisation, the PCC initially sided with the pro-affiliation faction led by Ian Donovan. It however reversed this position early in Respect's life to agree retrospectively with the anti-affiliation faction; Red Platform led by Manny Neira. This reversal managed to alienate both factions at different times, resulting initially in Manny Neira breaking away to form the short lived Red Party, followed by Ian Donovan after the change of position. This early debate though settled into a strong editorial line against Respect, for being an 'unprincipled unpopular front', which followed through to the split resulting in Respect Renewal and Left List. The paper's commitment to angular debate and reporting on the topic, combined with the lack of coverage from more official sources, led to increase in readership. The paper, {{at the height of the}} <b>Respect</b> <b>project,</b> reached 40,000 readers a week. This controversy has refreshed the party, seemingly leading to a new wave of confidence and generation of recruits.|$|E

40|$|NoImproving the {{effectiveness}} of projects, particularly in construction, is of interest and concern to practitioners and academics alike. To this end, the use of partnering, now commonplace {{in a variety of}} industry sectors has been encouraged in the UK construction industry. However, in many <b>respects</b> <b>project</b> environments represent the antithesis of current thinking in partnership development and an unusual and difficult application, particularly at the lower levels in the supply chain. This paper, therefore, is concerned with evaluating the progress the UK construction industry has made in its adoption of partnering, how it is likely to develop in the future and what the implications might be for the industry¿s suppliers. The partnering experiences of Main Contractors with Main Subcontractors for structural steel products are examined and a conceptual framework of the success factors presented and discussed. Critically, clients and not suppliers were found to be major barriers to the industry¿s adoption of partnering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{wide range}} of {{infectious}} diseases may change their geographic range, seasonality and incidence due to climate change, but there is limited research exploring health vulnerabilities to climate change. In order to address this gap, pan-European vulnerability indices were developed for 2035 and 2055, based upon the definition vulnerability = impact/adaptive capacity. Future impacts were projected based upon changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, whilst adaptive capacity was developed {{from the results of}} a previous pan-European study. The results were plotted via ArcGIS TM to EU regional (NUTS 2) levels for 2035 and 2055 and ranked according to quintiles. The models demonstrate regional variations with <b>respect</b> to <b>projected</b> climate-related infectious disease challenges that they will face, and with <b>respect</b> to <b>projected</b> vulnerabilities after accounting for regional adaptive capacities. Regions with higher adaptive capacities, such as in Scandinavia and central Europe, will likely be better able to offset any climate change impacts and are thus generally less vulnerable than areas wit...|$|R
30|$|To {{preserve}} {{fidelity to}} the STeLLA design features and sustain the VbPD program, we must do more than prepare new teacher PD leaders. Educational systems must also be readied. In the <b>RESPeCT</b> <b>project,</b> the systems involved in sustaining the work are the Pomona Unified School District and the California State Polytechnic University at Pomona.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} more specifically {{what we are}} doing in the <b>RESPeCT</b> <b>project</b> to support the scaling and sustainability of this VbPD program. Three design principles guide this work: principle 17 pertains to the development of new VbPD leaders while principles 18 and 19 focus on development and sustainability of systems in which VbPD PD leaders can effectively work.|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of STeLLA VbPD {{leaders who have}} the knowledge and abilities described in Fig.  4 is critical to enabling more teachers and students {{to have access to}} this powerful program.
