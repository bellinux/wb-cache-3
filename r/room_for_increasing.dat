50|$|Ruddiman’s central {{argument}} is that this most recent interglacial period has deviated from the natural cycle because of human activities, most importantly farming. Approximately 10,000 years ago the ice that once covered large portions of the northern hemisphere began to recede and {{gave rise to a}} new way of life for early humans. In the beginning these early humans had little impact on the environment because they were primarily hunter gatherer societies that moved from location to location allowing previously inhabited locations to be reclaimed by nature. However, about 8,000 years ago humans first developed agriculture and a domesticated lifestyle that allowed them to continually inhabit regions and build large civilizations. Ruddiman claims that carbon dioxide emission records indicate that levels in the atmosphere began to rise at about this same time. This process was intensified as the centuries passed and new technologies such animal husbandry and the plow made their way into more and more cultures. These new technologies allowed for more efficient methods of clearing forests and making <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> populations. According to previous interglacial periods the concentration of carbon dioxide should have fallen by about 20 parts per million instead of rising by 20 parts per million. Ruddiman uses estimates of population, forest cleared per person and carbon emitted per each square kilometer cleared to approximate the total impact and concludes that the magnitude is reasonably close to the extra carbon dioxide accumulated during the period. Ruddiman also attributes the rise of methane gas in the atmosphere to human related activities. The most notable of these activities is the cultivation of rice in artificial wetlands in Asia and increased animal waste due to increasing populations of domesticated animals. According to Ruddiman methane concentrations should have peaked about 11,000 years ago slightly above 700 parts per billion and then declined to about 450 parts per billion today. Methane levels followed this cycle at first, but about 5000 years ago they began to rebound and currently the concentration is about 275 parts per billion above the previous trends.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—this article {{discusses}} {{the uses of}} promising modern communication technologies for emergency and safety systems focusing on cognitive radio technologies and their roles in effective spectrum use.

Based on cognitive radio and sensed spectrum holes, the paper developed new approximated linear relations between {{the total number of}} served users in emergency situations as a function of total available bandwidth.

40|$|While Thailand is {{recognized}} as a country that produces a variety of unique and great-tasting fruits, {{it has not been}} very successful in penetrating overseas markets.

To date many organizations, both public and private, are aware of the situation and have attempted to enhance Thailand’s competitive position as a fruit exporting country.

30|$|The Chinese {{government}} has implemented reforms aimed at increasing {{the tax burden}} {{for the use of}} resources. At the present, there is little wiggle <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> resource taxes. The front-line issue is imposing more regulations on international markets. If Australian coal could be exported to Southeastern China at a lower cost than coal from Northern China, the public would naturally respond to the difference by demanding a higher tax burden on the imported coal. In a democratic society, tax rates and policy decisions are not solely the domain of government insiders but should reflect public opinion. As the tax burden increased, natural resources would in turn become more expensive. Apparently, higher resource prices are not better. As natural resources are unevenly distributed among the Eastern and Mid-western regions of China, it will be a complicated task to reform the resource taxation system. China cannot tax resources {{in the same way that}} resource-rich nations do, nor could it adopt the policies of resource-poor nations. We must build a resource tax system in Chinese style.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the elementary unit of synaptic communication between CNS neurons, one must know what causes {{the variability of}} quantal postsynaptic currents and whether unitary packets of transmitter saturate postsynaptic receptors. We studied single excitatory synapses between hippocampal neurons in culture. Focal glutamate application at individual postsynaptic sites evoked currents (Iglu) with little variability compared with quantal excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). The maximal Iglu was > 2 -fold larger than the median EPSC. Thus, variations in [glu]cleft are {{the main source of}} variability in EPSC size, and glutamate receptors are generally far from saturation during quantal transmission. This conclusion was verified by molecular antagonism experiments in hippocampal cultures and slices. The general lack of glutamate receptor saturation leaves <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>increases</b> in [glu]cleft as a mechanism for synaptic plasticity...|$|R

The objective is to streamline the digital investigation workflow - enabling more efficient use of limited hardware and software. The proposed automation framework reduces the time digital forensic experts waste conducting time consuming, though necessary, tasks. The evidence processing time is decreased through server-side automation resulting in 24 / 7 evidence preparation. The proposed framework increases efficiency of use of forensic software and hardware, reduces the infrastructure costs and license fees, and simplifies the preparation steps for the digital investigator. The proposed approach is evaluated in a real-world scenario to evaluate its robustness and highlight its benefits...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The City of Grand Rapids {{has been}} {{increasing}} their sustainable practices by expanding and streamlining their recycling program. One {{of the ways in}} which Grand Rapids has been improving their program is through the use of a Geographical Information System (GIS). GIS is a computer software that combines mathematical statistics with area maps. The use of GIS not only improves the city’s customer relations and efficiency, it also helps improve the city’s supplier relations with Cascade Engineering (CE). CE is a local plastics manufacturer who supplies the city with its recycling bins and carts. The GIS data which the city obtains can be relayed to CE to help improve their residential products, shipping timelines, and customer demands. The purpose of this study is to identify the distribution of recycling customers throughout the neighborhoods of Grand Rapids, in relation to the population and housing units of those neighborhoods, in order to better understand how the City can improve its recycling services. Methods and Implications: For each of the 37 neighborhoods of Grand Rapids, the percentage of housing units that are current recycling customers and the percentage of the population that are current recycling customers were determined. The City of Grand Rapids and CE use this information to decide which neighborhoods have the greatest <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> the number of customers and satisfying their needs...|$|E
