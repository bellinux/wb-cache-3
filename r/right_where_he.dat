5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the <b>right,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{has been known to}} utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
500|$|Hershiser {{had ended}} Padres catcher Benito Santiago's 34-game hitting streak {{the year before}} and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to Tony Gwynn, [...] "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too hard. You {{have to give the}} man credit.

[...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for {{there is so much to}} do <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is.|$|E

500|$|As Cadwalader's {{men began}} to flee, the American guns opened fire onto the British, who were {{preparing}} to attack, and the guns were able to hold them off for several minutes. Cadwalader {{was able to get}} one company to fire a volley but it fled immediately afterwards. At this point, Washington arrived with the Virginia Continentals and Edward Hand's riflemen. Washington ordered the riflemen and the Virginians to take up a position on the right hand side of the hill and then Washington quickly rode over to Cadwalader's fleeing men. Washington shouted, [...] "Parade with us my brave fellows! There is but a handful of the enemy and we shall have them directly!".

2500|$|The {{first game}} of the season was at West Virginia University where Marshall lost. [...] The second game of the season saw Moss pick up <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> left off in 1996. Facing Army, Moss caught 5 balls for 186 yards and two {{touchdown}}s. One touchdown went for 79 yards in which Pennington lobbed the ball down the left sideline. Moss leaped over an Army defender to snag the ball out of the air at the 40-yard line while the safety crashed into his teammate, knocking both men down. Moss galloped the last 50 yards untouched for the score. The other touchdown reception was his career long of 90 yards that came on a short screen pass on third down. Moss caught the ball {{on the right side of}} the field at his own 8-yard line, ran past 3 defenders in the middle of the field at the 15-yard line, hurdled two defenders coming from both sides of the left hash marks at the 25-yard line, then raced past the last defender at the 50-yard line before finally seeing daylight down the left sideline.|$|E
2500|$|The Dodgers resumed {{play after}} the break on July 17 at Nationals Park against the Washington Nationals. The first game was {{suspended}} twice because of electrical problems at the park and was eventually halted in the sixth inning and resumed the following day. Matt den Dekker's pinch hit two-run homer {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning wound up being the difference in the 5–3 Nationals win. In the second game, Kershaw struck out a season high 14 batters in eight shutout innings as the Dodgers won 4–2. He became the first Dodgers starter with back-to-back games of at least 13 strikeouts since Chan Ho Park in 2000 and the first Dodgers pitcher with back-to-back games of double-digit strikeouts and no walks since Dazzy Vance in 1930. Greinke picked up <b>right</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> left off in his first start of the second half, allowing only three hits and one walk in eight scoreless innings, while striking out a season high 11 batters. [...] The Dodgers won 5–0. Combined with the previous start by Kershaw, this was the first time the Dodgers had back-to-back starts of at least eight scoreless innings and double-digit strikeouts since at least 1914. The Dodgers next lost to the Atlanta Braves, 7–5, at Turner Field. Former Dodger Juan Uribe drove in the winning run in the Braves 4–3 win the next day. Mike Bolsinger only allowed one run on three hits in seven innings and retired 14 consecutive batters at one point as the Dodgers avoided the sweep [...] with a 3–1 win in the series finale. Kershaw threw a three-hit complete game shutout against the New York Mets at Citi Field on July 23, while striking out 11. He was the first Dodgers starter with two shutouts in the same month since Carlos Pérez in 1998 and the first pitcher dating back to 1900 to have three straight starts with double-digit strikeouts, no walks and no runs allowed. Ian Thomas made a spot start on July 24 and allowed only one run on three hits in five innings while Justin Turner, Yasiel Puig and Jimmy Rollins homered in the Dodgers 7–2 win. Rollins homer was his 10th of the season, giving the Dodgers seven players with double digit homers for the first time since 2008. The Dodgers 2010 first round draft pick Zach Lee made his major league debut to start the July 25 game against the Mets, but performed poorly. He allowed seven runs in 4 innings in the Dodgers 15–2 loss. He was the first Dodgers starting pitcher to allow seven runs in his debut since Johnny Babich in 1934 and the first to allow four runs or more in the first inning of his debut since Frank Wurm in 1944. Greinke's scoreless streak ended at 45 innings when he allowed two runs to score on July 26 against the Mets. A walk-off single by Juan Uribe, who had been traded to the Mets the day before, gave the Mets a 3–2 win in 10 innings.|$|E
