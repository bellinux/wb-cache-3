If the {{pentacene}} is preoxidized, the pentacene-quinone is a potential gate insulator, then the mobility can approach that of rubrene – the highest-mobility organic semiconductor – namely, 40cm2/(V·s).

25|$|Fires {{start when}} a {{inflammable}} or a combustible material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of <b>rapid</b> <b>oxidation</b> that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an inflammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|$|E

General hypotheses such as a temperature-related reduction in oxygen availability, or increased corrosion due to carbonate undersaturated deep waters, are insufficient as explanations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare two methods for the determination of organic carbon (OC) —rapid dichromate oxidation technique and dry combustion technique, in three groups of two different sizes of agricultural soils in Thailand. Fifty four soils collected from 3 provinces—Nakorn Pathom, Samut Sonkhram, and Samut Sakhon were classified as followed; 26 clays, 12 clay loams, and 16 medium loams. The selected soil sizes were < 65 μm representing the metal-studied soil size and < 212 μm representing the general purpose studied soil size. The statistical comparison of OC between the two methods indicated that using <b>rapid</b> dichromate <b>oxidation</b> technique—(Walkley-Black method) gave significantly less amounts of OC in clay and clay loam for soil size < 65 μm, but for soil size < 212 μm, the amounts of OC in clay were significantly less than those obtained from dry combustion technique. This implied that the amounts of OC associated to the soil particle size differently. In this study, the smaller of the soil particles the more underestimation of the amounts of OC were obtained by using <b>rapid</b> dichromate <b>oxidation</b> techniques.
