5000|$|Common Ground High School (CGHS) is {{a charter}} school in New Haven, Connecticut that aims to prepare {{students}} for [...] "college success and environmental leadership." [...] It was founded in 1997 in the first <b>round</b> of <b>charter</b> schools created in Connecticut. Common Ground is the nation's oldest environmental charter school. Common Ground has subsequently expanded to reach approximately 180 students; students are admitted by lottery, and any Connecticut high school student is eligible to apply.|$|R
50|$|Adria Airways {{operates}} charter flights for {{the most}} part seasonally, and most frequently to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean. Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada in Egypt are currently the only charter destinations served by Adria Airways all year <b>round.</b> Ad hoc <b>charter</b> flights are provided throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The brand started {{operations}} on 15 May 2014. It competed against other European low-cost airlines including Wizz Air, Blue Air, and EasyJet. Fly Romania started with operations to nine destinations all year <b>round</b> with additional <b>charter</b> flights from Bucharest-Henri Coandă to Antalya. All flights were operated by Ten Airways.|$|R
5000|$|With Tri-County Recreation's success, {{a series}} of [...] "Town Hall Meetings" [...] and [...] "Strategic Study Session" [...] were held for the program to expand to year <b>round</b> activities. A <b>charter</b> {{commission}} was formed for Tri-County Recreation to change its form to a metropolitan district {{with the addition of}} Linden City and Argentine Township.|$|R
50|$|The town {{is served}} by a fire {{department}} that is 100% volunteer and was founded in 1917. Besides the school system, {{it is the only}} part of town government that is not {{under the control of the}} Town Council or Town Manager. The volunteer fire department is run by an elected board of three fire commissioners, which appoints the fire marshal, the chief, and all officers. A study was undertaken during the administration of former town manager Paul Fetherston that recommended eliminating the board of fire commissioners and placing the department under the control of the town manager. During the 2008 <b>round</b> of <b>Charter</b> Revision, both the immediate past mayor (Mortenson) and current town manager (Salomone) brought up the topic of the fire services organizational structure.|$|R
50|$|Some yachts {{are used}} {{exclusively}} by their private owners, others are operated all year <b>round</b> as <b>charter</b> businesses, {{and a large}} number are privately owned but available for charter part-time. The weekly charter rate of luxury yachts around the world ranges from tens of thousands to over a million dollars/euros. Expenses of approximately 20-30%, such as food, fuel, and berthing are charged as an extra, called the advance provisioning allowance. The luxury yacht charter industry functions effectively because private yacht owners mitigate their running costs with charter income as well as keeping their yachts and crew in top running order. Conversely, private charterers charter yachts (rather than owning them) because it is generally considered to be less expensive, and less hassle, than owning a yacht and it also provides them with extra choice related to yacht type, location and crew.|$|R
50|$|A second {{attempt by}} Modern Air and Berliner Flugring to gain {{approval}} for their planned year <b>round</b> long-haul <b>charter</b> programme sought {{to address the}} established airlines' concerns by teaming up with Swiss flag carrier Swissair, whereby Modern Air would fly partner Berliner Flugring's long-haul package tour customers between Berlin Tegel and Swissair's Zürich Airport base at a minimum frequency of two round trips per week to enable convenient transfers to and from Swissair's global network. However, this revised plan still met with objections from Pan Am, BEA and Air France, who viewed Swissair's support for it {{as an attempt to}} divert long-haul passengers on to the Swiss airline's network by using Modern Air's proposed Tegel-Zürich flights as a feeder. The Allied Air Attachés upheld the objections of West Berlin's three main scheduled airlines by ruling that combining charter and scheduled flights in a package was impermissible. As a result of these rulings, despite increasing the total number of passengers carried in 1972 to just under 400,000 and growing total revenues to $15.6 million, Modern Air was unable to expand profitably in West Berlin and recorded a loss for the year (a $2.42 million operating loss and a $4.14 million net loss, respectively).|$|R
50|$|Modern Air's {{management}} {{sought to}} counteract the advantages British competitors enjoyed in the West Berlin charter market by partnering long-standing business partner Berliner Flugring in launching the city's first regular, all year <b>round</b> long-haul <b>charter</b> flight programme. It was thought that, in addition to picking {{up some of the}} lucrative contracts for an extensive short-/medium-haul West Berlin charter flight programme from Tegel Airport a consortium of three West German tour operators had awarded to defunct British rival Channel Airways in September 1970 (beginning in March 1971), this would provide sufficient utilisation for the airline's additional Berlin-based aircraft and enable it to obtain better rates than in the city's heavily contested short-/medium-haul charter market. This in turn would allow Berliner Flugring to further differentiate itself from rivals and enable it to charge its customers a premium for a new, unique and superior product. However, this was dependent on regulatory approval by the Allied Air Attachés in Bonn and the aviation authorities of destination countries. However, as a result of pressure exerted by Pan Am, British European Airways (BEA) and Air France on the Allied Air Attachés, as well as objections lodged by the destination countries' national airlines with their aviation authorities, the relevant approvals were withheld. The established airlines viewed Modern Air's plans as a backdoor route to the scheduled air market. They feared that granting permission to a non-member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) outside the relevant intergovernmental, bilateral air transport agreements would set a precedent for other non-IATA members to bypass regulatory restrictions in contemporary bilateral air transport agreements that limited access to scheduled air services and encourage circumvention of IATA fare rules by non-members.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, to Modern Air's {{abortive}} {{attempts to}} launch a regular, year <b>round</b> long-haul <b>charter</b> programme from West Berlin in partnership with Berliner Flugring, the airline and its long-standing business partner also attempted {{for a number of}} years to gain all necessary approvals for West Berlin's first-ever charter flight to Moscow as part of a one-off, all-inclusive city break package in the Soviet capital. Modern Air's management hoped to be able to build on its earlier success of 1968, when interventions at the highest level of the US government with its Soviet counterpart had resulted in Modern Air becoming the first US non-scheduled airline to be given permission at short notice to fly a US charter party to Moscow for a brief stopover on its first transpolar flight ("Polar Byrd I"). In addition to being a test of the limits of East-West cooperation in the then prevailing political climate of Détente (which aimed to create a more stable and predictable political environment by easing Cold War tensions), it was thought that this would be a major publicity coup for the airline and help it to raise its public profile further. Despite appearing cooperative initially, the Soviet authorities imposed increasingly onerous conditions on the airline and tour operator for the programme to go ahead. These ultimately proved unworkable and forced its abandonment. Similar to the case of the Bulgarian communist authorities' sudden and unexplained withdrawal of landing and overflight rights for flights originating/terminating in West Berlin (despite the much-needed hard currency Bulgaria earned from air navigation fees and airport user charges paid by the American and British airlines that operated these flights), some Western political observers at the time suspected behind-the-scenes East German lobbying of its Warsaw Pact ally and chief political backer respectively to have caused this to ensure East Germany's political and economic interests were not ignored in its Cold war allies' interactions with the West, especially where these concerned relations with West Berlin.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout this tumultuous period, Charter {{never quite}} lost its {{carefree}} atmosphere and wild touch—best exemplified perhaps by the infamous Initiation Night of 1988. In 1988, Charter counted as members {{most of the}} Varsity Football Team, including many of the '89 section's officers. It was some of these gridiron heroes who allegedly planned the raucous celebration of the admission of the new sophomore section which led to 45 members sent to McCosh Infirmary or Princeton Medical Center for alcohol-related reasons. The Princeton Borough Police quickly <b>rounded</b> up the <b>Charter</b> officer corps, and criminal charges were brought against the president and social chair, who were convicted of serving alcohol to minors, fined $500, and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The sentences were later overturned by a Mercer County Court judge, and the two undergraduate officers received probation and were ordered to perform community service. [...] To prevent a similar occurrence, but also to commemorate forever this fateful night, Charter now conducts formal initiations a week after all the other eating clubs, and on what would otherwise be initiation night officially [...] "goes dry." [...] Initiation Night '88 is generally considered to be, along with the Section Party of 1930, one of Charter's most infamous moments.|$|R
