5000|$|Wheels — these help {{propel the}} mower in action. Generally, <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> have two wheels.|$|R
50|$|While {{considered}} antiquated {{in modern}} times, the original type of push-powered <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> are still available. The reel {{is attached to}} the mower's wheels by gears, so that when the mower is pushed forward, the reel spins several times faster than the rubber-tired wheels turn. These types of <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> offer the benefit of zero pollution being produced. Since all of the energy necessary comes from the user however, this method of mowing is the most strenuous and is not recommended for large lawns. Depending on the placement of the <b>reel,</b> these <b>mowers</b> often cannot cut grass very close to lawn obstacles, like trees, driveways, edging, etc., and also require a very smooth lawn surface to operate properly without bottoming out the cutter bar.|$|R
50|$|As of 2006, Gravely {{provides}} a full line of power lawn implements, including zero-turn <b>mowers,</b> <b>reel</b> <b>mowers,</b> and grass trimmers. Gravely {{today is a}} division of Ariens. Gravely products today continue to be sold exclusively through its dealer network.|$|R
5000|$|Push handle — the [...] "power source" [...] of a {{manually}} operated <b>reel</b> <b>mower.</b> This is a sturdy T-shape handle that {{is connected to}} the frame, wheels and blade chamber.|$|E
50|$|A {{cylinder}} mower or <b>reel</b> <b>mower</b> carries a fixed, horizontal cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over {{this is a}} fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the blade cylinder forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder.|$|E
50|$|This type of mower is used {{to produce}} {{consistently}} short and even grass on bowling greens, lawns, parks and sports grounds. When pulled by a tractor (or formerly by a horse), these mowers are often ganged into sets of three, five or more, to form a gang mower. A well-designed <b>reel</b> <b>mower</b> can cut quite tangled and thick tall grass, but this type works best on fairly short, upright vegetation, as taller vegetation tends to be rolled flat rather than cut.|$|E
50|$|Mowers {{also create}} {{significant}} noise pollution, and could cause hearing loss if used without hearing protection. This {{can be avoided}} {{through the use of}} <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> or by using cheap, easily obtainable hearing protection such as earplugs or earmuffs.|$|R
50|$|Riding <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> {{are also}} produced. Typically, the cutting reels {{are ahead of}} the vehicle's main wheels, so that the grass can be cut before the wheels push the grass over onto the ground. The reels are often {{hydraulically}} powered.|$|R
50|$|Horicon is {{home of the}} John Deere Horicon Works, which {{produces}} lawn and garden tractors, golf and turf <b>reel</b> <b>mowers,</b> and utility vehicles. Daniel Van Brunt, {{the inventor of the}} grain-drill and founder of what became John Deere Horicon Works, also founded Horicon Bank in 1896.|$|R
50|$|Not {{everything}} the company produced {{was to be}} attached to a tractor. Agri-Fab was also producing environmentally friendly products that relied on muscle power. In addition to standard wheelbarrows, its precision-balanced poly wheelbarrow allowed the user to haul several times his or her weight. Its silent push <b>reel</b> <b>mower,</b> with blades that were precision ground {{to the point where}} the blade and the cutter bar did not touch, was the best in the business.Even as Agri-Fab added new products, the lawn sweeper continued to be the mainstay of the product line. Gradually, Agri-Fab became the dominant source in the lawn sweeper business.|$|E
50|$|Jacobsen Manufacturing {{was founded}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century as a {{pattern-making}} shop by Knud Jacobsen, a Danish immigrant who came to Racine, Wisconsin, in 1891. A skilled woodworker, Jacobsen made patterns for automobiles, agricultural machines and electrical equipment. Jacobsen restructured his business as Thor Machine Works in 1917.In 1921 it released the 4-Acre mower, a gasoline-powered <b>reel</b> <b>mower</b> marketed through Jacobsen Manufacturing.The company continued to produce mowers for estates and golf courses throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and was not damaged by the Great Depression. Knud Jacobsen retired in 1939 and was succeeded as president by his son, Oscar Jacobsen.|$|E
50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine or electric motor {{can be added}} to a cylinder mower to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers. One type of <b>reel</b> <b>mower,</b> now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a belt. The wheels in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower.|$|E
50|$|The {{engines are}} {{commonly}} used on pressure washers. They {{can also be used}} on construction equipment such as soil compactors, generators and air compressors, and various lawn and garden equipment including tillers, edgers, <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> and blower/vacs. The engines have also found to work well on go-karts.|$|R
50|$|Eventually Briggs and Stratton {{settled on}} {{manufacturing}} automotive components and small gasoline engines. Briggs purchased an engine patent from A.O. Smith Company and began powering early washing machines and <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> {{as well as}} many other types of equipment. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1928.|$|R
50|$|Home <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> {{have certain}} {{benefits}} over motor-powered mowers {{as they are}} quieter and not dependent on any extra form of power besides the person doing the mowing. This is useful not only to lessen dependence on other types of power which may have availability issues, but also lessens {{the impact on the}} environment.|$|R
50|$|Humphrey the Bear oversleeps {{through the}} opening of hunting season one year. While the other bears flee {{to the safety of}} their cave, Humphrey is left outside and is forced to hide in a nearby cabin instead. Once inside the cabin, Humphrey is horrified to learn that it is a hunting lodge, made evident by the many guns and hunting trophies hanging on the walls. As he starts to leave, he sees Donald Duck coming toward the cabin {{carrying}} a rifle. Humphrey desperately looks for a hiding place inside the cabin, and finally notices a large bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. He quickly rolls up the rug, stows it in an empty trunk, and lays out flat {{on the floor in the}} rug's place. Just then, Donald enters unaware that his rug has been replaced, or that it is alive. Humphrey nervously endures several uncomfortable and painful experiences, all the while being very careful not to let Donald know that he is a real bear. These include hiccups, a burning ember from the fireplace falling on his fur, going through Donald's washer-dryer, and being mowed with a <b>reel</b> <b>mower,</b> among other things.|$|E
40|$|In this diploma {{thesis is}} {{documented}} an analysis and an approach of designing a self-propelled mobile <b>reel</b> <b>mower</b> with respect of general assumptions of industrial design. Thesis takes aim on {{a comparison of}} technologies of present manufacturers of garden equipment and proper choice and following application of technical solution and shape solution on a new product...|$|E
50|$|The {{company began}} as {{informal}} partnership between Briggs and Harold M. Stratton.Eventually Briggs and Stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines. Briggs purchased an engine patent from A.O. Smith Company and began powering early washing machines and <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> {{as well as}} many other types of equipment. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1928.|$|R
5000|$|Although Richardson had {{developed}} rotating <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> for his sons business, in August 1952 {{he decided to}} make a rotary lawn mower similar to the Mowhall, using a Villiers two-stroke engine mounted on its side but utilising a lighter base plate, allowing use by a single operator. He wanted it to be cheaper, lighter and more powerful. It was called the [...] "Peach-Tin Prototype", so named because it was made out of scrap metal with a peach tin used as a fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|Two main {{styles of}} blades {{are used in}} lawn mowers. Lawn mowers {{employing}} a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as rotary mowers, while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).|$|R
50|$|Lisle {{was founded}} in 1903 by C.A. Lisle, {{originally}} manufacturing horse-powered water well drilling machines. Later, Lisle made washing machines, cream separators, and <b>reel</b> lawn <b>mowers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Reel</b> <b>mowers,</b> {{also called}} {{cylinder}} mowers [...] (familiar as the hand-pushed or self-powered cylinder lawn mower), have a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel composed of helical blades, {{each of which}} in turn runs past a horizontal cutter-bar, producing a continuous scissor action. The bar is held at an adjustable level just above {{the ground and the}} reel runs at a speed dependent on the forward movement speed of the machine, driven by wheels running on the ground (or in self-powered applications by a motor). The cut grass may be gathered in a collection bin.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the density}} of the grass, excess thatch can {{accumulate}} and should be removed every several weeks. Mowing can be performed every 7-10 days, with no more than 1/3 of the blade cut at one time. Recommended mowing height of this grass is between [...]75 and 2 in. Mowing the grass shorter than this height can produce a weaker less attractive product, whereas mowing the grass higher than this height will promote a less-dense, wispy appearance. The use of <b>reel</b> <b>mowers</b> are suggested since common rotary lawn mowers will tear the fine-blade grass and leave a grey/white tip instead of a clean cut.|$|R
5000|$|Elec-trak branded {{attachments}} included electric trimmers, edgers, chainsaws, radios, arc welders, fork lifts, front-end loaders, rotary brooms, roller aerators, lawn rollers, dump carts, large vacuums, agricultural sprayers, moldboard plows, {{row crop}} cultivators, tillers, disk harrows, sickle bar mowers, belly mowers, front-mounted rotary mowers, front or rear-mounted ganged <b>reel</b> <b>mowers,</b> lawn sweepers, electric rakes, snowblowers, snowplows, golf bag holders, double seats, 120vac rotary inverters, canopy tops, and more. [...] Most of these attachments were {{connected by a}} 36VDC [...] "power take off" [...] using a NEMA 10-50 outlet, usually used in the U.S. for 240VAC clothes dryers and thus compatible with readily available cords {{in most of the}} USA.|$|R
50|$|Of all the mowers, a {{properly}} adjusted cylinder mower makes the cleanest {{cut of the}} grass, and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted cylinder mower is straight and definite, as if cut {{with a pair of}} scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. Lawn cut with a cylinder mower is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is not necessary for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar. If the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass, a clean cut can still be made. If more however, the grass will slip through. <b>Reel</b> <b>mowers</b> also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain.|$|R
50|$|The first United States {{patent for}} a <b>reel</b> lawn <b>mower</b> was granted to Amariah Hills on January 12, 1868. In 1870, Elwood McGuire of Richmond, Indiana {{designed}} a human-pushed lawn mower, {{which was very}} lightweight and a commercial success. John Burr patented an improved rotary-blade lawn mower in 1899, with the wheel placement altered for better performance. Amariah Hills went on to found the Archimedean Lawn Mower Co. in 1871.|$|R
50|$|A roller mower, or rollermower, is a tractor-powered multi-spindled {{rotary mowers}} that have full width rollers front and rear. Most rollermowers attach to a four-wheeled tractor via the three-point linkage and are {{powered by the}} tractor’s power {{take-off}} (PTO), though larger models connect three or more complete mowing decks to a separate chassis that is towed behind the tractor. Good rollermowers can produce a finish rivalling that of <b>reel</b> (cylinder) <b>mowers</b> while generally being far more robust and requiring considerably less maintenance. Modern machines can also cope efficiently with {{a wider range of}} grass lengths and densities than cylinder mowers.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} zoysia are {{available}} commercially as sod in some areas. In typical savanna climates with warm {{wet and dry}} seasons, such as southern Florida, zoysia grasses grow during the warm-wet summer and are dormant in the drier, cooler winter months. They are popular because of their fine texture, soft feel, and low growth habit. They can form dense mats and even mounds that grow over low features. In contrast to St. Augustine grass, they generally require less fertilization and are less vulnerable to insect and fungus damage, depending on environmental conditions. For best appearance, turf experts recommend <b>reel</b> blade <b>mowers</b> for zoysia.|$|R
50|$|Used in <b>reel</b> or {{cylinder}} <b>mowers,</b> cylinder blades {{are composed}} of three to seven helical blades welded in a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel, creating a scissor-like cutting action. Unlike other types of mower blades, reel/cylinder blades cannot be replaced; therefore, a broken blade requires replacement of the entire mower. For dull or rusty blades, cleaning and sharpening kits are available.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, the {{original}} Lawn-Boy lawn mower was manufactured by the Evinrude Company, {{becoming the first}} one-handed <b>reel</b> power <b>mower</b> introduced to the American public. Evinrude purchased Johnson Motor Wheel Company from a New York stock brokerage firm a year later, and in 1936 they merged with the Outboard Marine and Manufacturing Company (OMC), continuing production of Lawn-Boy mowers until 1939, when it was temporarily put on hold to manufacture outboard motors for World War II. In 1946 and after the war, Joel G. (Jack) Doyle built the first rotary lawnmower for the Rotary Power Mower Company of Kansas City, Missouri. Doyle accumulated orders for these mowers from Sears Roebuck, Gimbles, Spiegel, and other businesses. OMC then bought RPM in 1952, and changed the brand of the rotary lawn mower to the Lawn-Boy name.|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} has been done concerning consumer product safety warnings. This study, using 91 undergraduates, attempts to alleviate this void through an experiment in which the design and presence of a safety warning are systematically varied. The presence of a warning is fowld to {{have a positive impact on}} an individual's perception of the effectiveness and safety of a brand. The use of a pictogram, the strength of a signal word, and the use of capital letters in a safety warning are found to have little effect on perception of a brand or 011 memory of safety information. Accidents related to poorly designed or manufactured products injure millions of Americans each year (U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,] 982). In response to this accident rate, the government has launched a major effort to make products safer. An im-portant part of this effort is ensuring that ap-propriate safety warnings are included on dangerous products. The government exercises authority over product warnings in two important ways. First, regulations are enacted by various gov-ernment agencies, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These regula-tions usually dictate that a specific warning be placed on a product that the government considers dangerous. For instance, all power rotary and <b>reel</b> lawn <b>mowers</b> must convey the message "Danger " on an 8. 12 x 10. 2 cm (3. 25 I Requests for reprints should be sent to Michael Ursie...|$|R
