Mackenzie tricks them into boarding a ferry for Morocco, where they are arrested and sent to a black site prison in the desert. After another attempt on their lives, they are informed that the drug operation was organised by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who are using the operation to fund black operations, {{and as a result of}} the four's interference a kill contract is out against them.
