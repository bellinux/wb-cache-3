In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to <b>rappel</b> down the cliffs {{on the side of the}} mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E

The same year, she played the supporting role of Aunt Josephine in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events alongside Jim Carrey, based on the first three novels in Snicket's book series. The black comedy received generally favorable reviews from critics, and won the Academy Award for Best Makeup. Inspired by her love of Giverny in France and Claude Monet, Streep did the narration for the film Monet's Palate, with Alice Waters, Steve Wynn, Daniel Boulud and Helen <b>Rappel</b> Bordman.|$|E

All <b>rappels</b> are conducted with and without combat equipment. During fast rope familiarization, students conduct a controlled descent and a static hold for five seconds. Students that successfully conduct both descents from a 12 ft platform then descend from the 34 ft tower using the stack-out/rapid exit technique. Fast rope descents are conducted without combat equipment.Soldiers are tested on: ...|$|R

25|$|After three years, {{during which}} {{surveyors}} sometimes had to <b>rappel</b> down the mountain's cliffs {{to mark the}} route, construction began in 1916. The original idea to build a tunnel was changed to a road cut into the side as lighting {{it would have been}} too expensive and it would have missed the most scenic aspects of the road. Accordingly, the specifications for the project were changed. The planned road was widened from , with a three-foot (1 m) concrete gutter.|$|E
25|$|A prusik, Klemheist knot, or autoblock knot {{may be used}} as safety back-up, {{commonly}} referred to as an 'autoblock,' and is used as a back-up {{in the case of the}} abseiler losing control of the abseil. One of these friction hitches is wrapped around the rope below the <b>rappel</b> device, using a short loop of smaller diameter cord or webbing, often called a 'prusik loop'. The prusik loop is then attached to the belay loop or leg loop of the harness.|$|E

25|$|The course {{requires}} prospective Guardsmen {{to undergo}} a timed 10km fast march, a 2km coastal swim and an advanced obstacle course known as the Guards Assault Course (GAC). The GAC is a team course that requires trainees to swim 50 meters, climb a high tower, <b>rappel</b> down, and complete a 5km run on a standard obstacle course while carrying a hors de combat teammate on a stretcher for the last 1.5 kilometers. The course is done in full battle order (FBO) and sandbags (to meet the weight requirement). Guardsmen are also required to maintain a strict physical fitness regime.|$|E

25|$|The game lets players control two characters: twins Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob is a hot-headed brawler, {{specializing in}} close-ranged combat, while Evie is strong in stealth and relies on her {{intelligence}} and wit. Additionally, Evie {{is the first}} playable female protagonist of the main series. The main weapons of Syndicate include brass knuckles, a compact revolver, a cane-sword, and the traditional Nepalese curved kukri knife. The game also introduces new systems to navigate the world: a rope launcher, which allows players to <b>rappel</b> up structures, or create a zip-line between buildings; carriages, which can be piloted or simply occupied by players, and can be the setting of fights and parkour chases; and a train, which serves as the main base for players throughout the game. Unlike its predecessor, the game has no multiplayer mode, and does not feature a companion app, which was introduced in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.|$|E

500|$|Intensive {{geological}} {{sampling and}} survey {{work of the}} pipeline route started in spring 1970. Aerial photograph were taken, examined, and a preliminary route was detailed. Small survey parties physically visited the route and hammered stakes into the ground. The work was difficult; animal dangers forced the crews to be armed, and they also {{had to cope with}} the remote area and limited infrastructure. In places, the foliage was so dense that trees had to be cut down and progress was limited to [...] per day. The surveyed route passed through several mountain passes: Atigun Pass, Isabel Pass, Thompson Pass, and Keystone Canyon. In the latter location, surveyors had to <b>rappel</b> down cliffs in order to perform their work.|$|E
500|$|Another {{series of}} pranks was planned for Thanksgiving weekend in 2009, {{involving}} transforming MIT into [...] "Caltech East: School of Humanities". [...] The pranks were planned {{over the course}} of six months. [...] Caltech students intended to deploy two large banners that were designed to be easy to place, but removal would require a cherry picker or a <b>rappel.</b> [...] However, the design of MIT's Killian Court prevented the placement of one of them, and another was intercepted by MIT security before its deployment could be completed. [...] Another fake edition of The Tech was released, stating that students would be required to take a core of literature, history, philosophy, and economics, but science subjects would be eliminated. [...] Although the failure of the pranks was considered to be a disappointment, Caltech and MIT students afterwards shared breakfast at a local diner.|$|E
500|$|As Gordon {{proceeds}} up the cliffside to the Byzantine Christian monastery, he encounters heavy {{resistance from}} Combine soldiers who <b>rappel</b> down the cliff {{to try to}} stop him. Gordon fights his way up, enters the church's nave, and disables the artillery launcher. This alerts nearby soldiers, who assault the sanctuary in force, while a Combine attack helicopter arrives to support the soldiers. After defeating the soldiers in the courtyard, Gordon moves to scaffolding {{over the side of the}} cliff and destroys the helicopter with RPGs. The helicopter crashes into the scaffolding, freeing up a path to a crude elevator which lowers Gordon back down to the pier. The fisherman congratulates Freeman on his success, invites him to a feast in St. Olga, and the screen fades out. As the level ends, the fisherman exclaims that Gordon is [...] "getting all fuzzy 'round the edges".|$|E
