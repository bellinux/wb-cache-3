Stiglitz says that without dwelling on the past, Brown tries to highlight the lessons previous events have for us.Lord Skidelsky says that Brown was the right man {{in the right place}} when it came to responding to the crisis, noting that efforts to coordinate economic recovery collapsed once Brown left the international stage. Skidelsky identifies two major acts of global leadership, the <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> and the coordination of fiscal and monetary stimulus, especially the one trillion dollar package announced at the London G-20 Summit. Skidelsky relates how the World Bank's president Robert Zoellick said the package [...] "broke the fall" [...] of the world economy. While mostly in agreement with Brown, Skidelsky writes that his successes in 2008 and 2009 have made Brown overly optimistic about what can be achieved at global summits, and that the road to achieving a [...] "global compact" [...] for jobs and poverty reduction will be rocky, if it can be travelled at all.Samuel Brittan in The Financial Times opines that Brown's message on the continual need for aggregate demand to be maintained very much needs to be heard, especially by European politicians who may be overly influenced by deficit cutting fiscal fundamentalism.|$|E

[...] However, the treaty states that the intention of the signatories is to incorporate the treaty's provisions into EU structures within 10 years. The agreement was signed by 26 EU member states (all but Sweden and the United Kingdom) and is open to accession to any other EU member states.

40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis has hit Europe in its core. While the crisis {{may not have}} originated in the European Union, it has laid bare structural weaknesses in the EU’s policy framework. Both public finances and the banking sector have been heavily affected. For a long time, the EU failed {{to take into account}} sufficiently the perverse link that existed between the two. Negative evolutions in one field of the crisis often dragged along the other in its downward spiral. In June 2012, {{in the early hours of}} a yet another EU Summit, the leaders of the eurozone finally decided to address the link between the banking and sovereign debt crises. Faced with soaring public borrowing costs in Spain and Italy, they decided to allow for the direct European <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> when the Member State itself would no longer be in a position to do so. In exchange, supervision of the banking sector would be lifted to the European level by means of a Single Supervisory Mechanism. The Single Supervisory Mechanism, or SSM in the EU jargon, is a first step in the broader revision of policies towards banks in Europe. The eventual goal is the creation of a Banking Union, which is to carry out effective surveillance and – if needed – crisis management of the banking sector. The SSM is to rely on national supervisors and the ECB, with the ECB having final authority on the matter. The involvement of the latter made it clear that the SSM would be centred on the eurozone – while it is to remain open to other Member States willing to join. Due to the ongoing problems and the link between the creation of the SSM and the <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks,</b> the SSM became one of the key legislative priorities of the EU. In December 2012, Member States reached an agreement on the design of the SSM. After discussions with the European Parliament (which were still ongoing at the time of writing), the process towards making the SSM operational can be initiated. The goal is to have the SSM fully up and running in the first half of 2014. The decisions that were taken in June 2012 are likely to have had a bigger impact than the eurozone’s Heads of State and Government could have realised at the time for two important reasons. On the one hand, creating the SSM necessitates a full Banking Union and therefore shared risk. On the other hand, the decisions improved the ECB’s perception of the willingness of governments to take far-reaching measures. This undoubtedly played a significant role in the creation of the Outright Monetary Transactions programme by the ECB, which has led to a substantial easing of the crisis in the short-term. 1 These short-term gains should now be matched with a stable long-term framework for bank supervision and crisis management. The agreement on the SSM should be the first step in the direction of this goal. This paper provides an analysis of the SSM and its role in the creation of a Banking Union. The paper starts with a reminder of why the EU decided to put in place the SSM (§ 1) and the state of play of the ongoing negotiations on the SSM (§ 2). Subsequently, the supervisory responsibilities of the SSM are detailed, including its scope and the division of labour between the national supervisors and the ECB (§ 3). The internal functioning of the SSM (§ 4) and its relation to the other supervisors are discussed afterwards (§ 5). As mentioned earlier, the SSM is part of a wider move towards a Banking Union. Therefore, this paper sheds light on the other building blocks of this ambitious project (§ 6). The transition towards the Banking Union is important and will prove to be a bumpy ride. Before formulating a number of conclusions, this Working Paper therefore provides an overview of the planned road ahead (§ 7) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} stability trilemma states that a stable financial system, an integrated financial system and national {{financial stability}} policy are incompatible.

As a stable financial system is desirable and financial integration is ongoing, the viability of national financial stability policies within the European Union comes into question. The ECB has set the first steps towards a European policy with the publication of a Financial Stability Review and the provision of liquidity to the banking system (general lender of last resort support) to stabilise markets in the 2007 / 8 financial crisis. However, individual lender of last resort support and possible <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> ailing <b>banks</b> are still in the realm <b>of</b> national central <b>banks</b> and finance ministries.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} the new European rules for burden-sharing and bail-in in the banking sector, in view of their ability to accommodate broader policy goals of aggregate financial stability. It finds that the Treaty principles and the new discipline of state aid and the restructuring <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> provide a solid framework for combating moral hazard and removing incentives that encourage excessive risk-taking by bankers. However, {{the application of the}} new rules may have become excessively attentive to the case-by-case evaluation of individual institutions, while perhaps losing sight of the aggregate policy needs <b>of</b> the <b>banking</b> system. Indeed, in this first phase <b>of</b> the <b>banking</b> union, while large segments <b>of</b> the EU <b>banking</b> sector still require a substantial restructuring and recapitalisation, the market {{may not be able to}} provide all the needed resources in the current environment of depressed profitability and low growth. Thus, a systemic market failure may be making the problem impossible to fix without resorting to temporary public support. But the risk of large write-offs of capital instruments due to burden-sharing and bail-in may represent an insurmountable obstacle to such public support as it may set in motion an investors’ flight. The paper concludes by showing that existing rules do contain the flexibility required to accommodate aggregate policy requirements in the general interest, and outlines a public support scheme for the precautionary <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> solvent <b>banks</b> that would be compliant with EU law...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has put great pressure on banks {{and led to}} a number of emergency measures intended to restore confidence in the banking system: tentative changes to accounting standards, <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>banking</b> industry, and higher capital requirements. Each measure targets a specific concern that has arisen during the crisis. Governments and regulators, however, have yet to deal with one of the essential causes of systemic risk: the inflexibility of prudential regulation for banking. As it happens, a single minor change would make it possible to restore much of the confidence in the banking sector without requiring any capital injections in the short term: acknowledging that banking capital ratios fall during downturns would have made most of the injections of public funds unnecessary. Making this change today would give governments far more room to support the real economy. 2 The work presented herein is a detailed summary of academic research conducted by EDHEC.

50|$|The third {{contributor}} to RBS's problems was its liquidity position. From a position around 2002 where {{the bank was}} essentially 'fully funded' (i.e. was funding its lending positions fully from deposits gathered from customers), the rapid growth in lending within the GBM (Global Banking and Markets) division led to a reliance on external wholesale funding. The combination of this, along with the weak equity capital position, and the massive exposure to losses on CDOs via Greenwich, were the factors that destroyed RBS. The bank experienced severe financial problems, and attempted to shore up its balance sheet with a £12 billion share issue in April 2008, {{one of the largest}} in UK corporate history.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis emphasised {{the need for}} effective financial stability analyses and tools for detecting systemic risk. This paper looks at assessment <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> sector resilience through stress testing. We argue such analyses are valuable even in emerging economies that suffer from limited data availability, short time series and structural breaks. We propose a top-down stress test methodology that employs relatively limited information to overcome this data problem. Moreover, as credit growth in emerging economies tends to be rather volatile, we rely on dynamic approach projecting key balance sheet items. Application of our proposed stress test framework to the Russian banking sector reveals a high sensitivity of the capital adequacy ratio to the economic cycle that shows up in both of the two-year macroeconomic scenarios considered: a baseline and an adverse one. Both scenarios indicate the need for capital increase in the Russian banking sector. Furthermore, given that Russia’s banking sector is small and fragmented relative to advanced economies, the loss of external financing can cause profound economic stress, especially for medium-sized and small enterprises. The Russian state has a low public debt-to-GDP ratio and plays decisive role in the banking sector. These factors allow sufficient fiscal space for <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> problematic <b>banks</b> under both <b>of</b> our proposed baseline and adverse scenarios. stress testing; bank; Russia...|$|R

40|$|On 8 October 2008 the UK Government {{announced}} a far-reaching plan to restore financial stability, protect depositors and re-invigorate {{the flow of}} credit to businesses and individuals in the UK. The £ 400 billion bailout plan embraced three elements: a massive expansion in emergency liquidity support from the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> England; <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>of</b> UK <b>banks</b> and building societies using taxpayers' money; {{and the provision of}} a Government guarantee of new short- and medium-term debt issuance made by UK-incorporated banks and building societies. This action proved necessary in the wake of continuing and substantial weaknesses in many banks' share prices despite the temporary ban on short-selling imposed by the Financial Services Authority. It followed two revisions to domestic deposit protection arrangements, and the adoption of a piecemeal approach to failure resolution which saw the eventual nationalisation of Northern Rock in February 2008, the nationalisation of Bradford and Bingley in September 2008 and the brokering of takeover rescues of Alliance and Leicester and HBOS by Banco Santander and Lloyds TSB respectively in July and September 2008, and of the Cheshire and Derbyshire Building Societies by the Nationwide Building Society in September 2008. This metamorphosis in approach to failure resolution by the UK authorities in response to the sub-prime crisis and the credit crunch – nationalisation by default to (part) nationalisation as the preferred course of action - is duly analysed in this article, as well as their proposals for banking reforms which still have to be agreed by Parliament.
