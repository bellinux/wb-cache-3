Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> to die down, and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are Loihi Seamount, Bowie Seamount, Davidson Seamount, and Axial Seamount.|$|E

Most married couples experience a gradual decline in the quality of their marriage; in recent years around the fourth year of marriage. Around the seventh year, tensions rise to a point that couples either divorce or adapt to their partner.|$|E

50|$|Zellweger is {{the brand}} name of an {{electric}} switching device used to control off-peak electrical loads such as water heaters. It {{is an example of}} carrier current signaling. Power stations transmit a ripple signal on the main transmission lines when off-peak <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> (often around 10 pm). This ripple noise is picked up by the Zellweger, which after a random delay turns the hot water heater on. The noise is often picked up by other equipment, especially audio amplifiers and stereos and the noise can cause problems with other electrical devices. Even some telephone lines can pick up the noise. The noise can be particularly obtrusive from some fluorescent light systems.|$|E
5000|$|GoCar is {{the first}} Carsharing service in Ireland. GoCar members can book cars online or via the app {{for as little as}} an hour, then unlock with their phone or GoCard; the keys are in the car, with fuel, {{insurance}} and city parking all included. <b>Rates</b> <b>start</b> from €8 per hour, with 50KM of driving included on each trip. [...] GoCar now has over 10,000 members and operates a fleet of over 200 cars across 150+ locations in Ireland. Drivers can visit GoCar.ie to request a GoCar in their community. [...] It launched in Cork in September 2008, with the support of Cork City Council as a pilot scheme. Cork City Council gave GoCar use of 3 car parking locations in Cork City as part of a wider pilot scheme. Ireland's National Spatial Strategy has noted CarSharing as one element of the strategy.|$|E

5000|$|Cost - Private jet {{travel is}} very expensive, and the {{fractional}} {{model can be}} the most costly option (when compared to memberships, charter, etc.). The plans are also complex, with multiple layers of cost that make it nearly impossible to calculate a realistic fully loaded bottom-line per-flight cost. Owners are charged a monthly fee whether or not they fly, and the often-overlooked fuel surcharges can add up to over $1,000 per flight-hour. When owners sell their share back to the provider, the [...] "residual value" [...] calculation can vary substantially, depending on market conditions for used aircraft. Additionally, planes in fractional fleets tend to be flown harder, with more hours and takeoff/landing cycles than the average. This negatively affects residual value. The initial purchase price for a 1/16 share of a light jet starts at over $300,000. Monthly management fees start at about $9,000 per month. Occupied hourly <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> at about $1,500.|$|E
50|$|The stipend {{is around}} £13,000 {{per year for}} three years, (sometimes higher by £2,000-3,000 in London), {{whether or not the}} degree {{continues}} for longer (within the usual four-year span). This implies that the fourth year of Ph.D. work is often unfunded. A very small number of scientific studentships are sometimes paid at a higher rate - for example, in London, Cancer Research UK, the ICR and the Wellcome Trust stipend <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> at around £19,000 and progress annually to around £23,000 a year; an amount that is tax and national insurance free. Research Council funding is sometimes 'earmarked' for a particular department or research group, who then allocate it to a chosen student, although in doing so they are generally expected to abide by the usual minimum entry requirements (typically a first degree with upper second class honours, although successful completion of a postgraduate master's degree is usually counted as raising the class of the first degree by one division for these purposes). The availability of funding in many disciplines (especially humanities, social studies and pure science subjects) means that in practice only those with the best research proposals, references and backgrounds are likely to be awarded a studentship. The ESRC (Economic and Social Science Research Council) explicitly state that a 2.1 minimum (or 2.2 plus additional master's degree) is required—no additional marks are given for students with a first class honours or a distinction at masters level. Since 2002, there has been a move by research councils to fund interdisciplinary doctoral training centres which concentrate resources on fewer higher quality centres.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} pattern of elderly homeownership using microeconomic surveys of 15 OECD countries, merging 60 {{national}} household surveys on about 300, 000 individuals. In all countries the survey is repeated over time, permitting construction of an international dataset of repeated cross-sectional data. We find that ownership rates decline considerably after age 60 in all countries. However, {{a large part of}} the decline depends on cohort effects. Adjusting for them, we find that ownership <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> falling after age 70 and reach a percentage point per year decline after age 75. We find that differences across country ownership trajectories are correlated with indicators measuring the degree of market regulations...|$|E
40|$|Risk parity {{portfolios}} {{are traditionally}} constructed by choosing historical volatility as the risk measure. In an asset allocation context, {{this results in}} a substantial overweighting of bonds versus more volatile asset classes such as stocks: this is a concern in a low bond yield environment, since the presence of mean reversion in the yield implies that bonds are likely to perform poorly in the next future. In this article, we introduce three distinct risk parity strategies, explicitly designed to respond to changes in interest rate levels. Our results indicate that these strategies deliver higher returns when interest <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> to increase back to their long-term levels, and that the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, which also incorporates information on expected returns, is a less robust alternative...|$|E
