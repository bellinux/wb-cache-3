50|$|The {{riverbank}} warbler (Myiothlypis rivularis), sometimes {{known as}} the Neotropical <b>river</b> <b>warbler</b> or just <b>river</b> <b>warbler</b> (leading to confusion with Locustella fluviatilis), is a species of bird in the Parulidae family.|$|E
50|$|Highly {{protected}} {{bird species}} here include the bittern, marsh harrier, crane, kingfisher and <b>river</b> <b>warbler</b> {{as well as}} the middle spotted woodpecker, red kite, red-backed shrike. The greylag goose, greater white-fronted goose, bean goose and tufted duck are also at home here.|$|E
50|$|There are 604 {{species of}} birds {{throughout}} the country (data from BirdLife International, 2013). None of these are endemic but some such as the Dja <b>River</b> <b>warbler,</b> Verreaux's batis, African river martin and black-chinned weaver are restricted to Central Africa and have only small ranges. The grey-necked picathartes and Loango weaver are classed as vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E

[...] And again in winter evens [...] When on firelight dreaming fancy feeds, [...] In those ears of agèd lovers [...] Love’s own <b>river</b> <b>warbles</b> in the reeds. [...] Love still the past, O my love! [...] We have lived of yore, [...] O, we have loved of yore.|$|R
50|$|The Ja <b>River</b> scrub <b>warbler</b> (Bradypterus grandis) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Locustellidae.It is found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Gabon.Its natural habitat is swamps.It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Other birds {{found in}} Järveküla Nature Reserve include: the Barn swallow (the {{national}} bird of Estonia), Eurasian wryneck, Eurasian golden oriole, Icterine warbler, <b>River</b> <b>warbler,</b> Spotted flycatcher, Eurasian tree sparrow, Common chaffinch, European greenfinch, European pied flycatcher, Eurasian skylark, Fieldfare, White wagtail, Yellowhammer, Hooded crow, Garden warbler, Grey heron, Eurasian blue tit, Eurasian blackcap, Common rosefinch, European goldfinch and Common chiffchaff among others.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>river</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella fluviatilis) is an Old World warbler in {{the grass}} warbler genus Locustella. It breeds in east and central Europe into western Asia. It is migratory, {{wintering}} in east Africa. The genus name Locustella is from Latin and is a diminutive of locusta, [...] "grasshopper". This refers to {{the song of the}} common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific fluviatilis is Latin for [...] "of a river".|$|E
50|$|Doxey Marshes {{lies within}} the {{floodplain}} of the River Sow and periodically it breaches its banks and subjects the marshes to flooding. Wading birds love the shallow pools and muddy edges this flooding leaves behind {{as a source}} of food. In the autumn and spring during the migration period, Doxey can attract a variety of rare birds. Rarities recorded in recent years include <b>river</b> <b>warbler,</b> marsh warbler, purple heron, cattle egret, spoonbill, European bee-eater and bluethroat.|$|E
50|$|Lobéké National Park is an Important Bird Area (#CM033). Over {{three hundred}} {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} here. The rare red-nosed green pigeon (Treron calvus), rhinoceros birds (Buceros rhinoceros), Chrysococcyx flavigularis, Otus icterorhynchus and the chestnut kingfisher (Halcyon badia) can all {{be found in the}} park. Specifically within Cameroon and Gabon, it is an important bird area for the Ja <b>River</b> scrub <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Clod and The Pebble is the {{exemplification}} of Blake's statement at {{the beginning}} of Songs of Innocence and of Experience that it is the definition of the [...] "Contrary States of the Human Soul." [...] It shows two contrary types of love. The poem is written in three stanzas. The first stanza is the clod's view that love should be unselfish. The soft view of love is represented by this soft clod of clay, and represents the innocent state of the soul, and a childlike view of the world. The second stanza connects the clod and the pebble. It gives the location of the clod, pleasantly singing his view while being trodden on by a cattle. At the end of the 2nd line the shift in views is signaled by a semicolon. This shift is further emphasized {{with the use of the}} word [...] "But" [...] {{at the beginning}} of the third line. The pebble is meanwhile in the <b>river</b> <b>warbling</b> his view. The final stanza is the pebble's view of selfish love, and it is set up in a parallel structure to the clod's stanza on unselfish love.|$|R
60|$|There he sat, {{and tried}} to forget Marie in the tinkling of the streams, and the sighing of the autumn leaves, and the cooing of the sleepy doves; while the ice-bird, as the Germans call the water-ouzel, sat on a rock in the <b>river</b> below, and <b>warbled</b> his low sweet song, and then flitted up the grassy reach to perch and sing again on the next rock above.|$|R
50|$|This small {{passerine}} bird {{is found}} in reed beds, usually with some bushes. Three to six eggs are laid in a nest in reeds. The adult has an unstreaked grey-brown back, whitish grey underparts {{and a lack of}} throat streaks, which is a distinction from the <b>river</b> <b>warbler.</b> The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. This is not a shy species, but can be difficult to see in the reeds except sometimes when singing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a dozen}} couples of {{northern}} lapwing and eastern yellow wagtail, together with couples of meadow pipit, whinchat, red-backed shrike, bearded reedling, goshawk, spotted nutcracker, Eurasian wryneck, European honey buzzard, thrush nightingale, long-tailed tit, lesser spotted woodpecker, wood warbler, hawfinch, and Eurasian hobby. In the night time sedge warbler and reed warbler are regularly heard, while grasshopper warbler, <b>river</b> <b>warbler,</b> marsh warbler, and great reed warbler are reported now and then. Osprey are regularly seen fishing in the lake. Uncountable numbers of resting species are reported by the lake, including various swans, hawks, eagles, cormorants, and sparrows.|$|E
40|$|Bird sound {{classification}} {{and recognition}} using wavelets In this paper a new method for automatic classification {{and recognition of}} bird sounds is presented. Our main idea is to study, how inharmonic and transient bird sounds can be recognized efficiently. The data consisted of sounds of eight bird species. Five species, the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the Graylag Goose (Anser anser), the Corncrake (Crex crex), the <b>River</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Locustella fluviatilis), and the Magpie (Pica pica) have inharmonic sounds, whereas the remaining three reference species, the Quail (Coturnix coturnix), the Spotted Crake (Porzana porzana), and the Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) have harmonic sounds. The wavelet analysis was selected due to its ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information, {{and its ability to}} analyse signals which contain discontinuities and sharp spikes. The feature vectors calculated with the proposed algorithm from the wavelet coefficients were used as the inputs of two neural networks, the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results were encouraging, for the unsupervised SOM network recognized 78 % and the supervised MLP network 96 % of the test sounds correctly...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} is {{a summary of}} the annual report of the Dutch rarities committee (CDNA) for 2012. In 2012, two new taxa were added to the Dutch list: Sooty Tern Onychoprion fuscatus and North Caspian Stonechat Saxicola maurus hemprichii. Other remarkable records were the second Steppe Grey Shrike Lanius lahtora pallidirostris, the second and third Eastern Black Redstart Phoenicurus ochruros phoenicuroides, the third Bufflehead Bucephala albeola and the fifth Bonaparte's Gull Chroicocephalus Philadelphia. High numbers were recorded for <b>River</b> <b>Warbler</b> Locustella fluviatilis (7 records), Radde's Warbler Phylloscopus schwarzt (8 records), Buff-breasted Sandpiper Calidris subruficollis (11 records) and Olive-backed Pipit Anthus hodgsoni (18 records). All records of the latter species are from October and were part of the largest influx of this species in North-Western Europe ever recorded. Following recent advances in identifying flight calls from this species, the number of accepted records has grown since the publication of the annual report and may still grow. Out of a total of 511 species now on the Dutch list, 207 species (41 %) are regarded as vagrants, with less than two records per year during the last 30 years. All records and their documentation can now be accessed through a new website: www. dutchavifauna. nl...|$|E
