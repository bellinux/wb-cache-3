40|$|Contact Dermatitis (CD) is a {{skin disease}} {{which can make}} humans fearful of wearing certain fabrications.

Symptoms of the disease were reviewed using books and previous researches in this study. Reddish blisters, itching and reddish skin are common symptoms of CD. As there is no evidence about CD in Ayurveda, Western medicine and Ayurweda were linked by matching symptoms to find the connectivity of the skin diseases. Ayurweda described about “Kshudra Kushta” which has similar symptoms to those of CD. Herbs such aswild snakegourd, white <b>sandalwood,</b> <b>red</b> sandal wood and Heart leaved Moonseed are used in Ayurveda to cure “Kshudra kushta”. Mixtures of herbs with fixing agents were applied to cotton and polyester fabrications through a natural dyeing method to find a fabric finishing method for CD.

The mixture was tested with colour fastness to wash test ISO – 165 -CO 1 : 1987 and pH value of the olutions was also checked to study the feasibility. Cotton fabrications showed acceptable durability up to three (3) washes and polyester had poor durability. Wash durability is also dependent on the amount of fixing agents. There were slight colour changes after Copper sulphate treatment; Aluminum sulphate did not showed any colour change. It has neutral pH range. Fourteen (14) different garments which cause symptoms of CD were treated with the herbal mixture and wear trials were carried out. All garments showed positive results up to 3 domestic washes...|$|R
