25|$|<b>Revenue</b> <b>shortfalls</b> {{resulting}} from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction {{have contributed to}} the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16billion in 1998 to $3.83billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate over}} whether to move to annual {{sessions}} is a long-standing battle in Oregon politics, but the voters have resisted the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers. Because Oregon's state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over- or under-budget. Recent legislatures {{have had to be}} called into special session repeatedly to address <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfalls</b> resulting from economic downturns, bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions. Oregon Initiative 71, passed in 2010, mandates the legislature to begin meeting every year, for 160 days in odd-numbered years, and 35 days in even-numbered years.|$|E
25|$|State funding has, historically, {{been very}} high at the University of California. In 1987, the state {{provided}} 54% of the UC Berkeley's budget. However, {{due in part}} to the 2008–11 California budget crisis, recent educational appropriations to the university have seen a significant decline. State educational appropriations such as general support given in the state's annual budget, and appropriations given to the state through the federal American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) dropped $37M in 2010–11 from the previous calendar year. In 2013, state general support dropped to 12% of the university's total revenues. State budget shortfalls as well as rising costs in pensions have been cited by the university as two of the leading reasons for its current financial woes. In response to <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfalls,</b> the UC Regents have raised tuition, and the university is trying to increase the number of non-resident undergraduates, who will pay the more costly out-of-state tuition. Nearly one-third of revenues from tuition and other student fees are returned to students as scholarships and fellowships.|$|E

25|$|On April 30, 2010, McDonnell {{authorized}} issuing $493 {{million in}} transportation bonds in May 2010 {{and an additional}} $1.493 billion over the five years to finance previously approved transportation projects. The bonds {{were a part of}} a transportation package enacted three years previously, but had not been issued while Republican State Delegate Robert Marshall filed a lawsuit challenging the their constitutionality while certain transportation notes issued during the Gilmore Administration had not yet been paid off. Critics noted that Virginia lacked a revenue source to amortize the bonds. On December 9, 2010, McDonnell announced a revised transportation funding plan which included both $1.8 billion in bonds that had been approved in 2007, as well as an additional $1.1 billion which he proposed to pay back from future federal transportation funds. He also proposed to spend $150 million of the 2009–2010 budget surplus and $250 million in reserves to protect against gasoline tax <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> On January 9, 2011, McDonnell proposed funding projects to address traffic congestion in Northern Virginia and Hampton roads by diverting 0.25% of the sales tax collected in those areas from the General Fund into the transportation fund. Legislation was required to implement the proposal, and Democrats responded that the revenues were needed in the General Fund for schools and public safety and that the projected revenues were insufficient to make a difference on highway needs.|$|E
500|$|Early cost {{estimates}} hovered at $5 billion, with $1.1 {{billion for the}} lakeside Olympic Village and an additional estimated $366 million for a temporary 80,000 seat Olympic Stadium {{to be built in}} Washington Park. Nonetheless, the proposed budget was small in comparison to the Beijing Olympics, which are estimated to have cost $40 billion. [...] Further, the 2004 Olympic games in Athens, initially budgeted to cost $2.4 billion, in fact cost $9 billion. [...] On April 11, 2007, former Governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich proposed $150 million in state funding to help secure the bid to the USOC for Chicago. [...] Current Governor Pat Quinn stated that {{he would be willing to}} support any funding necessary to secure the Olympics for Chicago. By April 14, over $35 million in cash and $13 million in goods had been pledged, including donations in excess of $100,000 from at least 225 individuals and corporations. Chicago had strong allies to pursue federal funds for security and transportation: U.S. Senator Dick Durbin was the second in command among Democratic Senators as the Whip, and former Senator Barack Obama had become the President of the United States.

2500|$|Current MRT-3 fare {{levels were}} set on January 4, 2015 as a {{consequence}} of DOTC having to increase fares for the LRT-1 as per their concession agreement with MPIC-Ayala, with fare hikes delayed for several years despite inflation and rising operating costs. Prior to the current fares levels, MRT-3 fares were set on July 15, 2000 under the orders of then President Estrada; this was intended to have the MRT-3 become competitive against other modes of transport, but had the effect of causing <b>revenue</b> <b>shortfalls</b> which the government shouldered. While originally set to last only until January 2001, the new fare structure persisted due to strong public opposition against increasing fares, especially as MRT-3 ridership increased significantly after lower fares were implemented. [...] These lower fares—which are only slightly more expensive than jeepney fares—ended up being financed through large government subsidies amounting to around ₱45 per passenger, and which for both the MRT and LRT reached ₱75 billion for the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014. [...] Without subsidies, the cost of a single MRT-3 trip is estimated at around ₱60, and a ₱10 increase in fares would yield additional monthly revenues of ₱2-3 billion a month.|$|E
