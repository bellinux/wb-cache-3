40|$|The {{effect of}} NaOH {{mercerization}} on the crosslinking properties of 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetet racarboxylic acid (BTCA) on <b>ramie</b> <b>yarn</b> is studied, {{with emphasis on}} mercerization tension. NaOH at mercerization strength decrystallizes the ramie fibers, resulting in a higher accessibility to BTCA. Due to the change in fiber orientation caused by mercerization, tension mercerized and crosslinked <b>ramie</b> <b>yarn</b> shows a higher tenacity than the crosslinked control, while the low-tension or slack mercerized and crosslinked <b>ramie</b> <b>yarn</b> exhibits more serious tensile strength loss than the crosslinked control.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{understand}} the basic performances of bamboo yarns, the tensile strength, abrasion resistance and hairiness of yarns are analyzed through the comparison of bamboo yarns, cotton <b>yarns</b> and <b>ramie</b> <b>yarns.</b> Bamboo yarns show a higher strength, a lower breaking elongation, a better abrasive resistance and an obvious hairiness. Because of the existence of uneven fineness, the strength of bamboo yarns display a higher level of unevenness than cotton <b>yarns</b> and <b>ramie</b> <b>yarns.</b> After moisture absorption, the strength, initial modulus and work to break will increase remarkably...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ramie</b> <b>yarns</b> {{were treated}} with various {{concentrations}} of NaOH at room temperature and subsequently crosslinked with 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA). The microstructure and tensile properties of the treated yarns were characterized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR were used to study the crystalline structure of the resultant <b>ramie</b> <b>yarns.</b> The {{results showed that the}} maximum change {{in the structure of the}} alkali-modified ramie took place at 16 % NaOH, which would completely transform cellulose I to cellulose II. At the same time, the crystallinity index and fiber orientation decreased to the minimum value while the absorption properties were enhanced. The average degree of polymerization (DPÌ„) of the treated <b>ramie</b> <b>yarns</b> slightly decreased after NaOH treatment. Tensile properties including tenacity, breaking elongation, and modulus of the treated yarns were also investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the breakage of the treated yarns. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} long fiber-reinforced {{composite}} strands using continuous <b>ramie</b> <b>yarns,</b> in which polypropylene including MA-PP (maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene) {{was used as}} a matrix material. The composite strands were fabricated by a new method called multi-pin-assisted resin impregnation (M-PaRI) process, for which the equipment was newly applied after conventional extrusion process. The composite strands were then pelletized and injection molded. Tensile strength and Young's modulus of the resultant short ramie/PP reinforced composites were investigated. Results show that this new process improved the mechanical properties of injection-molded specimens...|$|R
