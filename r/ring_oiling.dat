Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap <b>rings,</b> <b>oil</b> caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R

50|$|The spring backed <b>oil</b> <b>rings</b> and {{the cast}} iron <b>oil</b> <b>rings</b> have {{essentially}} the same range of peripheral forms which consist of two scraping lands of various detailed form. The multipiece <b>oil</b> control <b>rings</b> usually consist of two rails or segments (these are thin steel rings) with a spacer expander spring which keeps the two rails apart and provides the radial load.|$|R
50|$|Most {{automotive}} pistons {{have three}} rings: The top two while also controlling oil are primarily for compression sealing (compression rings); the lower ring is for controlling {{the supply of}} oil to the liner which lubricates the piston skirt and the compression <b>rings</b> (<b>oil</b> control <b>rings).</b> At least two piston rings are found on most piston and cylinder combination. Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section. The periphery will then have either a barrel profile (top compression rings) or a taper napier form (second compression rings or scraper rings). There are some taper faced top rings and on some old engines simple plain faced rings were used.|$|R
40|$|LectureThe {{choice of}} which {{lubrication}} strategy {{to apply for}} pump bearings has implications for both the short term characteristics exhibited by the bearings and their long term reliability. When lubricating rolling element bearings, four basic strategies have historically been employed: Grease lubrication; Oil bath lubrication; Oil lubrication via slinger disc or oil ring; Oil mist lubrication. For high speed (3000 RPM and higher), slinger discs or <b>oil</b> <b>rings</b> are commonly used due to the short re-greasing interval exhibited with grease lubrication and the high heat generation due to churning seen with oil bath lubrication. This paper seeks to reprise the work of Lemmon & Booser, Heshmat & Pinkus, Gardner and Ettles et al in defining the equations of performance related to oil slinger discs and <b>oil</b> <b>rings.</b> It will then {{address some of the}} operational and reliability concerns of each of these oiling methods using a purpose built test rig that is representative of {{the current state of the}} art in bearing housing design for pumps.

Of the many {{factors that affect}} their long-term performance, contamination in the bearing lubricating oil plays a major part.

Repeated short-term contamination implies that the lubricating properties of the oil will be impaired and bearing reliability will be reduced. This paper presents an analysis of the factors affecting the short-term contamination of <b>oil</b> in <b>ring</b> <b>oil</b> lubricated rolling element bearings.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the lubrication between a one-ring-piston assembly and a cylinder in an engine. A special apparatus, with a stationary piston and a reciprocating cylinder was used, by means of which the variation of the friction on the piston assembly during the cycle was recorded. The variable factors governing the friction could be independently controlled. Thermocouples were installed at various positions in the piston, the ring and the cylinder, providing a method of determining the mean temperature of the oil between the piston assembly and the cylinder. The tests included an Investigation of the effects of viscosity, speed, and pressure on piston friction force. Results of these tests show that full film lubrication prevails, when the viscosity of the oil is comparatively high. At low viscosities and under pressure, a breakdown of the oil film occurs in the rig at B. D. C. (corresponding to T. D. C. in an actual engine). A theoretical analysis of the lubrication and friction between a piston-ring and a cylinder is proposed for a parallel faced <b>ring.</b> The <b>oil</b> film thickness under the ring is calculated (on the assumption that the piston clearance is empty) and is found to be in the order of. 0003 ", under zero differential pressure conditions.

40|$|In modern {{marine diesel}} engines, power output and {{in-cylinder}} firing pressures are constantly increasing, leading to higher friction in engine components {{and especially in}} the piston assembly. A good understanding of the friction contributions of the various engine components is needed, if mechanical efficiency is to be improved. A friction model for the engine piston assembly has been developed and is presented in this paper. The model, based on lubrication theory, considers the detailed engine geometry and the complete lubricant action, and thus can be applied {{to a wide range of}} engines. In detail, the analysis takes into account the friction components of compression <b>rings,</b> <b>oil</b> control <b>rings,</b> piston skirt and gudgeon pin of the engine piston assembly. The model was applied to a four-stroke (medium speed) marine diesel engine and the effect of engine speed and load on friction was examined and compared with results from other semi-empirical models.

40|$|Using {{classical}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations and quantum chemical calculations, {{the structure and}} charge-transfer parameters in crystalline poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) are investigated. The changes in polymer structure with temperature are studied and, by performing DFT calculations on configurations found from MD, {{the changes in the}} charge-transfer characteristics are investigated. The system is found to adopt a structure consistent with X-ray diffraction experiments on the so-called type-II polymorph of the poly(3 -alkylthiophenes). Upon increasing temperature, a conformational change in the polymer side chains occurs, which is found to lead to increased disorder in the interring torsions, which modulates the charge transfer along the polymer backbone. The intrachain transfer integrals are found to decrease slightly with temperature, while their distribution broadens considerably clue to increased thermal motion of the rings. The interchain transfer integrals are found to be appreciable for both nearest and next-nearest neighbor rings. This, taken {{with the fact that the}} positions of <b>rings</b> <b>oil</b> neighboring chains are strongly correlated, has consequences for the clevelopment of more accurate phenomenological charge-transport models, such as variable range hopping models...|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 157 - 156 In today?s {{business}} environment, {{centrifugal compressor}} reliability is more critical than ever. Unscheduled equipment downtime {{has a negative}} impact on plant operations, oftentimes resulting in a temporary halt of production. In most centrifugal compressor applications, loss of production results in a substantial loss of revenue, sometimes measured in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars per day. This lost revenue has a direct impact on the profitability of the plant. There are tens of thousands of centrifugal compressors currently operating with outdated technology, resulting in increased maintenance costs and reduced reliability. However, product upgrades can improve compressor operation and increase reliability and availability by incorporating the latest technology into existing rotating equipment. The initial investment for these mechanical upgrades is very low in comparison to current operating and maintenance costs and the lost revenue resulting from unscheduled downtime. In most cases, the payback period is measured in months or even weeks. This paper identifies the following mechanical (nonaerodynamic) compressor upgrades and discusses the technical and commercial advantages of each, calling on actual field examples to illustrate achieved benefits: ?

The specimens of <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> were rubbed against cast iron engine cylinder liner under boundary lubrication conditions. The ring and liner surfaces were examined by optical, scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The elemental analysis of surfaces was performed by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Surface observations showed that coating was removed from the ring surface. Higher levels of Ca, Zn, P, and S elemental ratios (0. 93 %, 0. 45 %, 1. 55 %, and 1. 60 % as atomic percent) were detected on the cylinder liner surface. Wear width, length, and depth measurements were performed by optical and atomic force microscopies on the ring and cylinder liner surface.

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{techniques}} for different applications. The word safetying is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap <b>rings,</b> <b>oil</b> caps, drain cocks, valves, and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{friction}} loss in automotive reciprocating engine, it {{is required to}} know the lubricant oil film behavior. In the present study, a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and a particle image velocimetry (PIV) were applied to measure the oil film thickness and its velocity, independently. A model engine with a quartz glass cylinder was used. Using Rhodamine B, a linear relationship between oil film thickness and fluorescence intensity can be obtained {{in the range of}} 0 to 150 μm. The LIF measurements were performed under the 300 rpm of mortaring condition. The range of oil film thickness was from 10 to 25 μm on the piston rings. The crank angle variation of oil film thickness was demonstrated successfully. The PIV measurements were also carried out under the motoring speed of 100 rpm. The velocity vector map was obtained in the slit of piston <b>ring.</b> The <b>oil</b> velocity was almost the same as the piston speed near the <b>oil</b> <b>ring.</b> Velocity profiles in the slit were visualized according to the crank angle positions.

5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas load acting on the ring. To minimize this, they are made of wear-resistant materials, such as cast iron and steel, and are coated or treated to enhance the wear resistance. Two-stroke port design is critical to ring life. Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top <b>ring</b> and <b>oil</b> control <b>rings</b> will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (physical vapour deposition) ceramic coating. For enhanced scuff resistance and further improved wear, most modern diesel engines have top rings coated with a modified chromium coating known as CKS or GDC, a patent coating from Goetze which has aluminium oxide or diamond particles respectively included in the chrome surface. The lower <b>oil</b> control <b>ring</b> is designed to leave a lubricating oil film, a few micrometres thick on the bore, as the piston descends. Three piece <b>oil</b> <b>rings,</b> i.e. with two rails and one spacer, are used for four-stroke gasoline engines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{incidence}} of mechanical fracture of an automobile piston rings prompted development of fracture analysis method on this case. The three rings (two compression <b>rings</b> and one <b>oil</b> <b>ring)</b> were smashed into several parts during the power-test (after manufacturing the engine) causing piston and liner to be damaged. The radial and oblique cracking {{happened on the}} failed piston rings. The aim of the fracture mechanics simulations {{presented in this paper}} was the calculation of particular effective fracture mechanics parameters, such as J-integrals and stress intensity factors. Crack propagation angles were calculated as well. Two-dimensional fracture analysis of the first compression ring has been developed in this paper using ABAQUS CAE 6. 5 - 1 software. Moreover, SEM fractography was developed on fracture surfaces and is discussed in this paper. Results of numerical calculations constitute the basis for further research on real object.

50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the timing chain cover. The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s <b>oil</b> <b>ring.</b> Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the <b>oil</b> <b>ring</b> tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|R
