Taking into account the fact that when changing the <b>braking</b> <b>modes</b> of the first and third cuts which cause similar changes in the values τ_ 1 ([...] v_ 1,σ_ 1) and t_ 3 ([...] v_ 3,σ_ 2), the position of U line is not changed, {{it can be argued that}} only one line of equal intervals corresponds to each <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> v_ 2.

The {{application}} of automation systems of breaking up process on the gravity hump is the efficiency improvement of their operation, absolute provision of trains breaking up safety demands, {{as well as}} improvement of hump staff working conditions. One of the main tasks of the indicated systems is the assurance of cuts reliable separation at all elements of their rolling route to the classification track. This task is a sophisticated optimization problem and has not received a final decision. Therefore, the task of determining the cuts <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> is quite relevant. The purpose {{of this research is}} to find the optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of control cut of design group. Methodology. In order to achieve the purpose is offered to use the direct search methods in the work, namely the Box complex method. This method does not require smoothness of the objective function, takes into account its limitations and does not require calculation of the function derivatives, and uses only its value. Findings. Using the Box method was developed iterative procedure for determining the control cut optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of design group. The procedure maximizes the smallest controlled time interval in the group. To evaluate the effectiveness of designed procedure the series of simulation experiments of determining the control cut <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of design group was performed. The results confirmed the efficiency of the developed optimization procedure. Originality. The author formalized the task of optimizing control cut <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of design group, taking into account the cuts separation of design group at all elements (switches, retarders) during cuts rolling to the classification track. The problem of determining the optimal control cut <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of design group was solved. The developed <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> ensures cuts reliable separation of the group not only at the switches but at the retarders of brake position. Practical value.

3000|$|These {{expressions}} allow {{suggesting that}} if δ t_ 1 ([...] v_ 2) = δ t_ 2 ([...] v_ 2) and _ 1 = _ 2, then δ t_ 1 ^*([...] v_ 2) = δ t_ 2 ^*([...] v_ 2). Therefore, at _ 1 = _ 2, {{the position of}} the U line in the domain of permissible <b>braking</b> <b>modes</b> is unchanged. We take into account the fact that the direction of the interval value increases along the line U and depends only on the position of separating points, and the length of the middle cut based on the position of optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> remains unchanged too. Thus, if it is known that <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> v_ 2 is the optimal one, the breaking modes change of the first and last cuts {{in such a way that}} _ 1 = _ 2 and the optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> will remain at the same point v_ 2.|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{vehicles}} {{usually have}} several braking systems, and <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> switches are significant events during braking. It {{is difficult to}} coordinate torque fluctuations caused by mode switches because the dynamic {{characteristics of braking systems}} are different. In this study, a new type of plug-in hybrid vehicle is taken as the research object, and <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> switches are divided into two types. The control strategy of type one is achieved by controlling the change rates of clutch hold-down and motor braking forces. The control strategy of type two is achieved by simultaneously changing the target braking torque during different mode switch stages and controlling the motor to participate in active coordination control. Finally, the torque coordination control strategy is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that the proposed control strategy has a good effect in reducing the braking torque fluctuation and vehicle shocks during <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> switches...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} paper is developing the methods for assessment of <b>braking</b> <b>modes</b> of cuts under conditions of fuzziness of their rolling properties, as well as selecting the permissible starting speed range of cuts from retardant positions. As a criterion for assessing the modes of target control of cut rolling speed, it was proposed to use an average gap size on a classification track at the established norms of probable exceeding of permissible speed of cars collision and their stop in retarders. As a criterion for evaluating the modes of interval control of cuts rolling speed, using the risk of their non-separation on the switches was proposed. Using the simulation modeling and mathematical statistics, the configuration of the range of permissible speed of cuts coming out from retardant positions has been set. The conducted researches allow simplifying the choice of cut <b>braking</b> <b>modes</b> in systems of automatic control of cut rolling speed. ...|$|R
3000|$|At this, to {{increase}} both intervals δ t_ 1 and δ t_ 2 {{and at the}} same time to maintain their equality, it is necessary to reduce the movement time of cut at the initial section τ_ 2 ([...] σ_ 2) with the simultaneous increase of Δ t_ss.

40|$|Purpose. Defining and {{analysis}} of the probabilistic and spectral characteristics of random current in regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of DC electric rolling stock are observed in this paper. Methodology. The elements and methods of the probability theory (particularly the theory of stationary and non-stationary processes) and methods of the sampling theory are used for processing of the regenerated current data arrays by PC. Findings. The regenerated current records are obtained from the locomotives and trains in Ukraine railways and trams in Poland. It was established that the current has uninterrupted and the jumping variations in time (especially in trams). For the random current in the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> the functions of mathematical expectation, dispersion and standard deviation are calculated. Histograms, probabilistic characteristics and correlation functions are calculated and plotted down for this current too. It was established that the current of the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> can be considered like the stationary and non-ergodic process. The spectral analysis of these records and “tail part” of the correlation function found weak periodical (or low-frequency) components which are known like an interharmonic. Originality. Firstly, the theory of non-stationary random processes was adapted for the analysis of the recuperated current which has uninterrupted and the jumping variations in time. Secondly, the presence of interharmonics in the stochastic process of regenerated current was defined for the first time. And finally, the patterns of temporal changes of the correlation current function are defined too. This allows to reasonably apply the correlation functions method in the identification of the electric traction system devices. Practical value. The results of probabilistic and statistic analysis of the recuperated current allow to estimate the quality of recovered energy and energy quality indices of electric rolling stock in the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode.</b> But the correlation and spectral analysis is required to determine the electromagnetic compatibility of the electric rolling stock in the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> with the subsystems and the electric traction devices...|$|R
