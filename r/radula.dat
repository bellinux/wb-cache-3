5|$|Some {{species have}} other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} <b>radula</b> and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, {{some of the}} muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them {{one of the few}} bioluminescent octopuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{synonyms}} {{are other}} binomial names that were given {{over time to}} this taxon by authors who were unaware that the specimens they were describing belonged to a species already described by Linnaeus; in some cases, local variations in colour and form may have misled these authors into thinking they had a different species. Strombus vanicorensis is a subsequent, changed spelling of Strombus vanikorensis {{by one of the}} original authors. There is some disagreement in the literature {{as to whether or not}} this taxon and the similar-looking Laevistrombus turturella are actually separate species. Leo Man In 'T Veld and Koenraad de Turck (1998) considered that L.canarium and L.turturella are distinct (yet sympatric) species, based mainly on the shell morphology and a <b>radula</b> comparison. However, when Zaidi Che Cob reviewed a number of Strombus species in 2009, examining both shell characters and anatomical data including details of the genitalia, operculum and <b>radula,</b> he concluded that L.turturella was simply a morphotype, and therefore a synonym of L.canarium.|$|E
5|$|Their {{eyes are}} large and covered entirely by a {{transparent}} secondary cornea. They are greenish at the base. A pair of prominent ridges (olfactory crests) are present on the ventral surface of the head at the rear edge of the eyes. The mouth area is supported by seven triangular flaps (buccal lappets), each with 0 to 7 suckers of less than 0.2mm in diameter and 18 to 25 teeth. The strong, curved, and short beaks (rostra) are mostly black to dark brown. The <b>radula</b> has seven rows of teeth.|$|E
25|$|Cephalopod <b>radulae</b> {{are known}} from fossil {{deposits}} {{dating back to}} the Ordovician. They are usually preserved within the cephalopod's body chamber, commonly in conjunction with the mandibles; but this need not always be the case; many <b>radulae</b> are preserved in a range of settings in the Mason Creek.|$|R

5|$|The burrows {{observed}} imply simple behaviour, and {{the complex}} efficient feeding traces common {{from the start}} of the Cambrian are absent. Some Ediacaran fossils, especially discs, have been interpreted tentatively as trace fossils but this hypothesis has not gained widespread acceptance. As well as burrows, some trace fossils have been found directly associated with an Ediacaran fossil. Yorgia and Dickinsonia are often found at the end of long pathways of trace fossils matching their shape; these fossils are thought to be associated with ciliary feeding but the precise method of formation of these disconnected and overlapping fossils largely remains a mystery. The potential mollusc Kimberella is associated with scratch marks, perhaps formed by a <b>radula.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes <b>Radula</b> complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
5|$|Many {{details about}} the anatomy of Lobatus gigas were not well known until Colin Little's 1965 general study. In 2005, R. L. Simone gave a {{detailed}} anatomical description. L.gigas has a long extensible snout with two eyestalks (also known as ommatophores) that originate from its base. The tip of each eyestalk contains a large, well-developed lensed eye, with a black pupil and a yellow iris and a small slightly posterior sensory tentacle. Amputated eyes completely regenerate. Inside {{the mouth of the}} animal is a <b>radula</b> (a tough ribbon covered in rows of microscopic teeth) of the taenioglossan type. Both the snout and the eyestalks show dark spotting in the exposed areas. The mantle is darkly coloured in the anterior region, fading to light gray at the posterior end, while the mantle collar is commonly orange. The siphon is also orange or yellow. When the soft parts of the animal are removed from the shell, several organs are distinguishable externally, including the kidney, the nephiridial gland, the pericardium, the genital glands, stomach, style sac and the digestive gland. In adult males, the penis is also visible.|$|E

25|$|Predatory marine snails {{such as the}} Naticidae use the <b>radula</b> plus an acidic {{secretion}} to bore {{through the}} shell of other molluscs. Other predatory marine snails, such as the Conidae, use a specialized <b>radula</b> tooth as a poisoned harpoon. Predatory pulmonate land slugs, such as the ghost slug, use elongated razor-sharp teeth on the <b>radula</b> to seize and devour earthworms. Predatory cephalopods, such as squid, use the <b>radula</b> for cutting prey.|$|E
25|$|Within the gastropods, the <b>radula</b> {{is used in}} feeding by both herbivorous and {{carnivorous}} snails and slugs. The {{arrangement of}} teeth (also known as denticles) on the <b>radula</b> ribbon varies considerably from one group to another {{as shown in the}} diagram on the left.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radula</b> is 12mm {{long and}} 3mm in width. It has 61 rows of denticles (tiny teeth). There is {{sometimes}} a rudimentary tooth in the centre of some rows. The number of lateral teeth varying from 24 to 28. Charles Hedley described <b>radula</b> formula with 26 teeth: 24 + 0 + 24 × 61 while Robert C. Murdoch described <b>radula</b> formula with usual 26 teeth: 26 + 0 + 26 × 61. The innermost four teeth are small and slender, then they increase rapidly in size. The 25th tooth is rather smaller than the 24th, and the 26th is minute and occasionally absent.|$|E

25|$|The <b>radula</b> {{is used by}} {{molluscs}} {{for feeding}} and is sometimes compared rather inaccurately to a tongue. It is a minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon, typically used for scraping or cutting food before the food enters the oesophagus. The <b>radula</b> is unique to molluscs, and is found in every class of mollusc apart from bivalves.|$|E
25|$|Captured whales {{often have}} indigestible squid beaks in their stomachs. The mouth {{contains}} the <b>radula</b> (the rough tongue {{common to all}} molluscs except bivalvia).|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the more}} ancient {{lineages}} of gastropods, the <b>radula</b> is used to graze by scraping diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrates. Limpets scrape algae from rocks using <b>radula</b> equipped with exceptionally hard rasping teeth. These teeth have the strongest known tensile strength of any biological material, outperforming spider silk. The mineral protein of the limpet teeth can withstand a tensile stress of 4.9 GPa, compared to 4 GPa of spider silk and 0.5 GPa of human teeth.|$|E
50|$|Chitons are {{generally}} herbivorous grazers, though some are omnivorous and some carnivorous. They eat algae, bryozoans, diatoms, barnacles, and sometimes bacteria by scraping the rocky substrate with their well-developed <b>radulae.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{family of}} snails {{consists}} of herbivores, grazing with their <b>radulae</b> on rocky surfaces, feeding on algae and vegetable detritus, and more rarely by filter-feeding, as {{observed in the}} genus Umbonium.|$|R

50|$|Penion are {{commonly}} called siphon whelks {{because they have}} a very long siphon. Species typically have a large, pointed operculum. <b>Radulae</b> have 3 or 4 cusps on lateral teeth and 3 cusps on central teeth.|$|R

25|$|Digestive system: The {{formula of}} the <b>radula</b> is: 62-73/ × 138-157. The {{intestine}} has six convolutions and is without a caecum. Of the six convolutions of the intestine, four are imbedded in the liver, and two hang freely {{in the body}} cavity.|$|E
25|$|Molluscs have a {{structure}} called a <b>radula</b> which bears a ribbon of chitinous teeth. However, these teeth are histologically and developmentally different from vertebrate teeth and {{are unlikely to}} be homologous. For example, vertebrate teeth develop from a neural crest mesenchyme-derived dental papilla, and the neural crest is specific to vertebrates, as are tissues such as enamel.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} known to occur in a {{limestone}} area in Thanh Hóa Province, Vietnam. The shell is high-spired and slender with numerous whorls, and is usually a little over 10mm in length. When the species was described in 2007, {{as well as a}} detailed shell description, full accounts of the reproductive system and the <b>radula</b> of this species were also given.|$|E
50|$|Each tooth can {{be divided}} into three sections: a base, a shaft, and a cusp. In <b>radulae</b> that just sweep, rather than rasp, the {{underlying}} substrate, the shaft and cusp are often continuous and cannot be differentiated.|$|R
50|$|The {{biology of}} this cone species has been {{extensively}} studied, in particular the embryonic development of its venom apparatus, {{the expression of the}} venom gland proteome {{and the role of the}} venom bulb in delivery of venom components to the <b>radulae.</b>|$|R
