40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relation}} of CEO pay and turnover to performance and characteristics of companies in a new data set that covers large commercial banks over the period 1982 - 87. For newly hired CEOs, the elasticity of pay with respect to assets is about one-third. As experience increases, the correlation between compensation and assets diminishes for about four years and then rises back to its initial value. We interpret these findings {{along the lines of}} Rosen's matching model, allowing for adjustments of compensation and bank assets and for possible dismissal of the CEO.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we build}} first a {{univariate}} {{and then a}} multivariate filtered historical simulation (FHS) model for financial risk management. Both the univariate and multivariate methods simulate future returns from a model using historical return innovations. While the former relies on portfolio <b>returns</b> <b>filtered</b> by a dynamic variance model, the latter uses individual or base asset return innovations from dynamic variance and correlation models. The univariate model is suitable for passive risk management or risk measurement whereas the multivariate model is useful for active risk management such as optimal portfolio allocation. Both models are constructed {{in such a way}} as to capture the stylized facts in daily asset returns and to be simple to estimate. The FHS approach enables the risk manager to easily compute Value-at-Risk and other risk measures including Expected Shortfall for various investment horizons that are conditional on current market conditions.

40|$|The daily {{transport}} of human plasma apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, triglyceride, and total cholesterol from the thoracic duct lymph into plasma {{was measured in}} 2 subjects before and 3 subjects after renal transplantation. Lymph triglyceride transport was ~ 83 % of the daily ingested fat loads, whereas lymph cholesterol transport was consistently greater than the amount of daily ingested cholesterol. Lymph apolipoprotein transport significantly (P < 0. 05) exceeded the predicted apolipoprotein synthesis rate {{by an average of}} 659 ± 578 mg/d for apolipoprotein A-I and 109 ± 59 mg/d for apolipoprotein A-II among the 5 subjects. It is estimated that 22 - 77 % (apolipoprotein A-I) and 28 - 82 % (apolipoprotein A-II) of daily total body apolipoprotein synthesis takes place in the intestine. Lymph high density lipoprotein particles are mostly high density lipoprotein(2 b) and high density lipoprotein(2 a) and have a greater overall relative triglyceride content and a smaller relative cholesteryl ester content when compared with homologous plasma high density lipoproteins. The major quantity of both lymph apolipoprotein A-I (81 ± 8 %) and apolipoprotein A-II (90 ± 11 %) was found within high density lipoproteins with almost all of the remainder found in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. The combined results are consistent with a major contribution of the intestine to total body synthesis of apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II. An important role of lymph in <b>returning</b> <b>filtered</b> apolipoprotein to plasma in association with high density lipoproteins is proposed.

40|$|This paper evaluates Nordhaus’s neoclassical {{complaints}} about the Stern Review {{from the vantage point}} of classical growth theory. Nordhaus argues that the Stern Review exaggerates the effects of global warming because it uses a discount rate that is well below the market rate of return on capital. From the perspective of classical growth theory, Nordhaus’s belief in choosing preference parameters for the social planner based on observed market rates of <b>return</b> <b>filtered</b> through the Ramsey equation is equivalent to assigning the preferences of the capitalist agents to the social planner. This equivalence is an implication of the Cambridge Theorem, which interprets the Ramsey equation as the saving function of the capitalist agents. The classical theory of growth interprets the market return to capital as a reflection of the property relations of capitalist society that does not offer the social planner any information that would be useful in resolving the problem of global warming. Contrary to the viewpoint of neoclassical economic theory, the market return to capital offers no information about preferences for the social welfare function or about the putative “marginal product” of conventional capital.

The possible causes of the long-term memory property are investigated using the <b>return</b> data <b>filtered</b> by the AR(1) model, reflecting the short-term memory property, and the GARCH(1, 1) model, reflecting the volatility clustering property, respectively. Notably, we found that the memory effect in the AR(1) <b>filtered</b> <b>return</b> and volatility time series remains unchanged, while the long-term memory property either disappeared or diminished significantly in the volatility series of the GARCH(1, 1) filtered data. We also found that in the high-frequency data the long-term memory property may be generated by the volatility clustering as well as higher autocorrelation. Our results imply that the long-term memory property of the volatility time series {{can be attributed to the}} volatility clustering observed in the financial time series. ...|$|R

This becomes a serious challenge in pressurized space compartments since no outside air ventilation is possible, and a larger particulate load is imposed on the filtration system {{due to lack of}} gravitational settling. The ISS Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) uses a filtration system that has been in use for over 14 years and has proven to meet this challenge. The heart of this system is a traditional High- Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter configured to interface {{with the rest of the}} life support elements and provide effective cabin filtration. Over the years, the service life of these filters has been re-evaluated based on limited post-flight tests of <b>returned</b> <b>filters</b> and risk factors.

This paper will discuss the test methods adopted and test results on prototypes of the ISS filters. The results will assist in establishing whether the service life can be extended for these filters. Results from unused filters that have been in storage will also be presented to ascertain the shelf life and performance deterioration, if any and determine if the shelf life may be extended...|$|R

40|$|The {{return of}} glomerular-filtered albumin to the rat renal vein. BackgroundRecent studies have {{demonstrated}} that the normal glomerular capillary wall (GCW) is not charge selective to albumin. This means that albumin flux across the GCW is high, and this has been confirmed in studies in which albumin uptake by the tubules has been inhibited. Therefore, there must be a high-capacity postglomerular retrieval pathway in normal kidneys that <b>returns</b> <b>filtered</b> albumin back to the blood supply. MethodsThis study identifies the presence of glomerular-filtered albumin in the renal vein from the analysis of the decrease of radioactivity in the venous effluent after the injection of a pulse of tritium-labeled albumin into the renal artery in vivo and in the isolated perfused kidney. ResultsThe postglomerular <b>filtered</b> albumin is <b>returned</b> to the blood supply by a high-capacity pathway that transports this albumin at a rate of 1830 ± 292 μg/min · rat kidney (N = 14, mean±sem). This pathway has been identified under physiological conditions in vivo and in the isolated perfused kidney. The pathway is specific for albumin, as it does not occur for horseradish peroxidase. The pathway is inhibited in a nonfiltering kidney. The pathway is also inhibited by ammonium chloride (an agent that inhibits tubular protein uptake but does not alter glomerular size selectivity) and by albumin peptides (which compete for the tubular albumin receptor). ConclusionsThe high-capacity retrieval pathway for albumin is most likely associated with transtubular cell transport. It is also apparent that most albuminuric states could be accounted for by the malfunctioning of this pathway without resorting to any change in glomerular permselectivity...|$|R

40|$|Data Tags are strings used in {{journals}} {{to indicate}} {{the origin of the}} archival data and to enable the reader to recover the data. The NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) has recently introduced a new approach to production of data tags and recovery of data from them. Many of the data access services at the IRSA <b>return</b> <b>filtered</b> data sets (such as subsets of source catalogs) and dynamically created products (such as image cutouts); these dynamically created products are not saved permanently at the archive. Rather than tag the data sets from which the query result sets are drawn, the archive tags the query that generates the results. A single tag can, then, encode a complex dynamic data set and simplifies the embedding of tags in manuscripts and journals. By logging user queries and all the parameters for those query as Data Tags, IRSA can re-create the query and rerun the IRSA service using the same search parameters used when the Data Tag was created. At the same time, the logs give a simple count of the actual numbers of queries made to the archive, a powerful metric of archive usage unobtainable from the Apache web server logs. Currently, IRSA creates tags for queries to more than 20 data sets, including the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) and Spitzer Space Telescope Legacy Data Sets. These tags are returned by the spatial query engine, Atlas. IRSA plans to create tags for queries to the rest of its services in late Spring 2007. The archive provides a simple web interface which recovers a data set that corresponds to the input data tag. Archived data sets may evolve in time due to improved calibrations or augmentations to the data set.
