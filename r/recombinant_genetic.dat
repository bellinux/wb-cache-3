50|$|Synthetic genetic array {{analysis}} (SGA) is a high-throughput {{technique for}} exploring synthetic lethal and synthetic sick genetic interactions (SSL). SGA {{allows for the}} systematic construction of double mutants {{using a combination of}} <b>recombinant</b> <b>genetic</b> techniques, mating and selection steps. Using SGA methodology a query gene deletion mutant can be crossed to an entire genome deletion set to identify any SSL interactions, yielding functional information of the query gene and the genes it interacts with. A large-scale application of SGA in which ~130 query genes were crossed to the set of ~5000 viable deletion mutants in yeast revealed a genetic network containing ~1000 genes and ~4000 SSL interactions. The results of this study showed that genes with similar function tend to interact with one another and genes with similar patterns of genetic interactions often encode products that tend to work in the same pathway or complex. Synthetic Genetic Array analysis was initially developed using the model organism S. cerevisiae. This method has since been extended to cover 30% of the S. cerevisiae genome. Methodology has since been developed to allow SGA analysis in S.pombe and E. coli.|$|E

Previously only two full-length sequences {{of each of the}} HIV- 1 subtype F subclusters F 1 and F 2 have been described. To extend the knowledge of subtype F variation on a complete genome level, three new virtually full-length F 1 sequences were cloned and sequenced, two from Africa and one from South America. Comparison of the new and previously described sequences showed that monophyletic clustering of the subcluster F 1 of subtype F is consistent and highly supported in all genome regions. Two additional full-length strains were shown to be mosaics of subtypes F and D. These epidemiologically unrelated F/D sequences showed similar chimeric structure, suggesting that they may represent a previously undescribed circulating recombinant form (CRF).

Passive transfer of sera from mice monovalently vaccinated with MNV VLP to immunodeficient or immunocompetent mice protected against MNV infection; however, adoptive transfer of purified CD 4 + or CD 8 + cells did not influence viral loads in murine tissues.

We have previously shown that the presence of HLA-B* 5701 strongly predicts abacavir hypersensitivity and have identified a potential susceptibility locus within a 300 -kb region between the MEGT 1 and C 4 A 6 loci in the central MHC. We now report the results of fine <b>recombinant</b> <b>genetic</b> mapping in an expanded patient population of 248 consecutive, fully ascertained, abacavir-exposed individuals in the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, in which 18 cases of definite abacavir hypersensitivity (7. 3 %) and 230 tolerant controls were identified. Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57. 1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14 -kb Hsp 70 gene cluster. HLA-B* 5701 was present in 94. 4 % of hypersensitive cases compared with 1. 7 % of controls (odds ratio, 960; P < 0. 00001). A haplotypic nonsynonymous polymorphism of Hsp 70 -Hom (HspA 1 L, resulting from the substitution of residue M 493 T in the peptide-binding subunit) was found in combination with HLA-B* 5701 in 94. 4 % of hypersensitive cases and 0. 4 % of controls (odds ratio, 3, 893; P < 0. 00001). Individuals with abacavir hypersensitivity demonstrated increased monocyte tumor necrosis factor expression in response to ex vivo abacavir stimulation, which was abrogated with CD 8 + T cell depletion.

Blood transfusions and bone marrow transplantation are prime examples of the successful application of cell-based therapeutics; but recent advances in cellular and molecular biology have expanded the potential applications of this approach. Although <b>recombinant</b> <b>genetic</b> engineering to produce a variety of therapeutics such as human erythropoietin and insulin has proven successful, these treatments are unable to completely correct or reverse disease states, because most common disease processes are not due to the deficiency of a single protein but develop due to alterations in the complex interactions of a variety of cell components. In these complex situations, cell-based therapy may be a more successful strategy by providing a dynamic, interactive, and individualized therapeutic approach that responds to the pathophysiological condition of the patient.
