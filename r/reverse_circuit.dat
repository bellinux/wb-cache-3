5000|$|A {{lawsuit was}} filed during the special {{legislative}} session by State Representative Bob McDermott, a Republican {{member of the}} House who was opposed to same-sex marriage. The lawsuit sought a temporary injunction against implementing SB1, and challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} bill. Rep. McDermott and other plaintiffs based the lawsuit on the claim that voters believed that Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 of 1998 only allowed the Legislature to ban same-sex marriage and simultaneously barred the <b>reverse.</b> <b>Circuit</b> Court Judge Karl Sakamoto denied the request for the injunction on November 14, ruling that [...] "the court will conclude that same-sex marriage in Hawaii is legal". [...] The state filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in December 2014, which was granted on January 29, 2014. [...] The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled on May 27, 2015 that Rep. McDermott and other plaintiffs did not show any injury from the enactment of the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act, meaning they did not have standing to challenge the law, and dismissed their case.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the subclass of reversible functions that are self-inverse and relate them to reversible circuits that are equal to their <b>reverse</b> <b>circuit,</b> which are called palindromic circuits. We precisely determine which self-inverse functions {{can be realized}} as a palindromic circuit. For those functions that cannot be realized as a palindromic circuit, we find alternative palindromic representations that require an extra circuit line or quantum gates in their construction. Our analyses make use of involutions in the symmetric group $S_{ 2 ^n}$ which are isomorphic to self-inverse reversible function on $n$ variables. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

A pilot test campaign was carried out at Metso's pilot plant facility located in York city, Pennsylvania State, USA, to provide information to scale up the industrial grinding circuit. The perfect mixing model, normally used to simulate ball mills, {{was used to compare}} the direct and <b>reverse</b> <b>circuit</b> configurations. The simulations were based on the appearance function determined from the laboratory tests using a batch tube mill. The combined breakage rate/discharge rate function (r/d) was determined from Vertimill™ feed and product particle size distributions obtained from pilot tests. The residence time was estimated considering the mill hold-up and solids flow rate. The simulation results show that there are no significant differences between direct and reverse circuits for the sample tested...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{disorders}} of {{the brain}} can be debilitating, causing both cognitive and motor impairments, and often resulting in premature death. Despite this, {{there are very few}} effective treatments for neurogenetic diseases. Most systemic therapies are unable to reach the brain, due to the occluding blood-brain barrier. Therapies that directly target the central nervous system (CNS) will be the most beneficial, with direct brain injections probably required to treat many of these diseases. ^ The use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver therapeutic genes to the CNS allows long-term expression without extensive inflammation or immune response. However, the number of direct brain injections of AAV vectors that are currently estimated to be needed for widespread gene dispersal in the brain is too great for this to be accepted as a suitable treatment method in the clinic. Our goal in this study was to better understand the properties of AAV vectors {{that can be used to}} result in a more widespread distribution of a therapeutic gene or protein from a limited number of injections. ^ The amino acid sequence encoding the capsid proteins on the surface of the AAV virion is the main determinant of transduction capabilities. The capsid determines the types and numbers of cells transduced, as well as the patterns of transduction. We tested novel AAV serotypes in the mouse brain, and found that some AAV vectors have the ability to undergo vector transport along neuronal projections, which also appears to depend on the capsid proteins present. We hypothesized that injecting a transportable vector into a region with numerous projections would result in transport of the vector along those projections and thereby result in widespread dispersal of the vector with a single injection. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a region with widespread projections and a single small (1 μL) injection of the transportable serotype AAV- 9 into the VTA of mice with the neurogenetic disease mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII) resulted in complete correction of lysosomal storage throughout the brains of these mice. An injection of AAV was also able to <b>reverse</b> <b>circuit</b> abnormalities found in the hippocampi of adult MPS VII mice, further expanding our knowledge about the extent to which an AAV vector is able to reverse disease phenotypes. ...|$|E
