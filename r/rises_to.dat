5|$|The {{concentration}} of calcium carbonate {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from less than 10 milligrams per liter to 100 milligrams per liter. In the upper half of the creek, the concentration is less than 50 milligrams per liter. Around Mifflinburg, it <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> its peak of 100 milligrams per liter. The concentration declines to 70 milligrams per liter at the confluence with Spruce Run, but <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> about 80 milligrams per liter at the mouth of Buffalo Creek. One tributary of the creek has a {{concentration of}} 250 milligrams per liter. The calcium concentration in the creek ranges from virtually 0 milligrams per liter to over 40 milligrams per liter. The concentration is under 10 milligrams per liter until the point where Hoover Road goes over Buffalo Creek, at which point it <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> about 15 milligrams per liter.

5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E

5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|Aristarchus {{is located}} on an {{elevated}} rocky rise, known as the Aristarchus Plateau, {{in the midst of}} the Oceanus Procellarum, a large expanse of lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200km across, that <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> a maximum elevation of 2km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus is just to the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south of a system of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.|$|E
5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of magnesium {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from nearly 0 to almost 15 milligrams per liter. The concentration is close to 0 for the first third of the creek's course, but then <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> two or three milligrams per liter. The magnesium concentration reaches its peak around halfway between the source and the mouth, then steadily declines to slightly under ten milligrams per liter at the mouth. However, one of Buffalo Creek's tributaries has a magnesium {{concentration of}} nearly 35 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|The female has, on average, a {{narrower}} black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male.

In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> 40–80% in the Rocky Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles {{are similar to the}} adult, but duller plumaged.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 15,045 all-electric cars and vans were {{registered}} in 2014, of which, pure electric passenger cars totaled 10,560 units.

All-electric cars captured a 0.59% {{market share of}} new car registered in France in 2014. Plug-in hybrid car registrations totaled 1,519 units in 2014, almost doubling registrations from a year earlier. Plug-in hybrid sales were driven by the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, with 820 units registered in 2014.

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate <b>rises</b> <b>to</b> 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E
