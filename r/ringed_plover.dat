5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital ring is bare skin ringing the eye. In some species, such as little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> the orbital ring {{may be quite}} conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b> The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of habitats which include grazed pasture with hedgerows, ditches, reens, reed beds and grasslands. These help to attract breeding birds such as lapwings, redshanks, oystercatchers, little <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> and <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> as well as visitors such as wigeon, shovellers, teal, shelduck and pintails, bitterns, hen harriers and short-eared owls.|$|R

50|$|Birds include oystercatchers, <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> {{redshank}} and curlew. Parts of {{the island}} are largely undeveloped and are a haven for wild plants.|$|R
25|$|An {{increase}} in postal rates resulted in two new values on 6 January 2003. Two more were released on 25 August {{of the same}} year. The 75c showed a <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> and the 95c depicted a sparrowhawk. The August releases were priced at 7c and 48c using the stonechat and peregrin falcon designs. As usual these were printed in sheets of 100.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 Irish bird {{illustrations}} {{were used}} for the new issues that spanned the changes of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency, to the introduction of the euro. Lithographically printed on unwatermarked paper by a number of different printers, the stamps were designed by Killian Mullarney. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. The initial birds illustrated are: magpie, gannet, corncrake, wood pigeon, kingfisher, lapwing, blue tit, blackbird, robin, stonechat, <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> puffin, song thrush, sparrowhawk, barn owl, white-fronted goose, grey head pintail and shelduck.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the common gull, Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E
5000|$|March: The Little <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plovers</b> {{appear and}} start singing. Plenty of Natterjack Toad frogs croaking at night. Many trees budding, with sprouts of Willow, Common reed, Halophiles, and Common Alder.|$|R
50|$|Common <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> are migratory {{and winter}} in coastal areas south to Africa. In Norway, geolocators have {{revealed}} that adult breeding birds migrate to West Africa. Many birds in Great Britain and northern France are resident throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The Alaw estuary forms {{part of the}} Beddmanarch-Cymyran site {{of special}} {{scientific}} interest, which also extends across the mudflats between Holy Island and mainland Anglesey. The area contains large areas of seagrass and salt marsh, and is an important wintering area for <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> greenshanks, red-breasted mergansers and goldeneyes.|$|R
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E
500|$|Chapter 13 {{analyses}} [...] "markings {{and patterns}} in detail, {{starting with a}} color plate that shows the effect of disruptive patterning, which Thayer calls [...] "strong 'secant' and 'ruptive' patterns". Using a photograph of an oystercatcher at its nest by Cherry and Richard Kearton, Thayer argues that the boldly marked bird (mainly black above, white below, with red beak) is both countershaded and [...] "ruptively" [...] patterned. Chapter 14 discusses the barred markings of hawks and owls, with further fine plates of photographs by the Keartons of disruptively patterned waders and their cryptic chicks. The <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> is described as having [...] "eye-masking and 'obliterative' shadow-and-hole-picturing pattern".|$|E
500|$|In the mid-17th century, Eday was {{described}} as being [...] "absolutely full of moorland birds" [...] and today there are red-throated divers on Mill Loch, Arctic skuas and bonxies on the moors and black guillemot offshore. Shore birds include meadow pipit, rock pipit and <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b> The woodland at Carrick House attracts a variety of migrants and otters can be seen around the coasts. There are colonies of harbour and grey seals on Muckle Green Holm, Little Green Holm, Faray and Holm of Faray, and white-beaked dolphin, minke whale and killer whale are occasional visitors to the area. A ranger provideds guided walks throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} {{large area}} of {{saltmarsh}} together with some 12 ha of shell bank. Birds which breed on the shell bank include little terns and <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> and there many species on the saltmarsh. There are flora such as yellow-horned poppies, grass-leaved oraches and rock samphires.|$|R
50|$|Viviparous lizards, stoats, polecats, {{rabbits and}} voles {{can be found}} in the dunes. Skylarks, meadow pipits and <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> can be seen and heard over the dunes. Butterflies and moths which can be found here include the dark green {{fritillary}} and gatekeeper butterflies and the scarlet tiger and Portland moths.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>ringed</b> <b>plover's</b> {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} open ground on beaches or flats across northern Eurasia and in Arctic northeast Canada. Some birds breed inland, and in western Europe they nest {{as far south}} as northern France. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.|$|R
500|$|On {{the eastern}} {{outskirts}} of Bath a toll bridge near the George Inn links Bathampton to Batheaston, {{on the north}} bank of the canal. When the A46 Bathampton by-pass was built, the [...] Bathampton Meadow was created to provide additional flood relief. The resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive {{to a number of}} migrants; wading birds such as dunlin, ringed and little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn. Sand martin and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the lake, and other migrants have included yellow wagtail, whinchat and hobby. The canal turns south into a valley between Bathampton Wood and Bathford Hill which includes Brown's Folly, a [...] biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
500|$|In some cases, Yarrell's correspondents and {{reference}} books {{enable him to}} add an account of a bird's distribution around the world. For the <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> for example, Sven Nilsson speaks for Sweden and the Baltic coast; Mr Hewitson for Norway; Carl Linnaeus for Lapland; a Mr Scoresby for Iceland and Greenland; the zoologist Thomas Pennant for Russia and Siberia; the archaeologist Charles Fellows for Asia Minor , and Coenraad Jacob Temminck for Japan. In {{the case of the}} wood sandpiper, Dr. Calvert sent a specimen from Malta; Selby and Dr. Andrew Smith, specimens from South Africa; others from India; Gould [...] "mentions having seen skins" [...] from [...] "Chili and the Islands of the Pacific". Yarrell also describes his own observations, in this case with the words [...] "It [...] is far from being numerous in the localities where I met with it... Although I met with the young in a downy state, and partially feathered, I only obtained one nest with eggs." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are eight}} main pools in the reserve, {{some of which}} are {{maintained}} to support specific flora or fauna. [...] At the centre of the reserve is East Marsh Pool, the largest of the pools, which contains two islands. Tern Island is composed of gravel and pebbles which attracts certain species to breed here, notably common tern and little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b> [...] There are also a number of artificial rafts on the pool, again to induce common tern to breed; eight pairs did so in 2008. Willow Island is much larger and more grassy, providing suitable areas for lapwing, common redshank and green sandpiper. The existence of the islands helps to prevent the nests of species such as these being predated by foxes. There are three hides overlooking the pool. [...] An artificial structure alongside the pool is designed to attract sand martins to breed, as they did when the gravel quarry was operational; this was successful {{for the first time in}} 2009, with eight nestholes occupied and over 40 young fledged.|$|E
50|$|The Towy and {{surrounding}} valley (Dyffryn Tywi) {{are home to}} a very large variety of water and wetland birds. Among the more distinctive species found along the river are sand martins, common sandpipers, little <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> dippers, kingfishers and grey wagtails. Red kites and buzzards are numerous. Goosanders and cormorants prey on sea trout and salmon.|$|R
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The Sanctuary Bird and Wildlife Reserve was {{formally}} launched in July 2004 by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Margaret Beckett MP, alongside the Mayor of Derby. The site is {{now home to}} breeding skylarks, reed buntings and lapwings, all birds considered significant under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, with additional habitat created for breeding sand martins and little <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Molesey Heath Local Nature Reserve lies on {{the west}} bank of the Mole, west of the Island Barn Reservoir. [...] The Heath is an area of rough {{scrubland}} and, despite its name, is a reclaimed landfill site hence its large but artificial mound and small plateau. [...] The site is a rich habitat for birds including the redshank and little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Further up-river, the Sutton and Lound gravel pits {{are still}} part of an active {{quarrying}} operation which {{is run by the}} construction group Tarmac, but some 316 hectares have been designated as an SSSI. They provide an important wetland habitat for a large variety of birds. The pits won the 2008 [...] "British Trust for Ornithology - British Energy Business Bird Challenge" [...] in the category for quarries over 100 ha. A total of 172 different species of birds were recorded, including a number of birds which normally occupy the coastal fringes rather than inland sites. These include <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> shelduck and oystercatchers. Other birds seen include the black-necked grebe, which is rare in the United Kingdom, and the nightingale, which was extinct in Nottinghamshire before 2004. The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust have been active in planting reeds to improve the habitat, which are grown at Langford Quarry in a joint venture between Tarmac and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
2500|$|... 191 {{species of}} fauna have been {{recorded}} here: 63 are water-dependent; 20 species are known to breed here. Water birds in the sanctuary include black-headed ibis, Darters, Little Cormorant, Indian shag, Cattle Egret, Little Egret, Large Egret, Spoonbill, Grey Heron, Purple Heron, Pond Heron, night heron, Coot, Pheasant-tailed Jacana, Purple Swamphen, Common Sandpiper, Little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> Little Grebe, Cotton Teal. An average of about 8000 White Ibis visit the sanctuary every year.|$|E
50|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} {{primarily}} {{known as the}} most important breeding place in the Wadden Sea for grey seals. More than 300 pups are born on Richel in winter. In summer seals seem to prefer areas more sheltered from human contact. The sandbank is also important as a breeding and feeding area for <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> Kentish plovers, little terns and other bird species.|$|R
50|$|The estuary {{stretches}} roughly 3 km and is {{an important}} site for wintering wading birds and is protected under the European Union Birds Directive. The formation itself is narrow and sheltered, providing an excellent habitat for waterbirds. Golden Plovers, various oyster catchers, <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plovers</b> and Sanderlings shelter there over the winter. Other resident waterbirds include Brent Geese, Bar-tailed Godwits, Great Black-backed Gulls, Common Gulls, curlews, dunlins and cormorants.|$|R
