5000|$|The Double Eagle was {{chambered}} {{for several}} calibers; {{among the more}} common are [...]45 ACP and 10mm Auto. Occasionally, one will see a copy in [...]40 S&W, 9×19mm Parabellum, and [...]38 Super. Similar to the M1911, Colt offered, {{in addition to the}} full-sized version, the more compact Commander and Officer versions. The full-sized version was chambered for [...]45 ACP and 10mm Auto, as well as in 9mm and [...]38 Super for a time in 1992. The Commander was chambered for [...]45 ACP, along with a somewhat rare [...]40 S&W version in 1992. The Officer's model was available in [...]45 ACP and rarely [...]40 S&W, again only in 1992. Colt eventually redesigned the trigger mechanism and added a <b>retaining</b> <b>plate</b> due to some shooters having problems with skin being pinched by the top part of the trigger, as well as some springs only being retained by the grip panel. The result was the Double Eagle Mark II.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulation}} on low-speed {{magnetic flux}} leakage inspection to heat exchanger pipes is described. Statistics suggest that 90 % of defects in ferromagnetic heat exchanger pipes occur under the <b>retaining</b> <b>plate</b> or nearby, making it a key monitoring area. This paper illustrates influence of different velocities, defect depth and position on the characteristic of flux leakage signals. Result of the numerical simulation provides theoretical principle for application of Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) technique to inspection of heat exchanger pipes. It possesses great significance to enhance the possibility for defect inspection as well...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic model for slipper-pads which allows lift and tilt behaviour to be predicted, including {{the effects of}} possible contact with the swashplate or slipper <b>retaining</b> <b>plate.</b> This model has been incorporated in the Bathfp simulation package and {{used to examine the}} dynamic stability of slipper-pads over the pumping cycle, and to compare the behaviour over a range of pump speeds. The centripetal tilting moments acting on the slipper-pad increase with speed and as a consequence can lead to contact between the slipper and the swashplate at high speed. This is particularly likely to occur as the piston makes the transition between suction and delivery, where the pressure forces acting on the piston-slipper assembly change abruptly. The predicted nature of the swashplate contacts at high speeds correspond closely with witness marks on a dismantled pump. The model presented may also be used for predicting slipper behaviour in other types of pump, for example wobble-plate type pumps, or in piston motor...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} hair property changes {{in response to}} treatment {{is essential to the}} successful develop-ment of new formulations and benefi ting agents. In the attempt to expand the toolbox of hair tress testing tools, we developed a device that allows hair scientists to measure hair tress changes in stiffness and lubricity. The tool is based on a system of pins mounted on free rotating bearings and is operated in two modes: rotating and stationary. The hair attributes are measured by threading a hair tress through the pin assembly and measuring the total work of pulling through in rotational and stationary modes (the latter mode is obtained by immo-bilizing pins by a <b>retaining</b> <b>plate).</b> The data thus obtained is de-convoluted into the work of apparent stiffness (rotational mode) and the work of the friction-on-pins or lubricity (stationary mode minus the apparent stiff-ness). The data can be further reduced to produce an apparent friction coeffi cient defi ned as a ratio of the apparent lubricity to the apparent stiffness. This work demonstrates the utility of the parameters measured by the Aqualon SLT and illustrates how the device can be used to predict and understand the impacts of various hair treatments...|$|E
40|$|In coal mines, bolt {{loosening}} in {{the cage}} guide {{is affected by the}} harsh environmental factors and cage hoist vibration, leading to significant threats to work safety. It is crucial, to this effect, to successfully detect the status of multipoint bolts of guide structures. This paper proposes a system to monitor bolt status in harsh environments established based on the RFID technique. A proof-of-concept model was demonstrated consisting of a bolt gearing system, passive UHF RFID tags, a reader, and monitoring software. A tinfoil metal film is fixed on the <b>retaining</b> <b>plate</b> and an RFID tag bonded to a large gear, with the bolt to be detected fixed {{in the center of a}} smaller gear. The radio-frequency signal cannot be received by the reader if the tag is completely obscured by the tinfoil, and if the bolt is loose, the tag’s antenna is exposed when the gear revolves. A radio-frequency signal that carries corresponding bolt’s information is transmitted by the RFID tag to the RFID reader due to coil coupling, identifying loose bolt location and reporting them in the software. Confirmatory test results revealed that the system indeed successfully detects bolt loosening and comparative test results (based on a reed switch multipoint bolt loosening monitor system) provided valuable information regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed system...|$|E

40|$|Minimizing the {{likelihood}} of solder joint embrittlement in connectors is realized by reducing or eliminating <b>retained</b> Au <b>plating</b> and/or Au-Sn intermetallic compound formation from the assemblies. Gold removal is performed most effectively by using a double wicking process. When only a single wicking procedure can be used, a higher soldering temperature improves the process of Au removal from the connector surfaces and to a nominal extent, removal of Au-contaminated solder from the joint. A longer soldering time {{did not appear to}} offer any appreciable improvement toward removing the Au-contaminated solder from the joint. Because the wicking procedure was a manual process, it was operator dependent...|$|R

500|$|The Croft branch {{opened in}} October 1829. Construction of the {{suspension}} {{bridge across the}} Tees started in July 1829, but was suspended in October after the Tees Navigation Company pointed out the S had no permission to cross the Old Channel of the Tees. The S prepared to return to Parliament but withdrew after a design for a drawbridge was agreed with the Navigation Company. The line to Middlesbrough was laid with malleable iron rails weighing , resting on oak blocks. The suspension bridge had been designed to carry 150 tons, but the cast iron <b>retaining</b> <b>plates</b> split when it was tested with just 66 tons and loaded trains had to cross with the waggons split into groups of four linked by a [...] long chain. For the opening ceremony on 27 December 1830, [...] "Globe", a new locomotive designed by Hackworth for passenger trains, hauled people in carriages and waggons fitted with seats across the bridge to the staiths at Port Darlington, which had berths for six ships. Stockton continued to be served by a station {{on the line to}} the quay until 1848, when it was replaced by a station on the Middlesbrough line {{on the other side of}} the Tees. Before May 1829 Thomas Richardson had bought about [...] near Port Darlington, and with Joseph and Edward Pease and others he formed the Owners of the Middlesbrough Estate to develop it.

40|$|To warn of the {{stability}} of retaining wall structures with damage, a simplified mechanical model and a finite element model of this retaining wall-soil coupling system are established. Via finite element model updating, a baseline finite element model of the wall-soil system is acquired. A damage alarming index ERSD (Energy Ratio Standard Deviation) is proposed via the wavelet packet analysis of a virtual impulse response function of dynamic responses to this baseline finite element model. The internal relationships among the alarming index, earth pressure, and damage stability of the wall are analyzed. Then, a damage stability alarming method for the retaining walls is advanced. To verify the feasibility and validity of this alarming method, vibration tests on the baseline finite element model of a pile <b>plate</b> <b>retaining</b> wall are performed. The ERSD is used as an alarm for the damage stability of the wall. Analysis results show that, {{with an increase in}} the ERSD, {{the stability}} of the wall changes from a stable state to an unstable one. The wall reaches a critical stable state when the alarming index reaches its threshold value. Thus, the damage stability of this pile <b>plate</b> <b>retaining</b> wall can be alarmed via ERSD...|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of custom plate options in Victoria, issued by V Plates on behalf of VicRoads. Custom or personalised plates come with the {{optional}} purchase of a contract. This contract allows the <b>plate</b> holder to <b>retain</b> the <b>plates</b> whether on a vehicle or not.

VicRoads (who own V Plates) do not know the cumulative figure {{of the total number of}} custom registration plates sold since they were first launched in 1986. This is because many personalised plates are not on vehicles, or they are held on self-retention, or have been handed back to VicRoads.

For example, in the first edition a line read [...] "And his step was light", and in the second edition it becomes [...] "And his step seemed light". These tiny alterations persisted through the seventh edition, the last edition handled by Smithers, and thereafter to most of the reprints.
