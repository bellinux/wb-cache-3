50|$|Computational {{models for}} {{simulating}} combustion and heat release rates of HCCI engines require detailed chemistry models. This is largely because ignition is {{more sensitive to}} chemical kinetics than to turbulence/spray or spark processes as are typical in SI and diesel engines. Computational models have demonstrated the importance of accounting {{for the fact that}} the in-cylinder mixture is actually in-homogeneous, particularly in terms of temperature. This in-homogeneity is driven by turbulent mixing and heat transfer from the combustion chamber walls. The amount of temperature stratification dictates the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> and thus tendency to knock. This limits the usefulness of considering the in-cylinder mixture as a single zone, resulting in the integration of 3D computational fluid dynamics codes such as Los Alamos National Laboratory's KIVA CFD code and faster solving probability density function modelling codes.|$|E

Current research in developing fire-safe polymers is focused on modifying various properties of the polymers such as ease of ignition, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release,</b> {{and the evolution of}} smoke and toxic gases. Standard methods for testing polymer flammability vary among countries; in the United States common fire tests include the UL 94 small-flame test, the ASTM E 84 Steiner Tunnel, and the ASTM E 622 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) smoke chamber.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} effect of charge {{stratification}} on combustion phasing, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> and emissions for HCCI combustion. Engine experiments in both optical and traditional single cylinder engines were carried out with PRF 50 as fuel. The amount of stratification as well as injection timing of the stratified charge was varied. It was found that a stratified charge can influence combustion phasing, increasing the stratification amount or late injection timing of the stratified charge leads to an advanced CA 50 timing. The NOX emissions follows the CA 50 advancement, advanced CA 50 timing leads to higher NOX emissions. Correlation between CA 50 {{can also be seen}} for HC and CO emissions when the injection timing was varied, late injection and thereby advanced CA 50 timing leads to both lower HC and CO emissions. This trend can not be seen when the stratification amount was varied, increased stratification amount leads to higher CO emission and for operating condition with late CA 50 timing the HC emissions also increase with increasing stratification amount. Optical studies, with high speed CCD camera, show that an increase in stratification leads to poor combustion quality near the cylinder walls, due to leaner mixtures near the cylinder walls and this results in higher HC and CO emissions. The maximum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> depends on stratification amount - a larger amount gives a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> but the main heat release is advanced. Varied injection timing results in different phasing of the main heat releases. The use of charge stratification for HCCI combustion can lead to a larger operating range, due to its effect on combustion phasing and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release,</b> since the upper load range is partly restricted by too high rates of heat release leading to high pressure oscillations and the lower load to late combustion phasing leading to high cycle-to-cycle variations...|$|E

Residents of Madjadjane and Gala consider daily and seasonal variation in these climatic factors when planning burns, and personal preferences reflect different experiences and habitats where burns take place. “Hot days are good for burning and also help dry out the grass {{so that it is}} ready to burn [Farmer, Madjadjane].” A Gala elder said, “it is better to burn in the early morning or very late afternoon as the cooler temperatures make the fire less intense.” High temperatures dry out grass, which increases fuel load.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is now a}} ubiquitous computational tool for engine design and analysis. It is often necessary to provide well-known initial cycle conditions to commence the CFD computations. Such initial conditions can be provided by experimental data. To create an opportunity to computationally study engine conditions where experimental data are not available, a zero-dimensional quasi-predictive thermodynamic simulation is developed that uses a well-established spray model to predict <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> and calculated burned gas composition and temperature to predict nitric oxide (NO) concentration. This thesis details the thermodynamic simulation for diesel engine operating conditions. The goal is to produce an algorithm {{that is capable of}} predicting NO emissions as well as performance characteristics such as mean effective pressure (MEP). The simulation uses general conservation of mass and energy approaches to model intake, compression, and exhaust. <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> prediction is based on an existing spray model to predict how fuel concentrations within the spray jet change with penetration. <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> provides predicted cylinder pressure, which is then validated against experimental pressure data under known operating conditions. An equilibrium mechanism is used to determine burned gas composition which, along with burned gas temperature, can be used for prediction of NO in the cylinder. NO is predicted using the extended Zeldovich mechanism. This mechanism is highly sensitive to temperature, and it is therefore important to accurately predict cylinder gas temperature to obtain correct NO values. iii The simulation focuses on single fuel injection events, but some multiple injection events are investigated, and improvements to the model to better handle these cases are suggested...|$|E

These properties have been measured by asmall-scale fire test method, the Cone Calorimeter, andpresented for different types of building products. Uncertainty analysis, included instrument and assumptionuncertainty, has been performed for the case that both O 2 andCO 2 are measured for calculation of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> inthe Cone Calorimeter. The partial derivatives for theuncertainty analysis are given. The relative uncertainty forthe <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> measurements in the Cone Calorimeteris between ± 5 % to ± 10 % for rate of heat releasevalues larger than about 50 kW/m 2. The time to ignition in the Cone Calorimeter is compatiblewith the time to ignition in the ISO Ignitability test, whichis the main test method for measuring time to ignition. Thetime to ignition is an increasing linear function of density. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> in the Cone Calorimeter is dependentof material thickness and of use of retainer frame. Thematerial thickness gives the heat release curve duration andshape. Thin materials have short burning time and two maximumvalues. Thick materials have long burning time and when thematerial is thicker than about 35 mm no second maximum appears. When the retainer frame is used the actual exposed surface isreduced from 0. 01 m 2 to 0. 0088 m 2, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> isreduced and the burning time is increased. A comparison ofresults with and without use of the retainer frame gives thenequal results when the exposed area is set to 0. 0088 m 2 in thecase of using the retainer frame. The time to flashover in the full-scale room corner test waspredicted {{on the basis of}} Cone Calorimeter data at 50 kW/m 2 bya power law of ignition time, the total heat release calculatedover 300 s after ignition and the density of the product.

40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) engine operation {{offers the potential}} to provide fuel economy approaching that of traditional diesel engines, with increased compression ratios and low pumping losses, while simultaneously emitting low NOx and soot due to the homogeneous, low temperature nature of the combustion. HCCI, however, comes with unique challenges as fuel mixture chemical kinetics supplant direct ignition timing control via spark ignition or injection timing. Improved understanding of the ignition phenomena that control in-cylinder combustion phasing and duration in HCCI engines can help overcome the challenges of HCCI. In particular, spark-assisted HCCI combustion has been proposed {{as a means to}} extend HCCI operating limits and to facilitate transition between spark-ignition and HCCI operating modes. The current work presents the results of an experimental study characterizing the ignition phenomena observed during HCCI lean operating conditions using high-speed digital imaging and the optical access provided by a single-cylinder optical research engine. Three fuels (indolene, iso-octane, and pump gasoline) and a range of operating conditions, including spark-assisted HCCI operation, were examined. HCCI combustion was initiated and maintained over a range of lean conditions, from equivalence ratios of phi = 0. 69 to 0. 27. Time-resolved imaging and pressure data showed high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> in HCCI combustion correlated temporally to rapid volumetric ignition occurring throughout the combustion chamber.

The results for iso-octane indicate misfire at low load has distinctly different ignition characteristics (with well resolved, localized ignition and propagation) compared to stable HCCI (with volumetric ignition). The results of the spark-assisted HCCI study demonstrated that spark assist stabilized HCCI combustion and extended lean operating limits for a window of engine operating conditions.
