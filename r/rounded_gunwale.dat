5000|$|In 1989 the fused deck to hull joint {{was changed}} from a Â½" [...] flat lip {{protected}} by an aluminum trim strip to the increased surface area of a <b>rounded</b> <b>gunwale,</b> now more securely bonded using a methacrylate adhesive specially suited for fiberglass.|$|E
6000|$|... "The measure <b>round</b> the <b>gunwale</b> may now {{be taken}} within {{the edge of the}} tin, and an iron rod 3/8 of an inch thick, to go <b>round</b> this <b>gunwale,</b> bent to the form of the outline of fig. III., i b k c, which will now be that of the boat, and the ends welded at their meeting. Sufficient iron rod must be taken to form eyes at i and k to receive rings of 3 or 4 inches diameter, through which a pole is to be passed, for {{carrying}} the boat, and for their welding at the meeting of the ends.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that were}} impossible. A jerk from the {{tow-rope}} of a steamer {{at full speed}} would tear us asunder. Have you observed these two strong ropes running all <b>round</b> our <b>gunwale,</b> and the bridles across with ring-bolts in them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|On it came like a {{whirlwind}} of the tropics, and rushed right over the low <b>round</b> <b>gunwale</b> of the boat, sweeping loose articles overboard, and carrying her bodily to leeward. Leo had taken a turn of the life-lines round both thighs, and held manfully to his oars. These, after stooping to the first rush of wind and water, he plied with all his might, and was ably seconded by Oblooria {{as well as by}} the interpreter, but a very few minutes of effort sufficed to convince them that they laboured in vain. They did not even [...] "hold their own," [...] as sailors have it, but drifted slowly, yet steadily, to the north.|$|R
60|$|On {{the eve of}} St. Michael, the Duke's anxious face became cheerful, for a {{favorable}} wind had set in, and the word was given to embark. Horses were led into the ships, the shields hung <b>round</b> the <b>gunwale,</b> and the warriors crowded in, the Duke, in his own Mora, leading the way, the Pope's banner at his mast's head, and a lantern at the stern to guide the rest.|$|R
6000|$|In {{order to}} give them the {{requisite}} strength of frame for their tremendous warfare, they are built of the best Honduras mahogany, on {{what is known as the}} diagonal plan--that is, the boat has two distinct [...] "skins" [...] of planking, one set of planks being laid on in a diagonal position to the others. Moreover, these planks run from one <b>gunwale</b> <b>round</b> under the boat to the other gunwale, and have a complete layer of prepared canvas between them. Thus great strength and elasticity are combined, so that the boat can stand an inconceivable amount of battering on wreckage, rocks, or sand, without being destroyed.|$|R
6000|$|... "These lengths {{must then}} be {{soldered}} {{side by side}} by a similar joint, and the whole sheet thus made, trimmed {{to the shape of}} fig. I., care being taken that no two joints in the lengths should be exactly opposite each other. Form two other sheets in a similar manner for the two sides, and of the shape of fig. II. The dotted lines a b c d e f, fig. I., show the portions of the tin round the edges, 1 inch wide, which must be turned up at right angles with the bottom, and to which the sides are to be soldered on the inside; they should have triangular pieces clipped out of them, as shown in the fig., where the bends of the boat begin, to make them take the curve required. The two extra pieces at the ends a d, e f, 2 inches wide, are for turning down over an iron rod, which is to pass <b>round</b> the <b>gunwale,</b> to give stiffness to the boat; g h, fig. II., is a breadth of 2 inches of extra tin, for the same purpose of turning down over the iron rod.|$|R
6000|$|Erling's [...] "longship" [...] {{was one of}} the smaller-sized war {{vessels of}} the period. It pulled twenty oars--ten on each side--and belonged to the class named Snekiars, or cutters, which usually had from ten to twenty rowers on a side. To each oar three men were apportioned--one to row, one to shield the rower, and one to throw {{missiles}} and fight, so that her crew numbered over sixty men. The forecastle and poop were very high, and the appearance of height was still further increased by the figurehead--the neck and head of a swan--and by a tail that rose from the stern-post, over the steersman's head. Both head and tail were richly gilt; indeed, the whole vessel was gaudily painted. All <b>round</b> the <b>gunwales,</b> from stem to stern, hung a row of shining red and white shields, which resembled the scaly sides of some fabulous creature, so that when the oars, which gave it motion, and not inaptly represented legs, were dipped, the vessel glided swiftly out of the cavern, like some antediluvian monster issuing from its den and crawling away over the dark blue sea. A tall heavy mast rose from the centre of the ship. Its top was also gilded, as well as the tips of the heavy yard attached to it. On this they hoisted a huge square sail, which was composed of alternate stripes of red, white, and blue cloth.|$|R
60|$|The {{boat was}} {{provided}} with a light mast, which could be stepped or unstepped at pleasure, {{and there were two}} stays of twisted leather, one fastening to each side of the boat. An iron ring with a cord travelled up and down the mast, the halliard running through a small block, as Luka had been able to obtain a sheave at Turukhansk. The sail was a lug made of sheeting, oiled, and the boat carried beside a triangular sail of very much smaller dimensions and stouter cloth for heavy weather. She also carried a small mizzen mast and sail. In rough weather the cockpit could be completely covered with a light apron with openings where the rowers sat, with a sort of collar, which could be lashed tightly round their waists. The edges of this apron could be lashed down over the <b>gunwale</b> <b>round</b> the cockpit. When completed the canoe itself, with its mast and sails, weighed but sixty pounds, and could be carried with ease by one person on his shoulder.|$|R
