Materials and Methods: Ninety-six women underwent 1. 5 T breast MRI exam (48 Cartesian and 48 BLADE). Qualitative analysis including image artifacts, image quality, fat-suppression, chest-wall depiction, lesion detection, lymph node depiction and overall impression were evaluated by three blinded readers. Signal to noise ratios (SNRs) were calculated. Cronbach's alpha test was used to assess inter-observer agreement. Subanalyses of image quality, chest-wall depiction and overall impression in 15 patients with implants and image quality in 31 patients with clips were correlated using Pearson test. Wilcoxon rank sum test and t-test were performed. Results: Motion artifacts were present in 100 % and in 0 % of the Cartesian and the BLADE exams, respectively. Chemical-shift artifacts were present in 8 % of the Cartesian exams. Flow artifacts were more frequent on BLADE. BLADE sequence was statistically superior to Cartesian for all qualitative features (p < 0. 05) except for fat-suppression (p = 0. 054). In the subanalysis, BLADE was superior for implants and clips (p < 0. 05). SNR was statistically greater for BLADE (48. 35 vs. 16. 17). Cronbach ranged from 0. 502 to 0. 813.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. NUMERICAL design {{optimization}} provides {{a powerful tool}} that assists designers in improving their products. Design optimization automatically modifies important design parameters to obtain the best product that satisfies all the design requirements. This thesis explores the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and demonstrates its usefulness in the numerical optimization of a low-speed wind turbine for the power coe cient, Cp. The optimization design problem is the three-dimensional optimization of a wind turbine blade by making use of four two-dimensional radial stations. The candidate airfoils at these stations are selected from the 4 -digit NACA range. A metamodel of the lift and drag coe cients of the NACA 4 -digit series is created with SVR by using training points evaluated with XFOIL software. These SVR approximations are {{used in conjunction with}} the Blade Element Momentum theory to calculate and optimize the Cp value for the entire blade. The high accuracy attained with the SVR metamodels makes it a viable alternative to using XFOIL directly, as it has the advantages of being faster and easier to couple with the optimizer. The technique developed allows the optimization procedure the freedom to select profiles, angles of attack and chord length from the 4 -digit NACA series to find an optimal Cp value. As a result of every <b>radial</b> <b>blade</b> station consisting of a NACA 4 -digit series, the same lift and drag metamodels are used for each station.

40|$|The {{performance}} requirements of turbofan engines demands a stability and transient capability beyond that {{associated with the}} past generations of gas turbine engines. The axial flow fan unit is most vulnerable to loading limitations due to the primary {{problems associated with the}} compression process, its sensitivity to inlet distortion and the difficulty to design for an overall optimum blade duty in a machine of wide <b>radial</b> <b>blade</b> loading distribution. The development of mathematical models with some capability of predicting the stable operating range of an axial flow fan has to overcome the difficulties associated with the modelling of the radially distinct flow regions and their dynamic interaction. ' The current investigation combined the available knowledge of one-dimensional models (based on the principles of conservation of mass, linear momentum and energy) with the assumptions of the parallel compressor theory, in order to develop a linearized system of equations for stability analysis (surge prediction). The stability conditions which emerged from this approach were applied on the experimentally derived characteristics of a low hub to tip ratio split flow fan in a manner which involved the modelling of the dynamic interaction of the inner and outer flow region of the fan. The development of the governing equations was achieved by applying one-dimensional flow analysis to the inner and outer section of the fan. Their interaction was modelled on the experimentally obtained radial movement of the splitter streamline and the discharge,static pressure 'radial distribution. The inner and outer region were treated as a lumped volume element search operating on a local masflow averaged total pressure rise characteristic and alternatively acting in conjunction with a common nozzle and separate nozzles.

40|$|During {{a typical}} startup cycle {{industrial}} gas turbine blades experience rapid radial thermal expansion while bulky shroud structure with larger thermal inertia requires much longer period {{to reach its}} operating temperature. Turbine designers have to leave a safe radial distance {{in order to prevent}} contact of blades to the surrounding annular casing. However, when thermal steady state in the turbine stage is achieved, shroud and casing grow and excessive amount of blade-shroud clearance remains. Engine efficiency is very sensitive to blade-shroud clearance. Just one millimeter of <b>radial</b> <b>blade</b> tip gap in fist stage turbine section of a 150 MW class engine leads to 4 % efficiency drop due to blade tip leakage. To achieve better efficiency or higher power, turbine blade tip clearance has to be controlled. Attempts to address blade tip clearance problem were not applicable as designs were bulky and complex which required excessive modification on the turbine hardware and design. The goal {{of this study is to}} design, analyze and develop a low-cost and compact actuator system which is capable of controlling the tip clearance up to 0. 25 mm at elevated temperatures. Actuator will be positioned between inner and outer shrouds of the casing to force the inner shroud radially away from the blades during transients, and allow it to come back towards the blades when casing reaches operating temperature to decrease the tip leakage during steady state. Different actuator designs have been studied and finite element analysis solutions have been obtained for deflection and stress. Low cycle fatigue life of the actuator has been estimated via Coffin-Manson criterion. An experimental setup has been designed and fabricated to validate the simulation results. Furthermore, since actuator will be subjected to wear at elevated temperatures due to mechanical loading and vibrations in the gas turbine, friction and wear behavior of candidate actuator materials has to be investigated. High temperature scuffing combined with rapid oxidation can lead to failures and dramatic reductions service life. Therefore, another experimental setup has been developed to conduct friction and wear tests of the candidate actuator materials, i. e. Nickel and Cobalt based superalloys Haynes 25, 188 and 214.

40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure {{for evaluation of}} elastic stresses and strains in rotating conical disks, either solid or annular, subjected to thermal load, and having a fictitious density variation along the radius is presented. The procedure is based on two independent integrals of the hypergeometric differential equation describing the displacement field; this procedure is just as general as the one found in technical literature, but less intricate and more reliable. General unpublished relations of stress state and displacement field in conical disk subjected, under elastic conditions, to thermal gradient, and featuring a density variation along the radius are defined. Particular consideration is given to some industrial example of turbine rotors carrying hub and rim with buckets on periphery or <b>radial</b> <b>blades</b> on lateral surfaces. The analytical results obtained by using the new general relations perfectly match those obtained by FE...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the blade pump {{containing}} the half-open working wheel with <b>radial</b> <b>blades</b> as {{the version of}} adjustment of the combined millthrower-ground pump. The purpose of the work: {{the improvement of the}} technological process of channel cleaning by creating and using the effective multi-functional organs of the rotor-blade type. The obtained have been the values of the error for the final number of blades for the rare circular grids with flat blades of constant width. The laws of influence of the constructive and regimen factors on the working process of the blade pump have been determined. The multi-functional working blade organ the millthrower-ground pump for the MP- 14 channel cleaner has been introduced in the MPREO "Nizhegorodskoe", Nizhegorodsky region, Bogorodsky districtAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
