5|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa <b>Richness</b> ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa <b>Richness</b> ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa <b>Richness</b> and the EPT Taxa <b>Richness</b> are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa {{observed}} in a sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's Index value ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity Index value ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic <b>richness</b> and evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96.|$|E
5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the <b>richness</b> of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The <b>richness</b> results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of <b>richness</b> of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{value of}} Roaring Brook upstream of the Hollister Reservoir is 3.25 and the modified EPT Index value is 12. The total taxa <b>richness</b> is 26. Downstream of the reservoir, the modified Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value is 3.1 and the modified EPT Index value is 17. The total taxa <b>richness</b> is 26.|$|E
5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a <b>richness</b> of 48, {{diversity}} of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. Species <b>richness</b> {{was found to be}} different in 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples of thick phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer. Greater productivity was recorded in summer (65.96g/m2) than winter (15.76g/m2). Variation of productivity of annuals and perennials were noted according to seasons and type of phumdis.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, {{but it can be}} criticized for diminishing the potential <b>richness</b> of the subject matter.|$|E
5|$|The council's {{coat of arms}} uses gold to symbolise <b>richness,</b> three {{sprigs of}} ash tree {{representing}} former council areas, and a lion to commemorate nearby Tenterden {{as one of the}} Cinque Ports.|$|E
5|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna of Puerto Rico {{is high in}} <b>richness</b> but low {{in diversity}} relative to mainland neotropical faunas of similar size and habitat diversity. Puerto Rico, in comparison to other Antillean islands, is the most extensively studied in regards to invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{value of}} Spring Brook {{a short distance}} upstream of the Watres Reservoir is 2.56. The modified EPT Index value at this location is 15. The taxa <b>richness</b> value is 26.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{value of}} Stafford Meadow Brook is 3.82. The modified EPT Index value is 14 {{and the total}} taxa <b>richness</b> is 33.|$|E
5|$|Vikos–Aoös was {{designated}} as a National Park in 1973, in an effort by the Greek Government to conserve the <b>richness</b> of the local fauna and flora and the geological formations of the area.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his {{personal}} style, {{inspired by the}} organic shapes of nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of ruled geometry. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural <b>richness,</b> with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.|$|E
5|$|E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in {{the study}} of ants, social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work on island biogeography, which relates species <b>richness</b> to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is one of}} {{the three}} colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the color on their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural <b>richness</b> of Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a <b>richness</b> of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} for scholars {{to piece together the}} exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the <b>richness</b> and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species <b>richness</b> peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species <b>richness</b> and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E
5|$|Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, {{is known}} for its <b>richness</b> and variety. Many {{different}} spices, herbs and flavourings are used in conjunction with palm oil or groundnut oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 1960, {{less than}} six weeks {{after the first of}} the Greensboro sit-ins, Martin Luther King, Jr., {{delivered}} a sermon at the chapel. In the sermon he called for universal brotherhood and a life of spiritual <b>richness.</b> A plaque on the interior south wall of the chapel's nave commemorates the occasion.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{considered}} in a 2005 paper whether the revised taxonomy of the book, with its many species splits, had significant conservation implications, but {{felt that the}} effect on species <b>richness</b> in South Asia was limited, and would have only a moderate conservation impact, {{increasing the number of}} potentially threatened species in the region from 6% of the total avifauna to about 7%.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species <b>richness</b> and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species <b>richness,</b> the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such <b>richness</b> that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The bawarchis and rakabdars of Awadh {{gave birth}} to the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today. Their spread {{consisted}} of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and warqi parathas. The <b>richness</b> of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices including cardamom and saffron.|$|E
5|$|The {{books have}} {{appeared}} on national bestsellers lists and received worldwide critical acclaim; Warner Bros. acquired the rights to produce a movie based on the first book. The series has been noted for the realism and <b>richness</b> of its characters, the compelling nature of their adventures, and its humour. It has been compared with Harry Potter and other works within the genre.|$|E
5|$|The {{confluence}} of Twomile Run with Kettle Creek was completely devoid {{of fish in}} 1967, but by 1997, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed two species of fish, white sucker and smallmouth bass in this location. Twomile Run has the highest potential fish biodiversity of all streams in the Kettle Creek watershed, with a Potential Species <b>Richness</b> of 232 to 241 in places.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the film's première, it was made freely {{available}} from the iTunes Store for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered near universal critical acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited and praised its <b>richness,</b> poignancy, and careful construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} chairs started In ancient Egypt chairs {{appear to have}} been of great <b>richness</b> and splendour. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly {{materials}} and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress party would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, the <b>richness</b> of {{the design of the}} sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E
5|$|The {{quantity}} of benthic macroinvertebrates at sites in Tangascootack Creek has been {{measured by the}} West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition using different systems. These sites included designations T-1 and T-2the main creek just {{above and below the}} entry of Muddy Run, respectivelyand T-3 which is further downstream from T-2. Total taxa <b>richness,</b> as measured by the organization, ranged from 3 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 7 at site T-1, with an average of 4.3. The EPT Taxa <b>Richness</b> (measured on a scale of 0 to 4) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 2 at site T-1, with an average of 0.7. The scores of the sites according to version 3 of the Beck’s Index (twice the number of pollution-intolerant benthos taxa plus the number of facultative benthos taxa) ranged from 0 at sites T-2 and T-3 to 6 at site T-1. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (a method of determining a stream's ecosystem quality based on its benthic macroinvertebrates), the sites ranged from 3.538 for site T-1 to 6.2 for site T-2, with an average of 5.024. On the Shannon index, the sites ranged from 0.950 at site T-2 to 1.925 at site T-3, with an average of 1.325.|$|E
5|$|With its rhythmic {{arrangement}} of large, traceried windows, pinnacles, battlements and buttresses, {{the exterior of}} Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character, which is an unusual feature as England's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity. Close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16thcentury. The <b>richness</b> of the 13th-century tracery is accentuated {{by the presence of}} ornate, crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form.|$|E
25|$|Research {{is mixed}} on whether {{national}} culture mediates {{the relationship between}} media <b>richness</b> and bias in impression formation. Some studies that manipulated media <b>richness</b> have found that information presented in text form yields similar impressions (measured by reported appraisal scores) among cultures, while other studies found that richer forms of information such as videos reduce cross-cultural bias more effectively. The latter findings support Media <b>Richness</b> Theory.|$|E
25|$|Species <b>richness</b> {{ranges from}} 17 to 48 species per 1000 m². The lowest species <b>richness</b> occurs in severe {{habitats}} such as alongside salt lakes, {{but also in}} the areas of highest soil nutrition, where dominant species suppress associated species. Conversely, the highest species <b>richness</b> occurs in soils with the lowest soil nutrition. Most species are killed by fire and regenerate from seed, suggesting that they have evolved in an environment in which fire is infrequent.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>richness</b> of {{this region}} many animal species pass through this zone at least one season a year such as {{mountain}} goat, black-tailed deer, American black bear, elk, cougar, and many bird species. Only the whistling hoary marmot is restricted to alpine and subalpine areas. Besides the <b>richness</b> of mammals there is a <b>richness</b> of insects that are integral to the abundance of flowering plant species in this area. Another important pollinator {{in this area is}} the hummingbird. There is still much to be researched and discovered to better understand species interactions and reliance in both the alpine and subalpine ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|This third {{hypothesis}} is expounded on {{in a study}} demonstrating that habitat size also {{plays an important role}} in determining the species <b>richness</b> and assemblage structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi, namely that <b>richness</b> is reduced in smaller and more isolated habitat areas. The same study determined that spatial turnover of soil fungi actually occurs on scales more similar to macro-organisms.|$|E
