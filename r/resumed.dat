40|$|<b>Resumes</b> are an {{extraordinarily}} {{important part of}} the job search process. Successful job candidates take the time to figure out the best way to market their skills and experience on paper. If you are submitting <b>resumes</b> but not getting called for interviews, perhaps your <b>resume</b> needs a makeover. PURPOSE The purpose of the <b>resume</b> is to demonstrate your value to potential employers outside academia so they will invite you to interview. The <b>resume</b> is a marketing piece, not a history piece. Your <b>resume</b> should focus on the skills and experiences you have that are related to the job description and company mission because many employers electronically scan <b>resumes</b> for skill words used in the job description and eliminate <b>resumes</b> lacking those words.

40|$|Abstract—The {{enterprises}} and multinational companies receive thousands of <b>resumes</b> {{from the job}} seekers during this Internet era. Currently available filtering techniques and search services provide the recruiters to filter thousands of <b>resumes</b> to few hundred potential ones. It is difficult to identify the potential <b>resumes</b> by examining each <b>resume,</b> since these filtered <b>resumes</b> are similar to each other. We are investigating the {{issues related to the}} development of approaches to improve the performance of <b>resume</b> selection process. We have extended the concept of special features and also proposed an approach to identify <b>resumes</b> with special skills. In the literature, the concepts of special features have been applied to improve the process of candidate selection in E-commerce environment. As <b>resumes</b> contain unformatted text or semi-formatted text, extending the concept of special features for the development of approach to process <b>resumes</b> is a complex task. Only skills related formation of the <b>resumes</b> is obtained by considering this system approach. The experimental results of the real world set of <b>resumes</b> show that the proposed approach has the potential to improve the process of <b>resume</b> selection. An effective way of an approach for extraction of information from the <b>resumes</b> is achieved by the system. It supports routing and management of <b>resumes</b> automatically. The framework of an IE gives the extraction process of <b>resumes</b> along with the required information regarding the algorithms related with this extraction. The overall objective of the study is to provide the required information about the skills and experience to human resource system. This system provides the <b>resumes</b> to be extracted in a structured format for the semantic web approach...|$|R

An online survey method of data collection was used during which participants constructed a <b>resume</b> and filled out various measures pertaining to individual difference and <b>resume</b> misrepresentation. The results of this study provide an initial understanding of the existing categories of <b>resume</b> misrepresentations and the extent to which participants misrepresent.

40|$|A <b>resume</b> is a brief, concise {{document}} that presents, and effectively sells, your most relevant and positive credentials for employment, admission to graduate school, consideration for a scholarship or fellowship, or other professional purpose. An employer will usually spend 15 to 30 seconds reviewing your <b>resume,</b> so {{the content of}} your <b>resume</b> must be clear, concise, and targeted {{to the type of}} job for which you are applying. Preparation One-page <b>resumes</b> are preferred for most entry-level positions. Two-page <b>resumes</b> are acceptable if the information on both pages demonstrates the skills and/or experience relevant to your profession. <b>Resumes</b> should highlight skills and accomplishments that meet employer qualifications, excluding irrelevant information and experiences. Well-designed <b>resumes</b> will be visually appealing and free from any spelling, typographical, punctuation, or grammatical errors. All <b>resumes</b> should be written concisely in an organized format that presents the most important information first.

40|$|The <b>résumé</b> has one purpose: Produce a job interview. The {{purpose of}} {{preparing}} a <b>résumé</b> {{is to present}} yourself to a prospective employer at a glance. (Note: Employers often scan <b>résumés</b> in 20 - 30 seconds. Yours must survive the evaluating scan.) The <b>résumé</b> should contain positive information about your professional self. The <b>résumé</b> is often your first introduction to an employer and is therefore vital as that important first impression.

However, no student should miss out on an employment opportunity because of an inadequate <b>résumé.</b> A good <b>résumé</b> is concise and brief. It must be devoid of grammatical, typographical and spelling errors. Abbreviations should not be used unless their meaning is clear. A <b>résumé</b> should be attractively arranged on a standard size page. Single-page <b>résumés</b> are ideal, though two-page <b>résumés</b> may also be used, provided that the information and data are pertinent. Remember that too much detail or irrelevant information will detract from the effectiveness of the <b>résumé.</b> <b>Résumés</b> must contain only information that is true and accurate.
