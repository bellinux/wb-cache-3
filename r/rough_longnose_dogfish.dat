New {{microsatellite}} loci for the <b>longnose</b> velvet <b>dogfish</b> Centroselachus crepidater (Squaliformes: Somniosidae) {{and other}} deep sea sharks. Conservation Genetic Resources, 3, (1), 173 - 176. IMPF: 00. 48 The continuing over-exploitation of traditional coastal stocks {{has resulted in}} the shift of commercial fishing towards deep-sea ecosystems {{in many parts of the}} world. The effects on target and non-target species have been dramatic; particularly for the deep-sea sharks. With the aim of providing tools that will allow the assessment of population genetic structure of Centroselachus crepidater, novel microsatellite loci have been developed for this deep-sea elasmobranch. Seven of these markers showed between 3 and 7 alleles per locus in two North Atlantic populations, with observed and expected heterozygosities between 0. 18 ? 0. 95 and 0. 25 ? 0. 82, respectively. Additionally, ten loci cross-amplify in other Elasmobranch species. Peer reviewe...|$|R
