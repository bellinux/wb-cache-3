25|$|The game {{took two}} years to write and {{started out as a}} 3D arcade game without the trading element. It was written in machine code using {{assembly}} language, giving much care to maximum compactness of code.

25|$|The game's {{heads-up display}} {{includes}} a <b>radar</b> <b>display</b> and other flight instrumentation, {{as well as}} displays for the plane's damage rating and available weaponry. During gameplay, an aircraft's default weaponry typically consist of a supply of guided missiles and a gun. Additionally, each aircraft is also armed with a particular special weapon, examples of which include various types of air-dropped bombs and specialized air-to-air or air-to-ground missiles.|$|E
40|$|Weather {{radar systems}} are an {{important}} tool in commercial aviation to safeguard the safety and security of aircraft. However, the utility of weather radar systems lies in the accuracy and {{the reliability of the}} interpretations of the displays. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether experienced pilots could be clustered based on their assessments of the turbulence associated with simulated weather <b>radar</b> <b>displays</b> and whether these groups corresponded to differences in experience-related metrics. Sixty one participants completed a series of on-line scenarios in which they were asked to rate the level of turbulence associated with 11 simulated weather <b>radar</b> <b>displays.</b> They were also asked to indicate their confidence in being able to continue the flight for 80 nautical miles in the absence of an alteration in track or altitude. A cluster analysis reliably differentiated two groups of participants and these groups corresponded to differences in the capacity to discriminate between weather radar scenarios. The results also reveal both a lack of reliability in experienced pilots' interpretations of weather <b>radar</b> <b>displays</b> and difficulties associated with classifications of expertise on the basis of experienced-related metrics. At an empirical level, the outcomes have implications for assessments of expertise in domains in which ideal performance is difficult to establish. From an industry perspective, the results reveal important differences in the interpretation of weather <b>radar</b> <b>displays</b> amongst experienced, qualified pilots. This suggests a need for both more effective weather radar design, complemented by more reliable and comprehensive training that focuses on the accurate interpretation of different types of weather radar returns. Relevance to industry: The research highlights the difficulties that pilots face in interpreting weather <b>radar</b> <b>displays</b> accurately and emphasises the need for new designs and more effective training initiatives. 6 page(s...|$|R

50|$|At 6:48:15, {{with the}} {{aircraft}} approximately 10 minutes out of Stockton, the Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) received a high-pitched, garbled radio message from Flight 773, and the aircraft soon {{disappeared from the}} center’s <b>radar</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{first such}} device, the AN/APA-46 Adapter Assembly, allowed the {{operator}} to sight through the Norden at four (or five {{depending on the}} model) locations during the approach. This was quickly replaced by the APA-47, which updated the Norden continuously. This allowed the bombardier {{to concentrate on the}} <b>radar</b> <b>display</b> during the approach, and, if the conditions were favourable, move to the Norden at the last minute to achieve higher accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The CDS allowed {{operators}} to assign objects on the <b>radar</b> <b>display</b> different IDs and combined them together onto a single display which allowed intercept officers {{to have a}} unified display of location, raid size, and altitude. The CDS {{made it easy for}} {{operators to}} vector friendly fighters onto intercept courses with unknown targets and later versions could automatically calculate the interception points. The basic idea of the CDS was extremely influential in military circles and led to computerized versions in the form of DATAR, Naval Tactical Data System, and SAGE.|$|E
25|$|VIL {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} the potential for downburst, too. A convective downdraft is linked to three forces in the vertical, namely perturbation pressure gradient force, buoyancy force and precipitation loading. The pressure gradient force was neglected as it has significant effect only on the updraft in supercells. With this assumption and other simplifications (e.g. requiring the environment of the air parcel to be static on the time scale of the downdraft). The resulting momentum equation is integrated over height to yield the kinetic energy of the parcel on descending to the surface and is found to be the negative CAPE of a dry air parcel injected into the storm, plus de motion of the convective cell. S. R. Stewart, from NWS, has published in 1991 an equation relating VIL and the echo tops that give the potential for surface gust using this concept. This is a predictive result that gives a certain lead time. With the Doppler velocity data, the meteorologist can see the downdraft and gust fronts happening, but since this a small scale feature, detection algorithms have been developed to point convergence and divergence areas under a thunderstorm on the <b>radar</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

An array of dials and switches are mounted {{on either side of}} a centrally placed CRT monitor, controlling the navigational, communications, and weapons-control computers. BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced <b>Radar</b> <b>Display</b> Information System (TARDIS), a [...] multi-function display, to replace the rear cockpit's Combined Radar and Projected Map Display; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004.|$|E
500|$|By late 1939 it was {{realized}} that {{the rotation of the}} beam on the <b>radar</b> <b>display</b> could be accomplished using electronics. In December 1939, G.W.A Dummer began development of such a system, and in June 1940 a modified CHL radar was motorized to continually spin in bearing, and connected to one of these new displays. The result was a 360 degree view of the airspace around the radar. Six copies of the prototype Ground Control Interception radars (GCI) were hand-built at AMES (Air Ministry Experimental Station) and RAE during November and December 1940, and the first went operational at RAF Sopley on New Year's Day 1941, with the rest following {{by the end of the}} month. Prior to their introduction in December 1940 the interception rate was 0.5%; by May 1941, with a number of operational GCI stations and better familiarity, it was 7%, with a kill rate of [...] around 2.5%.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the post-war}} era, Elliott Brothers began concentrating on {{automation}} solutions for fire control, and on 1 December 1946 they {{began work on}} what would develop into the CDS. The initial idea was to collect ASDIC data on various targets from different ships in a task group and then produce a single unified view using a new display system that overlaid symbols on a large-format plan-position indicator (PPI) <b>radar</b> <b>display.</b> Elliott received a patent for this [...] "Peevish" [...] system in 1947.|$|E
