The modeling was followed by experimental testing {{using one of the}} curved arrays. Not surprisingly, the curved array showed significant improvements over a flat array on <b>reference</b> <b>notch</b> sizing. One of the major advantages of using curved arrays – as opposed to matrix arrays – is that curving is an economical and simple solution...|$|E
40|$|Several lately {{proposed}} modifications or variants {{of the structural}} stress or strain concepts, of the notch stress or strain concepts (also termed 'local stress or strain concepts') and of the fracture mechanics concepts of fatigue assessment of welded joints are reviewed, whereas the wider context is presented in a recently republished and actualised standard work. The structural stress concepts described first {{are based on a}} linearisation of the stress distribution across the plate thickness or along the anticipated crack path and, alternatively, on the structural stress 1 mm in depth below the weld toe. The structural stress is defined and set against design S-N curves. A further structural stress concept is presented for welded joints in thin-sheet steels and aluminium alloys. Among the elastic notch stress concepts, the variant with the <b>reference</b> <b>notch</b> radius, rho(r) = 1 mm, recently verified also for welded joints in aluminium alloys with plate thicknesses t >= 5 mm and the variant with a small-size <b>reference</b> <b>notch</b> radius, rho(r) = 0. 05 mm, applicable to welded joints in thin-sheet materials, are outlined. The elastic-plastic notch strain concept is applied to a spot-welded tensile-shear specimen starting from a small-size keyhole notch at the nugget edge. The novel notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) approach relating to crack initiation and extrapolated to final fracture of seam-welded joints in steels and in aluminium alloys is reviewed. A more recently developed crack propagation approach for spot welds is finally described...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect on}} new connective tissue attachment of citric acid conditioning and fibronectin-laminin application in treating naturally occurring periodontitis, all 4 quadrants in each of 2 Beagle dogs were used. Each quadrant included: P 2, P 3, P 4, and M 1 teeth. 2 treatment modalities were employed and comparatively analyzed for differences in histological healing respponses at 120 days after surgery. The treatments were: (1) surgery (mucoperiosteal flaps) plus citric acid; (2) surgery plus citric acid followed by fibronectin-laminin application. After scaling and root planing, coronal and root surface <b>reference</b> <b>notches</b> were placed for histometric measurements. Following each of the randomly assigned treatments, flaps were sutured. After sacrifice, tissue blocks of treated areas were decalcified and serially cut, obtaining bucco-lingual and mesiodistal sections. Using a Filar micrometer. 5 distances were masured on the buccal aspect: (1) from root surface notch to alveolar bone crest; (2) from root surface notch to coronal extent of the cementum; (3) from root surface notch to apical extent of the junctional epithelium; 84) from free gingival margin to apical extent of junctional epithelium; (5) from the coronal notch to the alveolar bone crest. Results showed no differences among the 5 measurements between the 2 treatments tested. On mesiodistal sections, surface area determinations {{were made in the}} furcations, evaluating the space occupied by new connective tissue, with or without bone, or by epithelium. For this, images were digitized using a Zeiss IBAS Image analysis system with a 4 mB of array processor memory coupled to a Newvicon TV camera and a microcomputer. Significant differences were found, with increased values for both regenerative connective tissue and bone when surgery plus citric acid was followed by fibronectin-laminin application. Often, these tissues filled completely furcation areas above root surface <b>reference</b> <b>notches...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{determined}} {{the difference in}} the location of the caries dye staining endpoint of 1 % Acid Red dye in propylene glycol versus that of 1 % Acid Red dye in polypropylene glycol. Methods: Freshly extracted permanent molar crowns with primary occlusal carious lesions were chisel-split axially to expose the lesion in cross-section on both halves. One half was stained with propylene glycol-based dye and the other with polypropylene glycol-based dye. For the control group, both halves were stained with propylene glycol-based dye. The dye staining front was marked on digital images of the stained split surfaces, and the images were aligned using <b>reference</b> <b>notches.</b> The distance between the marked staining front lines was measured in five locations, and the measurement protocol was repeated. Weighted averages and a 95 % confidence interval for the distance between marked staining front lines were calculated for the control and experimental groups. Results: The weighted average distance for the experimental group (0. 298 mm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 240 mm- 0. 357 mm) was about four times that of the control group (0. 070 mm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 051 mm- 0. 089 mm).

40|$|A fatigue {{strength}} parameter for (seam-) welded joints is presented {{which is based}} on the averaged elastic strain energy density (SED) criterion applied to full circle and semicircular 'control volumes', the latter centred by the expected crack path. The parameter is applicable both at weld toes and weld roots, at least in the medium-cycle and high-cycle fatigue range where elastic conditions are prevailing. Based on a rectangular slit-plate model representing the weld root and analysed by the finite element method, the effect of the following influencing conditions is investigated: tension loading (mode 1) and shear loading (mode 2), slit-parallel tension loading acting on a rounded slit tip, pointed slit tip versus small-size key-hole at the slit tip. semicircle and narrow sector versus full circle or full sector SED evaluations, distortional SED versus total SED under plane strain conditions. The following conclusions are drawn from the numerical results. The SED approach should be based on the full circle or full sector evaluation of the total SED, with R(0) = 0. 28 mm for steels. In cases of a markedly unilateral angular SED distribution, the semicircle evaluation centred by the expected crack path is more appropriate. The use of small-size <b>reference</b> <b>notches</b> instead of pointed notches provides no advantage. The endurable remote stresses for fatigue-loaded welded joints according to the SED approach are well in correspondence with those according to the fictitious notch rounding approach. High accuracy of the results can already be achieved with a rough meshing at the pointed notches...|$|R

40|$|A finite-element {{formulation}} for {{the analysis}} of time-dependent failure of concrete is presented. The proposed formulation incorporates: 1) the viscoelastic behavior of uncracked concrete through a Maxwell chain model; and 2) the inelastic behavior of damaged concrete, characterized by {{a modified version of the}} microplane Model M 4 which includes the rate dependence of fracturing. The proposed formulation is applied to the simulation of quasi-static concrete failure in the time domain. The different effects of creep and rate dependence of crack growth and their role in the lifetime of concrete structures are studied. The influence of different loading rates on the size effect is also analyzed with <b>reference</b> to single <b>notched</b> specimens, revealing the link between the size of the fracture process zone and the loading rate.

40|$|Abstract—Four ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas are proposed: one <b>{{referenced}}</b> antenna without <b>notch</b> {{and three}} novel antennas with one, {{two and three}} notched bands, respectively. The UWB referenced antenna consists of a beveled rectangular metal patch, a 50 Ω microstrip line and a defective ground plane. Then, by utilizing one, two and three electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures on the UWB antenna, the antennas present one, two and three notchedband responses, respectively. The frequency domain characteristics including VSWR, transfer coefficient S 21, radiation patterns and group delay are investigated. It is found that the EBG design approach is {{a good candidate for}} frequency rejection at the certain frequencies, owing to high performance of notch design and the notched-band bandwidth control abilities. Meanwhile, these abilities also enable less useful frequencies rejected. The design examples exhibit good bandrejected characteristics in the WiMAX/WLAN interference bands (3. 4, 5. 2 and 5. 8 -GHz bands). Moreover, good time-domain characteristics of the antennas are checked based on group delay, waveform response, correlation coefficient and pulse width stretch ratio (SR). 1...|$|R
40|$|Eddy current {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) {{is well known}} as an effective technique for detecting fatigue cracks in conducting materials [1]. Along with detection, {{it is also important}} to be able to size fatigue cracks. This sizing is difficult because eddy current phenomena do not in general allow a quantitative image to be obtained, rather, a characteristic signal is obtained from a test which is much like a defect fingerprint. Defect sizing is facilitated by calibration procedures, which utilize classification schemes. EDM notches are often used to produce reference signals which are then used in the classification schemes. There is, however, much discussion in the NDE community as to the accuracy of EDM <b>notch</b> <b>reference</b> standards for eddy current fatigue crack calibration [2 – 3]. In response to the need for accurate fatigue crack standards to be used for training a classification system for the NASA Space Shuttle main engine heat exchanger unit, a study was carried out comparing eddy current responses to EDM notches and fatigue cracks in stainless steel tubing...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{signalling}} pathways {{that control}} pancreatic endocrine tumour (PET) development and proliferation may reveal novel targets for therapeutic intervention. The pathogenesis for sporadic and hereditary PETs, apart from mutations of the MEN 1 and VHL tumour suppressor genes, is still elusive. The protein {{product of the}} MEN 1 gene, menin, regulates many genes. The aim of this thesis was to identify genes involved in pancreatic endocrine tumourigenesis, with special <b>reference</b> to <b>Notch</b> signalling. Messenger RNA and protein expression of NOTCH 1, HES 1, HEY 1, ASCL 1, NEUROG 3, NEUROD 1, DLK 1, POU 3 F 4, PDX 1, RPL 10, DKK 1 and TPH 1 were studied in human PETs, sporadic and MEN 1, {{as well as in}} tumours from heterozygous Men 1 mice. For comparison, normal and MEN 1 non-tumourous human and mouse pancreatic specimens were used. Nuclear expression of HES 1 was consistently absent in PETs. In mouse tumours this coincided with loss of menin expression, and there was a correlation between Men 1 expression and several Notch signalling factors. A new phenotype consisting of numerous menin-expressing endocrine cell clusters, smaller than islets, was found in Men 1 mice. Expression of NEUROG 3 and NEUROD 1 was predominantly localised to the cytoplasm in PETs and islets from MEN 1 patients and Men 1 mice, whereas expression was solely nuclear in wt mice. Differences in expression levels of Pou 3 f 4, Rpl 10 and Dlk 1 between islets of Men 1 and wt mice were observed. In addition, combined RNA interference and microarray expression analysis in the pancreatic endocrine cell line BON 1 identified 158 target genes of ASCL 1. For two of these, DKK 1 (a negative regulator of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway) and TPH 1, immunohistochemistry was performed on PETs. In concordance with the microarray finding, DKK 1 expression showed an inverse relation to ASCL 1 expression. Altered subcellular localisation of HES 1, NEUROD 1 and NEUROG 3 and down-regulation of DKK 1 may contribute to tumourigenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for the in-situ measurement and structural health {{monitoring of the}} rotating components in gas turbine engines is of major interest to NASA. As part of this on-going effort, several experiments have been undertaken to develop methods for detecting cracks and measuring strain on rotating turbine engine like disks. Previous methods investigated have included the use of blade tip clearance sensors to detect the presence of cracks by monitoring the change in measured blade tip clearance and analyzing the combined disk-rotor system's vibration response. More recently, an experiment utilizing a novel optical Moir based concept has been conducted on a subscale turbine engine disk to demonstrate a potential strain measurement and crack detection technique. Moir patterns result from the overlap of two repetitive patterns with slightly different spacing. When this technique is applied to a rotating disk, {{it has the potential}} to allow for the detection of very small changes in spacing and radial growth in a rotating disk due to a flaw such as a crack. This investigation was a continuation of previous efforts undertaken in 2011 - 2012 to validate this optical concept. The initial demonstration attempted on a subscale turbine engine disk was inconclusive due to the minimal radial growth experienced by the disk during operation. For the present experiment a new subscale Aluminum disk was fabricated and improvements were made to the experimental setup to better demonstrate the technique. A circular reference pattern was laser etched onto a subscale engine disk and the disk was operated at speeds up to 12 000 rpm as a means of optically monitoring the Moir created by the shift in patterns created by the radial growth due the presence of the simulated crack. Testing was first accomplished on a clean defect free disk as a means of acquiring baseline <b>reference</b> data. A <b>notch</b> was then machined in to the disk to simulate a crack and testing was repeated for the purposes of demonstrating the concept. Displacement data was acquired using external blade tip clearance and shaft displacement sensors as a means of confirming the optical data and for validating other sensor based crack detection techniques...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} {{plays an}} important role in the survival of nearly all animals. Normal levels of aggression are important for many processes, including defense against predators, acquisition of mates and in some species to establish a social hierarchy. Excessive aggression on the contrary is disadvantageous. In humans, abnormal aggression can have important socio-economic consequences. It is an endophenotype of multiple psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and Alzheimers disease or can constitute a behavioral pathology in and of itself (e. g. intermittent explosive disorder). The current medication used to control abnormal aggression is unspecific and has a variable effectiveness, depending on the genetic background of the individual. Gaining insigth into the genetic basis of aggression can lead to a better understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms and could help to develop better drugs. Aggression is a complex trait that is influenced by genetic as well as environmental factors. Historically, research focused on the individual roles of genes in biologically plausible pathways. Although this research identified multiple factors that can influence aggressive behavior, including neurotransmitters, hormones and anatomical differences, the results were often inconclusive or contradictory. Furthermore, more recent whole genome approaches revealed that the genetic background of aggression is considerably more complex and involves a large number of genes. We aimed to integrate quantitative whole genome analyses with the classical single gene approach. This integration allowed us to gain insight into the overall genetic network that is at the basis of this behavior and to use this knowledge as a starting point to unravel the effects of different pathways in aggression. Our analyses confirmed that aggression is a complex behavior that is under the control of a large number of pleiotropic genes. The pleiotropic functions of these genes include a variety of processes, e. g. energy metabolism, nervous system development and the reception and interpretation of different sensory inputs. Furthermore, we demonstrate for a subset of these genes that they do not exert individual effects on this behavior, but act together in epistatic networks. It is the combined output of these functional ensembles that forms the basis of the observed phenotype. We illustrate the extensive influences of genes in these networks by demonstrating that small alterations in one single gene can have a widespread influence on gene expression levels. Furthermore, the genetic networks that control aggression also control multiple other processes. We show that the genes that form these networks influence aggressive behavior and brain morphology as well as genome wide transcript abundance in an epistatic manner. For further analyses, we focused on a subset of the identified pathways. We showed that the Wnt and Notch pathways as well as GABA and glutamate signaling play a role in the control of aggressive behavior. Furthermore, we suggest that the identified pathways might provide novel drug targets. Interestingly, the effects of drugs affecting these pathways seem to be strongly dependent on the genetic background of the organism. The effects of one single mutation in the involved genes are capable of inducing significant changes in responsiveness to a certain drug. These findings show that Drosophila can provide an excellent model to unravel interindividual differences in drug response. Finally, we demonstrated that the applied techniques can be used to identify the different neuronal populations involved in the control of aggression. First of all, we confirm the role of the mushroom bodies in aggression. Furthermore, we provide evidence for specific effects of the individual mushroom body lobes in the control of this behavior. We show that the length of the &# 945;-lobes is inversely correlated with aggressive behavior in both the analyzed mutants and in wild-derived inbred lines. We also show that the expression levels of many candidate aggression genes correlate both with aggressive behavior and with the length of these lobes. Next, we provide evidence for an important role of the circadian system, and more precisely the ventral lateral neurons, in aggression. We show that mutations in different known clock genes induce changes in aggression. Furthermore, we show that the Notch signaling pathway is implicated in the aggression-mediating function of the clock neurons. We show that this pathway is involved in the development of the ventral lateral neurons as well as in the influences of these neurons on adult aggressive behavior. Interestingly, we could not correlate the anatomical abnormalities with the observed differences in aggression, suggesting independent roles for Notch signaling during development and in the adult organism. We suggest that these adult functions involve an interaction between neuronal Delta and glial Notch as well as Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF-) signaling.
