50|$|The Class N (D25) engines {{were built}} for express {{passenger}} service when the NBR {{was preparing for}} significant expansion of its timetable following the reopening of the Tay Rail Bridge. The bridge had been closed for several years following the 1879 Tay Bridge disaster. The engines performed admirably, and were popular with railway staff, several being recorded in use on Royal trains of the period. In later life they were relegated to more routine duties. Withdrawals commenced in 1926, with operational duties ending in 1932. One engine remained in commission as a <b>reserve</b> <b>locomotive</b> (but without being used) from 1931 until formally withdrawn and scrapped in 1933. This {{was the end of}} the class.|$|E
50|$|On 29 May 1991 the Federal President, Richard von Weizsäcker, {{gave the}} {{starting}} signal at Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe {{to announce that}} the new Hannover-Würzburg and Mannheim-Stuttgart high-speed railways were now fully in service. That meant four more locations for TuHi were required. In addition to Fulda and Würzburg, TuHi also had to be stationed at Kornwestheim, Mannheim, Kassel and Hildesheim. The TuHi in Fulda had to be organised as a bidirectional train, {{so that it could}} be used in the Würzburg and Kassel directions. To make this possible, another first aid coach has been inserted behind transport wagon 1. By stationing a TuHi at Hildesheim Hbf and Kassel Hbf both directions of the high-speed link can be traversed via link lines. For that reason a unidirectional train is sufficient here. Between August 1990 and April 1991 eight more 212 or 214s were modified at AW Bremen und AW Kassel for the four other TuHi. Locomotives 212 033, 212 046, 212 235, 212 245, 212 246, 212 251, 212 260 and 212 277 were converted to Class 214, all retaining their original serial numbers. There is no difference any longer between locos 1 and 2, {{in order to be able}} to exchange them more easily, which is always necessary when carrying out routine maintenance. The former locomotive 2's from Würzburg and Fulda were fitted with the missing infra-red cameras in 1991 at AW Kassel. The cooling of the infra-red cameras is achieved now using the usual liquid air cylinders, which were swapped for the previously used liquid nitrogen flasks.After the serious train accident on 15 November 1992 at Northeim, when no TuHi was used, a new concept for rescue operations was introduced. Once the TuHi also became available for deployment away from the high-speed railway they became known as “emergency trains” (Rettungszüge or Rtz). All 13 engines of Class 214 were redesignated by the DB AG on 31 October 1994 to railway works vehicles of Class 714. Again the running numbers were retained. On 1 August 1996, however, they were given sequential numbers within Class 714, from 001 to 013. The locomotive with the lowest original number became 001 and the one with the highest became 013.Because only one <b>reserve</b> <b>locomotive</b> is available, DB AG converted another two engines in 1996/97 at Stendal: numbers 212 269 became 714 014 and 212 160 became 714 015. In addition to the renumbering, the TuHi/Rtz locos changed their livery. The first five TuHi locos still had the classic ocean blue and beige livery, the later eight engines were painted orient red. To achieve greater recognisability against the emergency wagon, the locos were painted in luminous red. Numbers 714 003, 714 008, 714 009, 714 011, 714 014 and 714 015 have this livery, as do the wagons in the Rtz at Würzburg, Fulda and Hildesheim. Due to the rapid fading of the luminous red paint, all engines and wagons were subsequently repainted in traffic red. The inscription on the locomotives remains confusing. There are the white letters Rtz, the DB insignia with white writing Netz Notfalltechnik, and the DB sign with white lettering Notfalltechnik. All 15 engines of Class 714 belong to DB Netz, central route management/railway vehicles at Fulda. From there the disposition of the engines is controlled and they are regularly changed over under a rolling programme.|$|E
5|$|As Amtrak is in {{the process}} of {{replacing}} its fleet of EMD AEM-7 locomotives with Siemens ACS-64, PCJPB entered discussions to purchase several retired AEM-7s to test the electrification system and to serve as <b>reserve</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the event of EMU unavailability. Because of the delay in delivering ACS-64s, the target sale date for the AEM-7 was moved out to June 2016.|$|R

5000|$|All eleven {{survived the}} war, with five having been {{assigned}} to the Dalian Railway Bureau, and six to the Fengtian Bureau {{at the end of}} the war, and were taken over by the Republic of China Railway. In 1951, the China Railway designated them class ㄆㄒ伍 (PX5), subsequently becoming class SL5 (勝利, Shènglì, [...] "victory") in 1959, and were numbered in the 281-300 range. They were used by CR primarily around Shenyang on passenger trains. In 1980 five were known to be in service - 281-283, 292, and 296 - as <b>reserve</b> <b>locomotives</b> at the Sujiatun locomotive depot. SL5-292 is preserved at the Shenyang Steam Locomotive Museum.|$|R
50|$|From {{the start}} of {{locomotive}} preservation, owners were allowed to remove components from similar types of locomotives {{to make up a}} complete kit of bits, on the condition that the donor <b>locomotive</b> was not <b>reserved</b> and that no substantial damage was incurred in removing the parts. However, this policy combined with ease of access to the extensive yards resulted in petty pilfering and trophy/memorabilia collection in the early years, to mass criminal activity. Although Woodham's had allowed weekend working parties to access <b>reserved</b> <b>locomotives,</b> by 1981 illegal removal of valuable scrap had got so bad that Woodham's employed a 24-hour security guard team, and a total ban was placed on weekend working parties.|$|R

40|$|Having {{replaced}} the diesel locomotives operated in Lithuanian railways by new ones, part of old diesel locomotives (21 units) were renovated. They were equipped with new diesel engines made in Kolomna (Russia). These diesel locomotives {{are used as}} <b>reserve</b> <b>locomotives</b> or for carrying small scope freight on local routes. After a few years from their renovation diesel engines {{as well as the}} locomotives started to fail. Failures happened to be repeated. The article analyses these locomotives’ failure patterns such as number distribution of engine failures according to locomotive mileage, distribution of engine failures according to diesel locomotive turnover, distribution of engine failure number according to consumed fuel. It suggested to regard the density of engine failure probability according to consumed fuel as one of the indicators of engine reliability...|$|R

50|$|Special {{regulations}} governed {{the transportation}} of royalty and VIPs. The railway staff were sworn to secrecy and all documents {{had to be}} destroyed after the journey. <b>Reserve</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{had to be made}} available at certain stations and these engines had to be facing the direction of travel of the train and ready to move as long as the royal train was in their district. The engine driver and fireman were not permitted to leave the locomotive during this time. During the journey, the train was not allowed to be subject to any impacts or heavy swaying movements. The place at which the train was to stop in the station was indicated by an official with an unfurled red flag or, during the hours of darkness, by a red light. The station was decorated ceremonially for the visit and a red carpet was laid out from the platform through the west wing of the station to the exit on the station forecourt. There was always a large crowd of the local population because everyone wanted to see the emperor. The governor's office (Landdrostei) in Lüneburg was responsible {{for the safety of the}} imperial household. During the first visit of the emperor, two sergeants (Oberwachtmeister), seven mounted gendarmes and four gendarmes on foot were employed as guards.|$|R
5000|$|The alleged British 'Strategic Reserve' is {{a potent}} and {{frequently}} recurring urban myth amongst railway enthusiasts. Following the complete withdrawal of mainline steam traction in 1968, the myth persisted for decades that a <b>reserve</b> of <b>locomotives</b> had been retained for such a strategic purpose. As no official reserve existed, nor was any reserve obviously visible, this encouraged many fanciful explanations for where the reserve might be hidden, usually in some tunnel or mine. One theory even claimed that the growing steam preservation movement was itself the Strategic Reserve.|$|R

25|$|Evening Star {{was built}} at Swindon railway works in 1960. Though {{the last to}} be built, {{it was not the}} last 9F numerically as Crewe Works had already {{completed}} engines with higher numbers. It was equipped with a BR1G-type tender and given BR Brunswick green livery, normally <b>reserved</b> for passenger <b>locomotives,</b> and was completed with a copper-capped double chimney. All other members of the class of heavy freight locomotives were painted unlined black.|$|R
50|$|After {{the reunification}} of Germany and {{subsequent}} merger of the Deutsche Reichsbahn into the Bundesbahn the class designation was changed to BR 220 for the Deutsche Bundesbahn, as the original class number was already in use for the electric BR 120, and class designation ranges 100-199 were <b>reserved</b> for electric <b>locomotives</b> under the Bundesbahn's scheme. However, they were quickly phased out {{and by the end}} of 1994 the class had all but disappeared, with 31 units from Germany having been sold to North Korea.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} for mixed-traffic operation (use on both passenger and freight services) and were designed to operate on steep gradients. The first examples of the class entered service upon completion in 1910, and the final operational examples were withdrawn from mainline service in 1976. A number of locomotives in the class were retained in mothballed working condition as part of Italian Railways' policy of keeping steam <b>locomotives</b> in <b>reserve,</b> well into the era of internal combustion and electric motive power. The final withdrawal from the <b>reserve</b> fleet was <b>locomotive</b> 625 100 in 1998.|$|R

5000|$|Later, when {{electrification}} and dieselisation expanded, {{many of the}} Class P36 locomotives {{were transferred}} {{to work on the}} Lviv, Far East, Eastern Siberia, and Transbaikal Railways. The last was withdrawn from regular scheduled express passenger train service in 1974. All were staged in full working order and kept in reserve for times of extraordinary demand. At certain intervals, the locomotives were taken out from staging, steamed up and put to work to haul trains to test the condition of the locomotives. In the late 1980s, these strategic <b>reserves</b> of <b>locomotives</b> were disbanded and the Class P36 locomotives were distributed to museums and for preservation. Some that had not seen regular use for more than fifteen years and were in the worst mechanical condition, were scrapped. It was found that the roller bearings suffered most by standing unused. When the computerised new class numbers were introduced by the Russian Ministry of Railways, the Class P36 were designated Class 1000.0001 to 1000.0251. In the 1990s, {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, a number were sold to private train operators.|$|R

50|$|The {{location}} of the first Erfurt station was controversial. Inside the Erfurt city walls {{there were only a}} very limited area available and outside the fortifications a suitable area was available in the Krämpfer field to the east of the Schmidtstedter Tore (gate). The Erfurt Mayor, Karl Friedrich Wagner, however, argued in favour of a location within the city fortification and the Prussian authorities and the military also demanded that the route of the railway line pass through the fortress ramparts, so that they could stop railway operations in crisis situations. In July 1845, the decision was finally taken to build the station within the fortifications, north of the hohen Batterie (high battery). The first railway station was built in 1846 during the construction of the Thuringian Railway by the Thuringian Railway Company (Thüringische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). The location chosen meant that the construction of two double tunnels through the fortress wall and several wooden bridges across the moat would be required. It was opened with the Weimar-Erfurt line on 1 April 1847 with all buildings finished except for the entrance building, which was completed in 1852. Apart from the unfinished entrance building, the station had at its opening a locomotive building, a goods shed, a carriage shed, a coke shed, a shed for <b>reserve</b> <b>locomotives</b> and an operations workshop. Within a few years of its opening, the infrastructure was no longer sufficient for the growing needs. Two buildings, an additional goods sheds and a carriage shed, were planned in 1850 and completed in 1854. An enlargement of the locomotive shed was necessary in 1852 and the freight yard was expanded from 1855. One year later, the side wing of the workshop received another floor; the coke shed was converted into a locomotive shed together with a large turntable after the conversion of locomotive operations to coal. A further expansion of freight transport facilities followed in 1860. The two existing freight sheds were expanded and a third was built. However, the lack of space within the fortifications grew increasingly noticeable, and the Thuringian Railway Company purchased a large area in front of the Schmidtstedter gate in 1865 to erect a freight yard. Due to the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the start of construction was delayed and work only began in the following year. Freight sheds were built in 1871, allowing the freight yard to be opened in 1872, but it was only finally completed five years later in 1877. The timetable at the opening of Erfurt Hauptbahnhof showed four trains running daily between Halle and Erfurt with a journey time of three to three and a half hours. Ten years later, in the summer of 1857, two express trains, three ordinary passenger trains, and one mixed train ran daily between Halle and Eisenach via Erfurt. The Nordhausen-Erfurt Railway Company (Nordhausen-Erfurter-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) opened the Nordhausen-Erfurt railway on 17 August 1869. The Erfurt terminus was originally at the Nordhäuser Bahnhof (Nordhausen station) on the Schmidtstedter field; there existed from the outset a transfer railway to the station of the Thuringian Railway Company and from 1872 passenger trains continued through to its station. The Nordhäuser Bahnhof served freight traffic from then on and its entrance building is now used as a residential house. The Sangerhausen-Erfurt railway also originally ended at its own station, the Sangerhäuser Bahnhof, after the opening of the section to Erfurt on 24 October 1881. It was not far from the Nordhäuser Bahnhof and was integrated into the Thuringian station a few years later via the branch line of the Thuringian Railway to the Royal Salt Mine at Ilversgehofen. After that the Sangerhäuser Bahnhof was also exclusively used for freight transport. The three-storey entrance building of the first Erfurt station is still preserved and is now used by Deutsche Bahn AG. It is located west of today's Hauptbahnhof and has a white/olive colour scheme. Previously, with the low buildings on Bahnhofstraße (station street), its tower was widely visible. The building operated from 1847 to 1890 and later became the seat of the railway division(Reichsbahndirektion) of Erfurt.|$|R
50|$|In 1921 the Federal Royal Commission into Standard Gauge had {{recommended}} that the mainland States of Australia and the Australian Government commit themselves to providing a uniform railway network linking the capital cities of Australia with a common gauge. As part of the standardisation of the disparate gauges, a new link between Sydney and Brisbane via Kyogle, New South Wales was identified as being a central element. Queensland in 1924 passed the South Brisbane Kyogle Grafton Act committing itself {{to the construction of}} a new standard gauge railway from South Brisbane railway station to the border with New South Wales. As part of this, New South Wales demanded a bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton and the upgrading of the Kyogle branch. The Australian Government provided half the funding for the project. The interstate standard gauge railway line between Kyogle and South Brisbane opened in 1930. The importance of the Toowoomba-Wallangarra southern line diminished, as the new link via northern New South Wales and the Richmond Gap into Queensland did not involve a change of trains at a border station.During the time of the Second World War the strategic importance of Wallangarra was vital in providing an inland transhipment and staging point during the defence of Australia. Large numbers of workers were employed to tranship goods in the New South Wales section of the yard. The extensive yard and station complex at this time consisted of the station building, closets and horse dock at the southern end of the station platform (the border dock). Refreshment Room staff and ambulance quarters were situated at the north end of the platform. On the western (Queensland) side was a goods office, casual crew quarters with dining room, frame tent and library. To the north-east an engine shed was situated, <b>reserve</b> coal dump, <b>locomotive</b> coal stage, tool room, ASM's residence (1919), ganger's residence (1919) and trucking yards. On the east side (New South Wales) was the Station Master's residence (1887), 25 ton weighbridge, lamp room, waitresses quarters and the footwarmer furnace. Quarters were also provided for laundresses. Most of these ancillary buildings are now removed.|$|R
