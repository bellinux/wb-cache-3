40|$|Introduction: Optimal {{timing of}} {{surgical}} treatment for infective endocarditis (IE) complicated by intracranial hemorrhage remains controversial. Presentation of case: A 43 -year-old man with IE received appropriate antibiotic therapy but had recurrence of cerebral infarction and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). <b>Emergency</b> <b>valve</b> surgery was performed 2  days after ICH onset because {{of heart failure}} and recurrence of cerebral complications. Postoperatively, he showed no neurologic symptoms; neuroimaging showed no enlargement of ICH. Discussion: Postoperative risk of neurologic deterioration may be relatively lower than previously thought in patients with IE who undergo surgery within 1 month after ICH onset. Conclusions: Emergency surgery in patients with ICH is justified in cases of multiple indications for such small ICH. Further evaluation regarding the risk of subsequent hemorrhage in patients with ICH who require <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> surgery is warranted...|$|R

50|$|KEUL is a {{non-commercial}} {{radio station}} in Girdwood, Alaska, broadcasting on 88.9 FM. The station originally began as a non-licensed station, during a proliferation of such in the Anchorage area during the 1990s.

40|$|Mechanosensitive Ion {{channels}} {{are essential for}} maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has been proposed that they function as osmotically activated <b>emergency</b> <b>valves,</b> guarding against membrane rupture by opening pores to release excessive turgor pressure. Interfering with their function suggests many novel mechanisms to complement conventional antimicrobials to kill or inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens.

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the MscL pore expands to ~30Å in {{diameter}} when closed, with change of 15-16Å upon opening, which is the largest known conformational change in channel proteins. This large change accounts for the opening of the 30Å diameter pore, resulting in a 20 nm2 in-plane protein expansion. Such a transformation is responsible for MscL's unitary conductance of 3nS and the channel's lack of selectivity, allowing any particles with a molecular weight smaller than ~1,000. This property of MscL fulfills its role as an <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> to release solutes under osmotic shock.|$|R

50|$|Originally, the E-6A {{was built}} to perform the TAke Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) mission of <b>relaying</b> <b>Emergency</b> Action Messages to Navy Ballistic Missile Submarines in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, when {{it was decided to}} retire the {{remainder}} of the Air Force’s EC-135C fleet, the E-6A was extensively modified. A battlestaff compartment was added, additional communications equipment was installed, and ALCS equipment was installed. Due to these extensive modifications, this new variant of the Mercury was redesignated from the E-6A to the E-6B. Now, whenever a USSTRATCOM battlestaff and ALCS crew are onboard, the E-6B is known as the USSTRATCOM ABNCP.|$|R

40|$|The mechanosensitive {{channel of}} small conductance, MscS, {{is one of}} the most {{extensively}} studied MS channels to date.

5000|$|In the USA, an {{emergency}} stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running {{within the body}} of a railway car would have been what was known as the [...] "communicating cord." [...] This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the [...] "engineer"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a [...] "normal stop" [...] or an [...] "emergency application," [...] at his discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make {{an emergency}} stop. <b>Emergency</b> brake <b>valves</b> were (and still are) always located on the bulkheads (end walls), inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The <b>emergency</b> brake <b>valve</b> is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled [...] "Emergency Only." [...] Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled [...] "signal." [...] Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an <b>emergency</b> brake <b>valve</b> is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately from those of the cars, is evacuated ("dumped" [...] in US jargon), immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a [...] "separation"). No action is required (or even possible) {{on the part of the}} engineer. The train will stop, no matter what he/she does. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the <b>emergency</b> <b>valve</b> has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The <b>emergency</b> brake <b>valve</b> continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations.|$|R

50|$|Each of {{the four}} {{turbines}} is an English Electric Company multi-cylinder impulse reaction machine operating on a single re-heat cycle with terminal steam connections of 158.6 bar (2,300 lbf/in2), 566 degrees Celsius (1051 degrees Fahrenheit) and exhausting at a back pressure of 1.5 in Hg. Steam from the boiler passes through four strainers and two pairs of combines stop and <b>emergency</b> <b>valves,</b> each pair being associated with two throttle valves which regulate admission of steam to the H.P. cylinder inlet belt. The H.P. cylinder comprises eight stages in total. The steam expands through the first five stages towards the governor end and then re-versus its direction and flows between {{the inner and outer}} case to the last three stages. Reversing the steam flow within the H.P. cylinder helps to balance the thrust thus relieving the load on the single thrust bearing. From the H.P. cylinder the steam is fed to the boiler re-heater and returned to the I.P. cylinder through two strainers and two pairs of I.P. <b>emergency</b> <b>valves,</b> each pair of which is associated with a pair of interceptor valves which are attached to the cylinder. The I.P. section of the turbine is double flow with seven stages to each flow. The exhaust steam from the I.P. cylinder is passed to the three L.P. cylinders by cross-over pipes reducing cross sections, which distribute the flow of steam equally to each L.P. cylinder through which it expands to the condenser. Each cylinder is double flow with five stages to each flow. A special feature of the Cottam machines is the radial condenser in which the tube nests are disposed right round the turbine L.P. shafts in a common casing. This reduces the steam velocity in the exhaust space, which together with the reduced losses in the exhaust duct improves the efficiency of the condenser. The weight of the whole structure is some hundreds of tons less than earlier structures, and the foundation block is also greatly simplified, since only a rudimentary structure above basement floor level is necessary under the L.P. turbine.|$|R
