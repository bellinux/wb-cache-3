25|$|The {{lamp housing}} is a metal or plastic {{container}} {{that serves as}} a body for the entire instrument and prevents light from spilling in unwanted directions. It comprises all of the exterior of the fixture except for the lens or opening. The housing may be designed with specific elements that help <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> increase the efficiency of a lamp. Older instruments were made from rolled and machined steel or aluminum. With the advent of the Source Four, many lighting instruments are being made from die cast metal. Die casting allows for one single, light-weight body that is more economical to produce and use. The first lantern to make use of die castings was the Strand Pattern 23 designed by Fred Bentham in 1953, this small mirror spot enjoyed a 30-year production run and found its way into many British schools, halls and theaters. Some instruments are made from plastic, such as the Selecon Pacific.|$|E

30|$|The paper {{analyzed}} double diffusive convection {{induced by}} a horizontal wavy surface {{embedded in a}} porous medium taking the cross diffusion effect into account. The governing parabolic partial differential equations have been solved using the Keller box method. The convergence rate depends on the parametric values chosen. Computations show that the Lewis number enhances mass transfer while <b>reducing</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. The buoyancy ratio enhances both the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer rates. The surface geometry also {{plays a crucial role}} in controlling <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer rates. The effect of the Dufour number is to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> enhance mass transfer. The effect of the Soret number is the exact opposite of the Dufour effect. We observe <b>reduced</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer in the presence of cross diffusion terms.|$|R

AIW cards run at lower clock speeds (two exceptions are the AIW 9600XT/AIW X800XT faster/same speed) than their conventional counterparts to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> power consumption.

The lifetime of the CPU is also extended because of reduced electromigration, which varies exponentially with temperature.|$|E

50|$|Usually {{the reasons}} that might lie behind the desire to {{separate}} the user interface of a computer from the actual computer itself would be: securing computers away from users for corporate or government security, to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> noise in rooms with many computer operators, or to facilitate computer maintenance by placing all computers in very close proximity to one another.|$|E

50|$|It {{would be}} {{feasible}} {{to double the}} local store to 512 KiB per SPU leaving the total die area devoted to the SPU processors roughly unchanged. In this scenario, the SPU area devoted to the local store would increase to 60% while other areas shrink by half.

50|$|The form is a {{resultant}} {{geometry of}} a terraced pitched roof {{sitting on top}} of a rectangular mass. The design approach is relatively simple: a rectangular space accommodates all the programs and a roof to covers the upward opening, while the sun-breakers and openings are made on the façades to <b>reduce</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> increase ventilation in the tropical climate. It could be evident that aesthetics was more or less a secondary consideration for the design and the methodology employed was very functionalistic.|$|E
