5|$|The {{total cost}} of the picture was {{reported}} variously as $935,000 or $1.5 million. Even the lower figure was an exceptionally large amount for the time. To recoup its costs, MGM kept the film in circulation for many years. The <b>running</b> <b>time</b> of the film in previews was 160 minutes. Major cuts were made afterward, however. The final <b>running</b> <b>time</b> for the film was either 117 or 120 minutes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} filming, {{more than}} a million feet of {{negative}} had been used, necessitating significant editing.

Methods: The ultramarathoners competing in the Swiss Alpine Marathon were analyzed in terms of participation, difference in <b>running</b> <b>times</b> between the sexes, age of the fastest runners, and age-related decline in the fastest <b>running</b> <b>times.</b> The race covers a distance of 78 km, with a total altitude change of approximately 2260 m. A total of 12, 194 men and 1781 women finished the race between 1998 and 2011. Results: Women&# 39;s participation increased from approximately 10 % in 1998 to approximately 16 % in 2011 (r 2 = 0. 57; P = 0. 001), but participation remained unchanged in men (r 2 = 0. 17; P &gt; 0. 05). Over the years, the top ten women showed no change in <b>running</b> <b>times</b> (r 2 = 0. 02; P &gt; 0. 05), whereas the top ten men&# 39;s <b>running</b> <b>times</b> increased (r 2 = 0. 46; P &lt; 0. 01). The age for peak <b>running</b> <b>times</b> increased over time both for the top ten women (r 2 = 0. 58; P &lt; 0. 01) and for the top ten men (r 2 = 0. 40; P = 0. 01). Conclusion: Among the top women, participation increased, the age for peak <b>running</b> <b>times</b> increased, and the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> remained unchanged. Among the men, however, the participation remained steady, and both the peak running-time age and the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> increased.

The trains travel duration must respect some constraints, which depend on the railway network. Usually, the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> minimize the trains travel duration on the railway network. They are typically calculated without considering the energy consumption. The green transportation has recently gained significant importance. In this paper, the energy consumption in the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> estimation is taken into account by defining an optimization problem to calculate the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> for the railway timetable definition. This optimization problem finds the <b>running</b> <b>times</b> which minimize the energy consumption. Precisely, an algorithm to handle the optimization problem with the integration platform for multiobjective and multi-disciplinary optimization modeFRONTIER is defined. The algorithm is tested on a case study and the results are validated with the OpenTrack Railway Simulation Tool...|$|R
