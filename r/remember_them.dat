5|$|Judah {{returns to}} his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her {{arranged}} marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> as they were before, so she tells him that they died. This false revelation changes Juda's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race.|$|E
5|$|Sheep can {{recognize}} individual human and ovine faces, and <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> for years. In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. If worked with patiently, sheep may learn {{their names and}} many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. Sheep have also responded well to clicker training. Sheep {{have been used as}} pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the south}} window, the first panel of {{which shows the}} {{archangel}} Michael holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above his head, a seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices {{of women and children}} in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL <b>REMEMBER</b> <b>THEM,</b> taken from the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon. The third panel contains Lady Justice bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a crucifixion pose—representing suffering for both the victors and the defeated—and below her the words JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations. The fourth quadrant shows Joan of Arc bearing a shield and standing before the royal coat of arms of France.|$|E

500|$|Smith's live {{performances}} during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland's Crystal Ballroom expressed concern over his appearance and performance: {{his hair was}} uncharacteristically greasy and long, his face was bearded and gaunt, and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of [...] "memory-loss and butterfingers". At another performance in San Francisco that month, the audience began shouting out lyrics when Smith could not <b>remember</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with many {{noting that the}} episode served as a stop-gap. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Three of a Kind" [...] two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling the episode [...] "likeable and good-natured, and utterly redundant, this passes forty-five minutes pleasantly enough, but you'll be hard pushed to <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> afterwards". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris noted that the episode did [...] "an adequate job, but all in all, this is a filler episode, more substitutes than the real thing".|$|E

Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we’ve got our fingers (and toes!) crossed that it works out for them this time". She said that [...] "with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents and we can’t wait to see them with a little one". Crick {{went on to say}} [...] "while Darren might be dad to twins already (<b>remember</b> <b>them?</b> You could be forgiven for forgetting they even existed – it seems Darren already has!), we think he's got potential to be great daddy material".|$|E
500|$|As {{passengers}} and crew headed to the stern, where Father Thomas Byles was hearing confessions and giving absolutions, Titanics band played outside the gymnasium. Titanic had two separate bands of musicians. One was a quintet led by Wallace Hartley that played after dinner and at religious services while {{the other was a}} trio who played in the reception area and outside the café and restaurant. The two bands had separate music libraries and arrangements and had not played together before the sinking. Around 30 minutes after colliding with the iceberg, the two bands were called by Captain Smith who ordered them to play in the first class lounge. Passengers present <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> playing lively tunes such as [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band". It is unknown if the two piano players were with the band at this time. The exact time is unknown, but the musicians later moved to the boat deck level where they played before moving outside onto the deck itself.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Christgau {{attributed}} the album's success to Saadiq's {{lead role in}} Tony! Toni! Toné! He contended that [...] "only with House of Music did they become true sons of the soul revival, the most accomplished r act of the '90s. That's still the album to <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> by." [...] AllMusic editor Leo Stanley later remarked that the group [...] "successfully accomplish their fusion of the traditional and contemporary... {{within the framework of}} memorable, catchy songs" [...] indebted to both old and modern R songwriting virtues. According to Stanley, the record had an influence on contemporary neo soul artists such as Tony Rich and Maxwell. In Matos' opinion, the album showcased the increasing artistic contrast between Saadiq and Wiggins, which [...] "had grown so pronounced that the tension only enhanced what was already the group's best batch of songs". Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot regarded the record as [...] "a flawless gem" [...] on which the band's [...] "amalgamation of traditional and contemporary styles coalesced beautifully". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Fred Schruers said [...] "House of Music consolidates the triumph of Sons of Soul for a masterpiece of 1990s R, an album that is as steeped in soul tradition as anything by Maxwell or D'Angelo, but that mixes the homage with humor and deft contemporary touches, thereby creating a new space all its own".|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can <b>remember</b> <b>them</b> saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E
