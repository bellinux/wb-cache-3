The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation <b>referrals,</b> the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus.

40|$|Despite {{recommendations}} in clinical practice guidelines, evidence suggests cardiac rehabilitation (CR) utilization following indicated cardiac events is 15 - 20 %. <b>Referral</b> {{strategies such as}} automatic <b>referral</b> have been advocated to improve CR utilization. This Review evaluated the effects of <b>referral</b> strategies on CR <b>referral</b> and enrollment. <b>Referral</b> strategies were categorized as ‘automatic’ based on use of electronic health records or systematic discharge order sets, as ‘liaison’ based on discussions with allied healthcare providers, or ‘other’. The highest rates of CR <b>referral</b> were achieved in studies implementing automatic <b>referral</b> orders, where <b>referral</b> reached 85 %. The highest rates of CR enrollment were achieved {{with a combination of}} automatic and liaison methods (78 % and 86 %). Although there were some null findings, overall results suggest that innovative <b>referral</b> strategies significantly increase CR utilization. Automatic <b>referral</b> methods, such as the ‘Get With the Guidelines’ initiative, show promise for improving <b>referral</b> rates. The additional incorporation of a CR discussion resulted in enrollment rates that are double the rates seen after usual <b>referral.</b> While further investigation is needed, institutions should evaluate their CR <b>referral</b> practice in light of these findings...|$|R

5|$|Cetiosauriscus leedsi: In 1887, John Whittaker Hulke named a {{new species}} of sauropod, Ornithopsis leedsi.

In 1905, Harry Govier Seeley made a suggestion to Arthur Smith Woodward, who took Seeley's advice and renamed O. leedsi, Cetiosaurus leedsi. Woodward also referred an additional specimen to the species, BMNH R.3078. The specimen was mounted and displayed {{for many years in}} the Dinosaur Gallery of the British Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum) in London.

Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on <b>referrals</b> from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E

This study examined {{sex differences in}} CR <b>referral</b> and enrollment by <b>referral</b> strategies; {{and the impact of}} <b>referral</b> strategies for <b>referral</b> and enrollment concordance among women. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: This prospective study included 2635 coronary artery disease inpatients from 11 Ontario hospitals that utilized 1 of 4 <b>referral</b> strategies. Participants completed a sociodemographic survey, and clinical data were extracted from charts. One year later, 1809 participants (452 [25 %] women) completed a mailed survey that assessed CR utilization. <b>Referral</b> strategies were compared among women using generalized estimating equations to control for effect of hospital. Results: Overall, significantly more men than women were referred (67. 2 % and 57. 8 % respectively, p<. 001), and enrolled in CR (58. 6 % and 49. 3 % respectively, p=. 001). Of the retained women, combined systematic and liaison-facilitated <b>referral</b> resulted in significantly greater CR <b>referral</b> (Odds Ratio [OR]= 10. 3, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] = 4. 11 - 25. 58) and enrollment (OR= 6. 6, 95 % CI = 4. 34 - 9. 92) among women when compared to usual <b>referral.</b> Conversely, concordance between <b>referral</b> and enrollment was greatest following usual <b>referral</b> (=. 85), and decreased with <b>referral</b> intensity. Conclusions: While a lower proportion of referred patients enroll, systematic and liaison-facilitated inpatient <b>referral</b> strategies result in the greatest CR enrolment rates among women.

40|$|AIM: Currently only 12 - 30 % of {{individuals}} with {{a high risk of}} Lynch syndrome, the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome, are referred for genetic counselling. We assessed the sensitivity, usability and user experiences of a new online <b>referral</b> test aimed at improving <b>referral</b> of high-risk individuals for genetic counselling. METHOD: Sensitivity was assessed by entering pedigree data from high-risk individuals (i. e. Lynch syndrome mutation carriers) into the <b>referral</b> test to determine whether genetic counselling was recommended. For usability, we assessed nonmedical staff members' ability to determine <b>referral,</b> according to guidelines, in seven fictive clinical cases using the <b>referral</b> test after minimal training. Real-life users answered questions about their experience with the <b>referral</b> test. RESULT: Sensitivity of the <b>referral</b> test was 91 % for mutation carriers with CRC (n = 164) and 73 % for all affected and nonaffected mutation carriers (n = 420). Nonmedical staff members (n = 20) determined <b>referral</b> according to guidelines in 84 % of cases using the <b>referral</b> test. Ten per cent (256 / 2470) of real-life users provided feedback about experiences; of those, 71 % reported that the <b>referral</b> test increased reassurance, certainty about their familial risk and/or certainty about <b>referral.</b> CONCLUSION: The <b>referral</b> test has a high sensitivity in detecting individuals with a high risk of Lynch syndrome and is suitable for use in clinical practice.
