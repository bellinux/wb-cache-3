50|$|The <b>Reverse</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> (Reverse ARP or RARP), like InARP, {{translates}} Layer 2 addresses to Layer 3 addresses. However, in InARP the requesting station queries the Layer 3 {{address of}} another node, whereas RARP {{is used to}} obtain the Layer 3 address of the requesting station itself for address configuration purposes. RARP is obsolete; it was replaced by BOOTP, which was later superseded by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Reverse</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> (RARP) is an {{obsolete}} computer networking protocol used by {{a client}} computer to request its Internet Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a [...] MAC address. The client broadcasts the request, and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request.|$|E

So mainly we are focusing on the attacks like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), Ping of Death, Teardrop, Smurf, Fraggle, TCP-SYN Flood attack.

50|$|The core {{protocols}} {{specified by}} the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in this layer are the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), the <b>Reverse</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> (RARP), and the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), which is a facility delivering similar functionality as ARP for IPv6. Since the advent of IPv6, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is considered to operate on the link level as well, although the IPv4 version of the protocol was considered at the Internet layer.|$|E
50|$|The BOOTP {{was first}} defined in September 1985 in RFC 951 as a {{replacement}} for the <b>Reverse</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> RARP, published in RFC 903 in June 1984. The primary motivation for replacing RARP with BOOTP is that RARP was a link layer protocol. This made implementation difficult on many server platforms, and required that a server be present on each individual IP subnet. BOOTP introduced the innovation of relay agents, which forwarded BOOTP packets from the local network using standard IP routing, so that one central BOOTP server could serve hosts on many subnets.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, the <b>Reverse</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Resolution</b> <b>Protocol</b> (RARP), {{defined in}} RFC 903, was {{introduced}} to allow simple devices such as diskless workstations to dynamically obtain a suitable IP address. However, because it acted at the data link layer it made implementation difficult on many server platforms, and also required that a server be present on each individual network link. RARP was superseded by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) defined in RFC 951 in September 1985. This introduced {{the concept of a}} relay agent, which allowed the forwarding of BOOTP packets across networks, allowing one central BOOTP server to serve hosts on many IP subnets.|$|E
