500|$|Seaborg was {{a member}} of the {{professional}} chemistry fraternity Alpha Chi Sigma. As a graduate student in the 1930s Seaborg performed wet chemistry research for his advisor Gilbert Newton Lewis, and published three papers with him on the theory of acids and bases. Seaborg studied the text Applied Radiochemistry by Otto Hahn, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, and it had a major impact on his developing interests as a research scientist. For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial radioactivity using the Lawrence cyclotron at UC Berkeley. [...] He was excited to learn from others that nuclear fission was possible—but also chagrined, as his own <b>research</b> <b>might</b> have led him to the same discovery.|$|E

[...] The Illinois Conference of the American Association of University Professors also {{sent a letter to the}} university's president stating: [...] "It is entirely illegitimate for a university to deny tenure to a professor out of fear that his published <b>research</b> ... <b>might</b> hurt a college's reputation" [...] and that the association has [...] "explicitly rejected collegiality as an appropriate criterion for evaluating faculty members". In a 2014 interview, professor Matthew Abraham, author of Out of Bounds: Academic Freedom and the Question of Palestine, described the Finkelstein tenure case as [...] "one of the most significant academic freedom cases in the last fifty years", claiming the case demonstrated [...] "the substantial pressure outside parties can place on a mid-tier religious institution when the perspectives advanced by a controversial scholar threaten dominant interests".|$|E

30|$|This {{study and}} the {{corresponding}} inferences should also be interpreted in light of its limitations. Both the LS and QR models are estimated considering variables at student level, hence the multilevel structure of data (i.e. pupils within classes/school) is not taken into account. In fact, future avenues could be to assess how class and school level variables might affect pupils’ performance according to the different levels of ability by adopting a quantile multilevel regression perspective. Furthermore, this study is based on cross-sectional data.
