2500|$|The {{accounting}} treatment of CDS used for hedging may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. [...] For example, GAAP generally require that CDS be {{reported on a}} mark to market basis. [...] In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the income statement and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try {{to account for the}} CDS as a hedge under FASB 133 but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the <b>risky</b> <b>asset</b> owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.|$|E

In particular, we investigate whether the allocation to <b>risky</b> <b>assets</b> is higher for higher valued SMSFs. At this early stage of SMSF research the gathering of facts about these economic entities is necessary to guide policy makers and regulators. This study contributes to this small but growing body of factual knowledge regarding the microstructure of SMSFs in Australia. A cross-classification analysis based on a chi-square test statistic shows that the percentage of the portfolios’ investable funds allocated to <b>risky</b> <b>assets</b> has no clearly defined relationship with portfolio size. Whilst a high net worth SMSF will, on average, have a greater absolute dollar amount invested in <b>risky</b> <b>assets,</b> the portfolio weightings may be such that a high valued fund has a lower percentage of its portfolio invested in <b>risky</b> <b>assets</b> than a much smaller fund. To further test the relationship between fund size and allocations to <b>risky</b> <b>assets,</b> a series of regressions were performed. The results reveal a small tendency for higher net worth SMSFs to bear greater risk through increasing allocations to <b>risky</b> <b>assets.</b> The tendency for larger SMSFs to allocate more investable funds to <b>risky</b> <b>assets</b> is small but detectable by statistical analysis...|$|R

As for those families having such personality and performing influential financial practices,they whould realise their capability in risky investment.
