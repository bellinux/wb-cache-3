5|$|Early 4X {{games were}} {{influenced}} by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> yield among {{corporate}} bond mutual funds. In a low-interest-rate environment, funds may seek {{to invest in}} bonds with relatively higher yields than their benchmarks {{in order to attract}} flows. We show that funds engage in more <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> yield when the level and slope of the yield curve are low and when the default spread is narrow. The funds that engage in <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> yield are also exposed to greater illiquidity, exacerbating redemption risks. Younger and larger funds engage in more <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> yield. When funds actively shift their portfolio towards higher yields, they experience higher inflows, indicating that investors respond positively to this behavior. Funds that engage in <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> yield generate relatively higher returns, but their performance is explained by common risk factors and thus driven primarily by risk-taking rather than skill...|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} quarter, any hope of victory was {{seemingly}} out of <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> Virginia Tech. Three quick plays after the kickoff resulted in a first down before time ran out, but at {{the end of the}} third quarter, Florida State still had a 273 lead.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to also note that images of the family depend upon the specific source in which the image is found {{and the type of}} audience that the source aims to <b>reach.</b> <b>For</b> example, in a women’s magazine such as Good Housekeeping, one can expect to find women in the family portrayed solely as domestic housewives.|$|E

5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.|$|E
5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
5|$|After halftime, the Hokies {{threatened}} Miami for {{the first}} time all game. Virginia Tech mounted an 80-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10. But the Hurricanes' defense clamped down on any further offensive attempts by Virginia Tech and denied the Hokies more points. Miami added twofield goals: one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter that finally put the game out of <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> Virginia Tech. Miami earned the win, 20–10. Miami's win was its first bowl victory since the 1966 Liberty Bowl, which also featured a Hurricanes victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the pit lane {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. A swift stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado {{was able to get}} out ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when he came into the pit lane on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30, due to an issue with his front left wheel. His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 20-yard line, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to Still {{for a first}} down at the Tech 33-yard line. On the next play, Druckenmiller {{completed a}} long pass to tight end Bryan Jennings, who carried the ball 41 yards. Following the play, the Volunteers completed a penalty, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tennessee 22-yard line. Two short runs advanced the Hokies to the 19-yard line, then Druckenmiller completed a 10-yard pass to Freeman for a first down. On the next play, Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> the Hokies.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{struggled}} back in {{the third}} quarter, scoring six unanswered points to close the score to 3516. In the fourth quarter, however, Tennessee answered Virginia Tech's effort with 10points, putting the game out of <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> the Hokies, who managed only a single touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Hokies fumbled the ball five times—losing it once—and threw twointerceptions, allowing Tennessee to cruise to an easy victory, 4523. Tennessee running back James Stewart was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E
5|$|Traditional series {{items such}} as Bombs used for {{demolition}} and the Bow and Arrow for ranged attacks are available as Link progresses through the game, along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle that flies to areas beyond Link's <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> a variety of actions including activating switches; and a whip for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and levers. Link's shield takes damage when blocking attacks fail, and may eventually break. Items and equipment can also be optionally upgraded using materials gathered from defeated monsters and within each overworld environment, making them stronger and more durable. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.|$|E

He {{graduated in}} 1978, {{and was a}} member of Richview Collegiate's team on <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> the Top, a television quiz show for Canadian high school students. Harper enrolled at the University of Toronto but dropped out after two months. He then moved to Edmonton, Alberta, where he found work in the mail room at Imperial Oil. Later, he advanced to work on the company's computer systems. He took up post-secondary studies again at the University of Calgary, where he completed a bachelor's degree in economics in 1985. He later returned there to earn a master's degree in economics, completed in 1991. Harper has kept strong links to the University of Calgary. Harper was the first prime minister since Joe Clark without a law degree.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E
