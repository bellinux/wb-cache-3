5|$|Brad and Tracy Stevens are {{involved}} with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. Brad says that the cause <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer; Smith died {{less than a week}} later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike. That wasn't true, because some of the batsmen showed beyond all doubt that anyone who could <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> the ball could play it away with ease, power, and safety as it rose slowly from the turf.|$|E
25|$|We <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> {{it off and}} {{we would}} go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E

Wouldn't you agree, Betty fans?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Skunk'd" [...] - When a {{guy named}} Skunk comes looking for a bike bizarre enough to impress the members of SCUL (Subversive Choppers Urban Legion), well, you give him what he wants.

500|$|... {{was trying}} to {{encourage}} us to become more active in politics and she said, 'If you leave all the decision-making to others, you might not like what they do, {{and you will have}} no one but yourself to blame.' It was such a challenge to the women in the room. And it <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> me: She's talking to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{believed}} the episode was important developmentally for the series, explaining it was [...] "creatively {{when the show}} <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> its stride in the first season." [...] Jackson continued, [...] "I think right around the midway point of [...] season the show decided what it wanted to be. From about the midway, point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped. After that, it was pretty clear; we introduced the bad guys for the season {{and there was a}} much clearer narrative drive {{through the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
500|$|Today Tonights {{broadcast}} criticised The Chaser's {{approach to}} the APEC event, describing the stunt as [...] " [...] the boundaries yet again". The program quoted Morrow's radio comments about wanting [...] "a stunt that can <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> the headlines across the world" [...] as evidence of irresponsibility. The show also presented Craig Reucassel from The Chaser, responding to questions and claiming that the comedians were [...] "hardly sorry" [...] for their actions. Ironically, the report was made by Dave [...] "Sluggo" [...] Richardson, notorious for his hoax [...] story [...] "In Barcelona Tonight"; but Richardson, unlike The Chaser crew, had not gone through roadblocks in his stunt.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the victory}} over Mathias, Haskins {{returned}} to Bristol {{just two months}} later for his first defence against South African Zolile Mbityi.

500|$|Peter and I usually write very quickly. It's {{usually a}} day or two a song, but for some reason this didn't <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> us as a hit song. We didn't give up on it. We just kept working on it {{over the course of a}} year. Thank God we did. [...] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album. It made me nervous as a writer, because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn't make it in the long run. But the song ended up making the album, which really opened up a lot of doors for me.|$|E
500|$|Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth {{asserted}} that Wilson {{should have been}} credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well. [...] "He hit one in Cincinnati one day", he said, [...] "way up in the seats, hit it so hard that it bounced right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. I {{was sitting in the}} Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren't going to say anything. But Hack <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> 57 that year." [...] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).|$|E
500|$|Tonelli {{continued}} in the United States in 1978, recollecting [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> my straps", reporting that he had swum world records in time trials at training. Because {{he was in the}} United States, he was allowed to qualify for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada by swimming fast times in events in North America. Tonelli raced in five events at the Canada Cup held in Edmonton, winning four. During a drunken party after the competition, Tonelli and some fellow swimmers decided to steal three giant flags from poles in the city centre: those of Canada, the City of Edmonton, and Alberta. In the process, Tonelli fell off the staff and was hospitalised, his arm put in plaster.|$|E
5000|$|Signature of Divine (Yahweh) {{had very}} {{positive}} reviews by professionals. Allmusic said it [...] "has {{its share of}} rich, sweeping gusto". Jesus Freak Hideout also was positive about the song, saying [...] "The record <b>really</b> <b>hits</b> the high note with soaring worship on [...] "Signature of Divine (Yahweh)." [...] It [...] "arguably packs more punch… {{than a lot of}} songs coming from the worship genre today." ...|$|R
5000|$|Giving it a B+, Jon Freeman of Country Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "Kip's {{predominantly}} electric guitar-driven sound…is still intact, {{but this time}} the snare drum cracks like a pistol and there's a banjo plinky-plinking for possibly the first time ever in one of his songs. If there's a downside to this one, it's that the 2:16 run time cuts the tune short right as it's <b>really</b> <b>hitting</b> its stride." ...|$|R
500|$|Braun has {{the ability}} to hit for average and {{significant}} power. His fluid swing is compact and short, with tremendous bat speed and a protracted follow-through. [...] Braun waits well on offspeed pitches, and uses the entire field. He drives the ball, no matter where it is in the strike zone. [...] Brewers hitting coach Jim Skaalen observed: [...] "He's got tremendously quick hands and <b>really</b> <b>hits</b> through the ball. He stays on the ball as well as anyone we've got." ...|$|R
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik. He previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome", and the sixth season episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards". In an interview, Sapochnik spoke about the scenes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which mostly lacked any dialogue, saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of smart and witty dialogue. This is something that Game of Thrones is probably quite famous for and rightly so, but I love non-verbal film making more than anything probably." [...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, this is truly wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to try my hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> the jackpot this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Hiddleston portrayed novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in writer-director Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. He then {{played the}} noble Captain Nicholls in War Horse, a film {{based on the}} 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo, {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg. The same year he starred as Freddie Page, a RAF pilot in the drama The Deep Blue Sea, alongside Rachel Weisz. In 2012, he reprised {{his role as the}} supervillain Loki in The Avengers. While filming a scene with Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, the film's director, Joss Whedon told the fighting duo that the scene did not look real enough, so Hiddleston told Hemsworth to <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> him for the fight scene. [...] "I said to Chris, 'Dude, just hit me. Just hit me because I'm protected here and it's fine.' He's like, 'Are you sure?' I was like, 'Yeah, it will look great. Just go for it.'" [...] He provided the voiceover the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead in 2011 and poetry for iF Poems and The Love Book on iTunes in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E
5000|$|... "This EP {{represents}} everything I am, everything I’ve worked for, {{and everything}} I’m working towards. I’m {{so proud of}} this work, and feel so close to it. I’ve always been a writer and put my heart into every lyric. But this for some reason <b>really</b> <b>hits</b> home. I’ve had some of these songs for a year, and some I’ve written just recently. I hope the passion and love that went into them shines through. Enjoy my first ever solo release!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 1997 Lawrence, Martha, and Wayne {{toured the}} UK. A John Peel Session, {{recorded}} on 20 July, was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 on 7 August. Melody Maker reviewed a show {{and noted that}} [...] "for two {{people to be able}} to create such a huge, rolling epic sound is surprising; what <b>really</b> <b>hits</b> hard is just how huge it can be, how the inarguable and pulverizing beauty of BE's sound simply forces a slacked out crowd into its swell." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 26 November 2014, Coatsworth {{announced}} her intention {{to move forward}} her resignation as President to mid-December 2014, after completing the election in which Andrew Little was elected Party Leader, and starting the party's 2014 review.

500|$|President Obama {{was visiting}} Australia and Indonesia when the {{discovery}} was made. Michelle Obama {{had returned to}} the White House on the morning of November 15, going to sleep shortly after arriving. An usher went to check on her later that day and began talking about the shooting, assuming she already knew about the incident. According to Leonnig, the first lady was [...] "furious", wondering why the director of the Secret Service, Mark J. Sullivan, who had accompanied her on her flight back to Washington, had not told her about it. Leonnig also stated that Sullivan was subsequently summoned to a meeting with the first lady, during which she [...] raised her voice so loudly she could be heard through the closed door. Sullivan disputes this report, though he declined to give any details regarding the conversation. A detailed inspection of the White House for evidence or damage and interviews with key witnesses began later that afternoon. Leonnig also stated that president Obama was angered over the flawed response and the failure to notify the first lady. According to one presidential aide, [...] "the shit <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> the fan" [...] when Obama returned from his travels five days later.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.|$|E

The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> the nail on the head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're all a little insane, but it's so clear now that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it. She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} of Majora's Mask {{is that it}} is not as accessible as Ocarina of Time. GameSpot, which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10/10, gave Majora's Mask an 8.3/10, writing that some might [...] "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place." [...] Game Revolution wrote that it [...] "takes a little longer to get into this Zelda", but also that [...] "there are moments when the game <b>really</b> <b>hits</b> you with all its intricacies and mysteries, and that makes it all worthwhile." ...|$|R

Grainger's brother, harmonica player Mitch Grainger supports her on her cover of Robert Johnson's [...] "C'mon in My Kitchen". Graham Clarke, of Blues Bytes states that the album is [...] "a smooth, sensuous, slow burner of a release, as Kara Grainger shows {{that you can be}} as effective with a whisper as with a scream. This is a marvelous set of soulful blues that <b>really</b> <b>hits</b> home." ...|$|R
500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never <b>really</b> <b>hit</b> her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E
