50|$|In September 1944 <b>Balck</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred}} from 4th Panzer Army in Poland to the Western Front to command Army Group G in relief of General Johannes Blaskowitz in the Alsace region of France. <b>Balck</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to stop}} the Allied advance under General George S.

50|$|Methyl red (2-(N,N-dimethyl-4-aminophenyl) azobenzenecarboxylic acid), {{also called}} C.I. Acid Red 2, is an {{indicator}} dye that turns red in acidic solutions.

Methyl <b>red</b> <b>is</b> a pH indicator; it <b>is</b> <b>red</b> in pH under 4.4, yellow in pH over 6.2, and orange in between, with a pKa of 5.1. Murexide and methyl <b>red</b> <b>are</b> investigated as promising enhancers of sonochemical destruction of chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants.

50|$|Bromopyrogallol <b>red</b> <b>is</b> protonized in 1 M H2SO4 {{solution}} and changes gradually to its ionized forms in alkaline solution. In its neutral form, bromopyrogallol <b>red</b> <b>is</b> bipolar ion, containing a protonized carbonyl group {{as well as}} a dissociated sulfonate group. Through testing at isobestic points, it has been determined that bromopyrogallol <b>red</b> <b>is</b> a stronger acid than Pyrogallol Red. In the presence of ammonia salts, the bathochromic shifts increase. The hydrophilic group on the ammonia salts also change the dissociation of the reagent to be used with bromopyrogallol red to a more acidic region.|$|R
40|$|Different {{groups of}} pigeons {{were trained to}} respond to red and not to green with and without errors (responses to green) under a free operant procedure, in which {{responding}} to <b>red</b> <b>was</b> intermittently reinforced, and under a trial procedure in which all responses to <b>red</b> <b>were</b> reinforced. The response to <b>red</b> <b>was</b> then extinguished under a procedure in which the discriminative stimuli were successively alternated as during discrimination training. The performances of those birds that learned the discrimination without errors under the trial procedure were seriously disrupted during extinction; the birds persistently responded to green for the first time. The performances of those subjects that learned the discrimination without errors under the free operant procedure were not disrupted during extinction. In a second experiment, the same discrimination was trained without errors under a trial procedure in which the response to <b>red</b> <b>was</b> intermittently reinforced. Extinction did not disrupt discrimination performance. Thus, errorless discrimination performance was shown to remain intact during extinction {{so long as the}} response to <b>red</b> <b>was</b> intermittently reinforced during discrimination training...|$|R
50|$|<b>Balck</b> <b>was</b> a POW and {{remained}} in captivity until 1947. He declined {{to participate in}} the US Army Historical Division's study on the war. After the war Balck found employment as a depot worker. In 1948 he was arrested for murder for the execution of artillery commander Lieutenant-Colonel Johann Schottke. The incident in question occurred while Balck served as commander of Army Group G on the western front. On 28 November 1944 near Saarbrücken, Schottke's unit had failed to provide its supportive artillery fire upon its target area. When searched for he was found drunk on duty. Balck held a summary judgment, and Schottke was executed by firing squad. The sentence and execution were conducted without the ordained military tribunal. <b>Balck</b> <b>was</b> found guilty and sentenced to three years. He served half of this sentence before being granted early release.|$|R
