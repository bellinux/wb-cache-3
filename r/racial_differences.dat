5|$|Wade {{writes that}} along with the ongoing social {{evolution}} that occurred after humans left Africa, the human physical form also continued to evolve. This {{is the subject of}} chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths. Race is not well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races – Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises that <b>racial</b> <b>differences</b> may have an influence on sporting achievement. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants – such as Proto-Indo-European – possibly spread through agriculture. By citing linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} the performativity of <b>racial</b> identities and <b>difference</b> at a southern US high school. I utilize Butler’s performativity theory along with geographic theories of race, <b>racial</b> <b>difference,</b> and racism {{to argue that}} teenage girls reinstate <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> through their everyday spatial practices. The paper has two substantive sections {{in addition to the}} introduction and the conclusion. The first explores the segregated high school lunchroom. Here I examine two girls’ narratives and suggest that these girls encounter the spatiality of <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> in the lunchroom and repeat the practices of segregated sitting. Thus, they reinscribe racialized difference and identity through their spatial practices of sitting with same-race friends. The second substantive section focuses on girls’ practices of identifying others’ racial identities. In this section I argue that these identifications are spatialized and that <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> and categorization are achieved through spatial policing and boundary making. Throughout the paper I argue that racial identity and <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> are performative, but that performativity must account for the normative spatiality of social and racial practice. ...|$|R

Whereas Muly Mahamet is defined by vague racial stereotypes in keeping with early modern racial ideology, Othello's <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> is solely defined (radicalised by a treacherous Iago) by the colour of his skin, and many characters in the later play exhibit their own racial stereotypes through their astonishment at Othello's contradicting them.|$|R

25|$|This poem {{is a clear}} {{description}} of Martí’s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and <b>racial</b> <b>differences.</b> This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{males with}} 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} exhibit signs of continued undervirilization {{in a number}} of domains. Facial hair was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of Dominican males with the condition. However, more facial hair has been observed in patients with the disorder {{from other parts of the}} world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that of other men in the same communities. The divergent findings may reflect <b>racial</b> <b>differences</b> in androgen-dependent hair growth. A female pattern of androgenic hair growth, with terminal hair largely restricted to the axillae and lower pubic triangle, is observed in males with the condition. No temporal recession of the hairline or androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type II deficiency that have been reported, whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males. Individuals with 5α-reductase type II deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of acne, but subsequent research indicated normal sebum secretion and acne incidence.|$|E
25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but <b>racial</b> <b>differences</b> in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E

The {{analysis of the}} discursive practices of the past helps to understand the present tenacious investment in notions of <b>racial</b> <b>difference.</b> This thesis examines the construction of Maori, Melanesian and Aboriginal peoples {{in the writings of}} Jean Devanny. Western texts which are informed by the [impossible] need to become indigenous, attempt to incorporate the indigenous character as an "other-within". Where no conflict regarding indigenisation exists, such tension is minimised and the indigene remains a more distant other. In Devanny's New Zealand novels, the attempt to incorporate Maori as "one of us" is subverted by essentialist constructions which assign to them a fixed, irreducible otherness. In the Australian text, <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> is acknowledged and deployed to challenge the prejudice which such difference generates. Additionally, this text offers an exploration of the colonial processes which assign a group identity on the basis of <b>racial</b> <b>difference...</b>|$|R
25|$|Births have {{declined}} for three consecutive years, {{and are now}} 7% below the peak in 2007. This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011. Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions. This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly {{stems from the fact}} that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history. In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007. The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009. Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations. <b>Racial</b> <b>differences</b> prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Shockley became {{intensely}} {{interested in}} questions of race, human intelligence, and eugenics. He thought {{this work was}} important to the genetic future {{of the human species}} and he came to describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing his views damaged his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization. With regard to <b>racial</b> <b>differences</b> he used the following standard statement, e.g., on a debate with Afro-centrist Frances Welsing and on Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.:My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.Shockley's published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund. Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{however, the}} Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and {{moved from the}} liberalist to neoliberalist {{point of view of}} how to deal with {{imperial}} possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard the rights of the natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat. With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order. This was due to the assumption that subjects of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation to educate them in the sphere and set an example. The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding <b>racial</b> <b>differences</b> which could not weaken it. This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, something {{that a large number of}} Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} quarter-century, {{immigration}} from Asia and Latin America has brought tremendous {{changes to the}} American racial landscape, most especially {{a rise in the}} U. S. ’s multiracial population – those born to parents of two or more different races. Most studies on multiracial individuals have focused on their racial identities, yet few have examined their personal relationships (e. g. families, friends, romantic partners), the most racially segregated of social interactions. This dissertation utilizes the exemplar case of Filipinos in the U. S. to examine whether multiracial individuals, as products of interracial relations, perceive <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> as a fading or enduring impediment in their familial, friendship, and romantic relations. Through focused, life story interviews with over 60 multiracial adults born to Filipino/non-Filipino relationships in two U. S. regions, this dissertation reveals that multiracial respondents expressed two primary narrative orientations toward <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> in their personal relationships: 1) reconciliation and 2) discordance. First, approximately three-quarters of respondents saw <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> as not an impediment that fades or endures but as a compatible part of their closest relationships. They “presented” this seemingly counter-intuitive claim through telling reconciliation narratives, in which <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> transformed from a liability to an asset. Second, roughly one-quarter of respondents held more ambivalent stances. These respondents were exposed to counter-narratives in college (e. g. courses) that highlighted enduring gender and racial inequalities (e. g. sex work industry) and led them to tell discordant narratives, in which they felt they could neither fully embrace nor entirely reject the possibility of close, interracial relationships. Finally, three male respondents saw race as not playing a significant role in their closest relations. These outlier respondents denied race’s significance through gendered negation strategies that enabled them to present their personal lives as stable and changeless. This dissertation illustrates that, while <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> still persists as an obstacle in many multiracial individuals’ closest relations, members of a growing subset of the U. S. multiracial population – those born to Filipino/non-Filipino relationships – are refashioning traditional understandings of <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> in their personal relationships beyond only an obstacle that endures or fades but also something that can serve a valuable, compatible role...|$|R

However, {{the contributions of}} anthropometric, socioeconomic, nutritional, and environmental factors to this difference are unknown. From participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994), the authors selected 1, 462 healthy nonsmoking children (623 White and 839 African-American) aged 8 – 17 years. The African-American children were taller and heavier but had lower lung function. African Americans were poorer and had lower levels of the antioxidant vitamins A and C and α-carotene. The authors performed regression analyses using data on anthropometric, socioeconomic, and nutritional factors and smoke exposure. Adjustment for sitting height explained 42 – 53 % of the <b>racial</b> <b>difference.</b> Socioeconomic factors and antioxidant vitamin levels accounted for an additional 7 – 10 %. Overall, the authors could account for only 50 – 63 % of the <b>racial</b> <b>difference.</b> Exposure to tobacco in the home was weakly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second in girls, accounting for 1 % of the difference.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} legal construction {{and development of}} <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> as considered in literature written or set during {{the final years of}} American slavery. While there had consistently been a conceptual correspondence between black skin and enslavement, race or <b>racial</b> <b>difference</b> did not become the unqualified explanation of enslavement until fairly late in the institution’s history. Specifically, as slavery’s stability became increasingly threatened through the nineteenth century by abolitionism and racial slippage, race became the singular and explicit rationale for its existence and perpetuation. I argue that the primary discourse of this justificatory rationale was legal: through law race and its meaning was finally determined. However, as there was not a substantial body of legal texts, such as legislation and judicial opinions, defining race prior, legal determinations of race during this brief and tumultuous period ultimately produced race in service of slavery. To frame and understand these legal issues, my dissertation turns to nineteenth-century American literature. Because of the elusive nature of <b>racial</b> <b>difference,</b> literature provides a means to reflect upon and critique the law’s complicity in producing race. I begin with an overview of the difficulty of understanding and defining race as a concept, as well as the reasons why and when race became definitive of American slavery. I then turn to Frederick Douglass’s My Bondage and My Freedom (1855) which explores how race came to signify wrongdoing as a consequence of race-based slavery. I then discuss how knowledge of <b>racial</b> <b>difference,</b> characterized by its uncertainty, was stabilized by gender. As considered in Lydia Maria Child’s 1867 novel, A Romance of the Republic an individual’s uncertain racial identity was legally determined by recourse to his or her mother’s. The next chapter examines Mark Twain’s Pudd’nhead Wilson, published in 1894, which refutes the very existence of a <b>racial</b> <b>difference,</b> suggesting its legal existence is arbitrarily produced for the purposes of slavery. Finally, I conclude with a consideration of the limits of, and unexplored issues raised by, this project...|$|R
