5|$|The case {{attracted}} commentary by two contemporary writers. John of Salisbury, who was {{a secretary}} for Theobald, added information about Osbert {{in a letter to}} Alexander III on unrelated business. In the section of the letter, John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about Osbert, he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent. Another contemporary, Gilbert Foliot, who was Bishop of Hereford, wrote to the pope to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> although Osbert's accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal, this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
25|$|Despard has atoned for his {{previous}} {{ten years of}} evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts {{that he has done}} no wrong yet, they <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Uma tackles {{the raging}} {{conflict}} between Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan. She scans his expenses and <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Ammaiyappan does not charge rent. She also <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> of his filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Kannamma reminds Ammaiyappan {{that his family}} is all he has, {{and that he should}} think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Chidambaram and Ammaiyappan are finally reconciled.|$|R

25|$|Wakka {{lost his}} younger brother Chappu to Sin {{a year before the}} events of Final Fantasy X, and he never fully {{recovered}} from it. He forms a close brotherly relationship with Tidus, partially fueled by his resemblance to Chappu, though Lulu constantly has to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Tidus is not Chappu. As a devout follower of Yevon's teachings, Wakka believes that anyone who does not believe in Yevon, like the Al Bhed, are evil heathens, and is staunchly against the use of machina. However, he begins to question both his faith by the time Yevon's true colors are exposed to the world. Near the game's ending, Wakka denounces his prior beliefs entirely.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E
25|$|Its story {{focuses on}} the trials of a young cop named Charlie, played by Geoffrey Kennedy, who at the {{beginning}} receives a phone call summoning him for what is presumably his first job. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of him standing next to his older brother Brian, played by Brian Krause, {{who is also a}} cop. The film then begins playing the song “Spore” as Charlie joins his brother and a third cop as they enter a residence where they find a dead girl and arrest two thugs, one played by Todd La Torre, as they return to the scene with a bag full of money. The second thug lunges at Brian when he pilfers some of the cash but Charlie restrains him. Later, the chief of police, played by R.J. Adams, is seen looking through a window as the second thug is telling a detective to just ask Charlie about what Brian did during the bust. The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well and picks up the phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged at his brother for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E

50|$|Finally, Uma tackles {{the raging}} {{conflict}} between Prakash and Appala Narsaih. She scans his expenses and <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> costs are actually reduced when items are obtained in larger quantities. She also <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Appala Narsaih does not charge rent. She also <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> of his filial responsibilities. In the meantime, Chilakamma reminds Appala Narsaih {{that his family}} is all he has {{and that he should}} think of his children and grandchildren as his legacy and not his adversaries. Prakash and Appala Narsaih are finally reconciled.|$|R
500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Molotov's power began to decline. A clear sign of Molotov's {{precarious}} position was {{his inability to}} prevent the arrest in December 1948 for [...] "treason" [...] of his Jewish wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, whom Stalin had long distrusted. Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> in his own words, [...] "she suffered because of me".|$|E
500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. I wish I could call a waitress 'honey'." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{wakes up}} Bart to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> her {{birthday}} is nearing, {{and that he}} forgets it every year. [...] Bart promises to get her a present this year. [...] Meanwhile, Homer discovers that all of his white shirts have turned pink because Bart put his red hat in with the laundry. [...] Homer {{has no choice but}} to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. [...] Mr. Burns suspects him of being a [...] "free-thinking anarchist". [...] Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity. [...] Homer is too lazy to finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. [...] When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. [...] Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is Michael Jackson (referred to as [...] "the big white guy who thinks he's the little black guy"), and who introduces himself as such. [...] Being unfamiliar with the real Michael Jackson, Homer believes and quickly befriends him.|$|E

[...] He {{added that he}} had spoken with President Barack Obama {{on the day before}} about watching the show, but that he [...] "forgot to e-mail and <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it was on", so he could not tell whether Obama had seen the segment.|$|E
2500|$|Duc Tran Van, who {{was seven}} {{years old at the time}} of My Lai {{massacre}} and now resides in Remscheid, Germany, called the apology [...] "terse".

2500|$|A running gag in {{the series}} is Raj portraying himself as having come from humble origins and growing up in poverty in India, only for his friends to <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> his father is a gynaecologist, drives a Bentley (which he protests was a [...] "lease"), and had {{servants}} (although he protests on one occasion that there were only four servants, and that {{two of them were}} children). In the episode [...] "The Wiggly Finger Catalyst", Sheldon reveals that Raj's family is wealthier than he lets on. He observes that they are [...] "Richie Rich rich", which he explains is [...] "halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{anticipation}} of his later {{theories of the}} Oedipus complex, Freud suggests that Claudius has shown Hamlet [...] "the repressed wishes of his own childhood realized" [...] (his desire to kill his father and take his father's place with his mother). Confronted with this image of his own repressed desires, Hamlet responds with [...] "self-reproaches" [...] and [...] "scruples of conscience, which <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he himself is literally {{no better than the}} sinner whom he is to punish". Freud goes on to suggest that Hamlet's apparent [...] "distaste for sexuality", as expressed in his conversation with Ophelia (presumably in the 'nunnery scene' rather than during the play-within-a-play), [...] "fits in well" [...] with this interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 February 2008, {{news reports}} {{stated that the}} IAEA report on Iran's {{compliance}} with the August 2007 work plan would be delayed over internal disagreements over the report's expected conclusions that the major issues had been resolved. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated that he would meet with IAEA Director Mohammed ElBaradei to convince him to [...] "listen to the West" [...] and <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the IAEA is merely {{in charge of the}} [...] "technical side" [...] rather than the [...] "political side" [...] of the issue. A senior IAEA official denied the reports of internal disagreements and accused Western powers of using the same [...] "hype" [...] tactics employed against Iraq before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to justify imposing further sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.|$|E

When she asks how he's returning to the city before going to Chicago, Ted says that he'll take the train. Ranjit picks up Robin and Barney at their apartment. Marshall calls Lily and she <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> in a week, they'll be living in Italy. When Marshall's brother Marcus <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he hasn't told her about the job, Marshall says that it is [...] "face to face" [...] news.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Viviendo", {{the poet}} {{is in the}} city, walking in the {{twilight}} surrounded by the hum of traffic. [...] The poet feels part of a machine that is slowly ticking away time. [...] He reaches {{the realization that the}} individual can die without the machine either slowing or stopping, regardless of whether the individual has completed his part of the work of that machine. [...] As time goes by, the sight of tables on a café terrace <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> there is after all a human component to this machine. [...] The conclusion that emerges is again resignation to the inevitability of death but there is no sense of consolation, merely an unconvincing stoicism of a man journeying from nothingness to nothingness. [...] It is a very different feel to [...] "A vista de hombre".|$|E
