50|$|The said type of {{gate valve}} {{is having a}} <b>{{rotating}}</b> <b>member</b> inside a rotating valve chamber wherein {{the center of the}} valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the <b>rotating</b> <b>member.</b> Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the <b>rotating</b> <b>member</b> & the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.|$|E

The direct current electromagnet field winding on the rotor (<b>rotating</b> <b>member)</b> use superconductors but the alternating current multiphase winding set on the stator (stationary members), which have no practical support by superconductors, uses conventional, normal conduction copper conductors. Often the stator conductors are cooled to reduce, but not eliminate, their resistive losses.|$|E

50|$|ARF is a {{variable}} speed rotary feeder {{for bulk materials}} that works {{in harmony with the}} natural flow of the material being fed. The ARF, using a <b>rotating</b> <b>member</b> and articulable gate, controls the volume of material flow based on the material's inherent angle of repose. The speed of rotation and the positioning of the articulable gate provides a consistent feed of your material. Drum rotation allows the material to be gently fed without retarding material flow, while minimizing surge loading, product degradation, dust generation and maintaining uniformity of material flow.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to reports}} in {{respected}} national newspapers, the US envoy Bruce P. Jackson was the architect behind both {{the letter of}} the eight and the Vilnius letter. He arranged a meeting in the Lithuanian embassy in Washington, where the foreign ministers of all ten countries participated. The text had been proposed in advance, but according to the press reports it was Jackson who convinced the participants to accept the proposal and to disregard efforts by Bulgaria [...] - [...] then a <b>rotating</b> <b>member</b> of the UN Security Council [...] - [...] to alter the text. Since the early 1990s, Jackson had been an informal advisor to central European governments, advising them on the road to admission into NATO. He allegedly now convinced the foreign ministers of the Vilnius ten, that their support for the US in this international conflict would give them much better chances in the US Congress when it was to vote on accepting those countries into NATO.|$|E
50|$|These {{mechanisms}} {{were found}} in some types of synchronous-motor-driven electric clocks. Many different types of synchronous clock motors were used, including the pre-World War II Hammond manual-start clocks. Some types of self-starting synchronous motors always started when power was applied, but in detail, their behaviour was chaotic and they were equally likely to start rotating in the wrong direction. Coupled to the rotor by one (or possibly two) stages of reduction gearing was a wrap-spring clutch-brake. The spring did not rotate. One end was fixed; the other was free. It rode freely but closely on the <b>rotating</b> <b>member,</b> part of the clock's gear train. The clutch-brake locked up when rotated backwards, but also had some spring action. The inertia of the rotor going backwards engaged the clutch and wound the spring. As it unwound, it restarted the motor in the correct direction. Some designs had no explicit spring as such—but were simply compliant mechanisms. The mechanism was lubricated and wear did not present a problem.|$|E
