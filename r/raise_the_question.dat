25|$|A 1994 {{article in}} Neurology {{suggests}} Mozart {{died of a}} subdural hematoma. A skull believed to be Mozart's was saved by the successor of the gravedigger who had supervised Mozart's burial, and later passed on to anatomist Josef Hyrtl, the municipality of Salzburg, and the Mozarteum museum (Salzburg). Forensic reconstruction of soft tissues related to the skull reveals substantial concordance with Mozart's portraits. Examination of the skull suggested a premature closure of the metopic suture, which has been suggested {{on the basis of}} his physiognomy. A left temporal fracture and concomitant erosions <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of a chronic subdural hematoma, which would be consistent with several falls in 1789 and 1790 and could have caused the weakness, headaches, and fainting Mozart experienced in 1790 and 1791. Additionally, aggressive bloodletting used to treat suspected rheumatic fever could have decompensated such a lesion, leading to his death.|$|E
25|$|That Heidegger did {{not write}} this second part of Being and Time, and that the existential {{analytic}} was {{left behind in the}} course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of individual experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the collective human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time. There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking about being in relation to place and space, and to the notion of dwelling, with connections too to architectural theory as impacted by phenomenology.|$|E

500|$|The {{cladistic}} {{analysis by}} Sellés and Galobart in 2015 supported an ornithischian parentage. Late Campanian to early Maastrichtian ornithischians from Southwestern Europe {{are restricted to}} rhabdodontids and the nodosaurid Struthiosaurus. When Sellés and Galobart analyzed the pelvises of Rhabdodon (the largest known rhabdodontid) and Struthiosaurus, they found that Rhabdodon could not have laid eggs as big as Cairanoolithus. On the other hand, even though Struthiosaurus was relatively small, the unique orientation of its ischia would have easily allowed it to lay eggs {{as large as a}} [...] cairanoolithid egg. However, interpreting Cairanoolithus as the eggs of a nodosaur does <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of why Cairanoolithus or similar eggs have not been found in areas with a greater nodosaur abundance.|$|E
500|$|In March 1968, having {{received}} {{no response from}} the SACA to Griffith's letter, the MCC asked Alec Douglas-Home to intervene. Douglas-Home, a former British Prime Minister and then the Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, had just finished his term as MCC president and was visiting Rhodesia and South Africa; he agreed to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of D'Oliveira during a meeting with Vorster {{that was part of}} his itinerary. Douglas-Home believed {{that the best way to}} deal with apartheid was through dialogue and that contact between the countries should be increased, not reduced—as he described it, [...] "precept and example must be better than ostracism". When he met Vorster, Douglas-Home was reluctant to press him for an unequivocal answer, but discussed D'Oliveira. He also sounded out other figures in South Africa and returned to England to tell the MCC, in the words of the cricket writer E.W. Swanton, that [...] "if D'Oliveira were to be chosen the odds were 5/4 on his being allowed in".|$|E
500|$|British novelist Justin Cartwright, {{who wrote}} the book The Song Before It Is Sung {{about one of the}} plot's conspirators, wrote, [...] "The film is true to most of the facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and {{political}} vortex into which Germans were being drawn." [...] Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, who was disenchanted with the Nazis. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden ("poets and heroes"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: [...] "He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing." [...] The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a [...] "troublesome cop". Cartwright also noted that the film did not <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded.|$|E

500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{is noted}} both for its song and its {{accompanying}} music video, {{both of which}} are considered feminist odes to freedom. As author María José Coperiás Aguilar wrote in her book Culture and Power, the release of the song was in context of the anti-feminist or the [...] "backlash" [...] ideology dominant in the U.S., since the rise of the [...] "New Right" [...] in the 1980s and the government of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Aguilar went on to explain that the 1980s and the 1990s were characterized by a conservative reaction against the ‘excesses’ of the 1960s and 70s. This reaction was channeled mainly by the media's strong attacks against feminism, generally describing activists as [...] "tortured people with hairy legs", [...] "radical, bitter, man-hating, separatist and lesbian", accompanied by messages advocating a feminization of women that turned them into beautiful ornamental objects, and tended to increase the cultural differences between the sexes. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] appeared as a refutation of some of these reactionary premises. The title, Aguilar noted, seemed to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the urgency of a feminine voice to develop and emerge—a concern that recalled the tradition of French feminists like Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, The Journal of Sexual Medicine held {{a debate}} {{for both sides}} of the G-spot issue, {{concluding}} that further evidence is needed to validate the existence of the G-spot. In 2012, scholars Kilchevsky, Vardi, Lowenstein and Gruenwald stated in the journal, [...] "Reports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth." [...] The authors cited that dozens of trials have attempted to confirm the existence of a G-spot using surveys, pathologic specimens, various imaging modalities, and biochemical markers, and concluded:The surveys found that a majority of women believe a G-spot actually exists, although not all of the women who believed in it were able to locate it. Attempts to characterize vaginal innervation have shown some differences in nerve distribution across the vagina, although the findings have not proven to be universally reproducible. Furthermore, radiographic studies have been unable to demonstrate a unique entity, other than the clitoris, whose direct stimulation leads to vaginal orgasm. Objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for the existence of an anatomical site that could be related to the famed G-spot. However, reliable reports and anecdotal testimonials of the existence of a highly sensitive area in the distal anterior vaginal wall <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether enough investigative modalities have been implemented in the search of the G-spot.|$|E
