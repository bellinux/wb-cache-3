I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope {{you will not be}} there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{only means}} {{which have been}} placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those {{restrictions}} upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, & to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I {{do not have to}} <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> every man has the right to have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E

500|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} are two important themes in Little Busters!. The opening {{video of the}} visual novel starts with two lines written in English: [...] "What 'Adolescence' do you have?" [...] and [...] "Do you remember 'Childhood'?". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented {{in the form of}} Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, [...] "The irreplaceable one existed there," [...] though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters! Ecstasy: [...] "This will <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you have to recollect 'Adolescence'." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{called it}} [...] "metaphorically ambivalent". Barbara Jaeger of The Bergen Record called Clayton's bassline [...] "ominous". Stokes {{described}} it as [...] "the antithesis of [...] bright, ringing, optimistic, inspirational selves, it was dirty, loud, discordant, repetitive, noisy, black. If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad, then it was effective". Graham said [...] "'Exit' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the nice guys of rock. Never had they shown such a vicious streak or produced such a withering track.... Far more than even 'Bullet the Blue Sky', [...] playing is scratching at the prison bars of polished good taste", describing it as the wild card of the album. Author John Luerssen contrasted it {{to the rest of}} the band's catalogue, saying [...] "Unlike most of the songs U2 had written up to this point, 'Exit' lacked any optimism." [...] Hot Press contributor Colm O'Hare felt the claims by Bardo evoked memories of Charles Manson's use of [...] "Helter Skelter", and contained [...] "even more sinister shades" [...] of the death of John Lennon. In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond argued it was [...] "awkward enough to <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|As vice {{chairman}} of the Revolutionary Command Council, al-Douri was involved in the wars against Iran and Kuwait. During the 1988–1989 Al-Anfal Campaign, al-Douri was said to have ordered Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka 'Chemical Ali') to use Mustard and Sarin nerve gas on Kurdish fighters in Halabja. He was complicit in the invasion of Saudi Arabia and the attack on the town of Khafji in January 1991. During the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, he was involved in the suppression of the revolt led by the Iraqi marsh Arabs. When the Kurds rebelled again in 1991, al-Douri warned them [...] "If you have forgotten Halabja, I would like to <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we are ready to repeat the operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey {{reviewed}} the NES game in 1UP.com's official Retro Gaming Blog. He wrote {{that it had}} the same problems that Bart vs. the Space Mutants had, such as [...] "lousy jumping physics", and that it [...] "also manages to strip away the novelty that made the original Simpsons NES game worth checking {{out in the first}} place. The sequel is a straight-up, cookie-cutter platformer without any real Simpson-y touches to satisfy fans of the show; Bart finds himself wandering through generic side-scrolling levels, with a Simpsons character showing up every now and then to <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this is an actual licensed product and not just a ROM hack." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2011, FAO and {{its members}} {{countries}} officially recognized global freedom from the deadly cattle virus. On this day, the FAO Conference, the highest body of the UN agency, adopted a resolution declaring the eradication of rinderpest. The resolution also called on the world community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and vaccines be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for disease surveillance and reporting be applied. [...] "While we are celebrating {{one of the greatest}} successes for FAO and its partners, I wish to <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> this extraordinary achievement {{would not have been possible}} without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments, the main organizations in Africa, Asia and Europe, and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions", FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf commented.|$|E
