5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E

5000|$|NRB is India's largest {{needle and}} {{cylindrical}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> producer headquartered in Mumbai. NRB was incorporated in 1965 as an Indo-French venture with Nadella and pioneered {{the production of}} needle <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> in India. Its eight manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand produce needle <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> special ball bearings, thrust bearings and other anti friction solutions such as planetary shafts and pins.|$|R
50|$|The needle <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{business}} {{was part of}} the broader Torrington acquisition Timken made in 2003. The business had approximately 3,400 associates and manufactured highly engineered needle <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> including an extensive range of radial and thrust needle <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> as well as bearing assemblies and loose needles, for automotive and industrial applications.|$|R
50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R
25|$|This {{metallic}} {{bearing support}} may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on soft ground.

40|$|Distribution of {{loads and}} contact stress {{has a great}} {{influence}} on fatigue life of bearings. In {{view of the fact}} that the nonload area is ubiquitous in cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> there is a method for prolonging the fatigue life design by adjusting the working clearance of cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> In this article, optimization model of fatigue life of cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed with a quasi-dynamic method and calculated method of bearing life based on micro-area contact, considering the effect of assembly interference, temperature rise, and high-speed centrifugation. Aiming to the different geometry parameters and operating parameters of bearings, the effects of assembly interference on bearing fatigue life are discussed. The results show that the optimum fatigue life of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is achieved at negative working clearance with the loads distributed evenly within half ring. The optimum working clearance of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is not influenced by radial load. But with the increase in pitch diameter or decrease in rolling elements, the optimum assembly interference increases, and accelerating revolution of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> will increase the optimum assembly interference as well...|$|R
25|$|The Northern Pacific {{purchased}} Timken 1111 {{called the}} Four Aces, the first locomotive built with roller bearings, in 1933. The Northern Pacific renumbered it 2626 and classified {{it as the}} sole member of locomotive Class A-1. It was used in passenger service in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana until 1957 when it was retired from active service and scrapped at South Tacoma, despite attempts to preserve the locomotive.

United Motors also acquired at this time the original Remy corporation (called the Remy Electric Company), a competitor of Delco. In 1918 General Motors bought United Motors. Various entities {{grew out of the}} original Delco and Remy, including the Dayton Metal Products Corporation, the General Motors Research Corporation, the Delco Division and Remy Electric Division of GM, Delco Remy (now Remy International, Inc.), ACDelco, Delco Electronics, and others.

25|$|A {{swaging machine}} works by using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a <b>roller</b> <b>bearing).</b> The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} stage, the {{bearings}} of Structures 1 through 5 were repaired. The heavily polluted <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were completely replaced.

40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} method is adopted to analyze the pre-loaded {{cylindrical}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> according {{to the theory of}} contact mechanics. The effects of hollow ratio on the radial stiffness of bearings, the maximum contact stress of rollers, and the maximum radial load of bearing are analyzed. The analysis results show that the smaller the hollowness is, the larger the radial stiffness of pre-loaded cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> the maximum contact stress of the rollers, and the maximum radial load of the bearing would be. Under different magnitude loads, the reasonable combination of interference magnitude with the hollowness can not only increase the stiffness of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> but also decrease the maximum stress of rollers, which provides a reference for the design and manufacture of pre-loaded cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{station on}} Low Island was {{established}} 1874. A recommendation {{for the construction}} of a permanent lighthouse was made in February 1876 by Commander George Poynter Heath, the first Portmaster of Queensland and the Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board, Commander George Heath, in a letter to the Colonial Treasurer. While the recommendation was accepted for immediate action, the preparation of plans for the lighthouse was delayed from an unknown reason and tenders were called in March 1877. The contract, for £3,195, was awarded in May 1877 to W. P. Clark, who already constructed Queensland's first lighthouse since the separation, Bustard Head Light, in 1868, and who was later to be awarded the contracts for Cape Cleveland Light and Dent Island Light (1878), Double Island Point Light (1884) and Pine Islet Light (1885). Clark committed to completing the lighthouse and cottages in seven months, starting in June 1877. Constructed commenced in Brisbane in July 1877 and by December 1877 the lighthouse was being moved to Low Island. Construction completed by August of that year and light was finally displayed on 17 September 1878. The lens was a Chance Brothers 3rd order (500mm focal length) revolving dioptric supported by a <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> pedestal and the characteristic mentioned was [...] "attains its greatest brilliancy every minute", with visibility of [...] The tower was painted white.
