2500|$|Birds: The {{reserve is}} home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are {{considered}} rare at the national level. More than 22 species have been confirmed to be resident, the rest are migratory or rare visitors, {{and at least two}} or three species have been introduced. The reserve holds a combination of birds found in Europe, Africa, and Asia which include: chukar (Alectoris chukar), Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius), blackbird (Turdus merula), common raven (Corvus corax), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), shore lark (Eremophila alpestris), common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), common chaffinch, (Fringilla coelebs), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Petronia petronia), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). [...] Two species at least have been introduced to the shouf area for hunting and expanded their range into the reserve, the two species are: rock partridge (Alectoris graeca), and common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus).

50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Petronia petronia) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. This sparrow breeds on barren rocky hills {{from the}} Iberian peninsula and western north Africa across southern Europe and through central Asia.

5000|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between the roles of both parents in the Iberian <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows.</b> The female incubates the eggs 11-14 days before they hatch. Then, the female feeds the offspring while the male teaches them to fly and leave the nest usually within only 18 days of birth. The male also feeds the offspring a little less than half the time, easing the burden on both parents. <b>Rock</b> <b>sparrows</b> mostly bring one food item per trip and other times guard the nest. It was commonly observed how this species comes to the nest to guard their young when they are not bringing food, often as a prevention tactic to scare off predators. <b>Rock</b> <b>sparrows</b> raise their heads to display their yellow patch and make a noise when guarding.

5000|$|Bi-parental care is {{the most}} common form in birds, {{especially}} in passerines. A mating pair equally contributes to feeding and guarding the offspring. It occurs in approximately 85% of bird species. The hatchling benefits from the mutual care at the cost of the parents' future reproductive success. Each parent tries to find a mate who will not desert the nest and has high qualities that showcase their parental skills (e.g. ornamental cues). The good parent hypothesis states that birds can invest more energy towards their own survival rate by choosing an ideal mate.Evolution in potential mates to advertise their parental strengths through ornamental cues (e.g. a yellow chest patch in Iberian <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows)</b> are based on the differential allocation hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the bigger the ornamental cue a mate has, the more investment is put towards the offspring. As a result of bi-parental care, the offspring are usually stronger than birds who are only cared for by one parent in Iberian <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows.</b> (Vicente García-Navas) ...|$|R

50|$|Visual stimuli {{are also}} used in male-male competition. In <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows,</b> {{elaborate}} feather ornamentations are {{the best predictor of}} dominance in foraging groups.

50|$|The latter {{four or five}} {{species are}} quite often {{separated}} in a genus Pyrgilauda, based on different vocalizations and ecological preferences. Similarly, the white-rumped snowfinch is occasionally placed in a monotypic genus Onychostruthus. But the evidence is equivocal; though the proposed three lineages of snowfinches seem indeed to be distinct (and can be split), {{it is not at}} all certain that the snowfinches are not a monophyletic group (where splitting would become necessary). Thus, without conclusive evidence that Montifringilla sensu lato is paraphyletic with its closest relatives - the petronias (or <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows,</b> Petronia) and the pale rockfinch (Carpospiza brachydactyla) -, Onychostruthus and Pyrgilauda are usually lumped with Montifringilla to avoid maintaining three small or monotypic genera.|$|R
50|$|The male {{to female}} ratio {{has an effect}} on the type and amount of care provided. With an {{increase}} in available mates in some birds (such as the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow),</b> female desertion rate increases leading to more mono-parental care. When female rock sparrows were exposed to an abundant amount of male mates approximately 50% of the females deserted their first nest when the hatchlings were on average 14.3 days old. The fathers successfully took over all parental duties (Pilastro).|$|E
50|$|In {{most of its}} range, the Spanish sparrow occurs {{alongside}} the house sparrow. In such areas, both species breed in farmland and open woodland, with the Spanish sparrow preferring moister habitats. In areas where house sparrows are absent, the Spanish sparrow may live in urban habitats, as in the Canary Islands, Madeira, and some Mediterranean islands. In a few urban areas, {{such as those in}} eastern Sardinia, the primary sparrow species is the Eurasian tree sparrow. Before the Spanish sparrow arrived in the Canary Islands and Madeira, the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> was the sole native sparrow. In the Canaries, the Spanish sparrow occurs in most habitats, having ousted the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> from all but the driest localities. In Madeira the Spanish sparrow is common in cultivated areas, but it has not fully adapted to nesting in buildings or breeding in the drier north of the island. The Spanish sparrow is not common on most of the Cape Verde islands, due to the presence of the endemic Iago sparrow, and the house sparrow on São Vicente. On Fogo, where it is the sole species of sparrow, it is common in all habitats, breeding both in the houses of São Filipe and on the cliff walls of the volcano Pico do Fogo.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{positive}} correlation between ornamental cues and the parental care invested in Iberian <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Vincente Garcia-Navas). Males show more parental effort if their female mate has a larger yellow chest patch. Also, larger nestlings belonged to those who had males with larger yellow chest patches. There is also a connection between a larger yellow breast patch and higher parental effort but only from the males. Males who mated with females with a bigger yellow chest had a higher rate of visiting their offspring. Bigger males bred later and fed their young more than their smaller counterparts. Larger males are not in a hurry to mate because they are in better condition and can weigh their options. (Rikón, Amanda Garcia Del) ...|$|R
50|$|The family Passeridae was {{introduced}} (as Passernia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. Under the classification {{used in the}} Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) main groupings of the sparrows are the true sparrows (genus Passer), the snowfinches (typically one genus, Montifringilla), and the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Petronia and the pale rockfinch). These groups are similar to each other, and are each fairly homogeneous, especially Passer. Some classifications also include the sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser) and several other African genera (otherwise classified among the weavers, Ploceidae) which are morphologically similar to Passer. According to a study of molecular and skeletal evidence by Jon Fjeldså and colleagues, the cinnamon ibon of the Philippines, previously {{considered to be a}} white-eye, is a sister taxon to the sparrows as defined by the HBW. They therefore classify it as its own subfamily within Passeridae.|$|R
50|$|The very {{attractive}} and unreachable Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) lives at high altitudes. Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) breeds in this area.

Red-fronted serin (Serinus pusillus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), snow finch (Montifringilla nivalis), <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Petronia petronia), rock bunting (Emberiza cia) and horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) are native; in winter {{they come to the}} lower hill sides. In each spring wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), rock thrush (Monticola saxatilis), and nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) come from Africa for breeding.

5000|$|Japanese bush warbler {{songs from}} island populations have an acoustically simple {{structure}} {{when compared to}} mainland populations. Song complexity is correlated {{with higher levels of}} sexual selection in mainland populations, showing that a more complex song structure is advantageous in an environment with high levels of sexual selection. Another example is in purple-crowned fairywrens; larger males of this species sing advertising songs at a lower frequency than smaller rival males. Since body size is a characteristic of good health, lower frequency calls are a form of honest signaling. Negative correlation between body size and call frequency is supported across multiple species within the taxa. [...] In the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow,</b> song frequency is positively associated with reproductive success. Slower song rate is associated with age and is preferred by females. Reproductive status of the individual is communicated through higher maximum frequency. There was also positive correlation between age and extra pair copulation frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Mammals: Mammal explorations in Lebanon {{were limited}} until {{around the middle}} of the twentieth century. They are fragmentary and {{provided}} little information on the mammals inhabiting the country. Many species and sub-species were not yet recorded for Lebanon till the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1985, Tohmé, G. and Tohmé, H. alone produced 33% of the known published papers on the Lebanese mammals. The only documented data of the mammals of Al-Shouf Cedar Reserve apparently appeared in the report of Tohmé, H. that was prepared, on behalf of the Protected Areas Project at the Ministry of Environment, in 1999 by the NCSR. This report, which was based on inventory and surveys as well as brochures and other documents developed by the managing team of the reserve, produced a list of 32 mammals which include: wild boar (Sus scrofa), gray wolf (Canis lupus [...] ), beech marten (Martes foina), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica), wild goat (Capra aegagrus), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Middle East blind mole-rat (Nannospalax ehrenbergi) Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), wild cat (Felis silvestris), Cape hyrax (Procavia capensis). The reserve launched a project to reintroduce the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) to the area from Jordan, after it was extinct in the mid-twentieth century. The reserve was most probably home to the Anatolian leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) which are extinct now in Lebanon. The aurochs (Bos primigenius) may have existed in the area in the middle ages as well.Birds: The reserve is home to 200 species of birds, of which 19 are considered rare at the national level.

40|$|Social {{network theory}} {{provides}} a perfect tool {{to better understand}} the population-level consequences of how individuals interact and make their decisions; however, this approach is generally overlooked among evolutionary biologists interested in social relationships. Here, we used social network analysis to examine the patterns of leader-follower interactions in relation to individual characteristics in foraging groups of free-living <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Petronia petronia). We found that yellow feather ornamentation, a carotenoid-based trait, was the best predictor of leadership: birds with bigger ornaments exerted greater influence in the foraging groups and were followed by more group-mates than less elaborate individuals. An individual’s tendency for eliciting followings was not influenced by sex, condition or the level of parental investment. None of the above individual characteristics had significant effect on the tendency of individuals to follow others. Our results indicate that a sexually selected trait can also {{play a significant role in}} group coordination and social organization of a species...|$|R
50|$|Some urban {{species have}} a {{cosmopolitan}} (i.e. nonselective) distribution, {{in some cases}} almost global. They include house mice, cockroaches, silverfish, black rats, brown rats, house <b>sparrows,</b> <b>rock</b> doves, and feral populations of domestic species.|$|R
40|$|Albeit {{there is}} growing {{evidence}} that males prefer to mate with ornamented females, {{it has been suggested}} that the production of costly ornaments may reduce female fecundity, hence favoring males with a preference for females with average ornamentation. In the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow,</b> Petronia petronia, males and females possess a sexually selected patch of yellow feathers on the breast (a carotenoid-based trait). To test whether males prefer females with the largest ornament or average ornamented females, male rock sparrows were simultaneously faced with 3 conspecific females differing in breast patch size and a female house sparrow as a control. We found that the house sparrow and <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> female with the smallest patch were least preferred, and males showed a clear proximity preference for the females with the above average [...] sized patch. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to theoretical predictions, a directional preference for female ornament was observed. Directional male preference may arise as consequence of a male's sensory bias or may be associated with indirect (genetic) benefits of choosing ornamented females, if ornament size is correlated with female genetic quality. Clearly, more work is necessary to identify the conditions under which directional preference for female ornament arises. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that female ornaments in birds not only are genetic correlates of selection on males but may also have evolved by selection acting directly on females. However, most evidence comes from studies in captivity and it is therefore still debated whether male choice is important under natural conditions. The <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow,</b> Petronia petronia, is a monomorphic passerine in which both sexes show a yellow breast patch, although females have a smaller patch than males. Breast patch in females is positively correlated with body mass and fecundity (number of broods per year). We tested whether males preferentially mate with more ornamented females in this species. We examined male mate choice by reducing {{the size of the}} yellow breast patch of free-ranging females during the pair formation period in a colony in southeast Spain. We found that females with an experimentally reduced breast patch were courted less intensely and chased less frequently, than control females were. Furthermore, females with an experimentally reduced ornament were less likely to mate and, when mated, did so at a significantly later date than controls. These results are supported by correlational observations from another <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> population, for which a larger data set was available, showing that pairs mated assortatively with respect to breast patch size. Altogether; these results therefore suggest that female ornamentation may be sexually selected in this species...|$|E
40|$|Each {{parent has}} limited {{resources}} {{to invest in}} current reproduction, so each parent would benefit if its mate did more of the work, which generates a sexual conflict between parents. Parental care behaviour is an adaptive decision, involving trade-offs between remating (and consequently desertion of the brood) and continuing parental effort. The <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow,</b> Petronia petronia, is an unusual species in which brood desertion can occur in both sexes. Consequently, the <b>rock</b> <b>sparrow</b> is a good species to investigate the behavioural response of parents to the desertion by their mates and whether sexual difference in this response exists. We compared parental effort of pair members divided into three groups: pairs that cooperated, females that deserted the brood and males that deserted. During the period of biparental care, females fed offspring more often than males, {{but there were no}} differences among the three groups. Following desertion the total amount of care in biparental, female-only and male-only broods differed, because both sexes adjusted their care to the absence of their mates, but females overcompensated the mate's absence while males only partially compensated. Nestling survival rate was positively correlated with feeding rate and the mean survival rate was lower in the male-only broods. We suggest that both parents, in a negotiation process, would benefit from withholding parental investment, as proposed in recent theoretical models on sexual conflict over parental care. Altogether our results show an unexpected plastic response of parents to care during the desertion process...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that moult speed affects plumage quality. In many bird species, {{males and females}} differ in terms of breeding effort, survival expectation {{and the relationship between}} fitness and plumage quality. Consequently, differences in moult strategies between the sexes can be expected. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether, under simulated time constraints and with no parental investment in the previous breeding season, males and females differed in: a) timing and duration of primary moult, b) growth rates of individual primary feathers, and c) number of concurrently growing feathers. We investigated the effect of time constraints generated by a treatment consisting of two decreasing photoperiods (slow changing photoperiod, SCP= 2 min day- 1 and fast changing photoperiod, FCP= 8 min day- 1) on the primary post-nuptial moult of captive <b>rock</b> <b>sparrows</b> Petronia petronia. Females started to moult on average 14 and 15 days later than males in both experimental groups. Primary moult duration was 10 (FCP) and 24 (SCP) days longer in males than in females, and, within sex, 34 (females) and 48 (males) days longer in SCP birds than in FCP ones. Females renewed a larger number of primaries simultaneously (5. 7 % in FCP and 12. 8 % in SCP) and had a higher total daily feather mass grown (9. 9 % in FCP and 22. 4 % in SCP), even though daily growth rates of individual primaries did not differ between sexes. As a result, males and females completed their primary moult at the same time within treatment. The observed differences in timing, duration and energy allocation for primary moult between the sexes probably have a genetic basis, as birds did not engage in reproduction during the preceding breeding seaso...|$|R
