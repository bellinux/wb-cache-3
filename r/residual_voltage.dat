50|$|Termination can be passive or active. Passive {{termination}} {{means that}} each signal line is terminated by two resistors, 220 Ω to TERMPOWER and 330 Ω to ground. Active termination {{means that there}} is a small voltage regulator which provides a +2.85 V supply. Each signal line is then terminated by a 110 Ω resistor to the +2.85 V supply. Active termination provides a better impedance match than passive termination because most flat ribbon cables have a characteristic impedance of approximately 110 Ω. Forced perfect termination (FPT) is similar to active termination, but with added diode clamp circuits which absorb any <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> overshoot or undershoot. There is a special case in SCSI systems that have mixed 8-bit and 16-bit devices where high-byte termination may be required.|$|E

This model has a wide rangeability and its effectiveness is good for both medium- and high-voltage arresters.

40|$|Abstract. The {{additive}} of Al(NO 3) 3 {{has been}} doped into ZnO varistors {{in order to}} reduce their <b>residual</b> <b>voltages.</b> However, the leakage currents of samples always increase at the same time. Generally, it is recognized that some of doped Al 3 + ions enter the ZnO grains and reduce their resistivity, which results in lower <b>residual</b> <b>voltages</b> of varistor samples. On the other hand, the remnant Al 3 + ions appear in the grain boundaries and also reduce their resistivity, which results in larger leakage currents. In this paper, the electrical properties of ZnO varistor samples with various amounts of Al(NO 3) 3 dopant were measured. The experimental data are compared with the numerical simulation results, which reveals that the increased leakage currents of ZnO varistors with Al(NO 3) 3 dopant are not only due to the decreased resistivity of grain boundaries, but also the increased donor density of ZnO grains...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{categories}} of transient suppressors: a) those that attenuate transients, thus preventing their propagation into the sensitive circuit; and b) those that divert transients away from sensitive loads and so limit the <b>residual</b> <b>voltages.</b> Attenuating a transient, that is, keeping it from propagating away from its source or keeping it from impinging on a sensitive load is accomplished with filters inserted in series within a circuit. The filter, generally of the low-pass type, attenuates the transient (high frequency) and allows the signal or power flow (low-frequency) to continue undisturbed.

40|$|Metal Oxide surge arresters {{are used}} to protect medium and high voltage systems and {{equipment}} against lightning and switching overvoltages. Measurements of the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> of the metal oxide surge arrester indicate dynamic characteristics, and specifically, the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> increases as the current front time descends and the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> reaches its maximum before the arrester current reaches its peak. For these reasons, the metal oxide surge arresters cannot be modeled by only a non-linear resistance, since its response depends on the magnitude {{and the rate of}} rise of the surge pulse. Several frequent dependent models have been proposed, in order to simulate this dynamic frequency-dependent behavior. In the current work three modes - IEEE, Pinceti-Gianettoni and Fernadez-Diaz - are examined using PSCAD.

However, the energy efficiency of ADCs is degraded by scaling up transistor widths in the building blocks for high speed, thus increasing the impact of intrinsic parasitics.

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made in hydrogen, nitrogen, helium and neon on amolification of a stream of {{electrons}} crossing a parallel plate spark gap under the influence of combined ultra-high-frequency (40 mc/sec) and unidirectional electric fields. Electrons generated thermionically inside one of the electrodes are injected into the gap through cylindrical holes in the flat face of the electrode, and cross the gap with a motion which is a fixture of drift and diffusion. At high enough values of the effective field in the gap, the electrons ray gain sufficient energy to produce ionization by collision. A theory is presented to explain the shape of the curves relating the amplification of the stream to the value of the applied uhf field for a given value of the do field (AMPLIFICATION CURVES).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the statistical characterization {{of the performance of}} power systems in terms of voltage dips (sags). It presents a method named voltage dip estimation that extends monitoring results to buses not being monitored. Statistical dip characterization of power networks is essential to decide about mitigation methods as well as for regulatory purposes. Statistics on voltage dip may be obtained by means of 1) monitoring of the power supply, and/or 2) stochastic assessment of voltage dips. Monitoring is expensive and requires long monitoring periods. Stochastic assessment is a simulation method that combines stochastic data concerning the fault likelihood with deterministic data regarding the <b>residual</b> <b>voltages</b> during the occurrence of faults. The method of fault positions is used in this work to assess the dip performance of an existing power system. An alternative analytic approach to the method of fault positions that addresses the question of the suitable number of fault positions is proposed. It is shown that despite being able to provide a description of the long-term expected performance of the network, the method of fault positions cannot predict the performance during a particular year. Comparisons of pseudo measurements with the prediction via the method of fault positions show discrepancies and therefore the need for adjustment. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is proposed to better describe the performance of the network, and an optimal monitoring program is suggested to accomplish the adjustment of the method of fault positions. An integer optimisation model is introduced {{in order to determine the}} optimal number and location of monitors, so that every fault triggers at least a given number of power quality meters. The results of the monitoring program are then used to perform voltage dip estimation, adjusting the stochastic assessment and extending monitoring results to non-monitored buses.
