40|$|Background: Oocyte {{donation}} {{and assisted}} reproductive technology (ART) give women with ovarian failure, advanced reproductive age, inheritable disorders or recurrent implantation failure, {{the ability to}} conceive. The success of oocyte donation is reportedly influenced by multiple parameters of the oocyte donor <b>and</b> <b>recipient.</b> The <b>objective</b> {{of this study was}} to evaluate the donor <b>and</b> <b>recipient</b> variables affecting the outcome of oocyte donation. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 51 oocyte donation cycles of 45 women in an in vitro fertilization clinic. Data collected included age, body mass index, endomet-rial thickness, cycling <b>and</b> gravidity of <b>recipients</b> <b>and</b> the age of donors. Results: The clinical pregnancy rate was 40 % per <b>recipient</b> <b>and</b> 35 % per cycle resulting in 9 singleton, 7 twin and 2 triplet gestations. Embryo implantation rate was 27 %. Oocyte fertilization rates among patients who had become impregnated and those who had not were 75 % and 79 %, respectively of 18 pregnancies, 15 culminated in a live birth (33 % live birth rate). There was no significant relationship between incidence of pregnancy and mean age, BMI, gravidity, cyclicity of <b>recipients</b> <b>and</b> age of donors. There was a significant difference between the endometrial thickness of patients who became pregnant and those who did not (p= 0. 048). The number of transferred embryos was positively associated with pregnancy (p= 0. 006). Conclusion: The factor that most reliably predicts the outcome of oocyte donation cycles is oocyte recipient endometrial thickness. Donor age from 20 - 34 years dose not affect clinical pregnancy rates. Donors in their early 30 's are considered to be the best candidates for oocyte donation...|$|R

40|$|This paper (i) {{traces the}} {{historical}} origins of foreign aid, (ii) investigates tren­ds in the volume, composition, allocation {{and quality of}} aid flows, and (iii) reviews the empirical literature on aid allocation. The paper concludes that, historically, aid has served a multitude of objectives. For some donors, the allocation and quality of aid have been largely shaped by concern for the development needs of recipients. By contrast, the foreign aid of some larger donors has been used principally as a foreign and commercial policy tool. Yet while this particular character of aid flows may well have impaired the effectiveness of aid, there is no automatic contradiction between donor <b>and</b> <b>recipient</b> <b>objectives.</b> Perhaps the most important change in the aid picture is the reversal after 1992 of the historic upward trend in aid volumes. This {{may not be a}} problem when smaller aid flows are compensated by private flows, as has happened in several developing countries. Yet it may be a problem in low-income countries without access to private capital, which continue to rely on aid for financial resources. The underlying premises of donor-recipient cooperation are very different when aid resources become more limited, especially when debt service is still a factor of significance. The need to keep <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> rationales clear turn out to be even more important. Foreign Aid; Aid Allocation...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Non-reciprocal trade {{preferences}} and {{provisions in the}} GATT/WTO that allow developing countries greater leeway to retain or use protectionist policies {{are two of the}} central planks of so-called special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries in the multilateral trading system. This paper surveys the literature on the rationales, institutional features, and economic effectiveness of SDT. A large literature has emerged on SDT in the last 50 years, by both proponents and opponents. We summarize a number of key contributions on the subject, with a special emphasis on the evaluation of the impact of SDT, especially preferential market access. The issue of SDT has become very topical again, following a period during which it was viewed as an outdated concept for the multilateral trading system. We therefore devote attention as well to a number of recent contributions that discuss (i) whether there is a continued need for SDT, and (ii) how this might be designed from both a development (<b>recipient)</b> <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> {{from the perspective of the}} trading system more generally. A major theme of the survey is that most of the issues that are debated today were already being discussed in the 1960 s. We conclude that those who questioned the value of unilateral preferences have proven to be prescient...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} informal caregivers' {{attitudes toward}} respite care. Method: Interviews with informal caregivers during open-house support groups (three) for informal caregivers, conducted late 2004 at Informal Care Support Centres {{in the city}} of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A Q-methodological study was conducted. Informal caregivers were asked to rank-order 39 statements regarding motivation for providing informal care; supporting capacity; physical, psychological, practical, financial, relational and social obstacles; subjective burden; need for support; experienced support; and propensity and impediments to make use of respite care. In addition, respondents explained their Q-sort in writing and completed a questionnaire regarding characteristics of the caregiver, the care <b>recipient,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective burden of their care giving situation. Individual Q-sorts were analysed using PQMethod 2. 11 (statistical method factor analysis with a varimax rotation). Objective of Q-analysis was to reveal a limited number of corresponding ways the statements were sorted. For the factors identified, composite sorts were determined. Factors were interpreted and described using the composite sorts, differences and similarities in rank value of statements between factors and the explanations by respondents. Results: We found three distinct groups of caregivers: informal caregivers who need and ask for respite care, those who need but won't ask for respite care, and those that do not need respite care. Caregivers in the first two groups experience substantial burden, while those in the third group enjoy sufficient support and appear to manage pretty well. Caregivers {{in the second and third}} group derive considerable satisfaction from care giving. On balance, caregivers in the first two groups would sometimes rather have someone else take over their task. The first group feels misunderstood and undervalued by health and welfare organisations and has problems obtaining respite. The desire for respite of caregivers in the second group is not unambiguous, affected by care recipient resistance against respite. Conclusions: Respite care programmes should target caregivers in the first two groups. Regarding the second group, effort should be directed to both caregiver <b>and</b> care <b>recipient.</b> They need to be convinced that it is in their mutual interest to make the care giving task manageable in the long run, because they report serious burden from care giving coupled with a resistance to respite care. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
