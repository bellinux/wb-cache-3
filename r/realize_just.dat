25|$|The Assemblies of God has {{its roots}} in the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves forced outside existing religious bodies. These people sought out their own places of worship and founded hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations. By 1914, many ministers and laymen alike began to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how far-reaching the spread of the revival and of Pentecostalism had become. Concerned leaders felt the desire to protect and preserve the results of the revival by uniting through cooperative fellowship.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN {{was pleased with}} the series' return, and praised the [...] "drama, treachery, tension, romance, and best of all, the diabolical deliciousness that is Cheerio coach Sue Sylvester." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "A-". He felt that [...] "Hell-O" [...] had [...] "clumsy moments" [...] but overall found it [...] "a vastly enjoyable hour of television, reintroducing a show that's starting to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how far it can go." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Marvel debuted {{a second}} trailer for Ant-Man. Mendelson {{said it was}} [...] "frankly the Ant-Man trailer that we've been waiting for. It's not just funny and exciting, it's an 'Ah ha!' moment when we <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> what exactly an Ant-Man movie has to offer." [...] Also in April, {{miniature}} billboards promoting Ant-Man with battery-powered LED lights began appearing in Melbourne, Brisbane and other areas around Queensland, Australia {{as part of a}} street marketing campaign for the film. The next month, Marvel, in partnership with Dolby Laboratories, Visa, and Raspberry Pi, announced the [...] "Ant-Man Micro-Tech Challenge", aimed at females aged 14 through 18, to create DIY projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials. Winners teamed with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects. In June, Marvel released posters featuring Ant-Man juxtaposed with Iron Man's armor, Captain America's shield, and Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Mendelson compared this to Disney's marketing campaign for Lilo & Stitch that put the protagonist into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons. A six-minute IMAX preview of the film began screeing before showings of Jurassic World, and scenes from the film were shown at Disney California Adventure's Bug's Life Theater in 3D with in-theater effects.|$|E

500|$|... "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was generally, {{though not}} universally, well {{received}} among critics. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "easily the best 30 Rock of the season, {{and one of the}} series' best episodes to date". He complimented Robert Carlock for [...] " [...] in on the narcissistic worldview" [...] of the Dennis character as it [...] "cranked those qualities up to appropriately absurd 30 Rock proportions." [...] In addition, Sepinwall wrote that all of the elements featured in the episode [...] "all came together". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was similarly laudatory, writing that it was [...] "one of the most explosively hysterical and imaginative half hours of TV this season, and one of this show's best episodes ever". Time contributor James Poniewozik was favorable to the episode, observing that it was [...] "asily the funniest 30 Rock in months, and probably the whole season." [...] Poniewozik said it [...] "nailed it, from the too-many-good-jokes... to the sweet heart at the center of each character." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Adam West's cameo, but noted that Tracy's plot [...] "felt awfully shticky and sitcommy to me." [...] He opined that [...] "Apollo, Apollo" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] for Jane Krakowski's Jenna, and in conclusion, Rabin said [...] "I had initially pegged this episode as good but not great and essentially minor {{in the grand scheme of}} things but while writing this post I came to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how much of it I loved. 30 Rock is pretty great even when it's not that great." [...] Rick Porter, a contributor for Zap2it, said he [...] "loved" [...] the episode, writing that it made [...] "perfect sense" [...] for Kenneth to see everyone around him as muppets, and noted that Liz's commercial was a [...] "strong ending" [...] to the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Einstein {{also did}} not at first realize how radical Bose's {{departure}} was, and in his first paper after Bose he was guided, like Bose, {{by the fact that}} the new method gave the right answer. But after Einstein's second paper using Bose's method in which Einstein predicted the Bose–Einstein condensate (pictured left), he started to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how radical it was, and he compared it to wave/particle duality, saying that some particles didn't behave exactly like particles. [...] Bose had already submitted his article to the British Journal Philosophical Magazine, which rejected it, before he sent it to Einstein. It is not known why it was rejected.|$|E

2500|$|One of Wilson's {{earliest}} memories {{was hearing}} Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his {{development as a}} composer. He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt when you listen to my music. I don't think people <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E

60|$|Lady Harman {{was still}} {{in a state of}} amazement at the altered {{prospects}} of her hostels when the day arrived for the formal opening of the first of these in Bloomsbury. They made a little public ceremony of it in spite of her reluctance, and Mr. Brumley had to witness things from out of the general crowd and <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how completely he wasn't in it, in spite of all his efforts. Mrs. Pembrose was modestly conspicuous, like the unexpected in all human schemes. There were several reporters present, and Horatio Blenker who {{was going to make a}} loyal leader about it, to be followed by one or two special articles for the Old Country Gazette.|$|E
60|$|The men {{remained}} grouped amidships. No one {{had gone}} below, {{and no one}} was speaking. Nor were any looks being exchanged. Each man seemed stunned—deeply contemplative, as it were, and, not quite sure, trying to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> what had taken place. Wolf Larsen gave them little time for thought. He at once put the Ghost upon her course—a course which meant the seal herd and not Yokohama harbour. But the men were no longer eager as they pulled and hauled, and I heard curses amongst them, which left their lips smothered and as heavy and lifeless as were they. Not so was it with the hunters. Smoke the irrepressible related a story, and they descended into the steerage, bellowing with laughter.|$|E

Tom saw abundance of men,--great, burly, gruff men; little, chirping, dried men; long-favored, lank, hard men; and every variety of stubbed-looking, commonplace men, who pick up their fellow-men as one picks up chips, putting them into the fire or a basket with equal unconcern, according to their convenience; but he saw no St. Clare.|$|E

60|$|Marriage {{regarded}} in the abstract--that is to say, with Mr. Magnet out of focus--was by {{no means}} an unattractive proposal to her. It was very much {{at the back of}} Marjorie's mind that after Oxbridge, unless she was prepared to face a very serious row indeed and go to teach in a school--and she didn't feel any call whatever to teach in a school--she would probably have to return to Hartstone Square and share Daffy's room again, and assist in the old collective, wearisome task of propitiating her father. The freedoms of Oxbridge had enlarged her imagination until that seemed an almost unendurably irksome prospect. She had tasted life as it could be in her father's absence, and she was beginning to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> what an impossible person he was. Marriage was escape from all that; it meant not only respectful parents but a house of her very own, furniture of her choice, great freedom of movement, an authority, an importance.

60|$|That was not {{the first}} time General Triscoe had silenced {{question}} of his opinions with the argument he had used upon Eltwin, though he was seldom able to use it so aptly. He always found that people suffered, his belief in our national degeneration much more readily when they knew that he had left a diplomatic position in Europe (he had gone abroad as secretary of a minor legation) to come home and fight for the Union. Some millions of other men had gone into the war from the varied motives which impelled men at that time; but he was aware that he had distinction, as a man of property and a man of family, in doing so. His family had improved as time passed, and it was now so old that back of his grandfather it was lost in antiquity. This ancestor had retired from the sea and become a merchant in his native Rhode Island port, where his son established himself as a physician, and married the daughter of a former slave-trader whose social position was the highest in the place; Triscoe liked to mention his maternal grandfather when he wished a listener to <b>realize</b> <b>just</b> how anomalous his part in a war against slavery was; it heightened the effect of his pose.|$|E
