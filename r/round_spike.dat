5000|$|Although the {{validity}} of Stegosaurus longispinus was disputed because the long dermal spines {{were likely to be}} a product of ontogeny or sexual dimorphism, the amateur freelance paleontologist Roman Ulansky decided that the long tail spines were sufficient to remove S. longispinus from Stegosaurus and place it in a new genus, [...] "Natronasaurus". Ulansky interpreted [...] "Natronasaurus" [...] as a close relative of Kentrosaurus in accordance with the hypothesis of Olshevsky and Ford (1993). Ulansky published the name in a self-published electronic publication that was not archived by an independent organization nor had an ISSN. This renders the name [...] "Natronasaurus" [...] invalid, and Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter gave the genus another name, Alcovasaurus, in 2016, as part of a revision of the species. Galton and Carpenter also referred a very large <b>round</b> <b>spike</b> base to the species, found by Cliff Miles in Wyoming in the 1990s. Its present location is unknown but a cast was made with inventory number DMNH 33431.|$|E

40|$|Dual {{intracellular}} recordings in the CA 1 {{region of}} adult rat hippocampal slices and biocytin filling of synaptically connected cells {{were used to}} study the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited in basket (n= 7) and bistratified interneurones (n= 7) by action potentials activated in simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells. Interneurones could be subdivided according to their electrophysiological properties into classical fast spiking, burst firing, regular spiking and fast spiking cells with a <b>rounded</b> <b>spike</b> after-hyperpolarization. These physiological classes did not, however, correlate with morphological type. EPSPs were not recorded in regular spiking cells. Average EPSP amplitudes were larger in bistratified cells (range, 0. 5 – 9 mV) than in basket cells (range, 0. 15 – 3. 6 mV) and the probability of obtaining a pyramidal cell-interneurone EPSP was also higher for the bistratified cells (1 : 7) than for the basket cells (1 : 22). EPSP 10 – 90 % rise times in bistratified cells (0. 7 – 2 ms) and their widths at half-amplitude (3. 9 – 11. 2 ms) were slightly longer than in basket cells (rise times, 0. 4 – 1. 6 ms; half-widths, 2. 2 – 9. 7 ms). The majority of these EPSPs (6 of 8 tested) increased in amplitude and duration with postsynaptic depolarization, although in two (of 4) basket cells the voltage relation was conventional. All EPSPs tested in both basket (n= 7) and bistratified cells (n= 5) decreased in amplitude with repetitive presynaptic firing. The average amplitudes of second EPSPs elicited within 15 ms of the first were between 34 and 94 % of the average amplitude of the first EPSP. Third and fourth EPSPs in brief trains were further depressed. This depression was associated {{with an increase in}} the incidence of apparent failures of transmission indicating a presynaptic locus...|$|R

40|$|During the 1998 - 2001 {{vegetation}} seasons, {{the investigations}} on pollen efficiency and insect visitation of Malope trifida flowers were carried out. The flowering period of Malope lasted, in the climatic conditions of Lublin, {{from the middle}} of July till late September. One flower blooms for 2. 5 - 5. 0 days, whereas the staminate phase lasts 1. 5 - 2. 0 days. In one flower, there are 125. 3 - 148. 1 stamens, which constitute staminal tube surrounding the multilocular pistil. Pollen release starts in the flower bud stage, just before petal opening. Pollen grains are large and <b>round</b> with <b>spiked</b> exine. The diameter of pollen grains reaches on average 80. 37 µm (78. 33 - 82. 41 µm). The mean pollen efficiency reached 16. 81 mg per one flower, 4. 09 g per one plant and 30. 69 per 1 m 2. Under good weather conditions, Malope flowers were freely visited by pollinating insects, such as: honeybees, solitary bees and bumblebees. The number of insects increased from morning till noon, reaching 18 per 1 m 2 at 12 : 00. Then, the number of pollinators decreased. The most abundant group was solitary bees...|$|R

5000|$|Verticordia is a genus of {{more than}} 100 species of plants {{commonly}} known as featherflowers, in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. They range in form from very small shrubs such as V. verticordina to trees like V. cunninghamii, some spindly, others dense and bushy, but the majority are woody shrubs up to 2.0 m tall. The flowers are variously described as [...] "feathery", [...] "woolly" [...] or [...] "hairy" [...] and are found in most colours except blue. They often {{appear to be in}} <b>rounded</b> groups or <b>spikes</b> but in fact are always single, each flower borne on a separate stalk in a leaf [...] Each flower has five sepals and five petals all of a similar size with the sepals often having feathery or hairy s. There are usually ten stamens alternating with variously shaped staminodes. The style is simple, usually not extending beyond the petals and often has hairs near the tip. All but two species are found in Southwest Australia, the other two occurring in the Northern Territory.|$|R
6000|$|A narrow rim of {{the broad}} flat {{exterior}} part of each lobe is turned inwards, so that, when the lobes are closed, the exterior surfaces of the infolded portions come into contact. The edge itself bears a row of conical, flattened, transparent points with broad bases, like the prickles on the stem of a bramble or Rubus. As the rim is infolded, these points are directed towards the midrib, and they appear at first {{as if they were}} adapted to prevent the escape of prey; but this can hardly be their chief function, for they are composed of very delicate and highly flexible membrane, which can be easily bent or quite doubled back without being cracked. Nevertheless, the infolded rims, together with the points, must somewhat interfere with the retrograde movement of any small creature, as soon as the lobes begin to close. The circumferential part of the leaf of Aldrovanda thus differs greatly from that of Dionaea; nor can the points on the rim be considered as homologous with the <b>spikes</b> <b>round</b> the leaves of Dionaea, as these latter are prolongations of the blade, and not mere epidermic productions. They appear also to serve for a widely different purpose. [page 325] ...|$|R
60|$|The way, therefore, lay open to {{the great}} hall or outer {{vestibule}} of the Lodge. One end of this long and dusky apartment was entirely occupied by a gallery, which had in ancient times served to accommodate the musicians and minstrels. There was a clumsy staircase at either side of it, composed of entire logs of a foot square; and in each angle of the ascent was placed, by way of sentinel, {{the figure of a}} Norman foot-soldier, having an open casque on his head, which displayed features as stern as the painter's genius could devise. Their arms were buff-jackets, or shirts of mail, <b>round</b> bucklers, with <b>spikes</b> in the centre, and buskins which adorned and defended the feet and ankles, but left the knees bare. These wooden warders held great swords, or maces, in their hands, like military guards on duty. Many an empty hook and brace, along the walls of the gloomy apartment, marked the spots from which arms, long preserved as trophies, had been, in the pressure of the wars, once more taken down, to do service in the field, like veterans whom extremity of danger recalls to battle.

40|$|Diatoms are micro algae {{that live}} in moist environments. While their size and shape vary between species, they are {{typically}} on the micron scale. Although, diatoms are simple single cell organisms, they simultaneously allow selectively uptake nutrients whilst rejecting deleterious viruses and bacteria. It is still unknown how a simple organism manages to filter these different particles. A diatom is comprised of intricate nano/micro pore like features on their outer shells, known as frustules, which has been proposed {{are responsible for the}} selective uptake of particles. A commercial CFD package, CFD-ACE+ has been used for this study. To reduce complexity only one pore was simulated with three different entrance shapes, namely edged, <b>rounded</b> and <b>spiked.</b> In addition, two alternate flow conditions were used to verify the effects of different modes of operation. A fully coupled simulation, {{similar to that of the}} Immersed Boundary Method, of the particle effect on the flow field, was used to study the hydrodynamic interaction of the particle with the different entrance shapes. The more conventional modelling method for particle flow that solves the flow field independently of the particle, hence, one-way coupled simulation, was also investigated to compare to the new fully coupled particle modelling. Finally, Brownian motion was also simulated using the one-way coupled simulation to examine its role in filtration if coupled with the hydrodynamic interaction of different pore entrance shapes. The results have shown that the edged pore entrance, due to its sudden change of flow condition, is the best at rejecting particles. The spiked pore entrances also increase the instability in the flow field and enhance the rejection of particles. Like that of the diatom, the rounded edge has shown the possibility of allowing for selective uptake of different sized particles. The results for the Brownian motion simulations indicate that it dominates in the regions where the flow is insignificant. Even at the position where the Peclet number is approximately 111, the Brownian motion was clearly visible. This has lead to a belief that Brownian motion may assist the transport of the particles through the pore. It may also assist to transport particles into the pore from the regions near the wall and the pore, where the flow is insignificant and the Peclet number is small (< 1). The combined results of Brownian motion and the particle simulation on the rounded edge indicate that during when the particle is partially captured in the pore, diffusion will help transport through the pore...|$|R
