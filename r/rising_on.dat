5|$|The present bronze {{statue of}} Benavides {{is in front}} of the Main Building of the Sampaloc campus, <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> top of a granite {{pedestal}} flanked by four lions each bearing the coats-of-arms of the Philippines, Spain, Holy See, and the Dominican Order. He dons the rugged habit of the pioneer Dominican missionaries. His right hand is elevated in the preaching fashion, his index finger pointing to heavens. His left hand rests on his chest holding a book bearing the words Santo Evangélico on its cover. A skull cap covers his head, and a pectoral cross hangs from his neck, the symbols of Episcopal dignity.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Lazy Afternoon debuted {{at number}} 107 on the Billboard 200 chart {{for the week}} ending November 1, 1975. It {{continued}} <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> the charts for several weeks before peaking at number 12 on December 20 of that same year. Later in 1976 due to the album's strong sales, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Lazy Afternoon Gold on April 14, 1976 for shipments of 500,000 copies. In Canada, the album peaked {{at a much lower}} position; it debuted on RPMs official list at number 69 as the week's third highest entry on December 20, 1975. The following month and year, it would reach its peak position at number 42. It also charted in Australia, where it peaked at number 84 according to the Kent Music Report.|$|E

5|$|He {{received}} regimental {{promotion to}} major in the 28th Foot on 9 May 1816. The regiment moved to a garrison posting in the Ionian islands in 1819, and {{his time in the}} islands saw him command a force which put down a local <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> Santa Maura. On 2 September 1819 he purchased the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel and command of the 92nd Gordon Highlanders. His tenure at the 92nd was short and contentious; since it was garrisoned in Jamaica, he did not actually join the regiment until October 1820, and then scandalised his officers and men by his approach to regimental traditions. He appeared on parade in a cocked hat rather than the conventional highland bonnet, and attempted to order the regiment to wear trousers rather than the kilt. The Duke of York quickly arranged for his transfer to a less sensitive role, and he was transferred to command the 90th Light Infantry, a Lowland—and safely trousered—regiment, on 9 August 1821. The 90th were in the Ionian Islands, where Stovin had been posted some years earlier, but his second tour was substantially quieter; he saw no further active service before he retired from the 90th on half-pay on 23 April 1829. For his services there, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E

25|$|In 2010–2011, Bryan Erickson {{teamed up}} with William Anderson of Louisiana. William did a ton of sampling, Bryan made a bunch of VAC B-sides and turned them into Toxic Coma tracks.

This VAC side project is known as Toxic Coma Satan <b>Rising,</b> <b>on</b> Metropolis Records. Erickson then began to write more music for future VAC LPs.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, a {{wrought iron}} truss bridge, the Prince Alfred Bridge, was {{completed}} across the Murrumbidgee River. The bridge {{was designed by}} William Christopher Bennett and was constructed by Francis Bell and Frederick Augustus Franklin and had a total length of 314 m, including three wrought iron truss spans each of 31.4 m across the river itself, two southern approach spans of timber, and twenty-three northern approach spans of 9.14 m, also of timber, <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> a gradient of 1 in 30 from {{the level of the}} floodplain.

25|$|Characteristic of {{the country}} are the {{enormous}} fissures which divide it, formed over time by the erosive action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred thousands cubic metres of hard rock. One result of the action of the water has been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as ambas, with nearly perpendicular sides.|$|E
25|$|The Tournament {{was held}} on a meadow or holm at a loop in the Lugton Water. The ground chosen for the tournament was low, almost marshy, with grassy slopes <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> all sides. The Knights on horseback and their retinue reached the tilt yard ('C' on the map) via an {{enclosed}} ride ('G' on the map), whilst the guests and visitors {{made their way to}} the stands via the route marked 'F' on the map illustrated. Both groups crossed over the three arched Gothic Eglinton Tournament Bridge. An 1837 map of Eglinton Castle, Grounds and Tilt yard shows that the tilt yard was already in extistence at this early date, but it is not recorded what its fate was after the tournament was over.|$|E

25|$|The harbour town is Adamantas; {{from this}} {{there is an}} ascent to the plateau above the harbour, on which are {{situated}} Plaka, the chief town, and Kastro, <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> a hill above it, and other villages.

Here is a theatre of Roman date and some remains of town walls and other buildings, one with a fine mosaic excavated by the British school at Athens in 1896. Numerous fine works of art have been found on this site, notably the Aphrodite in Paris, the Asclepius in London, and the Poseidon and the archaic Apollo in Athens. Other villages include Triovasalos, Peran Triovasalos, Pollonia and Zefyria (Kampos).|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the plot, Emilio Mola, had ordered the Army of Africa to revolt at 5 a.m. on July 18, but the plan was {{discovered}} by Republican officers of Melilla on July 17, and the {{leader of the}} plot in the city, Colonel Segui, decided to start the <b>rising</b> <b>on</b> Melilla and arrested General Romerales. The rebels seized the radio station and proclaimed the estado de guerra. The Legionnaries, the Regulares, and the Assault Guards in Melilla joined to the rising. Seizing key buildings, they crushed the resistance in the working class quarters. General Romerales, the major of Melilla, the government delegate, the aerodrome commander, Virgilio Lerez Ruiz, and all those who resisted the rebellion were shot.
