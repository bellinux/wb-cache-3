40|$|A <b>ram</b> <b>and</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{penetrometer}} was de-signed {{to measure}} the viscosity of impres-sion materials at their time of placement. Viscosity {{had no effect on}} accuracy or sta-bility of the impression materials within the viscosity ranges studied. The accuracy of impression materials is af-fected by a number of factors that have received widespread attention. Some of these are the type of material used, the thickness of the impression material between the tooth and the impression tray, the method of at-taching the impression material to the tray, and the time of pouring (casting) the im-pression...|$|E
40|$|An {{indirect}} extrusion viscometer {{has been developed}} and tested on fluids of standard viscosity. Results close to given standards have been obtained and errors in the pro-cedure analyzed. Preliminary tests {{have shown that the}} developed apparatus will be suitable for following the viscosity changes during the setting of dental materials. It is important to know the viscosity, and, hence, the flow properties of dental mate-rials in the fluid stage. This relates to their ability to adapt to a required shape. When setting materials, viscosity alters with time; knowledge of these changes can yield infor-mation about working and setting times. In addition, it is desirable to know how vis-cosity varies with shear rate in order to cor-relate optimal shear properties with the method of application. A viscometer that investigates dental ma-terials should satisfy the following basic ob-jectives: (1) be able to measure high vis-cosities, (2) monitor viscosity changes with time, (3) be able to work with small quan-tities similar to those used in dental practice, for example, less than 1 -gm batches of ce-ments and restorative materials, (4) enable studies of shear rate dependence of viscosity, and (5) preferably should use little equip-ment apart from that normally found in a dental materials laboratory. Previous dental investigators have used a variety of techniques.

25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the <b>rams</b> <b>and</b> their <b>cylinders,</b> buried underground <b>and</b> a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} propulsion and pyrotechnic {{test program}} has been in progress at the NASA White Sands Test Facility since 1995. This program created the capabilities to: accurately measure and characterize pyrovalve combustion product blow-by into propellant systems; characterize valve operation using a Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR); and evaluate hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine thermal decomposition initiated by blow-by. These capabilities were further utilized and refined this year. Low blow-by pyrovalves manufactured by Conax Florida Corporation continued to be evaluated as a potential corrective measure for blow-by induced propellant explosions. Development and testing of various advanced pyrovalves and investigation of explosion mechanisms also continued. Current and near-term testing includes: evaluation of 3 / 8 in. Conax pyrovalves and other commercially available valves; development and testing of advanced pyrovalve subcomponent technologies including a zero blow-by pyrovalve ram, composite overwrapped <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder,</b> <b>and</b> a zero particulate generating poppet; investigation of non-destructive evaluation techniques to evaluate pyrovalve <b>ram</b> seals; <b>and</b> testing and modeling of pyrotechnically induced explosive hydrazine decomposition. Evaluation of 3 / 8 in. Conax valves will include operational margin testing to be accomplished at NASA Langley Research Center. The test program also seeks to compile and format significant amounts of data from this and other pyrovalve test programs to generate a pyrovalve applications handbook. The handbook will facilitate formation of standards that ensure safe spacecraft applications. Current data and future plans are discussed, and community interaction is encouraged...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{comprises}} {{an in-depth}} physical {{discussion of the}} flow-induced vibration of two circular cylinders {{in view of the}} time-mean lift force on stationary <b>cylinders</b> <b>and</b> interaction mechanisms. The gap-spacing ratio T/D is varied from 0. 1 to 5 and the attack angle a from 0 ¡ to 180 ¡ where T is the gap width between the <b>cylinders</b> <b>and</b> D is the diameter of a cylinder. Mechanisms of interaction between two cylinders are discussed based on time-mean lift, fluctuating lift, flow structures and flow-induced responses. The whole regime is classified into seven interaction regimes, i. e., no interaction regime; boundary layer <b>and</b> <b>cylinder</b> interaction regime; shear-layer/wake <b>and</b> <b>cylinder</b> interaction regime; shear-layer and shear-layer interaction regime; vortex <b>and</b> <b>cylinder</b> interaction regime; vortex and shear-layer interaction regime; and vortex and vortex interaction regime. Though a single non-interfering circular cylinder does not correspond to a galloping following quasi-steady galloping theory, two circular cylinders experience violent galloping vibration due to shear-layer/wake <b>and</b> <b>cylinder</b> interaction as well as boundary layer <b>and</b> <b>cylinder</b> interaction. A larger magnitude of fluctuating lift communicates to a larger amplitude vortex excitation. [URL] www. elsevier. com/locate/jfshb 2013 ai 201...|$|R
