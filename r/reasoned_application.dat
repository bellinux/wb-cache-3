40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the criminalisation of fabricated images of child pornography. Focusing {{on the new}} offence of possessing ‘non-photographic pornographic images of children’ (NPPIC) under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, it assesses whether harm- and morality-based arguments legitimate {{the extension of the}} criminal law to this activity. I contend that harm may be caused to children by NPPIC that are depictions of real child sexual abuse, and images that depict the fantasy sexual abuse of a real, recognisable child. However, it is extremely difficult to find a legitimate basis for prohibiting the possession of fantasy, completely fabricated NPPIC through a <b>reasoned</b> <b>application</b> of the harm principle and thus criminalisation of such images is not justified. Adopting a liberal perspective, I argue that moral harm-based arguments ultimately fail to convince, since legal moralism or moral paternalism should not be acceptable grounds for criminalisation. I conclude that a stronger case for criminalisation would have been made had the offence been limited to NPPIC depicting real child sexual abuse, or featuring real, recognisable children, or targeted at creators and distributors rather than possessors...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{demonstrates}} that the only suitable basis for morality lies in the Judeo-Christian faith. Popular relativistic approaches either rely on one’s intuition or society for guidance. However, intuitionism lacks any objective standards and cultural relativism is illogical and often condones what is clearly evil. Philosophy is also wanting since the different ethical philosophies sometimes yield conflicting prescriptions and {{are subject to the}} limitations of human reasoning. Natural law and divine revelation are less disputable. However, natural law is less clear than divine revelation. While divine revelation has been criticized on various grounds, none of these is a serious problem. Divine law provides an unequivocal moral authority, and the Bible is a superior divine revelation. However, in ethical dilemmas it requires <b>reasoned</b> <b>application,</b> which can be flawed, although the Holy Spirit guides believers. It is hoped that the arguments in this paper will help both Christian professors and their students be able to intelligently defend Judeo-Christian ethics when they come under attack.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{rationale for}} {{judicial review of}} the constitutionality of legislative and executive acts {{is based on a}} deterministic assumption about the nature of constitutional legal rules. By the early twentieth century however; American legal realists persuasively questioned the determinancy of law in general and posited that indeterminate cases were decided by judicial intuitions of fairness. Social science research has discovered that self-identified liberals and conservatives predictably place different relative values on different shared moral intuitions. At the same time, neurological research suggests that humans and primates implement 2 ̆ 2 decisions 2 ̆ 2 before the cognitive parts of the brain are even aware that the subject has made a decision potentially negating the role of cognitive reason in intuitive human decision making. Combining these three behavioral insights - that of the realist the psychologist, and the neurobiologist - seems to undercut the classical justification for judicial review by unelected judges. If intuitive ideology rather than <b>reasoned</b> <b>application</b> of rules controls much judicial decision making, then the Supreme Court has no more authority to issue biding interpretations of the Constitution than those branches of government whose ideological leanings are more directly subject to political controls. Nevertheless, the Supreme Courts structural role as a potential restraint on unconstitutional government action and as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional disputes, together with institutional and political restraints on judicial activism, leaves an essential practical role for judicial review in the U.

S. 186 (1986), {{and the historical}} and legal background {{leading up to the}} case. Often characterized as a decision representing an emotional rejection of homosexuality rather than a <b>reasoned</b> <b>application</b> of constitutional privacy precedent, this inquiry sought to identify and document the determinants of the outcome in Bowers, in which a slim majority of the Court ruled that the constitutional right of privacy did not prohibit states from regulating homosexual sodomy. The study demonstrated that although homophobia certainly played a part in the Bowers decision, that the opinion was not necessarily inconsistent with previous privacy decisions such as Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), and Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). The author concluded that the dominant insight gleaned from Bowers {{is that there is no}} such thing as a constitutionally protected right of privacy, at least not in the way that privacy is conventionally understood. The Bowers opinion illuminates that the Court's privacy jurisprudence has been more about the privileging of certain relationships (such as that between husband and wife or doctor and patient) than it has been about personal privacy. Such relationships serve an important limiting principle. The author concluded that the outcome in Bowers was not the insufficiency of the claim of a right to privacy, but the insufficiency of any limiting principle. The research documented and analyzed history of the two bodies of law most relevant to the Bowers opinion: state law which criminalized sodomy; and constitutional protection of individual privacy...|$|E

40|$|The {{rational}} {{character of}} the political sphere largely relies upon {{the idea that it}} is effectively possible to provide rational justification to some fundamental principles of social normativity. Contemporary democratic forms of political life, in particular, are grounded upon the existence of a shared public discourse as the epistemic environment where a fair exercise of citizens’ representation, the active support for specific policies and the <b>reasoned</b> <b>application</b> of laws find their appropriate grounding. Within these last decades, though, the widespread pluralistic character of modern societies has been often identified as a major challenge to the stability and effectiveness of liberal democracies. This scenario can be at least partially explained as the joint effect of the increasing complexity of contemporary plural societies and the decreasing cultural credit given to the justificatory power of practical reason. Political and moral philosophy have been widely engaged with this issue and since the 90 s the scene has been taken by a major debate between liberal and communitarian perspectives, characterized by a variety of articulated re-interpretations of the Aristotelian, Kantian and Utilitarian traditions. Among some the most recent elaborations, though, there has been also a significant return of philosophical views inspired by the Pragmatist tradition. Most notably, the work of Robert Talisse and J. Caleb Clanton has focused on an renewed attention to Peirce to bring about new ways to look at the issue of deep moral disagreement in democratic debate.

40|$|If Congress has {{delegated}} lawmaling {{authority to}} an agency {{and has not}} specifically addressed an issue covered by the statute, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Chevron doctrine requires judges to defer to reasonable agency interpretations. Justice Scalia maintains that deference is grounded, at least in part, {{in the executive branch}} 2 ̆ 7 s own lawmaling authority; hence, judges should defer to virtually all agency interpretations not inconsistent with statutory plain meaning. This Symposium reveals that Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s reading is gathering academic support. Yet the Court continues to reject his understanding of Chevron, as illustrated by the recent decision of Gonzales v. Oregon. The Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) makes it a crime to possess or distribute addictive or psychotropic drugs. The Act requires doctors to register before they can issue such controlled substances, and the Attorney General has the authority to deny registration when {{it would be in the}} 2 ̆ 2 public interest. 2 ̆ 2 In 1994, Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s legislature enacted a statute authorizing doctors to administer lethal drugs to terminally ill patients. Concluding that Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s statutory regime involved wrongful use of controlled substances, Attorney General Ashcroft in 2001 issued a Directive interpreting the CSA to bar such medical practices, effectively preempting Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s euthanasia law. Ashcroft 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation is an example of agency norm-entrepreneurship, the <b>reasoned</b> <b>application</b> of fundamental norms by agencies when they apply statutory directives. Over Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s objections, the Supreme Court rejected Ashcroft 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation in Oregon. Because there had been no congressional delegation, the Court found Chevron deference inapposite; the majority further ruled that the 2 ̆ 2 public interest 2 ̆ 2 standards of the Act did not justify preempting state regulation of medical practices. As Oregon illustrates, agencies have become an important situs for the expression and testing of public norms. We argue that their norm-entrepreneurship complicates the Chevron debate. When public values are implicated, the sharp rule-like edges of both the Chevron framework and Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s alternative will be fuzzier and more standard-like in practice...|$|E
40|$|Pectin methylesterase (PME) catalyzes the demethoxylation of pectin, a major {{polysaccharide}} {{in plant}} cell walls. Demethoxylated pectin can be cross-linked by divalent ions and is {{less susceptible to}} chemical depolymerization by β-elimination. PME is therefore applied for improvement of textural properties of plant based foods. The application of PME in food industry has generally been developed empirically. However, the increasing insight in the cell wall architecture, the pectin structure, its relation to physico-chemical properties and the structure and action of enzymes (including PME), will enable the design of enzyme preparations that tailor-make pectins with specific functionalities. In this context, {{the objective of the}} present work was to study the effect of relevant processing parameters (temperature, high pressure and pH) on the structural and functional stability and the kinetics and the mode of action of recombinant Aspergillus aculeatus PME, purified from a commercial preparation currently applied in fruit processing. The aim was to generate a scientific basis that allows a more <b>reasoned</b> <b>application</b> of the enzyme and the development of products with new functionalities[I 1]. As a case study, the effect of pretreatments involving infusion of the enzyme preparation on the texture of thermally and high pressure processed strawberries was investigated. High pressure was selected as a processing parameter, next to the more conventional parameters pH and temperature, because high pressure processing is gaining interest as a food preservation technique due to the better balance between food safety and food quality, compared to conventional processes, obtained for various food products. The main structural component of recombinant A. aculeatus PME, as revealed by FTIR studies, was β-helix, which supports the idea that the fungal enzyme adopts a parallel β-helix three-dimensional architecture, similar to the crystalline structures proposed for bacterial and plant PME and other pectinolytic enzymes. The ordered structural components of recombinant A. aculeatus PME started to unfold at temperatures exceeding 50 °C. This irreversible protein denaturation was reflected in a loss of catalytic activity in the same temperature range. The thermal inactivation kinetics of recombinant A. aculeatus PME could be described be a first-order model. Recombinant A. aculeatus PME was a very pressure stable enzyme. No loss of activity was observed after prolonged treatments up to 700 MPa at moderate temperatures. Pressures higher than 1 GPa had to be applied to induce any conformational changes of the protein. Moreover, pressure protected recombinant A. aculeatus PME against thermal denaturation. At elevated pressures higher temperatures were required to unfold and inactivate the enzyme. Temperature, pressure and pH strongly affected the rate of pectin demethoxylation catalyzed by recombinant A. aculeatus PME. The enzyme was active in acidic conditions, with highest activity observed between pH 4. 0 - 4. 5 (depending on temperature). At atmospheric pressure recombinant A. aculeatus PME was optimally active at 40 - 45 °C. Increasing the pressure shifted the optimal temperature to higher values, due to the protective effect of pressure against thermal inactivation. Highest activity was detected when temperatures of 50 - 55 °C were combined with pressures of 200 - 300 MPa. At all elevated pressures studied (100 - 500 MPa) the activity was higher compared to atmospheric pressure. The mode of action of PME was investigated by enzymatic fingerprinting of the demethoxylated pectins using endo-polygalacturonase from Kluyveromyces fragilis, with subsequent analysis with HPAEC and HPSEC. A multiple-chain mechanism was proposed to describe the action of recombinant A. aculeatus PME, although some multiple-attack mechanism on the intrachain level, yielding limited blocks of demethoxylated units, can be suspected. The mode of action of the fungal PME (with acidic pI and acidic pH optimum) clearly differed from the mode of action of PME purified from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) (with an alkaline pI and neutral to alkaline pH optimum), which was suggested to act according to a multiple-attack mechanism producing large blocks of demethoxylated galacturonic acids residues. Neither for recombinant A. aculeatus PME, nor for tomato PME an effect of pH (pH 4. 5 vs pH 8. 0) on the mode of action was detected with the enzymatic fingerprinting method applied. Furthermore, increasing temperature (50 °C vs 22. 0 °C) and/or pressure (300 MPa vs 0. 1 MPa) did not have an influence on the mode of pectin demethoxylation by recombinant A. aculeatus PME. In a final part, it was demonstrated that recombinant A. aculeatus PME can be applied as a tool to improve the textural properties of processed fruit with a delicate structure. It was shown that vacuum infusion of the fungal PME together with Ca 2 +-ions can significantly increase the hardness of strawberries. The difference in hardness was maintained after thermal and high pressure treatments of the fruit. status: publishe...|$|E
