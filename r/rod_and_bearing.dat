50|$|Rod {{bearings}} {{were made}} of babbitt cast integral with the rod. The bearing was adjustable for wear by removing copper shims placed between the rod cap and connecting rod. In this way specified oil clearance could be maintained. If the crankshaft were to be turned undersized, or if the bearing was damaged or worn out, <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> were replaced as a unit, typically at the dealership.|$|E
50|$|Its cylinders, <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bearings</b> {{were all}} rebuilt at the Great Northerns Dale Street Shops in St. Paul in 1947-48 by {{machinist}} George A. Halvorsen as his last job before retirement.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 Michell {{formed the}} Crankless Engines company {{to develop and}} {{manufacture}} engines with an intriguing design that eliminated the crankshaft found in most automotive and stationary engines. The engines did not require connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bearings</b> found in most engines and as such could be lighter and more compact.|$|R
50|$|When {{compared}} to a V6 or V8, an inline four will generally have somewhat lower frictional losses at a comparable engine speed due to having fewer pistons, connecting <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bearings,</b> although the lower frictional loss is offset in practice by the inline four's need to operate at a higher RPM {{compared to}} a larger engine {{in order to produce}} equivalent power.|$|R
50|$|This action puts {{strain on}} the rack and pinion, pump, tie <b>rods,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bearings,</b> {{especially}} causes undue wear to the steer wheels, and can be exceptionally difficult {{in the absence of}} power-assisted steering. Although in most modern cars the steering components are sturdy enough to handle dry steering without taking damage, it is still not recommended due to stronger tire wear. This is the reason automatic parking systems are usually designed not to dry steer, although their design would be somewhat simpler if they used dry steering.|$|R
50|$|Also {{unlike the}} Chevrolet inline 6, Ford {{products}} used {{high oil pressure}} for lubrication for the main <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings,</b> as do all modern vehicle combustion engines. While this offered no special performance advantage it did eliminate a complex oil jet system in the oil pan. As a side benefit to a prospective purchaser of a used vehicle, this also enabled {{the condition of the}} connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> main <b>bearings</b> to be determined indirectly by observation of the analog oil pressure gauge after the vehicle was warmed up, provided that oil of normal viscosity was in use.|$|R
50|$|Connecting <b>rods</b> were cast, <b>and</b> <b>bearings</b> were brass and/or Babbitt metal. The early {{lubricants}} {{were all}} animal fat based, and only suitable for low temperature applications. Later, petroleum based lubricants provided much better performance.|$|R

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of converting {{a unit of}} fuel to rotation of the driving wheels includes many points of friction loss and heat loss through the exhaust or cooling system. Friction inside the engine happens along the cylinder walls, crankshaft <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> main <b>bearings,</b> camshaft bearings, drive chains or gears, plus other miscellaneous <b>and</b> minor <b>bearing</b> surfaces. An electric motor has internal friction only at the main axle bearings. Friction outside the motor/engine includes loads from the generator / alternator, power steering pump, A/C compressor, transmission, transfer case (if four-wheel-drive), differential(s) and universal joints, plus rolling resistance of the pneumatic tires.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper shows a {{performance}} analysis for conical type sealless cylinders <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings.</b> The pistons without seal have partly cylindrical and conical shapes. 2 dimensional Reynolds equation and FD(finite differential) numerical techniques are utilized {{for the performance}} analysis. The relationship among self-centering forces and leakage flows are investigated. Also, optimal design values for a sealless cylinder are presented. A prototype of sealless cylinder which had rod bearing with four pockets, five pockets, and six pockets was manufactured respectively. Leakage flow test is conducted to evaluate performance of piston <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearing</b> in sealless cylinder...|$|R
40|$|A piston <b>and</b> {{connecting}} <b>rod</b> assembly {{includes a}} piston crown, a piston skirt, a connecting <b>rod,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>bearing</b> insert. The piston skirt is a component {{separate from the}} piston crown and {{is connected to the}} piston crown to provide a piston body. The bearing insert is a component separate from the piston crown and the piston skirt and is fixedly disposed within the piston body. A bearing surface of a connecting rod contacts the bearing insert to thereby movably associate the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> the piston body...|$|R
40|$|Connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> {{crank pin}} <b>bearing</b> are {{important}} components of automotive diesel engine. If these components failed, all of engine {{system would be}} shut down. In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> crank pin <b>bearing</b> was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch and chipping on crank pin bearing which formed by high friction during operation. High friction affects performance of other pistons and therefore bolts of connecting rod experienced dynamic tension load. With repeated load during operation, crack initiated on the bolts and propagated until the bolt could not withstand the load anymore before they are finally broken...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{two models}} (M 9 B 1 and M 9 B 2 {{connection}} types) of acacia glulam wood exterior beam-to-column connections with angles <b>and</b> steel <b>rod</b> system have been developed. Both {{models have been}} tested experimentally under monotonic static and cyclic loadings. The behaviour of each model under static and cyclic loadings, maximum displacement, maximum moment, equivalent viscous damping ratio, stiffness degradation, rotational stiffness and ductility have been observed. From the test results {{it can be concluded}} that the behaviour of the connections were influenced by the number of bearing steel rods at the beam, wood quality, and thickness of the angles. The M 9 B 1 connection type has more flexibility than the M 9 B 2 connection type. Three dimensional finite element analyses considering anisotropic plasticity have been conducted for both models. It can be concluded that in M 9 B 1 connection type, the tensile forces due to the moment are received by the combination of tensile steel <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bearing</b> force in the steel <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> wood around it. Overall performance of M 9 B 2 connection type is better than that of M 9 B 1 connection type because the former has higher initial stiffness and higher rotational ductility than the later...|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head is fitted with seals {{to prevent the}} pressurized oil from leaking past the interface between the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> the head. This area is called the seal gland. The advantage of a seal gland is easy removal and seal replacement. The seal gland contains a primary seal, a secondary seal / buffer seal, bearing elements, wiper / scraper and static seal. In some cases, especially in small hydraulic cylinders, the <b>rod</b> gland <b>and</b> the <b>bearing</b> elements are made from a single integral machined part.|$|R
50|$|The Willans {{engine was}} single-acting; steam {{pressure}} was only {{applied to the}} upper surface of the pistons. This was a common feature of high-speed engines at this time, in a measure to reduce knocking and increased wear, thus permitting higher operating speeds. The principle was that in a single-acting engine the forces on the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> its <b>bearings</b> always act to compress the rod, rather than reversing direction twice in every revolution, as for the double-acting engine. The lower bearing brasses, which carried a load only during starting, were smaller than the crankpin and the main working brasses above. Although single-acting engines produce only half the power of an equivalent double-acting engine, or else must run at twice their speed, this reduced knocking could allow them to run {{more than twice as}} fast.|$|R
5000|$|On November 10, 1943 at the {{locomotive}} builders {{meeting with the}} War Production Board Alco again requested to build road diesels. On December 10, 1943 Alco received approval to build one experimental three unit road freight locomotive {{in the fourth quarter}} of 1944.. A 12 cylinder 241 engine is put on test at Auburn, New York on March 29, 1944. Testing of 241 engines in 1944 revealed several shortcomings, including failures of the connecting <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> their <b>bearings,</b> <b>and</b> the GE turbocharger's inability to supply sufficient air to the engine as the engine's speed was increased. [...] As a result, work began that year to design a new engine based on the 241; this design was named the 244. [...] Later that year, ALCO management decided to abandon their previous plan to use the 241 in production locomotives, instead choosing to use the new 244 design as soon as possible.|$|R

5000|$|When {{building}} a high-performance engine, great {{attention is paid}} to the connecting rods, eliminating stress risers by such techniques as grinding the edges of the rod to a smooth radius, shot peening to induce compressive surface stresses (to prevent crack initiation), balancing all connecting rod/piston assemblies to the same weight and Magnafluxing to reveal otherwise invisible small cracks which would cause the rod to fail under stress. In addition, great care is taken to torque the connecting rod bolts to the exact value specified; often these bolts must be replaced rather than reused. The big end of the rod is fabricated as a unit and cut or cracked in two to establish precision fit around the big end bearing shell. Therefore, the big end [...] "caps" [...] are not interchangeable between connecting <b>rods,</b> <b>and</b> when re{{building a}}n engine, care must be taken to ensure that the caps of the different connecting rods are not mixed up. Both the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> its <b>bearing</b> cap are usually embossed with the corresponding position number in the engine block.|$|R
5000|$|The LS based GM small-block {{engine is}} the primary V-8 used in General Motors' line of rear-wheel-drive cars and trucks.

40|$|Two {{nonlinear}} pushover {{analyses and}} three displacement-controlled time history analyses of two precast concrete panel assemblies were completed. The analytical software used was SAP 2000 (version 15. 0. 0). The precast concrete panel modeled was a three-dimensional single panel {{connected to a}} one-story, one-bay, concrete-reinforced structural frame with four flexing <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> two <b>bearing</b> connections. The results showed that static analysis is suitable to predict only dynamic analysis with a long input period of vibrations (low acceleration vibrations). As the period of input vibration neared the fundamental period of vibration of the precast concrete panel, the maximum value of forces developed in connections increased. The amplification ratio for both models decreased as {{the period of the}} input vibrations varied from 100 to 0. 32 s, and {{the amount of time that}} each flexing rod experienced a local maximum of force changed for the periods of input vibrations of 100, 1, and 0. 32 s...|$|R
5000|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, the gudgeon pin (UK, wrist pin US) connects the piston to the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> provides a <b>bearing</b> for the connecting rod to pivot upon as the piston moves. [...] In very early engine designs (including those driven by steam and also many very large stationary or marine engines), the gudgeon pin {{is located in}} a sliding crosshead that connects to the piston via a rod. A gudgeon is a pivot or journal. The origin of the word gudgeon is the Middle English word gojoun, which originated from the Middle French word goujon. Its first known use was in the 15th century.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automobile Industry is {{the largest}} {{industry}} in the world. Automotive engines need to be reconditioned after certain running. The frictional torque of a half engine (which consists of cylinder block, pistons with rings and gudgeon pins, connecting <b>rods,</b> crankshaft <b>and</b> <b>bearings)</b> is about 75 % to 80 % of the total frictional torque of that engine. The components of new engines are manufactured with high degree of automation and accuracy but the same is not available during their reconditioning. Obviously, due to difference in accuracy of CNC machines and GPMs, a newly manufactured half engine has comparatively less frictional torque than a reconditioned one. This results in somewhat poor performance of a reconditioned engine {{as compared with the}} new one. The objective of this research work is to design & develop a test rig which could measure the frictional torque of a reconditioned half engine accurately and to bring quality consciousness in engine reconditioning business...|$|R
5000|$|Oil {{circulation}} is kept {{separate from}} the fuel/air mixture, thereby preserving oil rather than burning it as happens in two-stroke engines. Oil moves from its reservoir, is pressurized by an oil pump, and is pumped through the oil filter to remove grit. The oil is then squirted into the crankshaft <b>and</b> connecting <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> onto the cylinder walls, and eventually drips off {{into the bottom of}} the crankcase. [...] In a wet sump system, oil remains in a reservoir at the bottom of the crankcase, referred to as the oil pan. In a dry sump system, oil is instead pumped to an external reservoir.|$|R

50|$|In 1935, Pontiac re-introduced their six-cylinder engine, as a 208 CID L straight-6. The 208 was {{produced}} in 1935 and 1936. It was a side-valve design with a timing chain, as was popular at the time. This engine featured a conventional one piece cylinder head, and the distributor {{was moved to the}} side of the block. The number of main bearings was increased to four. Like the Pontiac Straight-8 engine it also featured full-pressure oiling and insert type precision main <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>bearings.</b> These two latter features greatly increased longevity and durability especially under high speed conditions.|$|R

The second engine followed on November 13th. One of these engines was put on a 600 hour test inside Building 37 at Schenectady. The test started on November 23rd and concluded on December 17th with six shutdowns to fix minor problems. Positive test results were reported at an Alco sales meeting conducted December 17th through 20th. Production of the first FA-1s and FB-1 commenced before the testing of the 244 engine was completed.|$|R

40|$|The {{lubricating}} oil system {{provides a means}} to introduce a lubricant {{in the form of}} a film to reduce friction and wear between surfaces that bear against each other as they move. 1 The oil film which is established also cools the parts by carrying generated heat away from hot surfaces, cleans and carries dirt or metal wear particles to the filter media, and helps seal the piston to the cylinder during combustion. Most systems are pressure lubricated and distribute oil under pressure to <b>bearings,</b> gears, <b>and</b> power assemblies. Lubricating oil usually reaches main, connecting <b>rod,</b> <b>and</b> camshaft <b>bearings</b> through drilled passages in the cylinder block and crankshaft or through piping and common manifolds. Many parts rely on oil for cooling, so if the lube oil system fails to perform its function the engine will overheat. Metal to metal surfaces not separated by a thin film of oil rapidly build up frictional heat. As the metals reach their melting point, they tend to weld together in spots or streaks. Lube oil system failures can cause significant damage to an engine in a short period of time. Proper maintenance and operation of the {{lubricating oil}} system is essential if your engine is to accomplish its mission...|$|R
50|$|From these {{holes in}} the main journals, the oil moves through passageways inside the {{crankshaft}} to exit {{holes in the}} rod journals to lubricate the <b>rod</b> <b>bearings</b> <b>and</b> connecting <b>rods.</b> Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. However, in modern designs, there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the rod bearings to the rod-piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders. This oil film {{also serves as a}} seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase. The oil then drips back down into the oil pan.|$|R
