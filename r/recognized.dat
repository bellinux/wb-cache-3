In the past few decades, rheumatoid factors (autoantibodies that <b>recognize</b> the Fc-tail of immunoglobulins) as well as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively. ACPAs <b>recognize</b> post-translationally modified proteins in which the amino acid arginine has been converted into a citrulline.

However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of <b>recognized</b> species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection.

We give a quadratic-time algorithm for computing the syntactic morphism from any given strongly <b>recognizing</b> morphism, thereby showing that minimization is easy as well. In addition, we give algorithms for efficiently solving various decision problems for weakly <b>recognizing</b> morphisms. Weakly <b>recognizing</b> morphism are often smaller than their strongly <b>recognizing</b> counterparts.
