40|$|In this study, the geological, {{petrographical}} {{properties of}} <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs</b> exposed around Çan-Etili in the Biga Peninsula (NW Turkey) which are pyroclastic products of Late Oligocene-Early Miocene aged Çan Volcanism were investigated, also physical and mechanical characteristics of tuffs introduced {{and tried to}} determine the impact on engineering properties of petrographical features. In the region, <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs</b> called locally “Çan stone” {{have been used as}} covering and building stones for many years. These tuffs generally have light yellowish, beige, brown colored and different patterns with light yellowish, cream, reddish and brown colors caused by iron oxidation of hydrothermal alteration. They are preferred as coatings and decorative stone with these patterns. Çan stone which consisted of rhyolitic composition, lithic and locally crystalline tuffs has compact structure. The mineral assemblage of tuffs is mainly composed of quartz, plagioclase, rarely biotite, amphibole (hornblende) phenocrystals and opaque mineral with particles of volcanic glass and lithic fragments. Not only petrographical and geochemical analyses were carried out but also standard rock mechanic tests (unit weight, specific gravity, porosity, water absorption and uniaxial compressive strength) on <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs</b> samples collected from four different quarries (Hoppa Hill, Halilaga, Uzunalan, Dereoba). Simple regression analysis of test results obtained from four different regions and correlations were found good correlation between engineering proper- ties and the petrographical and chemical properties of <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{summit of}} Green Gable is overlain by till, {{although}} there are outscops of the Long Top Member {{to the west and}} north. This comprises bedded and welded <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff</b> and lapilli-tuff. Above Sty Head there are examples of Scafell dacite and the tuffs and breccias of the Lingmell Formation. There is no history of mining on the fell.|$|E
25|$|Lying on {{the edge}} of the Scafell Syncline, the various strata dip to the east. The summit area is formed from a dacite lava flow (Scafell Dacite), {{directly}} underlain by the Lingmell Formation. This tuff, lapilli tuff and breccia outcrops a little to the west of the summit. Around Beck Head is evidence of the Crinkle Member, welded <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff</b> and lapilli-tuff with some breccia. A dyke of andesite and hybridised andesite porphyry is responsible for Kern Knotts.|$|E
500|$|The rocks {{which today}} make up Snowdon and its {{neighbouring}} mountains were {{formed in the}} Ordovician Period. At that time, most of modern-day Wales was {{near the edge of}} Avalonia, submerged beneath the ancient Iapetus Ocean. In the Soudleyan stage (...) of the Caradoc age, a volcanic caldera formed, and produced ash flows of <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuff,</b> which formed deposits up to [...] thick. The current summit is near the northern edge of the ancient caldera; the caldera's full extent is unclear, but it extended as far as the summit of Moel Hebog in the south-west.|$|E

50|$|The first {{sequence}} was {{deposited in}} the Jurassic during the rifting which caused the initial formation of the basin. This Jurassic formation is called the Girón Group which consists of siltstones and <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs.</b> During this period, the basin also experienced granitic plutonism along its western margins. The Jurassic-Cretaceous angular unconformity, separating {{the first and second}} sequence, is representative of the post-rift boundary.|$|R

50|$|The Sturgeon Lake Caldera {{contains}} a well preserved north facing homoclinal chain of greenschist facies metamorphosed intrusive, volcanic, and sedimentary layers. This piecemeal caldera complex includes nearly 3000 m of major subaqueously deposited intracaldera fill. Episodes of subaerial and subaqueous explosive felsic volcanism created rhyodacitic to <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs</b> and lapilli tuffs.

Beltanelliformis miuntae and Beltanelliformis brunsae occur in the succession.|$|R

Activity of Chachani has {{migrated}} southward, from the Nocarane-Chingana volcanoes {{in the north}} to a complex of lava flows and lava domes in the south. Volcanic activity in the area began as Tacaza volcanics during the Miocene. During the Sillapaca phase starting in the Pliocene the cone building volcanism took place.

5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava.

50|$|Three {{different}} stages of ignimbritic volcanism have been delineated by argon-argon dating. The first and oldest occurred 8.4 million years ago and formed the rhyolitic tuffs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Steens Mountain in SE Oregon {{is part of}} the {{northern}} Basin and Range Province, and represents a horst tilted about 100 to the west that is bounded to the east by a high angle, NNE trending normal fault. The minimum displacement is about 1200 m. Volcanic rocks, exposed along the eastern escarpment, range from basalt to high-silica rhyolite. By establishing a stratigraphy and determining chemical variations in the volcanic rock sequence underlying Steens Mountain Basalt, it was possible to evaluate the origin of this volcanism and the role of crustal contamination, explain its chemical variation with time, and relate the chemical evolution to extensional processes. The necessary chemical data were obtained by X-ray fluorescence, electron microprobe, and instrumental neutron activation analyses; field mapping provided information about stratigraphy and structure. The oldest units are lake sediments which are overlain by a volcanic rock sequence that proceeded from early <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs</b> to <b>rhyolitic</b> lava flows, dacites, andesites, and culminated with the eruption of Steens Mountain Basalt (S MB). All stratigraphic units are tilted to the NW or SW to various degrees. Early sediments and <b>rhyolitic</b> <b>tuffs</b> are tilted as much as 25 °; whereas younger andesites (15 ° tilt), and SMB (5 - 10 ° tilt) overlie the older units unconformably. The stratigraphy and mapped unconformities indicate that active, volcanic episodes alternated with episodes of erosion and block tilting. Tilting events are thought to be connected to extensional tectonics, and the maximum extension for the Steens Mountain area is estimated to be 30...|$|R
