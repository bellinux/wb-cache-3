5000|$|The {{collected}} {{waste oil}} is sold to local workshops or small factories for cleaning and packaging. When sold to workshops {{it is often}} transported {{on the back of}} bicycles by peddlers who are paid a monthly wage; afterwards, the oil is held in 200-liter barrels at the workshops until it is processed. On other occasions the oil goes to industrial cooking oil refineries for further processing before it finally reaches its end purpose. The industrial oil refineries are usually legitimate producers that sell the processed oil for use in the chemical or energy industries. Gutter oil is perfectly suitable as a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient</b> for producing soap, rubber, bio-fuel, and cosmetics. However, the refiners can also have other intentions as the prices attained by selling it as cooking oil are much higher than if it is sold to the chemical or energy industries.|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{livestock}} feed from insect infestation {{is a common}} challenge that feed facility managers and farmers have to deal with. It becomes an issue of importance because insect infestation degrades feed quality and quantity. Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) is added to {{livestock feed}} because of its high protein content. As DDGS usage in animal feed increases, understanding the susceptibility of DDGS, when mixed with livestock feed, to insect infestation is necessary for safe feed storage. This research addressed four questions. The first looked at the susceptibility of DDGS, when stored as a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient,</b> to Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) infestation. DDGS susceptibility to T. castaneum was lower when stored as a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient</b> compared with normal T. castaneum laboratory diet at 30 % r. h [...] However, increasing r. h. to 50 % and grinding DDGS samples, increased DDGS susceptibility to T. castaneum infestation. The second question concerned the susceptibility of livestock feed that contains DDGS to T. castaneum infestation. Results showed that adding any amount of DDGS to animal feed will not change diet susceptibility to T. castaneum infestation and feed pelletization negatively affected insect development. For the third question, experiments were conducted to determine the chemical and physical characteristics of DDGS which may influence its susceptibility to T. castaneum infestation. Particle size was the main factor affecting DDGS vulnerability to T. castaneum infestation. The fourth question focused on the alternative uses of DDGS as bait for monitoring T. castaneum. Efficacy of traps significantly increased when a combination of DDGS and food oil kairomone lures were used compared with food oil or empty traps. Therefore, DDGS {{may be a good}} additive to food oil lures to increase trap efficacy. In conclusion, T. castaneum development significantly increased when fed DDGS. Diet particle size and environmental humidity had significant effects on T. castaneum development. As a result, it is recommended that facility managers store DDGS as a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient,</b> pelletize DDGS if it is cost-effective, and keep the storage humidity at 30 % or lower. ...|$|E

Considering this, microemulsions of grape pomace are considered as suitable vehicle of delivery of topical antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant (tocopherol), steroidal, antibacterial, antifungal drugs and various local anesthetics. Kumar et al. (2014) achieve better drug absorption across skin compared to cream, gel or lotion. In these conditions, the pharmaceutical market would potentially receive benefit {{by the addition of}} grape pomace microemulsion as a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient</b> and satisfy the consumers’ demand for organic, less toxic drugs.|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of asbestos is widely known, and various methods are being investigated to decompose asbestos into harmless compounds.

Recycling decomposed asbestos as a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient</b> for cement is crucial in using this result industrially. However, compounds including chlorine form in decomposed asbestos, preventing of use in production of cement.

40|$|Poor {{diet and}} {{nutrition}} in the United States has immense financial and health costs, {{and development of}} new tools for diet planning could help families better balance their financial and temporal constraints {{with the quality of}} their diet and meals. This paper formulates a novel model for dietary planning that incorporates two types of temporal constraints (i. e., dynamics on the perishability of <b>raw</b> <b>ingredients</b> over time, and constraints on the time required to prepare meals) by explicitly incorporating the relationship between <b>raw</b> <b>ingredients</b> and selected food recipes. Our formulation is a diet planning model with integer-valued decision variables, and so we study the problem of designing approximation algorithms (i. e, algorithms with polynomial-time computation and guarantees {{on the quality of the}} computed solution) for our dietary model. We develop a deterministic approximation algorithm that is based on a deterministic variant of randomized rounding, and then evaluate our deterministic approximation algorithm with numerical experiments of dietary planning using a database of about 2000 food recipes and 150 <b>raw</b> <b>ingredients...</b>|$|R

40|$|Melamine is a <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient</b> for plastics, {{but it is}} {{frequently}} misused by adding it to food to give the false impression of a high protein content, since the molecule has a very high nitrogen content. Samples of dried milk obtained from 5 manufacturers containing varying levels of melamine were illuminated by a small cross-section of a laser beam and the scattered light was examined. The presence of melamine in contaminated milk could be immediately detected without any chemical or physical alteration of the milk by interpreting its Raman scattering spectra. Among its many Raman bands, the intense 676 cm- 1 band was the most useful for detecting melamine; detection limit was about 1 % (w/w). Because this method does not extract melamine from the dried milk sample, it {{reduces the risk of}} error that may occur during the extraction and interaction with chemical reagents. The method provides a very rapid screening test for melamine-adulterated dried milk in food chemistry and forensic toxicology...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{production}} of biopesticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis activity in culture media supplemented with semi-solid wastewater sludge {{as one of the}} <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient.</b> A series of testing using mixture of sludge and source of protein as B. thuringiensis growth media were carried out and selection of media was based on viable spore count. The entomotoxicity test of B. thuringiensis was carried out against larvae of fruit fly using diet incorporation method. Further impact of entomotoxicity was observed based on histology deformities on columnar epithelial cell and goblet cell of the midgut. A mixture of sludge with 60 % wheat bran produced up to 1. 64 × 1010 CFU/mL of viable spore count within 10 days of incubation. Based on entomotoxicity test, incorporation of 12 mL of semi-solid wastewater sludge-culture media into fruit fly artificial diet caused the highest fruit fly mortality at 64. 8 %. The value of semi-solid wastewater sludge-culture media concentration for LC 50 was determined at 8. 43 %. Effect of entomotoxicity can be seen started from 3 rd instar larvae where histopathological studies showed that up to 10 % of columnar epithelial cells in the intestine were swollen and severe reduction of goblet cell’s size. Thus, it decreases the survivality of the fruit fly larvae. The present study indicated that semi-solid wastewater sludge has the potential to enhance B. thuringiensis entomotoxicity activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{germination}} time on physicochemical characteristics of brown rice flour {{and its effect}} on gluten free bread qualities have been investigated. Germination was carried out at 28  °C and 100  % RH for 12, 24 and 48  h; brown rice and soaked brown rice was also analyzed. Significant changes on hydration and pasting properties of brown rice flour were found during germination. The starch degradation by enzyme activity could be evidenced with the decrease in viscosity and water binding capacity (WBC). No significant effect in specific volume, humidity and water activity of the gluten free bread was found as germination time increase, but a significant softness of the crumb was obtained. However, at 48  h of germination, the intense action of α amylase could result in excessive liquefaction and dextrinisation, causing inferior bread quality. Overall, germinated rice flour showed appropriate functionality for being used as <b>raw</b> <b>ingredient</b> in gluten free breadmaking.
