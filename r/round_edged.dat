40|$|The {{placement}} of the fuel in combustors is significant for combustor design. Hence {{the study of the}} liquid penetration into a crossflow has received attention from various researchers. There have been various correlations suggested for the upper surface of the liquid jet trajectories suggested by several researchers. However, many of these correlations are applicable to specific operating conditions, injector geometries and measurement techniques. This study is an attempt to develop spray trajectory correlations that is applicable {{to a wide range of}} operating conditions and injector geometries. Previous studies have shown that the penetration of a spray created by <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> orifice is higher than that created by a sharp edged orifice. The approach is to develop trajectory correlations to the spray created by a <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> orifice that is expected to give the highest penetration. For the injectors of various other geometries, a correction factor is used to obtain the spray trajectories. Preliminary study has shown that the location of the column breakup point obtained by using the liquid jet light guiding technique could possibly be a part of the correction factor to the penetration of the spray. The trajectories of the jet and the location of the column breakup points are obtained for four different injectors at several operating conditions. These results are used for obtaining the correlation for the spray trajectory and the correction factor for the various injectors.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{have been}} applied for {{numerical}} simulations of the flow around simplified shapes of a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The simulations {{have been carried out}} at Re = 850 000, which coincides with a free stream velocity of one knot in seawater conditions. Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) have been used with the k-w SST turbulence model in the near-wall (unsteady RANS) regions. The CFD code FLUENT from ANSYS Inc. have been used. The first case to be investigated, was a fully submerged rectangular stationary cube with both sharp and rounded edges. The sharp edged case showed good agreement with published reference values. The results for the refined mesh gave Cd = 0. 8192, Clrms = 0. 0473 and St = 0. 1132. The Strouhal number was identical for both meshes, while small discrepancies were seen on the mean drag and the root mean square lift coefficient. For the <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> case, the mean drag coefficient was shown to be about 25 % of the sharp edged case (Cd = 0. 2257). The lift was more difficult to model correct and large discrepancies were seen both on the Strouhal number and the root mean square lift coefficient. It was concluded that longer time series were needed in addition to further mesh refinement in order to get more stable mean quantities of the lift history. Some effort were also made on trying the realizable k-e turbulence model in the near-wall regions for the <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> case, but without noticeably effect on the results. For both the sharp edged case and the <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> case it was concluded that although the drag was successfully modeled, a further mesh refinement was needed in order to ensure converged results. For the case of the simplified model of the ROV, three meshes were used for the grid convergence study. Small discrepancies were seen, between 2 % and 6. 2 %. The pitch moment through the Center of Gravity (COG) was also measured and a negative mean value of Cm = - 0. 2563 was obtained. This means that the reported instability for the ROV was also seen in the simplified model. Through a more detailed study of the pressure and velocity distributions, the main problem regions were identified to be above the forward top and below the aft bottom. Here high-velocity regions generate low-pressure regions, which coincides with a negative pitch moment. One proposed solution was the removal of the plate in the aft which span the width of the ROV. The effect of this solution was however found to be questionable. This is due to the components which are placed in front of the plate, and these may actually cause the same effect. For this reason, these components should be relocated. It was concluded that there should be performed numerical simulations without the plate and the components in front included. The effect of these components could then be studied and a decision on whether to remove the plate could be made. Also, numerical simulations where different locations for the components in front of the plate are tried should be an interesting case to run with respect to the stability analysis. </p...|$|E

These vortices strongly influence all the aerodynamic coefficients. Working at model scale, using two configurations of the Davis model with different rear pillar radii, (sharp edged and 10 mm radius) the flow fields over the rear half of the models were investigated using balance measurements, flow visualisations, surface pressure and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements. For a small geometry change between the two models, the changes to the aerodynamic loads and wake flow structures were unexpectedly large with significant differences to the strength and location of the trailing vortices in both the time averaged and unsteady results. The square edged model produced a flow field similar to that found on an Ahmed model with a sub-critical backlight angle. The <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> model produced a flow structure dominated by trailing vortices that mix with the wake behind the base of the model and is weaker. This flow structure was more unsteady than that of the square edged model. Consequently, although both models can be described as having a wake dominated by trailing vortices, there are significant differences to both the steady state and unsteady flow fields that have not been described previously. This also shows that the fastback wake structure described by Ahmed is not definitive...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal inserts within an assembly injection process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety.

30|$|Alio et al., {{in their}} study in adult uveitic cataract, found acrylic IOLs to be {{associated}} with least amount of immediate and delayed inflammation, and HSM-PMMA and acrylic IOLs had the least incidence of uveitis relapse. Silicone IOLs had the highest rates of opacification of the posterior capsule [42]. Papaliodis et al., {{in their study}} comparing four types of IOL materials, reported acrylic IOLs to be superior to HSM-PMMA, PMMA, and silicone lenses in adult uveitic eyes, when they evaluated inflammation, posterior capsular opacification, visual acuity, and macular oedema [43]. The Perry review concluded that acrylic and HSM lenses performed better in uveitic eyes. They suggested that a lens with a sharp optic edge had better visual outcomes in uveitic eyes because of reduced incidence of PCO [45]. A Cochrane review by Leung et al. on types of intraocular lenses for cataract surgery in uveitis included four studies with a patient profile of adult uveitic eyes [42, 46 – 49]. They concluded that there was uncertainty as to which type of IOL gave best visual and clinical outcomes in uveitic cataract surgery based on existing studies and advocated a multicenter international study. Abela-Formanek [50], while comparing IOL biocompatibility in 72 uveitic eyes versus 68 control eyes, suggested that though design and biomaterial of the IOL was important, meticulously performed surgery and perioperative management of inflammation could not be overlooked. They compared foldable hydrophilic acrylic, hydrophobic acrylic, and silicone lenses and found hydrophilic acrylic lenses to have good uveal but worse capsular biocompatibility. Hydrophobic acrylic had low uveal but better capsular biocompatibility, and silicone lenses showed more severe anterior capsular contraction. They suggested avoiding <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> hydrophilic acrylic lenses in uveitic eyes because of accelerated rate of PCO formation seen. As all their uveitic patients benefited from the surgery despite the different foldable IOLs, they suggested a longer follow-up to have more conclusive results. Van Gelder et al. [14] in their review for adult uveitis also suggested optimum management of uveitis, including scrupulous attention to preoperative and postoperative inflammation and intraoperative technique for excellent visual outcomes.|$|E
40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is an {{alternative}} route to produce liquid fuels {{from a variety of}} carbon feedstocks including coal and biomass. Typically iron and cobalt based catalysts have been used for the FTS reaction, in which a mixture of CO and H 2 (syn-gas) reacts to form hydrocarbons. Enhanced performance has been reported for iron-based systems doped with alkali metals and chalcogenides. Sulfides are considered a poison for most catalytic processes, but sulfur in the form of sulfates (SVI) is found to enhance the performance of iron based catalysts towards the FTS when present at low levels. In this study a wide range of iron based catalysts was prepared under varying synthesis conditions and with different dopants. The standard methods of preparation used were co-precipitation and incipient wetness impregnation. A structural study {{of a wide range of}} iron based catalysts was carried out using characterisation methods such as X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Brunner-Emmett-Taller surface area determination (BET). The characterisation was performed before and after reduction of the catalysts (under H 2) to form the catalytically active materials. Before reduction, PXRD, XPS and quantitative analysis identified a haematite iron oxide structure (?-Fe 2 O 3) for all samples. The crystallinity of the iron oxide materials varied between samples prepared in various conditions. The highest crystallinity was observed for the samples synthesised at pH 7, fast titrant addition rate, at room temperature. The same techniques revealed changes in the iron oxide structure after reduction. The catalysts activated at 400 oC were mainly composed of Fe 3 O 4 and those activated at 450 oC were a mixture of Fe 2 +, Fe 3 + oxides and metallic iron Fe 0. Moreover, the study of the role of alkali metals showed that some of the alkali promoters (K, Rb) may decrease the effective iron oxide reduction temperature. The nitrogen adsorption experiment was used to establish that iron oxide doped with different promoters had a mesoporous structure with a narrow pore size distribution. The SEM analysis indicated two different types of surface: irregularly shaped agglomerates with smaller <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> particles attached to their surface and homogenous agglomerates surfaces with sharp edges for the samples with different promoters. The most homogenous were the samples with Rb. All samples had small particles attached to the surface of larger agglomerates. An increase of the alkali metals on the surface after the activation process and migration of the alkalis to the surface with rising reduction temperature were observed using bulk and surface techniques (XRF, EDX and XPS). The differences in K K-edge shape of the XANES spectrum indicated changes in the local structure of K corresponding to changes of coordination number around K+ during activation. It was also observed that reduction influenced the sulfur species in iron oxide catalyst. For all the samples prior to reduction sulfates (SO 42 -) were detected by XPS and XAFS. After the reduction at 400 oC and 450 oC, characteristic XPS S 2 p peaks for both sulfate and sulfide, were noticed. The sulfate/sulfide ratio was higher for the catalyst samples reduced at the lower temperatur...|$|E
40|$|Tyres {{are used}} in {{everyday}} life {{for a variety of}} practical and recreational tasks. Frictional behaviour of tyres on any surface is important for vehicle safety and control; this behaviour becomes more important when that surface is snow. The interaction of rubber and a snow surface is complex and a deeper understanding of both is needed in order to help develop better tyres. Outdoor full scale tyre test results were compared to results from indoor laboratory tests using a linear tribometer and a surface of compacted artificial snow; these were in excellent correlation allowing a systematic and comprehensive study of rubber friction on snow to be conducted in the laboratory. Rubber samples of varied rubber compositions and geometries were used to gain an understanding of friction on snow. Samples with varying glass transition temperature (Tg), dynamic rigidity (G*) and Payne effect (dependence of the dynamic moduli on the amplitude of the applied strain) were investigated along with samples with and without sipes. The rubber friction coefficient (μ) was measured as a function of velocity and temperature. The siped samples exhibited a higher μ than those without sipes. FE simulations, rubber friction tests for varying contact pressures and steel blade force tests were performed to evaluate contributions from ‘surface’ friction and ploughing separately. The increased μ was attributed to the ploughing force from the front edges of the ‘subblocks’ created by the sipes. Although it is well known in the industry that siped tyres grip well, {{this is the first time}} it has been explained how sipes grip effectively through a combination of ploughing and rubber snow interaction. A comprehensive study of varying rubber properties (Tg, G* and Payne effect) was conducted to better understand their impact on snow friction. The findings were evaluated using the WLF shift factor to account for the running frequency of the rubber from the snow surface roughness. G* was found to be the dominant parameter for rubber μ when considering running frequency. Increased μ values were exhibited by rubbers with a lower G*. The decreased G* makes the rubber more compliant, thus increasing the contact area between the rubber and the snow, in turn increasing μ. A better knowledge of the surface roughness of snow will aid the understanding of the interaction between rubber and snow for tyres. A method was developed to characterise the artificial snow surface utilising sectioning and imaging of chemically stabilised snow samples. From images of the snow surface before friction testing the average indentor size can be found, this is used to analyse the running frequency of the rubber. Qualitatively comparing the surfaces before and after rubber friction testing shows a decrease in surface profile aggressivity after a test; this is attributed to melting of the snow from frictional heating and snow grain fracture. Friction tests were conducted to directly compare rubber friction on snow and ice using <b>round</b> <b>edged</b> samples. Again it was found that the rubber with the decreased G* exhibited higher friction; this was seen on both snow and ice confirming G* as the dominant rubber property for both surfaces, regardless of the surface roughness change. It was found that at low temperatures ice had a higher μ than snow, while at high temperatures snow exhibited a higher μ than ice. It is hypothesised that this intriguing switch is due to the surface roughness change leading to differing contact areas both with and without melt water. This switch is not seen when a simple heat transfer model is used, confirming the effect as a surface roughness change. The use of a modified Hertz model shows that indentation is the dominant mechanism at low velocities on snow. It is hypothesised that at high velocities melt water dominates on both snow and ice while adhesion may have a more significant role on ice at low velocities. These findings provide knowledge that can be used in the design of tyres for snow and ice in the future...|$|E
