" Although no longer in charge of music, he was still exerting an administrative supervision on its broadcasting, but the director of the Chaîne nationale's manager fiercely opposed the project of a specialization of the various possible stations of the ORTF. In fact, he was afraid of a ghettoisation of classical music, already criticized as being elitist : culture is indivisible. He however wouldn't be able to slow down this inexorable movement of specialization of the stations. Henceforth, non specialized stations object to broadcasting classical music, since it now has its own station and listeners. The years 1960 were the time of the blossoming of the microgroove and the authorities draw the conclusions, painful as they are for the bands linked with the Radio. The steady disappearance of the links between the diverse provincial orchestras and the Radio leave only three remaining regional orchestras in 1970 : in Lyon, Nice and Toulouse.

Starting {{with the}} middle of the ‘ 90 s of the {{previous}} century, the Republic of Moldova started to implement a series of important reforms, aimed at improving the access and quality of the services for increasing the efficiency and the performances of the health system. The aim of the research is the analysis of the <b>Regionalization</b> <b>Plan</b> of the Hospital Services and the assessment of medical workers opinion from district and republican hospitals regarding the envisaged transformations, in order to elaborate conclusions and recommendations that will be considered at the stage of reform’s implementation. The object of the research is the physicians of different profile (therapeutic, surgical, diagnostic), which work in republican and district hospitals. Methods: questioners, statistic data analyze, comparative method. Results. The logic of the regionalization suggests a reality, and namely, the need to transfer the physicians from the republican institutions to regional hospitals will be little. As a result, it will be applied only for the provision of the highly specialized services, for the solution of the associated cases or for the use of certain sophisticated methods of diagnosis and treatment (cardiac catheterization with subsequent plasty, etc). Therefore, it can be appreciated positively the fact that only 1 / 5 of physicians that work in the republican hospitals accept to commute or the transfer. It is more regrettable another reality, which shows that almost ½ of the specialists from the republican medical institutions generally do not want the regionalization and boycott the reform, just when they should promote the change. It results that mainly these physicians plead for the continuous maintenance of poor quality of hospital medical assistance, for the access limitation of the rural population at quality health service and, as consequence, and the financial burden to be left on patients shoulders – a fact mentioned in all the reports of foreign experts.

We examine Hox gene expression data for several taxa, in relation to recent work on the polychaete annelid Chaetopterus. The work in Chaetopterus shows the basic conservation of colinearity of anterior expression boundaries seen in other groups. It also reveals novel patterns including early expression in the larval growth zone and later formation of posterior boundaries that correlate with morphological transitions in the polychaete body plan. The polychaete gene expression pattern is {{compared with those of}} Hox gene homologs in other taxa to reveal differences that represent evolutionary changes in Hox gene regulation between lineages. Correlations between Hox gene expression differences and morphological differences are examined, focussing on a number of cases in which posterior Hox gene expression boundaries correlate with morphological transitions.

The improvements are due to {{changes in the}} health system which include comprehensive health <b>planning,</b> <b>regionalization</b> of health services and popular participation in health education and mass drug administration programs. Traditional structural approaches to the study of national health systems can benefit from an analysis of the process of change.

An analysis of decision-making within the Sistema Nacional Unico de Salud illustrates the process whereby a health system undergoes structural change from within. The Nicaraguan case suggests that the changing configuration of health systems is a dynamic process and the result of negotiation among several constituencies amid changing conditions in the world system. The role of a government seeking to democratize health delivery within a socialist political economy is to create and promote constituencies for the popular model and thereby institutionalize the debate. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Regionalization</b> {{promotes}} <b>planning</b> {{and coordination}} of services across settings and providers to meet population needs. Despite the potential advantages of regionalization, no regional hospice palliative care program existed in Ontario, Canada, as of 2010. This paper describes {{the process and}} early results {{of the development of}} the first regional hospice palliative care program in Ontario. The various activities and processes undertaken and the formal agreements, policies and documents are described. Methods A participative approach, started in April 2009, was used. It brought together over 26 health service providers, including residential hospices, a palliative care unit, community and hospital specialist consultation teams, hospitals, community health and social service agencies (including nursing), individual health professionals, volunteers, patients and families. An extensive stakeholder and community vetting process was undertaken that included work groups (to explore key areas such as home care, the hospital sector, hospice and palliative care unit beds, provision of care in rural settings, e-health and education), a steering committee and input from over 320 individuals via e-mail and town-halls. A Transitional Leadership Group was elected to steer the implementation of the Regional Program over the summer of 2010. This group established the by-laws and details regarding the governance structure of the Regional Program, including its role, responsibilities, reporting structures and initial performance indicators that the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) approved. Results The Regional Program was formally established in November 2010 with a competency-based Board of 14 elected members to oversee the program. Early work involved establishing standards and performance indicators for the different sectors and settings in the region, and identifying key clinical needs such as the establishment of more residential hospice capacity in Ottawa and a rural framework to ensure access for citizens in rural and remote regions. Challenges encountered are explored as are the process enablers and facilitators. The paper views the development and implementation process from the perspectives of several frameworks and models related to change management. Conclusions Following on several initial achievements, the long term success of the Regional Program will depend on consolidating the early gains and demonstrating changes based on key measurable outcomes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the {{geographic}} {{variation in the}} rates of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) between 1981 and 1991. DESIGN: Retrospective study of discharge abstracts (from the provincial hospital discharge database) for odd fiscal years. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All Ontario residents undergoing CABG between 1981 and 1991. OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and sex-standardized median, maximum and minimum (plus 25 th and 75 th percentile) rates of CABG per 100, 000 population aged 20 years and over, as well as interregional variation. RESULTS: The median rate of CABG rose from 46. 2 to 72. 7 per 100, 000 adults between 1981 and 1991. The minimum rate varied from 1. 9 to 12. 4 per 100, 000 and the maximum rate from 110. 4 to 172. 1 per 100, 000 during the study period. Variations in the area-specific rates were significant in all years (p < 0. 0001, based on the likelihood ratio chi 2 test after adjustment for age and sex). None of the four summary statistical measures showed any obvious diminution between 1981 and 1989, nor was there {{a change in the}} utilization pattern during the waiting-list crisis years of 1987 and 1989. However, the summary measures did reach their lowest level in 1991.

40|$|Irrigation {{development}} in northeast Thailand has witnessed an eventful last century. The 'dry' and 'marginal' lands of northeast Thailand have been continuously reshaped, {{in an attempt}} to both balance the seasonality of rainfall and to counter the in-season variations that constrains rainfed cultivation. Apart from that, the Thai government's support for irrigation development has served many additional goals: food security and self-sufficiency, the creation of rural employment opportunities along with the support of agribusiness development, a counterstrategy against migration to the rural and national economic centers, and the fight against insurgency and the spread of communism. Throughout this period, attempts to render nature fit for human use has been both a state and a local process. Years before the height of the hydraulic mission in Thailand, farmers and communities have diverted surface waters with earthen bunds, constructed water wheels, and scooped water from channels and ponds to supplement water for agricultural production. While mostly local {{in the early years of}} the 20 th century, it was only in the 1950 s, both with the advent of the states increasing attempts to draw the peripheries of Thailand closer to the central state of (then) Siam, and with international aid flowing in for water resources development, that state sponsored irrigation development started to shape the waterscape of the region. First small in scale, these developments soon turned to large and multipurpose projects, and to a <b>regionalization</b> of water <b>planning</b> and development, which (at least on paper) interconnected the river basins of northeast Thailand. Interbasin-diversion (mostly from the Mekong main stem and more recently from Laos) to supplement the regions low runoff and limited available storage sites have rationalized the expansion of irrigated areas and have triggered dreams of a "Green Northeast?, an area where most agricultural land would be served by irrigation infrastructure.

In particular, it explores: What are the objectives regionalization policies? What is the socio-political context of the initiatives? and how the institutional framework is structured in the regionalization process? documentary sources and semi-structured interviews with key informants from the academic and political fields were analyzed. The findings show that between 1996 and 2007 regional planning structures and territorial development {{within the framework of}} a national policy of federalization, with a distribution of resources and transfer of legal-institutional powers are created. However, its configuration as decentralized manage- ment with affective capacities is strongly linked to the structures and cultures of organizations each of the agencies under analysis. The analysis of the data revealed that the policies of <b>regionalization</b> and territorial <b>planning</b> are set from the distribution of institutional legal to exercise the promotion, coordination and management of science policy at the regional level powers. These objectives conceive science and technology from a change of linear model but are configured according to the characteristics of the organizational structures of each region. That is, the change is developed as isomorphism. In these notes the analysis of the initiatives of territorial and regional development in the science and technology system organized into sixth sections. After a brief review of a socio-political perspective for policy analysis (first section), the methodological aspects (second section), and a summary of relevant background in the federal distribution of institutional legal for science powers arise, technology and innovation (third section); it is argued that there is possible to detect a tradition of national science policy planning in the sixties when are constituted -and distribute- regional structures with approaches taken by the federal and community contributors. This planning comes in active interaction with a backdrop of discussions and confrontation of approaches around the issue of economic development in non-industrialized or industrializing countries. However, certain disruptive factors such as the absence of specific regulations, have hampered the ability to explain and give consistency to the policy objectives of Science and Technology. This tradition of planning is recovered in the Nineties under a paradigm of strategic planning that sought an order in the system of science and technology from a clear distinction between new organisms public planning at the federal level, {{on the one hand and}} institutions that develop activities science and technology on the other. In light of this background, the fourth and fifth section examines the policies of science, technology and innovation between 2001 and 2007. The findings allow review tradition -not without tensions and territorial approach spark-contexts- thus distinguishing the historical character of their interventions. From a legal and political-institutional level the progress of a scenario of increasing institutionalization and functional differentiation of structures arises. However, the organizational perspective on these new structures or institutions put in tension the purpose of state planning systemically. The analysis shows that the formal legal powers assigned to new decentralized units without an effective counter-part in terms of instruments of power is insufficient to ensure effective management and coordination at regional level.
