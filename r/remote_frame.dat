40|$|Multiple {{reference}} frame motion estimation (MRF-ME) {{is one of}} the most crucial tools in H. 264 /AVC to improve coding efficiency. However, it disciplines an encoder by giving extra computational complexity. The required computation proportionally expands when the number of {{reference frame}}s used for motion estimation increases. Aiming to reduce the computational complexity of the encoder, various motion vector (MV) composition algorithms for MRF-ME have been proposed. However, these algorithms only perform well in a limited range of reference frames. The performance deteriorates when motion vector composition is processed from the current frame to a distant reference frame. In this paper, a reliable tracking mechanism for MV composition is proposed by utilizing only the relevant areas in the target macroblock and taking different paths through a novel selection process from a set of candidate motion vectors. The proposed algorithm is especially suited for temporally <b>remote</b> reference <b>frames</b> in MRF-ME.

The key issue is how to best exploit the mathematical structure of the 3 D model in order to take advantage of redundancy among its views.
