50|$|A lookout, lookout rafter or roof outlooker is {{a wooden}} joist that extends in {{cantilever}} {{out from the}} exterior wall (or wall plate) of a building, supporting the <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing</b> and providing a nailing surface for the fascia boards. When not exposed it serves to fasten the finish materials of the eaves.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method of}} {{applying}} radiant {{barrier to the}} roof in new construction {{is to use a}} radiant barrier that is pre-laminated to OSB panels or <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing.</b> Manufacturers of this installation method often tout the savings in labor costs in using a product that serves as roof decking and radiant barrier in one.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the last}} 325 years, the {{appearance}} of the houses have evolved very little as there have been only three families to own the Curtiss farm. Many original architectural details remain preserved including; dirt cellars, field stone foundations, oak post and beam frames, oak <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing,</b> pine flooring, clam shell plaster walls and ceilings over oak lath, original windows and frames.|$|E
50|$|The church {{building}} itself has three sections. The main block, with the sanctuary, is a rectangular structure of sandstone laid in random ashlar sandstone with a steeply pitched gabled <b>roof</b> <b>sheathed</b> in blue and gray slate.

50|$|The house's {{main block}} is a one-and-a-half-story three-bay {{structure}} of uncoursed fieldstone on an exposed stone foundation. It is {{topped with a}} cross-gabled <b>roof</b> <b>sheathed</b> in asphalt shingles and pierced by brick chimneys on either end. There are additions on {{the north and west}} sides, and small porticos sheltering both entrances.|$|R
5000|$|This {{building}} was originally constructed in 1909 as a storage area. It is flat-roofed, one story high and contains a single room. The 2000 NRHP application states that a 1916 photograph showed a frame lean-to addition, which was removed sometime afterward. The building is constructed of quarry- faced,i rregularly-coursed, rubble masonry, {{and has a}} gabled roof facing the front. A door centered on the front side is aligned with a door on the back side. The gable ends are shingled, {{and it has a}} front-facing louvered vent. The {{building was}} converted to serve as the laundry in 1922, but is now unoccupied. The 2000 NRHP application calls its condition,..."the poorest of the buildings of the district." [...] The <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing</b> is partially missing, exposing the rafters to the elements. However, the structure retains its original form, {{as well as some of}} the <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing.</b> McClure's thesis stated that the tribe had discussed demolishing the building instead of renovating it.|$|E
50|$|The third {{addition}} {{was completed}} sometime around 1882, when the front roof {{was raised to}} a full story in height. The original common rafters were replaced with new vertically-sawn two inch by ten inch common rafters. The original oak <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing</b> was reused. The second floor was also partitioned into five small rooms, {{each with its own}} closet. The new batten doors were hand planed pine and the cast-iron hardware, hinges and latches were made by Eli Whitney Blake.|$|E
50|$|The 1713-1714 {{dwelling}} was a timber {{framed structure}} approximately 39 ft, 6 inches by 20 ft, with an ell of equal size {{situated on the}} north side. This first dwelling was {{one and a half}} stories. This dwelling had an riven oak clapboard <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing,</b> a 17:12 pitched roof and likely clapboard siding. No drawings of the original structure have been located, nor are there references to this building in land records. However, the evidence of this original structure is present in the dwelling today.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{windstorm}} activity, in the United States in particular, {{has focused}} interest in measures {{that can be}} used to lower the likelihood of damage to structures. Billions of dollars of damages have resulted from such strong winds and the manner in which structures have been built in the affected areas in the United States. Some building codes address mitigation measures. For example, the Florida Building Code, specifies the type of nail used to secure <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing.</b> The specification was determined by scientific research conducted by Florida International University's International Hurricane Research Center.|$|E
50|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing</b> and {{flooring}} is vertically quarter sawn one-inch-thick oak boards with random widths between {{twelve and}} thirty inches. The flooring is laid directly over one-inch-thick split oak boards {{that were not}} suitable {{to be used as}} flooring. The mortise-and-tenon joints are held by wooden pins, and the flooring is nailed with large hand-wrought iron nails (see image).The four- to six-foot-length hand-riven oak clapboard siding is nailed directly to the oak studs with large flat rose-headed nails which was the typical material and application for the earliest New England homes (see images).|$|E
50|$|Over {{the last}} 345 years, the {{appearance}} of the house has evolved as each family has left their mark while expanding, adapting or preserving the house to accommodate changing ideas about space, function, comfort, privacy, cleanliness and fashion. Many original architectural details remain preserved including; partial dirt cellar, field stone foundation, oak post and beam frame, oak <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing,</b> stone chimney with brick beehive oven, oak interior walls, wide-board quarter-sawn oak flooring, clam shell plaster walls and ceilings over riven oak lath, poplar paneling, oak batten doors, oak window frames and the original riven oak clapboard siding in the lean-to attic.|$|E

It also has a central projecting entrance / tower bay and two-story gable-roofed kitchen / servant wing.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} most pole barns is simple. Poles {{make up the}} outer walls and support the roof system, usually {{pre-engineered}} wood trusses with a <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing.</b> Poles are usually spaced 8' apart, with the trusses bearing directly on the poles. Some variations in design call for truss carrying beams between the posts with trusses sitting on them. The exterior walls consist of girts attached horizontally to the post with the exterior sheathing attached to them. Exterior walls may be finished with corrugated metal, plywood sheathing, vinyl siding, or other cladding. Roof materials are generally corrugated metal but may be finished using any typical roofing product.|$|E
50|$|The second {{addition}} {{was completed}} sometime before the American Civil War, when a lean-to {{was added to}} the remaining rear of the house. This may have been used as a bedroom for Sara Hawley, who had received lifelong use of the house upon her husband's death and lived to the age of 87. The poplar vertical feather-edge beaded paneling, that had encased the original stairs, were reused as <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing.</b> The rear exterior oak clapboards were preserved in place in the attic that was created (see image). A new central staircase and interior wall was built, since removed, enclosing the kitchen fireplace and turning the house into a two-family residence at this time.|$|E
50|$|When radiant {{solar energy}} strikes a roof, heating the shingles, felt paper and <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing</b> by conduction, it causes the {{underside}} of the sheathing and the roof framing to radiate heat downward through the attic toward the attic floor. When a radiant barrier is placed between the roofing material and the insulation on the attic floor, much of the heat radiated from the hot roof is reflected back toward the roof and the low emissivity of {{the underside of}} the radiant barrier means that very little radiant heat is emitted downwards. This makes the top surface of the insulation cooler {{than it would have been}} without a radiant barrier and thus reduces the amount of heat that moves through the insulation into the rooms below.|$|E
50|$|The Jan Pier House is a {{historic}} home located at Rhinebeck, Dutchess County, New York. The farmhouse was originally built about 1761 and remodeled about 1881 in a Second Empire style. It is a one- to two story, asymmetrical stone building built into a hillside. It features a Mansard <b>roof</b> <b>sheathed</b> in polychrome slate. Also on the property are two contributing barns, a smoke house, wellhouse / well, and a cistern.|$|R

50|$|Hotel Sansone, {{also known}} as the Hotel Springfield and Hotel Sterling, is a {{historic}} hotel building located at Springfield, Greene County, Missouri. It was built in 1911, and is a four story American Craftsman style brick building. It measures 44 feet wide by 110 feet deep. It features a stepped parapet, beneath which is set a shallow overhanging hip <b>roof</b> <b>sheathed</b> with green Spanish tiles, and supported by heavy carved wooden brackets.|$|R
5000|$|For {{installing}} a radiant barrier under a metal or tile roof, the radiant barrier may be applied {{directly over the}} <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing.</b> Then furring strips (1x4s) are applied over the radiant barrier before the metal or tile roof is applied. The furring strips ensure that the radiant barrier faces into a sufficient air space. If an air space is not present or is too small, heat {{may be able to}} conduct through the radiant barrier. Since the metal in the radiant barrier is highly conductive, the heat transfer would be by conduction and the heat would not be blocked. According to the US Department of Energy, “Reflective insulation and radiant barrier products must have an air space adjacent to the reflective material to be effective.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} managed collaboratively by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and San Juan County until a long awaited land swap was {{recently}} completed in 2009. The BLM {{is now the}} sole owner of the Townsite, and provides interpretive brochures and maps at an adjacent parking area. Entry into the buildings is unrestricted. The nine standing buildings within the Townsite have been stabilized and restored, repairing floors, walls, windows, and doors, to secure the envelope of each building. Cedar shingle <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing</b> has been restored on several of the buildings along with structural repairs and improvements to the drainage around the structures and across the site. The jail structure, the oldest building on the site, has had it gable roof reconstructed {{as part of the}} second phase of the project along with new interpretive signage installed in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{version of}} plywood {{was invented in}} the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, {{produced}} the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use {{in a wide variety}} of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, <b>roof</b> <b>sheathing,</b> wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships. The pulp and paper industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp & Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.|$|E
50|$|Wheat Row is {{topped by}} a low hip <b>roof,</b> <b>sheathed</b> in copper. Double {{chimneys}} rise where the row houses meet. A triangular pediment rises above the projecting central section of the structure, pierced by an oval window. (This window's stone facing is not historic, and was created in 1964.) A bas-relief fretwork wooden cornice runs {{most of the way}} around the building, except where a stone band separates the pediment from the third floor.|$|R
