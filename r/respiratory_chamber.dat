40|$|A morfologia macro e microscópica da traqueia e pulmões de Amphisbaena vermicularis Wagler, 1824 e Amphisbaena microcephala (Wagler, 1824), assim como a ultraestrutura das câmaras respiratórias, foram descritas pela primeira vez neste estudo. A traqueia não se ramifica e seu segmento caudal, situado entre os pulmões, foi denominado brônquio. O pulmão esquerdo é alongado, saculiforme e unicameral, com parênquima faveolar na porção cranial e trabecular, na porção caudal. Câmaras respiratórias estão presentes em ambas as regiões do pulmão, mas é possível que a região caudal funcione também como reservatório de ar. O pulmão direito está reduzido nas duas espécies, no entanto em A. vermicularis a redução é bastante acentuada e apenas um vestígio deste órgão pode ser observado, mas em A. microcephala o pulmão direito é um órgão com limites definidos que se comunica com a porção caudal do tubo traqueal, através de dois orifícios. Pneumócitos tipo I e tipo II estão presentes nas câmaras respiratórias. As lâminas basais dos pneumócitos I e das células endoteliais encontram-se fundidas, de forma a diminuir a barreira ar-sangue, que é de aproximadamente 0, 5 µm em A. microcephala. As características morfológicas descritas neste estudo podem representar adaptações que permitem a sobrevivência dos espécimes de Amphisbaenia nas galerias subterrâneas, onde passam a maior parte de suas vidas sob condições de baixa renovação de ar, níveis de umidade relativamente variáveis e partículas em suspensão. The {{macroscopic}} and microscopic morphology of the trachea {{and lungs}} of Amphisbaena vermicularis Wagler, 1824 and Amphisbaena microcephala (Wagler, 1824), {{as well as}} the ultrastructure of the pulmonary <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> of the latter, are described for the first time. The trachea does not ramify, and its caudal segment, between the lungs, was named bronchus. The left lung is long, sac-like and unicameral, with a faveolar parenchyma in the cranial portion and a trabecular parenchyma in the caudal portion. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> are present in both regions of the lungs and it is suggested that the caudal portion acts as a reservoir of air. The right lung is reduced in both species, however in A. vermicularis this reduction is fairly pronounced and only a vestige of this organ can be observed, but in A. microcephala the right lung is a delimited organ that links to the caudal portion of the tracheal tube through two holes. Pneumocytes I and II occur in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers.</b> The basal membranes of the pneumocytes I and of the endothelial cells are fused, diminishing the air-to-blood barrier which measures approximately 0. 5 µm in A. microcephala.

30|$|For each {{experiment}} triplicate treatment {{measures were}} taken. For studying the oxygen consumption, we specially designed a rectangular shaped glass <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> of 4  L capacity having 20  cm length, 12  cm width and 15  cm height. A small PVC pipe (45  mm diameter) {{was attached to}} {{one end of the}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> and was fixed 5  cm above {{from the bottom of the}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> for inserting the pinpoint dissolved oxygen monitor (YSI 556 MPS; Yellow springs, Ohio 45387, USA) to record the dissolved oxygen (DO) measurement. To reduce microbial activity, the chamber was sterilized before trials. Before transferring the larvae from the preparation tank to the respiratory chambers, proper aeration was provided in the experimental chambers for a period of 2  h. A total of 30 trilobite larvae were introduced in each <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> after recording the weight of larvae to the nearest 0.01  g. Larvae were blotted using a dry soft tissue paper before weighing and weight of the larvae used for the present study ranged from 0.060 to 0.0746  g. During the blotting process, the larvae were handled very gently to avoid any possible damage to the gill tissues and the whole process was done as quickly as possible to avoid any stress to the animal. Extreme care was taken to avoid variation in total biomass of the larvae in each replicated tanks and also for the entire experimental sets. The initial dissolved oxygen in the water was measured immediately after the introduction of weighed larvae in each tank in all set of experiment. This was followed by sealing the water surface with a thin layer of liquid paraffin wax (Gene Chem., Canada) to avoid any diffusion of oxygen from the atmosphere. The probe reached almost to the bottom of the chamber while taking the measurement; however, it did not harm larvae in anyway as they were found swimming away from the location during the oxygen recording.|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the oxygen consumption of fish by a single electrode in a constant flow system. A cylindrical <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> with feces collector was employed in this experiment. The oxygen electrode of DO meter (YSI model 57) with stirrer was suspended from an arm which was manipulated by the vertical movement of water within a pipet cleaner. The electrode was alternated between inlet water and outlet water of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> at ten minutes intervals by this apparatus. The coefficient of relationship between fish metabolism measured by oxygen electrode and the values obtained by the Winkler method was + 0. 98 for the resting metabolism of yellowtail (Av. 136 ± 11 ml/kg/hr) at temperatures of 12. 1 to 13. 1 °C. It can be said from these results that the single oxygen electrode method: has superior efficiency (i. e. lower instrumental error) in comparison to double oxygen electrodes at inlet and outlet of the respiratory chamber; has similar accuracy to the Winkler method; and thus, merits the recording of hourly dissolved oxygen variations...|$|E

In experiment 1, two sets of two 4 -month-old male White Roman geese were allocated {{to one of two}} treatment groups. Each set of geese was inoculated either with formic acid or with phosphate buffer solution (PBS). After the acid or the PBS was inoculated into the esophagi of the geese, two birds from each treatment were placed in a <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> as a measurement unit for 4 h in order to determine methane production rate. In experiment II and III, 6 - and 7 -wk-old male White Roman goslings were used, respectively. Birds were allocated to receive either formic acid or PBS solution injected into the ceca in experiment II. Acetic acid or PBS solution injected into the cecum were used for experiment III. After either the acids or the PBS solution were injected into the cecum, two birds from each treatment were placed in a <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> as a measurement unit for 3 h; each treatment was repeated 3 times. The results indicated that formic acid inoculated into the oesophagi of geese was quickly converted into methane. Compared with the PBS-injected group, methane production increased by 5. 02 times in the formic acid injected group (4. 32 vs. 0. 86 mg/kg BW/d; p< 0. 05). Acetic acid injected into the ceca did not increase methane production; conversely, it tended to decrease methane production. The present study suggests that formic acid may be converted to methane in the ceca, and that acetic acid may not be a precursor of methane in the ceca of geese...|$|E

30|$|Many {{authors have}} {{verified}} {{the impact of}} handling stress on the respiration of crustaceans (Aldrich 1975; Carvalho and Phan 1997). Although an acclimation period of 1 – 2  h is suggested to be sufficient (Villarreal et al. 2003), the impact of stress duration can be varied greatly depending on the species and size (Dall 1986; Crear and Forteath 2000; Romero et al. 2006; Daoud et al. 2007). There is possibility of argument that {{the high rate of}} oxygen consumption in the initial 4  h of experiment under various parameters could be because of the artefacts of experimental procedures such as insufficient acclimation time. However, such arguments cannot be valid as it could be realized that the high consumption pattern at the initial phase was found only at the unfavourable environmental variables. Although our experiment was carried out only after the proper acclimatization, perhaps handling stress encountered while transferring the larvae from the acclimatization tank to the <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> along with the sub-optimal environmental conditions could have made the larvae to consume more oxygen at the initial hours. Meanwhile, at optimal environmental parameters the larvae might have quickly recovered from such stress level.|$|R

Six Swiss White Hill lambs were used in a 6 ? 6 Latin-square design with a 3 ? 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with measurements of energy metabolism being conducted using open-circuit <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers.</b> Treatments consisted of three basal diets, either grass alone or legume : grass ratios of 1 : 2 or 2 : 1. These basal diets were supplemented (1 : 3) with a control concentrate or with a concentrate containing 250 g/kg dry matter of S. saponaria fruits. The apparent total tract digestibilities of organic matter (OM) and neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) were reduced and the proportionate crude protein (CP) losses through faeces were increased (P 0 · 1) by the inclusion of S. saponaria in the concentrate, but increased linearly (P 0 · 05) indicates that supplementation with S. saponaria fruits is a useful means to reduce methane emission from sheep given both tropical grass-based and grass-legume-based diets.

Additionally, it is unknown if changes in SPA, measured in a <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber,</b> reflect changes in free-living physical activity level (PAL). RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Participants (N = 48) were randomized into 4 groups for 6 months: calorie restriction (CR, 25 % restriction), CR plus structured exercise (CR+EX, 12. 5 % restriction plus 12. 5 % increased energy expenditure via exercise), low-calorie diet (LCD, 890 kcal/d supplement diet until 15 % weight loss, then weight maintenance), and control (weight maintenance). Measurements were collected at baseline, Month 3, and Month 6. Body composition and RMR were measured by DXA and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Two measures of SPA were collected in a <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> (percent of time active and kcal/d). Free-living PAL (PAL = total daily energy expenditure by doubly labeled water/RMR) was also measured. Regression equations at baseline were used to adjust RMR for fat-free mass and SPA (kcal/d) for body weight. RESULTS: Adjusted RMR decreased at Month 3 in the CR group and at Month 6 in the CR+EX and LCD groups. Neither measure of SPA decreased significantly in any group. PAL decreased at Month 3 in the CR and LCD groups, {{but not in the}} CR+EX group, who engaged in structured exercise. Changes in SPA in the chamber and free-living PAL were not related. DISCUSSION: Body weight is defended in non-obese participants during modest caloric restriction, evidenced by metabolic adaptation of RMR and reduced energy expenditure through physical activity.

The RFI+ line consumed more feed than predicted from its performance, whereas the RFI− line consumed less feed. Each pig was exposed to 24 °C for 7 d (P 0) and thereafter to a constant temperature of 32 °C for 3 consecutive periods of 7 d (P 1, P 2, P 3). Feed intake, feeding behavior parameters, digestibility, components of heat production (HP; measured by indirect calorimetry in respiration chambers), and energy, nitrogen, fat, and water balance were measured in pigs offered feed and water ad libitum and individually housed in <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers.</b> Two identical <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> were simultaneously used, and 5 pigs of each line were measured successively. Whatever the trait, the interaction between line and period was not significant (P > 0. 10). On average, ADFI was greater in the RFI+ than in the RFI− line (1, 945 vs. 1, 639 g/d; P = 0. 051) in relation to an increase of the mean size of each feeding bout (128 vs. 82 g/visit; P < 0. 001). There was no line effect on nutrient and energy digestibility. Total HP tended to be greater in RFI+ than in RFI− lines (1, 279 vs. 1, 137 kJ·kg BW- 0. 60 ·d− 1; P = 0. 065), which tended to retain more energy (968 vs. 798 kJ·kg BW- 0. 60 ·d− 1; P = 0. 050). The sensible heat loss was greater in RFI+ compared with the RFI− line (644 vs. 560 kJ·kg BW- 0. 60 ·d− 1; P = 0. 020). The RFI+ pigs consumed more water (+ 981 vs. 657 g·kg BW- 0. 60 ·d− 1; P = 0. 085) and produced more urine (589 vs. 292 g·kg BW- 0. 60 ·d− 1; P < 0. 001) than RFI− pigs, whereas water evaporation was similar for both lines. On average, ME intake and HP declined by about 38 % and 20 %, respectively, from P 0 to P 1 (P < 0. 001). In contrast to ME intake, HP gradually decreased (P < 0. 05) from P 1 to P 3 {{in connection with a}} reduction of the activity related HP. The evaporative heat loss represented 30 % on the total heat loss on P 0, and this proportion significantly increased on P 1 (61 %; P < 0. 001) and remained constant thereafter. In conclusion, our results suggest that thermal heat acclimation in pigs is mainly related to a biphasic reduction of HP rather than a change in the ability of losing heat, and it did not significantly differ between RFI+ and RFI− lines despite a decreased HP in the latter ones...|$|R

A large majority of these have been discussed by Benedict and MacLeod (1) when they described a modification of the closed circuit method used in the Carnegie Nutrition Laboratory. All of the methods are complicated and require elaborate ap paratus. Since it has been shown by Benedict and Root (2) that the basal metabo lism of man may be predicted from the basal insensible loss of weight, and Levine, Wilson, and Kelly (3) found that the maximal variation of the in sensible loss of weight of infants from day to day under rigidly standard conditions rarely exceeded 10 per cent of the average, and Johnston and Newburgh (4) found the insensible loss of a man, over a period of 37 days, to vary within 10 per cent of the mean, it appears likely that the insensib'e loss of weight may be used to determine the basal metabolic rate of small animals. The insensible loss of weight, as defined by Isenschmid (5), is equal to the weight of the water vaporized, plus the carbon dioxide eliminated, mi nus the oxygen absorbed. Johnston and Newburgh (4) showed that the water of vaporization constituted from 82 to 104 per cent of the insensible loss of weight in man when the respiratory quotients were 1. 00 and 0. 707 respectively. Therefore, if the respiratory quotient is known, the weight of the water vaporized and the heat lost by vaporization of water may be ac curately found by the determination of the insensible loss of weight.

In study 1, measurement of the 24 h energy expenditure of seventy-nine Japanese subjects (40 (SD 12) years old) was performed in a large <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber.</b> During the measurements, the subjects wore a uniaxial accelerometer (Lifecorder; Suzuken Co.

In study 2, ten male subjects walked at six different speeds and ran at three different speeds on a treadmill for 4 min, with the same accelerometer. O 2 consumption was measured during the last minute of each stage and was expressed in MET. The measured TEE was 8447 (SD 1337) kJ/d. The accelerometer significantly underestimated TEE and PAEE (91 · 9 (SD 5 · 4) and 92 · 7 (SD 17 · 8) % chamber value respectively); however, there was a significant correlation between the two values (r 0 · 928 and 0 · 564 respectively; P< 0 · 001). There was a strong correlation between the activity levels and the measured MET while walking (r 2 0 · 93; P< 0 · 001). Although TEE and PAEE were systematically underestimated during the 24 h period, the accelerometer assessed energy expenditure well during both the exercise period and the non-structured activities.

The aim of this study was to determine whether individual variation in routine and fed metabolic rate was affected by daily light–dark rhythms in juveniles of Senegalese sole. The individual oxygen consumption measurements in Senegalese sole juveniles were determined by flow-through respirometry, at fasted conditions and after the fish were fed a single meal, the meal time started at 0930 h and fish fed ad libitum for 30 min. The measurements were made during 22 h, of which 8 h was in the light and 14 h in the dark, and started immediately after transfer to the <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> at 1100 h. The results suggest an influence of light–dark cycles in routine metabolism. It was observed that oxygen consumption increased during the dark phase in fasted fish (FAST) but was higher during the light phase in fed fish (FEED). However, when feed is provided during the light phase, juveniles are capable of shifting oxygen consumption rhythms to respond to the energetic demands of digestion and growth. These results suggest that routine metabolism varies according to the species natural habits as Senegalese sole {{is known to}} be nocturnal.

40|$|Abstract Background Soya and its {{derivatives}} represent nutritionally {{high quality}} food products whose major drawback is their high content of α-galacto-oligosaccharides. These are not digested {{in the small}} intestine due to the natural absence of tissular α-galactosidase in mammals. The passage of these carbohydrates to the large intestine makes them available for fermentation by gas-producing bacteria leading to intestinal flatulence. The aim of the work reported here {{was to assess the}} ability of α-galactosidase-producing lactobacilli to improve the digestibility of α-galacto-oligosaccharides in situ. Results Gnotobiotic rats were orally fed with soy milk and placed in <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> designed to monitor fermentative gas excretion. The validity of the animal model was first checked using gnotobiotic rats monoassociated with a Clostridium butyricum hydrogen (H 2) -producing strain. Ingestion of native soy milk by these rats caused significant H 2 emission while ingestion of α-galacto-oligosaccharide-free soy milk did not, thus validating the experimental system. When native soy milk was fermented using the α-galactosidase-producing Lactobacillus fermentum CRL 722 strain, the resulting product failed to induce H 2 emission in rats thus validating the bacterial model. When L. fermentum CRL 722 was coadministered with native soy milk, a significant reduction (50 %, P = 0. 019) in H 2 emission was observed, showing that α-galactosidase from L. fermentum CRL 722 remained active in situ, in the gastrointestinal tract of rats monoassociated with C. butyricum. In human-microbiota associated rats, L. fermentum CRL 722 also induced a significant reduction of H 2 emission (70 %, P = 0. 004).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 31 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 61 nondiabetic control subjects were analyzed. The 24 -h energy expenditure, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and sleeping energy expenditure (EEsleep) between 1 : 00 a. m. and 6 : 00 a. m. were measured in whole-body <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers.</b> Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). RESULTS: No significant differences in unadjusted EEsleep, BMR, and 24 -h energy expenditure were observed between the type 2 diabetic group and the control group. After adjustment for fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass, SPA, sex, and age, EEsleep and BMR were, respectively, 7. 7 and 6. 9 % higher in the type 2 diabetic group compared with the control group. This was equivalent to 144 +/- 40 kcal/day (P = 0. 001) and 139 +/- 61 kcal/day (P = 0. 026), respectively. Adjusted 24 -h energy expenditure was 6. 5 % higher in the type 2 diabetic group compared with the nondiabetic control subjects (2, 679 +/- 37 vs. 2, 515 +/- 23 kcal/day, P = 0. 002). In multiple regression analyses, FFM, fat mass, SPA, and diabetes status were all significant determinants of EEsleep and 24 -h energy expenditure, explaining 83 and 81 % of the variation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms reports in Pima Indians that basal and 24 -h energy expenditure adjusted for body composition, SPA, sex, and age are higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with nondiabetic control subjects and may be even more pronounced in Caucasians...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{expenditure}} {{was measured}} {{by means of a}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> in two groups of adult rural Gambian men. The first group (n = 29) had a low body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) 22). This study shows that the energy expenditure of Gambian men with low BMI is not different from that of Gambian men with normal BMI when the results are normalized for fat-free mass or for weight by analysis of covariance. In Gambian men the nutritional status thus does not seem to affect energy metabolism notably. No differences in respiratory quotient, diet-induced thermogenesis, net work efficiency, spontaneous physical activity, heart rate, or urinary catecholamine excretion were observed between the two groups. It is, however, {{interesting to note that the}} basal metabolic rate of Gambian men, regardless of their nutritional status, is approximately 10 % (range 4 - 12 % depending on the reference value used) lower than that predicted for individuals living in industrialized countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} 24 -h {{energy expenditure}} (24 -h EE) of {{mother and child}} was measured with a <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> (indirect calorimeter) {{in a group of}} 16 lactating Gambian women and was compared with that of a control group of 16 nonpregnant, nonlactating (NPNL) Gambian women. Breast-milk production (738 +/- 47 g/d: mean +/- SE) was adequate to allow a normal rate of growth of their 2 -mo-old babies (28. 0 +/- 2. 4 g/d). The combined 24 -h EE (mother and child) was higher (8381 +/- 180 kJ/d. P less than 0. 001) than that of NPNL women (6092 +/- 121 kJ/d). Two-thirds of this differences could be attributed to the child's EE and one-third to a greater spontaneous physical activity of lactating women. The energy retained by the child for growth in conjunction with the calorimetric measurements allowed the calculation of the extra energy requirements for lactation, which were found to be 2100 kJ/d. These results confirm the values of the current dietary recommendations for lactation, based on the energy cost of milk production...|$|E
40|$|Myostatin is {{a member}} of {{transforming}} growth factor-beta superfamily that plays an important inhibitory role during muscle development; in fact mutations of myostatin gene result in a hypermuscular phenotype. Moreover myostatin-deficient mice have a significant reduction in fat depots and a depression of adipogenesis. Little is known about myostatin function in muscle growth regulation in humans and in particular during caloric restriction. In the present work we quantified by real-time RT-PCR myostatin expression in muscle biopsies of a group of morbidly obese patients before and after weight loss obtained by biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). The patients reduced body weight by 38. 9 %, mostly due to fat-mass loss, showing also a significant reduction in the 24 -hour EE as assessed by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber.</b> Myostatin mRNA levels result clearly decreased after weight loss, suggesting a role in counteracting the progressive decline of muscle mass after BPD. Myostatin may provide therefore another mechanistic explanation for the control of energy partitioning between protein and fat, working against muscle wasting. Our data suggest that myostatin might represent an important regulator of skeletal muscle size also in conditions of food restriction in obese subjects...|$|E
40|$|Measuring and {{mitigating}} methane (CH 4) {{emissions from}} livestock is of increasing {{political and economic}} importance. Potentially, the most sustainable way of reducing CH 4 emission from ruminants is through the estimation of genomic breeding values to facilitate genetic selection. Enteric CH 4 emissions are difficult and expensive to measure, thus genomic prediction could provide significant, long term economic benefits. Implementation will require global collaboration to define a suitable measure and many thousands of records to ensure valid and accurate evaluations. A number of approaches for individual measures {{on a large scale}} have been recently proposed including fixed and portable <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers,</b> SF 6 tracer gas, laser detector systems and sniffers or spot samples at milking. Some studies have also shown promising results in predicting individual animal CH 4 emission from mid infra-red milk spectra data. It is currently unclear, however, how well measures between these approaches correlate. Comparison and validation of these novel phenotypes presents a huge task over the coming years. A crucial first step is to define a trait phenotype and measuring protocols to create a robust resource for the global sharing and comparison of data, and further, to measure correlations with production traits. Proposed phenotypes could be measures of “total methane emissions”, measured in grams CH 4 per day, or “methane yield” measured in grams CH 4 per kg dry matter intake (DMI) when DMI is available as a phenotype, or “methane intensity” measured in grams CH 4 per kg of produced human edible protein. Here, we describe how two recently established entities; an ICAR Working Group and the EU COST-Action network METHAGENE are working in close collaboration to successfully address these major challenges together with the Animal Selection Genetics and Genomics Network (ASGGN) of the Livestock Research Group of the Global Research Alliance (GRA) on agricultural greenhouse gases.

40|$|Studies on {{metabolism}} usually rely on {{measurements of}} oxygen consumption obtained in respirometry chambers. Despite rigorous standardization {{there is still}} considerable interindividual variation in metabolic rates which is often ignored. Furthermore, housing in respirometry chambers implies handling and exposure to a new environment, conditions {{known to be a}} source of stress in animals. The extent of stress response is known to be dependent on an individual’s coping style. Therefore, the extent of individual variation in respirometry data may be related to the expression of coping styles. The goal of this study is to determine whether the variation in oxygen consumption after a stressor is the resultant of an individual’s coping style. Our approach was to determine oxygen consumption in fish immediately after transfer to <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> and during the subsequent 22 h. In addition, the same individuals were subjected to 3 respirometry runs (22 h each) to address the question whether habituation occurs when fish are used in multiple runs and whether habituation potential is linked to coping styles. The same individuals were then subjected to an acute stressor and the escape behaviour and plasma cortisol were determined to assess coping style. Taken as a whole, the findings of this study suggest that individual variation in oxygen consumption in respirometry chambers are related to the expression of coping styles: individuals with higher oxygen consumption at the start and throughout the measurement period were shown to react passively (longer latency to escape) in a confinement stress. In addition, successive respirometry runs should not be assumed to result in habituation, as depending on an individual’s coping style either habituation (in the case of passive copers) or sensitization (in the case of active copers) can occur...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of supplementing exogenous cellulase on nutrient and energy utilization. Twelve desexed Boer crossbred goats were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design with 23 -d periods. Dietary treatments were basal diet (control, no cellulase), basal diet plus 2 g unitary cellulase/kg of total mixed ration dry matter (DM), and basal diet plus 2 g compound cellulase/kg of total mixed ration DM. Three stages of feeding trials were used corresponding to the three treatments, each comprised 23 d, with the first 14 d as the preliminary period and the following 9 d as formal trial period for metabolism trial. Total collection of feces and urine were conducted from the 4 th d of the formal trial, and gas exchange measures were determined in indirect <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> in the last 3 d of the formal trial. Results showed that cellulase addition had no effect (p> 0. 05) on nutrient digestibility. Dietary supplementation of cellulase did not affect (p> 0. 05) N intake and retention in goats. Gross energy (GE) intake, fecal energy and urinary energy excretion, heat production were not affected (p> 0. 05) by the cellulase supplementation. Total methane emission (g/d), CH 4 emission {{as a proportion of}} live weight or feed intake (DM, organic matter [OM], digestible DM or digestible OM), or CH 4 energy output (CH 4 -E) as a proportion of energy intake (GE, digestible energy, or metabolizable energy), were similar (p> 0. 05) among treatments. There was a significant (p< 0. 001) relationship between CH 4 and live weight (y = 0. 645 x+ 0. 2, R 2 = 0. 54), CH 4 and DM intake (y = 16. 7 x+ 1. 4, R 2 = 0. 51), CH 4 and OM intake (y = 18. 8 x+ 1. 3, R 2 = 0. 51) and CH 4 -E and GE intake. Results from this study revealed that dietary supplementation of cellulase may have no effect on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention, energy metabolism, and methane emission in goat...|$|R
40|$|Daily human energy {{requirements}} calculated from separate components of energy expenditure are inaccurate and usually in poor agreement with measured energy intakes. Measurement of energy expenditure over periods of 24 h or longer {{is needed to}} determine more accurately rates of daily energy expenditure in humans. We provide a detailed description of a human <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber</b> and methods used to determine rates of energy expenditure over 24 -h periods in 177 subjects. The results show that: fat-free mass (FFM) as estimated by densitometry is the best available determinant of 24 -h energy expenditures (24 EE) and explains 81 % of the variance observed between individuals (24 EE [kcal/d] = 597 + 26. 5 FFM); 24 EE in an individual is very reproducible (coefficient of variation = 2. 4 %); and even when adjusted for differences in FFM, there is still considerable interperson variability of the daily energy expenditure. A large portion of the variability of 24 EE among individuals, independent of differences in body size, was due to variability in the degree of spontaneous physical activity, i. e., "fidgeting," which accounted for 100 - 800 kcal/d in these subjects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to determine if}} a history of colic plays a role in carbohydrate absorption in infants consuming either apple or white grape juice. In this double-blind study, 31 infants (5. 0 ± 0. 4 months, 7. 5 ± 0. 9 Kg, 64. 1 ± 3. 8 cm, 29. 2 ± 3. 4 % fat and 5. 1 ± 0. 6 Kg fat-free mass) were divided into four groups and were fed 120 ml of either white grape (sorbitol free; 1 : 1 fructose to glucose ratio) or apple (sorbitol 0. 5 g/dl; 2. 3 : 1 fructose to glucose ratio) juice. Sixteen of the infants had a history of colic. During the study continuous physical activity (PA) and metabolic rate (MR) were measured for 0. 5 hours before and 3. 0 hours after juice load using an infant <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber.</b> Carbohydrate absorption was determined every 30 minutes after juice feeding by breath hydrogen (BH 2) gas analysis.

40|$|A reduced lipid {{oxidative}} {{capacity is}} considered {{a risk factor for}} the development of obesity, but a further impairment of lipid oxidative capacity is observed after weight loss. We aimed to define the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in skeletal muscle and in particular to study the mitochondrial and peroxisomal lipid oxidative pathways. Thus we measured intramyocellular triglyceride content (IMTG) and the expression of genes of lipid oxidation [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 B, and acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) oxidase 1] and synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase B) using RT-PCR analysis in muscle biopsies of morbidly obese patients before and after biliopancreatic diversion. Weight reduction significantly decreased IMTG while increasing insulin sensitivity, measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Moreover, an increase in glucose and a decline in lipid oxidation, as assessed by <b>respiratory</b> <b>chamber,</b> were observed. Weight loss reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (- 46. 7 %), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 B (- 43. 1 %), acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (- 37. 8 %), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase B (- 48. 7 %). Our results indicate that a defect of both peroxisomal and mitochondrial oxidative pathways at the muscular level may contribute to the reduced fat oxidation in obese subjects after biliopancreatic diversion. They also suggest that a depression of the de novo lipogenesis may account for IMTG depletion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) in the regulation of feed intake in age-matched broiler and layer cockerels. In addition, the effect of genotype on endocrine functioning and key metabolites of the intermediary metabolism as well as on the expression of muscular uncoupling protein (avUCP) was explored. One-day-old male broiler (Ross) and layer (ISA Brown) chicks were reared under standard conditions on commercial broiler starter and finisher diets. From 22 d of age, twice per week, 3 broiler and 6 layer cockerels were placed in open circuit <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers.</b> After adaptation, the animals were feed-deprived for 24 h, and heat production was measured by indirect calorimetry. During the subsequent 7 -h refeeding period, feed intake and DIT were measured. Blood samples were taken after feed deprivation and refeeding. Muscle samples were taken after refeeding for determination of avUCP expression. A significantly higher heat production per metabolic BW (MBW) in the layer compared with the broiler cockerels, independent of nutritional state, suggests that the broilers used a greater proportion of the metabolizable energy intake for growth. The DIT per MBW and per gram of feed intake was higher for the layer than for the broiler cockerels. However, feed intake per MBW was also significantly higher in the layer cockerels. Thus, no feedback effect of DIT on feed intake per MBW was observed, and the model formulated for adult mammals relating feed intake to DIT could not be corroborated. The muscular expression of avUCP was not different between genotypes, which does not support the hypothesis of an involvement of avUCP in the higher DIT measured in layer cockerels. Circulating uric acid, glucose, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels were significantly elevated in the layer compared with the broiler cockerels. As the diet was formulated according to broiler requirements, the higher metabolite levels of the layer cockerels might reflect a relative oversupply of dietary nutrients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tea saponin is {{considered}} a promising natural compound for reducing enteric methane emissions in ruminants. A trial was conducted to study {{the effect of this}} plant extract fed alone or in combination with nitrate on methane emissions, total tract digestive processes, and ruminal characteristics in cattle. The experiment was conducted as a 2 x 2 factorial design with 4 ruminally cannulated nonlactating dairy cows. Feed offer was restricted to 90 % of voluntary intake and diets consisted of (DM basis) : 1) control (CON; 50 % hay and 50 % pelleted concentrates), 2) CON with 0. 5 % tea saponin (TEA), 3) CON with 2. 3 % nitrate (NIT), and 4) CON with 0. 5 % tea saponin and 2. 3 % nitrate (TEA+NIT). Tea saponin and nitrate were included in pelleted concentrates. Diets contained similar amounts of CP (12. 2 %), starch (26. 0 %), and NDF (40. 1 %). Experimental periods lasted 5 wk including 2 wk of measurement (wk 4 and 5), during which intake was measured daily. In wk 4, daily methane emissions were quantified for 4 d using open circuit <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers.</b> In wk 5, total tract digestibility, N balance, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives were determined from total feces and urine collected separately for 6 d. Ruminal fermentation products and protozoa concentration were analyzed from samples taken after morning feeding for 2 nonconsecutive days in wk 5. Tea saponin and nitrate supplementation decreased feed intake (P 0. 05), whereas nitrate-containing diets (NIT and TEA+NIT) decreased methanogenesis by 28 %, on average (P < 0. 001). Total tract digestibility, N balance, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives were similar among diets. Ruminal fermentation products were not affected by tea saponin, whereas nitrate-containing diets increased acetate proportion and decreased butyrate proportion and ammonia concentration (P < 0. 05). Under the experimental conditions tested, we confirmed the antimethanogenic effect of nitrate, whereas tea saponin alone included in pelleted concentrates failed to decrease enteric methane emissions in nonlactating dairy cows...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to plasma metabolites and hormones participating as humoral signals {{in the control}} of feed intake, oxidative metabolic processes in peripheral organs also generate signals to terminate feeding. Although the degree of oxidation over longer periods is relatively constant, recent work suggests that the periprandial pattern of fuel oxidation is involved in regulating feeding behavior in the bovine. However, the association between periprandial oxidative metabolism and feed intake of dairy cows {{has not yet been}} studied. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate possible associations existing between single feed intake events and whole-body net fat and net carbohydrate oxidation as well as their relation to plasma metabolite concentrations. To this end, 4 late-lactating cows equipped with jugular catheters were kept in <b>respiratory</b> <b>chambers</b> with continuous and simultaneous recording of gas exchange and feed intake. Animals were fed ad libitum (AL) for 24 h and then feed restricted (RE) to 50 % of the previous AL intake for a further 24 h. Blood samples were collected hourly to analyze β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), insulin, and acylated ghrelin concentrations. Cross-correlation analysis revealed an offset ranging between 30 and 42 min between the maximum of a feed intake event and the lowest level of postprandial net fat oxidation (FOX(net)) and the maximum level of postprandial net carbohydrate oxidation (COX(net)), respectively. During the AL period, FOX(net) did not increase above - 0. 2 g/min, whereas COX(net) did not decrease below 6 g/min before the start of the next feed intake event. A strong inverse cross-correlation was obtained between COX(net) and plasma glucose concentration. Direct cross-correlations were observed between COXnet and insulin, between heat production and BHBA, between insulin and glucose, and between BHBA and ghrelin. We found no cross-correlation between FOX(net) and NEFA. During RE, FOX(net) increased with an exponential slope, exceeded the threshold of - 0. 2 g/min as indicated by increasing plasma NEFA concentrations, and approached a maximum rate of 0. 1 g/min, whereas COX(net) decayed in an exponential manner, approaching a minimal COX(net) rate of about 2. 5 g/min in all cows. Our novel findings suggest that, in late-lactating cows, postprandial increases in metabolic oxidative processes seem to signal suppression of feed intake, whereas preprandially an accelerated FOX(net) rate and a decelerated COX(net) rate initiate feed intake...|$|R
