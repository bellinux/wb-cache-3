The {{first part of the}} project deals with the evaluation of the relative performance benefits of using a vaneless stator in place of a vaned stator in a radial turbine. Using a commercial CFD code, a series of numerical models were developed of existing test turbine geometries consisting of a common turbine rotor with a series of different vaned and vaneless stator configurations. The results are compared with corresponding measured turbine performance data for a total of six turbine geometries. Steady state predictions showed good agre. ement with the experimental trends confirming the vaneless stators to yield higher efficiencies across the full operating range. Subsequent analysis of the numerical results compared the detailed internal passage flows for both types of stator, showing the vaned stator to incur generally higher overall levels of total pressure loss due to the combined effects of secondary flows, boundary layer growth and wakes from vane trailing edges. Transient analysis successfully captured the variation in rotor inlet flow properties with each stator design, showing the vaneless stators to deliver more uniform flow conditions around the rotor periphery. The second investigation involved the design and analysis of a series of vaned stators for radial turbines to determine the effect of the vane solidity and vaneless space parameter on stage efficiency. The designs were subsequently manufactured and tested as part of a full running turbine stage, and a body of performance data collated from which to <b>guide</b> <b>radial</b> <b>guide</b> vane design.

When choosing an appropriate {{guide catheter}}, the diameter {{and shape of}} the guide are the most important factors to be considered, and depend on the anatomy of the coronary artery and backup support required to cross the obstructive lesion. In turn, backup support of the guide catheter depends on the size and terminal shape of the guide rather than the route of intervention chosen and can be expressed mathematically. Many <b>radial</b> route-specific <b>guide</b> catheters have been developed by introducing extratertiary curves and angles to previous existing femoral guides. Backup support can be enhanced by various maneuvers and innovations like the “mother-child” technique. Computer-aided aortogram analysis can help in choosing the right catheter for anomalous coronary arteries.

40|$|Early telencephalic {{development}} involves {{transformation of}} neuroepithelial stem cells into radial glia, which are themselves neuronal progenitors, {{around the time}} when the tissue begins to generate postmitotic neurons. To achieve this transformation, radial precursors express a specific combination of proteins. We investigate the hypothesis that micro RNAs regulate the ability of the early telencephalic progenitors to establish radial glia. We ablate functional Dicer, which is required for the generation of mature micro RNAs, by conditionally mutating the Dicer 1 gene in the early embryonic telencephalon and analyse the molecular specification of radial glia as well as their progeny, namely postmitotic neurons and basal progenitors. Conditional mutation of Dicer 1 from the telencephalon at around embryonic day 8 does not prevent morphological development of radial glia, but their expression of Nestin, Sox 9, and ErbB 2 is abnormally low. The population of basal progenitors, which are generated by the radial glia, is disorganised and expanded in Dicer 1 -/- dorsal telencephalon.

Furthermore, disruption of accurate recall of the correct pattern of arms induced by increasing the delay period from 30 min to 1 or 6 hr, is associated with attenuated DA efflux during the retrieval phase of the task. The observed increase in DA efflux in the absence of reward at a 30 min delay and the minimal increase during consumption of the same quantity of food during poor performance after an unexpected 6 hr delay, argue against a simple relationship between DA {{function in the}} PFC and reward processes.

50|$|If the {{strength}} of the applied magnetic field is sufficient, it magnetizes the light electrons in the plasma, which therefore describe a helicoidal motion about the magnetic lines. In practice, this is achieved with magnetic fields in the range of a few hundred Gauss. The guiding center of each electron is forced to travel along one magnetic tube. This magnetic confinement prevents the uncontrolled expansion of the electrons in the <b>radial</b> direction and <b>guides</b> them axially downstream. The heavier ions are typically unmagnetized or only partially magnetized, but are forced to expand with the electrons thanks to the electric field that is set up in the plasma to maintain quasineutrality. As a result of the ensuing electric field, the ions are accelerated downstream, while all electrons except the more energetic ones are confined upstream. In this way, the electric field helps convert the electron internal energy into directed ion kinetic energy.|$|R

For this purpose, the axis deformation {{impact on the}} gas-dynamic stability margin and the coefficient of efficiency of axial compressor has been numerically investigated. The influence of guide vane (GV) axis was considered with invariable rotor blades and different variants of stator. The GV axis form was changed on the {{arc of a circle}} in the range of ± 15 % guide vane height in circumferential direction and in the axial direction in the range ± 10 % of guide vane height, increments ± 2. 5 %. As an object, for investigation was chosen a numerical 3 D model of transonic stage of axial compressor with the following values of basic parameters: circumferential speed in the rotor blade trips of 345 m/s, relative diameter of the hub being 0. 7, and coefficient of discharge being 0. 5. The stage was profiling by classic low Cu*r=const. Rotor and stator profiles for all variants under investigation were the same in the same radii. As to initial <b>radial</b> axis <b>guide</b> vane, the losses of total pressure in stator become substantially less throughout the height of blade in case there is a guide vane axis bending in axial direction in line of flow. Bending of the axis in the circumferential direction against the rotation leads to reducing total pressure losses especially in hub and shroud regions, and in the flow core there is no change. In future, the effects of a tangent pitch and a slanting flow can be of interest in case of the simultaneous bending in both directions, as well as when studying the influence of bending of the guide vanes, which are a part of a sector of stages and a multi-stage compressor {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions. </p...|$|R
50|$|However, for {{particles}} which mirror at safe altitudes, (in yet {{a further}} level of approximation) {{the fact that}} the field generally increases towards the center of the Earth means that the curvature {{on the side of the}} orbit nearest the Earth is somewhat greater than on the opposite side, so that the orbit has a slightly non-circular, with a (prolate) cycloidal shape, and the guiding center slowly moves perpendicular both to the field line and to the <b>radial</b> direction. The <b>guiding</b> center of the cyclotron orbit, instead of moving exactly along the field line, therefore drifts slowly east or west (depending on the sign of the charge of the particle), and the local field line connecting the two mirror points at any moment, slowly sweeps out a surface connecting them as it moves in longitude. Eventually the particle will drift entirely around the Earth, and the surface will be closed upon itself. These drift surfaces, nested like the skin of an onion, are the surfaces of constant L in the McIlwain coordinate system. They apply not only for a perfect dipole field, but also for fields that are approximately dipolar. For a given particle, as long as only the Lorentz force is involved, B and L remain constant and particles can be trapped indefinitely. Use of (B,L) coordinates provides us with a way of mapping the real, non-dipolar terrestrial or planetary field into coordinates that behave essentially like those of a perfect dipole. The L parameter is traditionally labeled in Earth-radii, of the point where the shell crosses the magnetic Equator, of the equivalent dipole. B is measured in gauss.|$|R

This study describes a complete system for creating an anatomically accurate 3 D human body model from living human scans of a specific person. The method provides accurate and personalized tissue deformation arising from articulated motions of human body regions such as the human hand, probably the most complex articulated region in the human body.; Our system approaches the problem in three stages. First, a person-specific hand model is generated from a single canonically posed palm image of the hand without human guidance. Tensor voting is employed to extract the principal creases on the palmar surface. Joint locations are estimated using extracted features and analysis of surface anatomy. The skin geometry of a generic 3 D hand model is deformed using <b>radial</b> basis functions <b>guided</b> by correspondences to the extracted surface anatomy and hand contours. The result is a 3 D model of an individual's hand, with similar joint locations, contours, and skin texture.; Second, a parallel skin deformation algorithm is presented suitable for SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architectures such as GPUs. It presents real-time performance of skin deformation arising from the motion. Joint weights of each vertex are automatically computed and used in skinning algorithms. Skin deformation algorithms for articulated subject such as SSD (Skeletal Subspace Deformation), PSD (Pose Space Deformation), and WPSD (Weighted Pose Space Deformation) are parallelized in SIMD manner and implemented on GPU fragment processors to obtain sufficient speed-up for real-time skin deformation.; Finally, a complete system is developed to create a deformable articulated human body volume from multiple 3 D MRI scans of an in vivo human body, which can produce anatomically accurate human volume deformation for articulated body animation. The system combines existing and new techniques that together address the practical issues involved in producing a detailed articulated volume model from scans. These include joint estimation from the actual skeleton, bone volume registration, smooth deformation that preserves the rigidity of the skeleton, and a staged registration process that incorporates a careful initialization as needed {{to deal with the}} strong local minima inherent in registering articulated bodies. A locally adaptive non-rigid registration algorithm is developed that greatly reduces the high degrees of freedom and data processing arising in registration of deformable articulated volumes. The registration step establishes a correspondence across scans that permits the last step, interpolation of the scans under intuitive joint control using an example based deformation approach that we extend from the surface to the volume domain.; The result is a volumetric model driven by standard joint control that incorporates detailed deformation based on real data. Visual presentation and quantification of articulated human body model and deformation have potential to contribute many applications such as medical studies of arthritis, bio-mechanics, robotics, ergonomics, medical education, rehabilitation, virtual reality as well as computer graphics and animation...|$|R
40|$|All-optical {{devices have}} {{attracted}} many research interests {{due to their}} ultimately low heat dissipation compared to conventional devices based on electric-optical conversion. With recent advances in nonlinear optics, {{it is now possible}} to design the optical properties of a medium via all-optical nonlinear effects in a table-top device or even on a chip. In this thesis, I realize all-optical control of the optical group velocity using the nonlinear process of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in optical fibers. The SBS-based techniques generally require very low pump power and offer a wide transparent window and a large tunable range. Moreover, my invention of the arbitrary SBS resonance tailoring technique enables engineering of the optical properties to optimize desired function performance, which has made the SBS techniques particularly widely adapted for various applications. I demonstrate theoretically and experimentally how the all-optical control of group velocity is achieved using SBS in optical fibers. Particularly, I demonstrate that the frequency dependence of the wavevector experienced by the signal beam can be tailored using multi-line and broadband pump beams in the SBS process. Based on the theoretical framework, I engineer the spectral profile to achieve two different application goals: a uniform low group velocity (slow light) within a broadband spectrum, and a group velocity with a linear dependence on the frequency detuning (group velocity dispersion or GVD). In the broadband SBS slow light experiment, I develop a novel noise current modulation method that arbitrarily tailors the spectrum of a diode laser. Applying this method, I obtain a 5 -GHz broadband SBS gain with optimized flat-topped profile, in comparison to the ~ 40 MHz natural linewidth of the SBS resonance. Based on the broadband SBS resonance, I build a 5 -GHz optical buffer and use this optical buffer to delay a return-to-zero data sequence of rate 2. 5 GHz (pulse width 200 ps). The fast noise modulation method significantly stabilizes the SBS gain and improves the signal fidelity. I obtain a tunable delay up to one pulse-width with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 7. I also find that SBS slow light performance can be improved by avoiding competing nonlinear effects. A gain-bandwidth product of 344 dB. GHz is obtained in our system with a highly-nonlinear optical fiber. Besides the slow light applications, I realize that group velocity dispersion is also optically controlled via the SBS process. In the very recent GVD experiment, I use a dual-line SBS resonance and obtain a tunable GVD parameter of 7. 5 ns$^ 2 $/m, which is 10 $^ 9 $ times larger than the value found in a single-mode fiber. The large GVD system is used to disperse an optical pulse with a pulse width of 28 ns, which is beyond the capability for current dispersion techniques working in the picosecond and sub picosecond region. The SBS-based all-optical control of GVD is also widely tunable and can be applied to any wavelength within the transparent window of the optical fiber. I expect many future extensions following this work on the SBS-based all-optical GVD control using the readily developed SBS tailoring techniques. Finally, I extend the basic theory of backwards SBS to describe the forward SBS observed in a highly nonlinear fiber, where asymmetric forward SBS resonances are observed at the gigahertz range. An especially large gain coefficient of 34. 7 W$^{- 1 }$ is observed at the resonance frequency of 933. 8 MHz. This is due to good overlap between the optical wave and the high order <b>guided</b> <b>radial</b> acoustic wave. The interplay from the competing process known as the Kerr effect is also accounted for in the theory. Dissertatio...|$|R
