50|$|The {{actuation}} mechanism {{is simply a}} piston and cylinder, similar to a small pneumatic ram. The tappet bore where a hydraulic tappet would normally reside, becomes the cylinder, and the <b>retainer</b> <b>assembly</b> becomes the piston. Pressurized air (nitrogen) is pumped into this cylinder which then causes the piston/retainer {{to rise to the}} top of cylinder, causing the valve to form an airtight seal with the seat. The compressed gas then becomes the spring, so to speak, but does not have the same traits as springs do at elevated rpm. A small light spring is sometimes fitted between the piston and retainer so that when the system is switched off the spring forces the piston down against the bottom of the bore, thus forcing the retainer upwards. This ensures that no crown-to-valve contact occurs when shut down.|$|E

Underwater electroacoustical transducer assembly uses precast silicone rubber compressed between ceramic crystal and metal container. Removable <b>retainer</b> ring holds <b>assembly</b> in place. Method provides proper stress loading, speed {{and ease of}} assembly, and way of removing transducer without damaging crystal...|$|R
60|$|At length, when affairs were {{ripe for}} their consummation, Duke Robert called {{together}} a grand council {{of all the}} subordinate dukes, and earls, and barons of his realm, to make known to them the plan of his pilgrimage. They came together {{from all parts of}} Normandy, each in a splendid cavalcade, and attended by an armed retinue of <b>retainers.</b> When the <b>assembly</b> had been convened, and the preliminary forms and ceremonies had been disposed of, Robert announced his grand design.|$|R
50|$|By the 19th century, {{unlawful}} assembly was the term used in English law for an assembly {{of three or}} more persons with intent {{to commit a crime}} by force, or to carry out a common purpose (whether lawful or unlawful), in such a manner or in such circumstances as would in the opinion of firm and rational men endanger the public peace or create fear of immediate danger to the tranquillity of the neighbourhood. In the Year Book of the third year of Henry VII's reign assemblies were referred to as not punishable unless in terrorem populi domini regis. It was suggested that legislation first became necessary {{at a time when it}} was usual for those landed proprietors who were on bad terms with one another to go to market at the head of bands of armed <b>retainers.</b> An <b>assembly,</b> otherwise lawful, was not made unlawful if those who take part in it know beforehand that there will probably be organized opposition to it, and that it may cause a breach of the peace. All persons may, and must if called upon to do so, assist in dispersing an {{unlawful assembly}}. An assembly which was lawful could not be rendered unlawful by proclamation unless the proclamation was one authorized by statute. Meetings for training or drilling, or military movements, were unlawful assemblies unless held under lawful authority from the Crown, the Lord Lieutenant, or two justices of the peace.|$|R
