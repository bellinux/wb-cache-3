40|$|Fault arcs in {{electrical}} installations occur extremely seldom. However, {{they can not}} be avoided totally. Insulation failure, flashover, malfunction or maloperation by service personnel can lead to powerful fault arcs. As a result switchgear installations and even substation buildings may be endangered by thermal and mechanical stress. Metal enclosed switchgears can withstand some hundred mbar overpressure, substation buildings e. g. constructed of bricks may be damaged by overpressures exceeding 3 mbar. The goal of this work is the investigation of possibilities to reduce overpressure due to internal arcs especially in switchgear rooms or substation buildings. The following measures are analysed:- pressure relief openings,- intermediate volumes and relief ducts,- fault arc energy absorbers. Encapsulated (gas insulated) switchgears are provided with overpressure relief devices which lead to the switchgear room. After fault arc ignition pressure rises in the compartment where the arc burns (arc room), the relief devices open and the overpressure in the switchgear room rises. The level of overpressure depends significantly on fault arc duration and power, which can be about some 10 MW in distribution systems. The overpressure reduction in the switchgear room can be achieved e. g. by sufficiently dimensioned pressure <b>relief</b> <b>openings.</b> Another possibility is the use of intermediate rooms as buffer volumes or pressure relief ducts, which can be installed on switchgears draining hot gases. Fault arc energy absorbers are cooling grids, which withdraw energy from hot gases generated by the fault arc with the result of overpressure reduction. The overpressure development is analysed by using two available program packages. The first one leads to pressure results, which are averaged values in the volume under consideration. The second one is a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool with three dimensional results. To quantify the effect of fault arc energy absorbers, experiments with a high-current test set-up are performed. The results of these investigations shall contribute to a safe design of measures for overpressure reduction in the case of fault arcs {{in electrical}} installations...|$|R
40|$|Internal arcs cause sudden {{temperature}} and thus pressure increase in electrical installations, which may endanger personnel, installation rooms or buildings {{as well as}} the security of power supply. Overpressure can be controlled by e. g. <b>relief</b> <b>openings.</b> The proof of internal arc withstand is usually performed by tests in high power laboratories or by pressure calculations especially in cases, where tests are impractical. Nowadays, there exist reliable pressure calculation methods, which are able to determine pressure rise due to internal arcing. For practical applications, two methods are of importance, the CFD calculation method, which provides spatially resolved results, and the standard calculation method providing spatially averaged results. However, the application range of these methods is limited. This is especially true if SF 6 -air mixtures have to be considered (SF 6 -insulated switchgear) or if arc energy absorbers are installed. In this thesis, both effects, which are important for pressure rise in the case of internal arcing, are treated. The key point of modelling SF 6 -air mixture flows of changing composition is the generation and treatment of reliable gas data. A further main focus is the modelling of arc energy absorbers. For this purpose, heat absorption and flow resistance are considered first of all separately. In order to describe both effects simultaneously, existing and improved model approaches are evaluated and appropriate model combinations are proposed. SF 6 -air mixtures and the effect of arc absorbers are implemented in both calculation methods {{for the first time with}} reliable gas data. Special care is taken on data handling and modification of the equation systems. The inclusion of the effect of absorbers is achieved by considering heat sinks and friction forces. Based on the standard calculation method, a versatile improved software tool (Improved Standard Calculation Method) for the determination of pressure developments is developed, which is fast, easy to handle, able to treat SF 6 -air mixtures and absorbers based on reliable gas data, platform independent and including any number of rooms and openings. Both calculation methods are validated by comparing measurements in different arrangements with calculation results...|$|R

A coupled thermal-hydraulic neutron physics code was developed. This was used for the Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Turbine Trip (TT) experiment planned and executed in the Peach Bottom Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in the USA. The test was originated by the quick closing of the turbine inlet valve, followed by the quick opening of the condenser bypass line and, in the core region, by the arrival of a pressure wave. The pressure wave cause void collapse and increase of fission core power for a factor 5 in a few seconds after the turbine trip. The overall scenario was successfully reproduced by the coupled Relap 5 /Parcs code.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis dissertation {{is concerned with the}} theoretical calculations of two-dimensional nonlinear wave loads on a horizontal deck of the coastal structure located in water of finite depth. The deck may be fully submerged, partially inundated or fully elevated above the still-water level. Two different approaches are used to calculate the wave-induced horizontal and vertical forces and overturning moment. One is based on the theory of directed fluid sheets, namely the Green-Naghdi (GN) theory of water waves, and the other is based on Euler's equations. The forces on the deck are calculated by integrating the time-dependent pressure around the body. The Level I GN equations are used to obtain an unsteady solution of the problem of propagation of flow of an incompressible and inviscid fluid over a fully submerged thin horizontal plate, an idealized model of a horizontal deck. A theoretical formulation of the problem is provided, and the solution of the equations are approximated by finite-difference equations. Euler's equations are solved with a finite-volume formulation and an Euler scheme for time derivations to approximate the loads of the flow of an incompressible and inviscid fluid on the deck of a coastal structure, whether it is submerged or elevated. The free surface between the water and air is captured by an interface capturing approach, namely the Volume of Fluid method. The computations are performed by use of the InterFoam solver of the Computational Fluid Dynamic's program, OpenFOAM. The results section of this dissertation is mainly concerned with the loads due to nonlinear waves of solitary and cnoidal types.

The numerical model took into account both the effect of fractures on the in situ bulk permeability {{and the increase in}} permeability resulting from the stress <b>relief</b> and <b>opening</b> of the fractures caused by excavation. Fracture patterns were estimated on the basis of field exposures in three orthogonal planes. The numerical model was calibrated for the in situ condition by varying the fracture stiffness until a close match (in terms of both magnitude and direction) was obtained with the equivalent permeabilities estimated on the basis of field pumping tests. Excavation of the shiplocks both with and without the use of temporary supports was modelled, and the resulting changes in stress and permeability in the surrounding rock mass calculated. In both cases, the opening of fractures subparallel to the shiplock channels resulted in an increase in the permeability of the ground, but when the vertical sidewalls were supported during excavation the increase in permeability was less marked. The results of the analyses highlight the effects of engineering activities on the permeability of fractured rock masses, and demonstrate that these effects can be controlled through the judicious choice of construction techniques and procedures. <br/...|$|R

Wave loads on coastal bridges due to tsunami {{and storm}} waves are studied through {{a set of}} {{laboratory}} experiments and numerical calculations. Effects of wave nonlinearity and entrapped air on wave loading under conditions where the bridge may be partially or fully inundated are of particular interest. In addition, effects of compressibility and scaling are investigated through numerical calculations. With the destruction of bridges during recent events such as the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Ivan in 2004, this highlights the importance of this research in understanding the mechanisms of failure during such events to prevent future coastal bridge failures. Destruction of these bridges is not only financially costly, but can prevent emergency services from reaching coastal communities, thus potentially contributing to loss of life. Along with the bridges, this research is applicable to other coastal and offshore structures, such as piers, submerged breakwaters and offshore platforms, in which wave loading or entrapped air is of concern. To investigate this problem, an extensive set of experiments is conducted on a flat plate, bridge model with girders, and a bridge model with varying percentages of trapped air that serves as a valuable benchmark for understanding wave loads on coastal structures, and bridges in particular. The wave cases tested include an extensive set of water depths, wave amplitudes and wave periods (for periodic waves) to cover a wide range of solitary and shallow-water to intermediate-water depth cnoidal waves. A range of model elevations was also tested to cover a range where the entire model is fully submerged below the water surface, to where the model is fully elevated above the water surface, {{and in the case of}} the model with girders, the girders are fully elevated as well. Experiments were conducted in a two-dimensional wave flume located in the University of Hawaii at Manoa's Hydraulics Lab in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The models used were representative of a 1 : 35 scale model of a two-lane coastal bridge, typical in an island community. To study the effects of entrapped air, a series of experiments is conducted where side panels were added to each side of the model to trap air between the girders. Then different percentages of air-relief openings are added to the panels to capture a range of cases where no air can escape between the girders, to where all the air can escape and the wave can freely interact with the bottom of the bridge deck. Data from these experiments show the largest vertical uplift forces and forces in the direction of wave propagation on a flat plate and a bridge model occur when the structure is near the still-water level (SWL). For the cases where air is trapped, the addition of air <b>relief</b> <b>openings</b> significantly reduces uplift forces. Many current empirical relations estimating wave loads on coastal bridges only take hydrostatic effects into account.

ComEd adopts a limit of 60 psi margin for the main steam isolation valve closure- unpiped safety valve margin (MSIVC-USM) analysis. The load rejection no bypass- unpiped safety valve margin (LRNB USM) analysis was also performed. At EOFP the limiting initial conditions for steam line pressurization occur at 100 % core power and 87 % core flow (1 00 %P/ 87 %F). For coastdown conditions of EOFP+ 1500 MWd/MTU, the state point 100 %P/ 87 %F is unattainable; therefore, the limiting state point for EOFP+ 1 500 MWd/MTU is 1 00 %P/ 1 00 %F. The lowest nominal set point for a Quad Cities unpiped safety valve is 1254. 7 psia. Because the unpiped safety valve margin analyses are not licensing analyses, some of the conservatism normally assumed in COTRANSA 2 analyses is relaxed.
