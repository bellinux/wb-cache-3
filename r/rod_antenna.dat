40|$|Terahertz {{radiation}} {{has many}} unique properties that {{lends itself to}} applications not possible elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelength is long enough to pass through many materials that are opaque in the visible spectrum but short enough to form sub-millimetre resolution images. The frequency band also contains the rotational and vibrational spectra of many molecules due to intra- and inter-molecular resonances allowing substances to be identified by their spectral signature. Potential applications for terahertz technology range from security to medicine to communications. Current terahertz imaging systems [1] are limited to acquiring {{one or a few}} pixels at a time leading to impractically long image acquisition times. Large terahertz imaging arrays are therefore needed to fully realise the potential of terahertz technology. To address this need a focal plane array of antennas is being investigated for terahertz imaging (Fig. 1). Dielectric <b>rod</b> <b>antennas</b> were chosen as the array elements as they are broadband, perform well in an array and have the potential for compatibility with superconducting detectors [2] and bulk micromachining fabrication processes.

As examples we present dielectric rod designs optimized for maximum gain and low sidelobes. These designs are compared with a conventional linear profile design. Measured results are presented and these are shown to agree well with the calculated radiation patterns. We show that improved gain and sidelobe performance is achieved using a non-linear rod profile compared to a standard linear profile. The generality of the approach is demonstrated with a shaped beam antenna design that has a cosecant-squared pattern. 10 page(s...|$|R

Such a radiometric system has to meet several key requirements concerning its thermal and spatial resolution and the image acquisition time.

30|$|Spinels are {{the class}} of {{compounds}} of the type M 2 +M 2 3 +O 4, which has attracted researches because of its versatile properties and applications in various fields [16]. When M 3 + = Fe, we get spinel ferrites with the general formula MFe 2 O 4 and the transition metal spinel ferrites are obtained when M = Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn etc. These spinel ferrites are studied more due to their magnetic property and semiconducting property [17]. Among all the ferrites, spinel copper ferrite {{is one of the}} most important ferrite and finds application as ferro fluids, humidity sensor, gas sensor [18] as catalyst for organic reactions and are used in multilayer chip induction, high speed digital tape or recording disks, <b>rod</b> <b>antennas</b> etc. [19]. In this study, we make use of magnetic property of nano crystalline copper ferrite in the removal of dyes from effluents by adsorption as this property of ferrites is not much investigated. Adsorption property of ferrites depends on its structure and composition which in turn depends on the method of synthesis and the distribution of cations in the crystal lattice [20]. The diverse routes available or adopted to prepare nano-sized spinel ferrites are ball-milling, sol–gel, co-precipitation, hydrothermal etc. [21]. However, these methods are tedious and require lot of time and are expensive.|$|R

50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a ferrite rod aerial), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>antenna</b> has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|E
50|$|In the LRP most of {{the radio}} {{operators}} were New Zealanders, but the LRDG radio operators were all from the Royal Corps of Signals. These men were skilled in communications {{and were able to}} maintain and repair their equipment without any outside help. On only three occasions did a broken radio prevent a patrol communicating with its headquarters. All LRDG patrols included one vehicle equipped with a Wireless Set No. 11 and a non-military Philips model 635 receiver. The No. 11 Set had been designed for use in tanks, and had transmitter and receiver circuits; the Royal Signals expected to use the No. 11 set to transmit and receive between 3 mi and 20 mi with the use of 6 ft or 9 ft antennas.The LRDG used Morse code for all transmissions, and were able to transmit over great distances using either a dipole antenna system attached to a 6.3 ft <b>rod</b> <b>antenna</b> mounted on the truck which was adequate up to 500 mi, or for greater distances, a Windom dipole system slung between two 17 ft tall poles.

To power the No. 11 set extra batteries had to be carried by the radio vehicles.The Philips receiver was used to monitor Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time checks which was vital for desert navigation.|$|E
50|$|The radio {{equipment}} carried on course must {{be capable of}} receiving the signal being transmitted by the five transmitters and useful for radio direction finding. This includes a radio receiver that can tune in the specific frequency of transmission being used for the event, an attenuator or variable gain control, and a directional antenna. Directional antennas are more sensitive to radio signals arriving from some directions than others. Most equipment designs integrate all three components into one handheld device. On the two meter band, the most common directional antennas used by competitors are two or three element Yagi antennas made from flexible steel tape. This kind of antennahas a cardioid receiving pattern, which means that it has one peak direction where the received signal will be the strongest, and a null direction, 180° from the peak, in which the received signal will be the weakest. Flexible steel tape enables the antenna elements to flex and not break when encountering vegetation in the forest. On the eighty meter band, two common receiver design approaches are to use either a small loop antenna or an even smaller loop antenna wound around a ferrite rod. These antennas have a bidirectional receiving pattern, with two peak directions 180° apart from one another and two null directions 180° apart from one another. The peak directions are 90° offset from the null directions. A small vertical antenna element can be combined with the loop or ferrite <b>rod</b> <b>antenna</b> to change the receiving pattern to a cardioid shape, but the resulting null in the cardioid is not as sensitive as the nulls in the bidirectional receiving pattern. A switch {{is often used to}} allow the competitor to select the bidirectional or cardioid patterns at any moment. ARDF receiver equipment is designed to be lightweight and easy to operate while the competitor is in motion as well as rugged enough to withstand use in areas of thick vegetation.|$|E
