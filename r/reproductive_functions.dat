The drones have two <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions.</b> They convert and extend the queen's single unfertilized egg into about 10million genetically identical male sperm cells. They {{also serve as a}} vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. Female worker bees develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16chromosomes for a total of 32one set from each parent. Since all the sperm cells produced by a particular drone are genetically identical, full sisters are more closely related than full sisters of other animals where the sperm is not genetically identical.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary psychologists seek to {{understand}} psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions</b> they might have served {{over the course of}} evolutionary history. These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances. In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenge}} hypothesis {{outlines the}} dynamic relationship between plasma testosterone levels and aggression in mating contexts in many species. It proposes that testosterone {{is linked to}} aggression when it is beneficial for reproduction, such as in mate guarding and preventing the encroachment of intrasexual rivals. The challenge hypothesis predicts that seasonal patterns in testosterone levels in a species are a function of mating system (monogamy versus polygyny), paternal care, and male-male aggression in seasonal breeders. This pattern between testosterone and aggression was first observed in seasonally breeding birds, such as the song sparrow, where testosterone levels rise modestly {{with the onset of}} the breeding season to support basic <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions.</b> The hypothesis has been subsequently expanded and modified to predict relationships between testosterone and aggression in other species. For example, chimpanzees, which are continuous breeders, show significantly raised testosterone levels and aggressive male-male interactions when receptive and fertile females are present.

60|$|Hildebrand {{has shown}} that with {{hermaphrodite}} plants which are strongly proterandrous, the stamens in the flowers which open first sometimes abort; and this seems to follow from their being useless, as no pistils are then ready to be fertilised. Conversely the pistils in the flowers which open last sometimes abort; as when they are ready for fertilisation all the pollen has been shed. He further shows {{by means of a}} series of gradations amongst the Compositae, that a tendency from the causes just specified to produce either male or female florets, sometimes spreads to all the florets on the same head, and sometimes even to the whole plant (7/5. 'Ueber die Geschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den Compositen' 1869 page 89.); and in this latter case the species becomes dioecious. In those rare instances mentioned in the Introduction, in which some of the individuals of both monoecious and hermaphrodite plants are proterandrous, others being proterogynous, their conversion into a dioecious condition would probably be much facilitated, as they already consist of two bodies of individuals, differing to a certain extent in their <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{variations}} occurring {{later in}} life, and transmitted to one sex alone, have incessantly been {{taken advantage of}} and accumulated through sexual selection {{in relation to the}} reproduction of the species; therefore it appears, at first sight, an unaccountable fact that similar variations have not frequently been accumulated through natural selection, in relation to the ordinary habits of life. If this had occurred, the two sexes would often have been differently modified, for the sake, for instance, of capturing prey or of escaping from danger. Differences of this kind between the two sexes do occasionally occur, especially in the lower classes. But this implies that the two sexes follow different habits in their struggles for existence, which is a rare circumstance with the higher animals. The case, however, is widely different with the <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions,</b> in which respect the sexes necessarily differ. For variations in structure which are related to these functions, have often proved of value to one sex, and from having arisen at a late period of life, have been transmitted to one sex alone; and such variations, thus preserved and transmitted, have given rise to secondary sexual characters.|$|E
60|$|The real {{difficulty}} in our present subject is not, {{as it appears}} to me, why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed, but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties {{as soon as they}} have been modified in a sufficient and permanent degree to take rank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; but we can see that the species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous competitors, must have been exposed to more uniform conditions of life during long periods of time than domestic varieties have been, and this may well make a wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild animals and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions</b> of organic beings which have always lived and been slowly modified under natural conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner.|$|E

We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is this surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the normal and abnormal action of the reproductive system. But we can see that species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous competitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more uniform conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well make a wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild animals and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions</b> of organic beings which have always lived under natural conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross.

60|$|In {{searching for}} facts which might throw {{light on the}} cause of the good effects from crossing, and of the evil effects from close interbreeding, we have seen that, on the one hand, it is a widely {{prevalent}} and ancient belief, that animals and plants profit from slight changes in their condition of life; and {{it would appear that the}} germ, in a somewhat analogous manner, is more effectually stimulated by the male element, when taken from a distinct individual, and therefore slightly modified in nature, than when taken from a male having the same identical constitution. On the other hand, numerous facts have been given, showing that when animals are first subjected to captivity, even in their native land, and although allowed much liberty, their <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions</b> are often greatly impaired or quite annulled. Some groups of animals are more affected than others, but with apparently capricious exceptions in every group. Some animals never or rarely couple under confinement; some couple freely, but never or rarely conceive. The secondary male characters, the maternal functions and instincts, are occasionally affected. With plants, when first subjected to cultivation, analogous facts have been observed. We probably owe our double flowers, rich seedless fruits, and in some cases greatly developed tubers, etc., to incipient sterility of the above nature combined with a copious supply of nutriment. Animals which have long been domesticated, and plants which have long been cultivated, can generally withstand, with unimpaired fertility, great changes in their conditions of life; though both are sometimes slightly affected. With animals the somewhat rare capacity of breeding freely under confinement, together with their utility, mainly determine the kinds which have been domesticated.|$|E

This animal does not emit its strong odour until more than a year old, and if castrated whilst young never emits it.[341] Besides the general odour, with which the whole body of certain ruminants seems to be permeated during the breeding-season, many deer, antelopes, sheep, and goats, possess odoriferous glands in various situations, more especially on their faces. The so-called tear-sacks or suborbital pits come under this head. These glands secrete a semi-fluid fetid matter, which is sometimes so copious as to stain the whole face, as I have seen {{in the case of an}} antelope. They are “usually larger in the male than in the female, and their development is checked by castration.”[342] According to Desmarest they are altogether absent in the female of Antilope subgutturosa.

Animal response seems to depend on body condition score, age (parity), nutrients available in the diet, and type of fat supplemented.

It has previously been established that the dominance hierarchy within the species {{is dependent on the}} highest ranking female (queen) and her ability to suppress critically important reproductive hormones in male and female sub-dominants. In sub-dominant males, appears that lutenizing hormone and testosterone are suppressed while in females it appears that the suppression involves the entire suppression of the ovarian cycle. This suppression reduces sexual virility and behavior and thus redirects the sub-dominant's behavior into helping the queen with her offspring. though the mechanisms of how this is accomplished are debated. Former research suggests that [...] pheromones secreted by the queen cause direct suppression of these vital <b>reproductive</b> hormones and <b>functions</b> however current evidence suggests {{that it is not the}} secretion of pheromones which act to suppress <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> but rather the queen’s extremely high levels of circulating testosterone, which cause her to exert intense dominance and aggressiveness on the colony and thus [...] "scare" [...] the other mole-rats into submission. Research has shown that removal of the queen from the colony allows the reestablishment of <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> in sub-dominant individuals. To see if a priming pheromone secreted by the queen was indeed causing reproductive suppression, researchers removed the queen from the colony but did not remove her bedding. They reasoned that if a primer pheromones were on the bedding then the sub-dominant's <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> should continue to be suppressed. Instead however, they found that the sub-dominants quickly regained <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> even in the presence of the queen’s bedding and thus it was concluded that primer pheromones do not seem to play a role in suppressing <b>reproductive</b> <b>function.</b>|$|R

60|$|Besides the {{foregoing}} {{primary and secondary}} sexual differences, {{the male and female}} sometimes differ in structures connected with different habits of life, and not at all, or only indirectly, related to the <b>reproductive</b> <b>functions.</b> Thus the females of certain flies (Culicidæ and Tabanidæ) are blood-suckers, whilst the males live on flowers and have their mouths destitute of mandibles.[336] The males alone of certain moths and of some crustaceans (e.g. Tanais) have imperfect, closed mouths, and cannot feed. The Complemental males of certain cirripedes live like epiphytic plants either on the female or hermaphrodite form, and are destitute of a mouth and prehensile limbs. In these cases it is the male which has been modified and has lost certain important organs, which {{the other members of the}} same group possess. In other cases it is the female which has lost such parts; for instance, the female glow-worm is destitute of wings, as are many female moths, some of which never leave their cocoons. Many female parasitic crustaceans have lost their natatory legs. In some weevil-beetles (Curculionidæ) there is a great difference between the male and female in the length of the rostrum or snout;[337] but the meaning of this and of many analogous differences, is not at all understood. Differences of structure between the two sexes in relation to different habits of life are generally confined to the lower animals; but with some few birds the beak of the male differs from that of the female. No doubt in most, but apparently not in all these cases, the differences are indirectly connected with the propagation of the species: thus a female which has to nourish a multitude of ova will require more food than the male, and consequently will require special means for procuring it. A male animal which lived for a very short time might without detriment lose through disuse its organs for procuring food; but he would retain his locomotive organs in a perfect state, so that he might reach the female. The female, on the other hand, might safely lose her organs for flying, swimming, or walking, if she gradually acquired habits which rendered such powers useless.|$|E

In the Huia of New Zealand the difference is wonderfully great, and we hear from Dr. Buller (3.

In most cases, differences of structure between the sexes are more or less directly connected with the propagation of the species: thus a female, which has to nourish a multitude of ova, requires more food than the male, and consequently requires special means for procuring it.

AMH levels did not change with weight loss in both responders and non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: In overweight and obese women with PCOS and reproductive dysfunction, a 20 -week weight loss intervention resulted in improvements in <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> but no change in AMH levels.

40|$|Animal {{and a few}} human {{studies suggest}} that polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) may affect male <b>reproductive</b> <b>function.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate if male <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> was associated with serum level of PBDEs. We evaluated, in a cross-sectional study, the effects of environmental exposure to BDE- 47 and BDE- 153 on reproductive hormones and semen quality, including markers of DNA damage and apoptosis, in 299 spouses of pregnant women from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine. Adjusted linear regression models indicated no strong associations between BDE- 47 or BDE- 153 exposure and markers of male semen quality or reproductive hormones. In the largest study to date we demonstrate that BDE- 47 and BDE- 153 exposure was not associated with altered semen characteristics or reproductive hormones, indicating that male <b>reproductive</b> <b>function</b> is not affected by the exposure level of these compounds in fertile European or Arctic populations.
