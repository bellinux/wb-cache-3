40|$|This {{document}} forms {{a report}} of work in progress <b>of</b> <b>STECF</b> EWG 12 - 02 which met in Rostock, Germany to provide an evaluation of status of stocks and fisheries in the North Sea and Kattegat. For NS most stocks except NS cod are near to exploitation at Fmsy. Mixed fisheries considerations for NS therefore relate only to exploitation of cod. Work needs for NS include the influence of multi-species considerations and changes in M. Development of mixed fisheries advice {{in the short term}} is available for NS. Development of mixed fisheries advice for the NS in the medium term is not possible by June. For Kattegat fisheries are dominated by single species fisheries with minor bycatch. Although some Kattegat cod are caught the amounts are below the current TACs Work needs for the Kattegat are dominated by need to give catch advice for cod {{in the absence of an}} agreed assessment.

40|$|This paper explores how contextual {{uncertainty}} {{and the use}} of the budgetary system explain cross-sectional variation in the organisational <b>role</b> <b>of</b> business unit controllers. We argue that there are complementarities between the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the budgetary control system (i. e. coercive vs. enabling) and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the controller (i. e. corporate policeman vs. business partner). Thus, we explore both the direct effect of uncertainty on the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the controller and the indirect effect through the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the budgetary control system. Using survey data from 134 business unit controllers, we find that uncertainty provides a partial explanation of the variation in the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> budgetary control systems and in the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> controllers. In particular, our data suggest alignment between the coercive (enabling) use of the budgetary control system and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> controllers acting as corporate policemen (business partners). These findings add to our understanding of the functioning of business unit controllers within their organisational context...|$|R
