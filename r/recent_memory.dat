40|$|Much {{remains to}} be {{discovered}} {{about the fate of}} <b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> in the human brain. Several studies have reported the reactivation of learning-related cerebral activity during post-training sleep, suggesting that sleep plays a role in the offline processing and consolidation of memory. However, little is known about how new information is maintained and processed during post-training wakefulness before sleep, while the brain is actively engaged in other cognitive activities. We show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that brain activity elicited during a new learning episode modulates brain responses to an unrelated cognitive task, during the waking period following the end of training. This post-training activity evolves in learning-related cerebral structures, in which functional connections with other brain regions are gradually established or reinforced. It also correlates with behavioral performance. These processes follow a different time course for hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent memories. Our experimental approach allowed the characterization of the offline evolution of the cerebral correlates of <b>recent</b> <b>memories,</b> without the confounding effect of concurrent practice of the learned material. Results indicate that the human brain has already extensively processed <b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> during the first hours of post-training wakefulness, even when simultaneously coping with unrelated cognitive demands.

40|$|Understanding the {{electrophysiological}} {{correlates of}} recognition memory processes {{has been a}} focus of research in recent years. This study investigated the effects of retention interval on recognition memory by comparing memory for objects encoded four weeks (remote) or five minutes (recent) before testing. In Experiment 1, event related potentials (ERPs) were acquired while participants performed a yes-no recognition memory task involving remote, recent and novel objects. Relative to correctly rejected new items, remote and recent hits showed an attenuated frontal negativity from 300 to 500 ms post-stimulus. This effect, {{also known as the}} FN 400, has been previously associated with familiarity <b>memory.</b> <b>Recent</b> and remote recognition ERPs did not differ from each other at this time-window. By contrast, recent but not remote recognition showed increased parietal positivity from around 500 ms post-stimulus. This late parietal effect (LPE), which is considered a correlate of recollection-related processes, also discriminated between <b>recent</b> and remote <b>memories.</b> A second, behavioral experiment confirmed that remote <b>memories</b> unlike <b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> were based almost exclusively on familiarity. These findings support the idea that the FN 400 and LPE are indices of familiarity and recollection memory, respectively and show that remote and <b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> are functionally and anatomically distinct...|$|R

40|$|People with {{synaesthesia}} have enhanced memory on a {{wide range}} of laboratory tests of episodic memory, but very little is known about their real-world memory. This study used a standard measure of autobiographical remembering (the Autobiographical Memory Questionnaire, AMQ) considering four constructs (Recollection, Belief, Impact and Rehearsal) and two time periods (<b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> from adulthood, remote memories from childhood). Synaesthetes reported more Recollection (e. g. sensory detail) and Belief (e. g. confidence) which interacted with time, such that remote memories are reported to be comparatively better preserved in synaesthetes. This cannot be explained by synaesthetes recalling more salient episodes (the groups did not differ in Impact). It suggests instead that childhood memories have a special status in synaesthesia that reflects the different neurodevelopmental trajectory of this group. With regards to Rehearsal, controls tended to report that more <b>recent</b> <b>memories</b> tend to resurface (i. e. adulthood > childhood), but the synaesthetes showed the opposite dissociation (i. e. childhood > adulthood) ...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging was used to study brain regions implicated in retrieval of memories that are decades old. To probe autobiographical memory, family photographs were selected by confederates without the participant’s involvement, thereby elim-inating many of the variables that potentially confounded previous neuroimaging studies.

By contrast, retrosplenial cortex was more active for recent events regardless of memory vividness.

After retention intervals associated with remote memory, previously observed familiarity preferences shifted to null preferences, whereas after a retention interval associated with intermediate memory,;the previously observed null preference shifted to a novelty preference.
