40|$|Subradiance, i. e. the {{cooperative}} inhibition of spontaneous emission by destructive interatomic interference, {{can be realized}} in a cold atomic sample confined in a ring cavity and lightened by a two-frequency laser. The atoms, scattering the photons of the two laser fields into the cavity-mode, recoil and change their momentum. Under proper conditions the atomic initial momentum state and the first two momentum <b>recoil</b> <b>states</b> form a three-level degenerate cascade. A stationary subradiant state is obtained after that the scattered photons have left the cavity, leaving the atoms in a coherent superposition of the three collective momentum states.

40|$|We {{consider}} several subtle {{aspects of}} the theory of neutrino oscillations which have been under discussion recently. We show that the $S$-matrix formalism of quantum field theory can adequately describe neutrino oscillations if correct physics conditions are imposed. This includes space-time localization of the neutrino production and detection processes. Space-time diagrams are introduced, which characterize this localization and illustrate the coherence issues of neutrino oscillations. We discuss two approaches to calculations of the transition amplitudes, which allow different physics interpretations: (i) using configuration-space wave packets for the involved particles, which leads to approximate conservation laws for their mean energies and momenta; (ii) calculating first a plane-wave amplitude of the process, which exhibits exact energy-momentum conservation, and then convoluting it with the momentum-space wave packets of the involved particles. We show that these two approaches are equivalent. Kinematic entanglement (which is invoked to ensure exact energy-momentum conservation in neutrino oscillations) and subsequent disentanglement of the neutrinos and <b>recoiling</b> <b>states</b> are in fact irrelevant when the wave packets are considered. We demonstrate that the contribution of the recoil particle to the oscillation phase is negligible provided that the coherence conditions for neutrino production and detection are satisfied. Unlike in the previous situation, the phases of both neutrinos from $Z^ 0 $ decay are important, leading to a realization of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.

Global quantities such as net electron loss from the target, net capture, and net ionization are predicted within experimental errors using a spherically symmetric optimized effective target atom potential with dynamical screening effects based on the time-dependent net ionization probability. The inclusion of target response is crucial in order to obtain correct positions and heights for the peaks in the net ionization cross sections. Effects due to cascading following multiple outer-shell excitation are found to be appreciable at energies between 10 and 100 keV/amu, but are overestimated by the statistical model.

40|$|We {{present a}} model {{calculation}} of the generalized parton distributions where the nucleon is described by a quark core surrounded by a mesonic cloud. In the one-meson approximation, we expand the Fock state of the physical nucleon in a series involving a bare nucleon and two-particle, meson-baryon, states. We discuss {{the role of the}} different Fock-state components of the nucleon by deriving a convolution formalism for the unpolarized generalized parton distributions, and showing predictions at different kinematics. 1. The meson-cloud model for the nucleon The convolution model for the physical nucleon, where the bare nucleon is dressed by its virtual meson cloud, has a long and successful history in explaining properties such as form factors [1] and parton distributions [2]. In this paper it has been revisited and applied {{for the first time to}} study Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) that have recently been introduced and discussed in connection with Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and hard exclusive meson production (for reviews, see Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6]).

40|$|Precession of aligned {{nuclear spin}} systems in ions {{recoiling}} {{from the target}} into vacuum (RIV) with consequent attenuation of angular distributions of emitted radiation is, in principle, a versatile method for measurement of g-factors of nuclear excited states of lifetimes in the pico-second range (Stone et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 94, 192501, 2005 and Stuchbery and Stone, Phys. Rev. C, 76, 034307, 2007). Calibration of the observed attenuations has been achieved in favourable cases through comparison with measurements on states having previously known g-factors and lifetimes. The general lack of suitable states with known g-factors has limited application of the RIV method. This paper concerns the present status of efforts to describe the states of excited ions recoiling into vacuum in detail so that the average interaction can be estimated with useful precision from a-priori theory. The calculations use the GRASP 2 K package (Froese-Fischer et al. 1997 and Jonsson, Comp. Phys. Comm., 177, 597, 2007 & 184, 2197, 2013) to obtain, for each <b>recoiling</b> ion change <b>state,</b> the individual possible electronic states, their configurations, lifetimes and hyperfine interactions. It is assumed that all possible ionic states are produced, up to a chosen excitation energy. This energy is selected to approximate the energy at which all states have lifetimes far shorter than the nuclear state of interest. It is further assumed that the ionic state total electron angular momenta are randomly oriented in space. The first estimates of the average attenuation of emission distributions, {{as a function of}} the product g τ of the nuclear state g-factor and mean lifetime, used an averaged precession frequency obtained neglecting transitions between electronic states. Improved calculations, which include such transitions, are described...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{identify}} the direction of an incident Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) via induced nuclear recoil. Our method is based on spectroscopic interrogation of quantum defects in macroscopic solid-state crystals. When a WIMP scatters in a crystal, the induced nuclear recoil creates a tell-tale damage cluster, localized to within about 50 nm, with an orientation to the damage trail that correlates well with {{the direction of the}} recoil and hence the incoming WIMP. This damage cluster induces strain in the crystal, shifting the energy levels of nearby quantum defects. These level shifts can be measured optically (or through paramagnetic resonance) making it possible to detect the strain environment around the defect in a solid sample. As a specific example, we consider nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, for which high defect densities and nanoscale localization of individual defects have been demonstrated. To localize the millimeter-scale region of a nuclear recoil within the crystal due to a potential dark matter event, we can use conventional WIMP detection techniques such as the collection of ionization/scintillation. Once an event is identified, the quantum defects {{in the vicinity of the}} event can be interrogated to map the strain environment, thus determining the direction of the recoil. In principle, this approach should be able to identify the recoil direction with an efficiency greater than 70 % at a false positive rate less than 5 % for 10 keV recoil energies. If successful, this method would allow for directional detection of WIMP-induced nuclear <b>recoils</b> at solid <b>state</b> densities, enabling probes of WIMP parameter space below the solar neutrino floor. This technique could also potentially be applied to identify the direction of particles such as neutrons whose low scattering cross-section requires detectors with a large target mass.
