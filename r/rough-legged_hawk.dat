25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawk</b> (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> (Buteo lagopus Pontoppidan), {{a species}} {{typically}} associated with more northerly regions, occurred in unusually high numbers on insular Newfoundland in the summers of 1988 and 1993, and some pairs nested in noncoastal areas on the island in 1993. We suggest that the island is an alternative breeding ground for the species during years of low prey abundance on the Labrador Peninsula. Our observations concur with hypotheses that <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> nomadically search for nesting territories and exploit areas near {{the limits of their}} breeding range during such years. Forest clear-cuts were used for foraging by pairs nesting in interior Newfoundland during 1993, which suggests that forest harvesting may have opened new alternative habitats for <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks...</b>|$|R

50|$|Grasslands are {{periodically}} hayed, mowed or {{burned to}} keep open field from changing back to forest. Many wildlife species benefit from these open field habitats. Waterfowl, bobolinks, {{and many other}} songbirds and small mammals use open fields to nest and rear young. Birds of prey such as American kestrel, northern harriers and <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> glide over these same grasslands in search of prey such as mice, voles and other small mammals.|$|R
50|$|The Colville River is a {{migration}} route for wildlife including moose, and a breeding area for gyrfalcon, peregrine falcon, and <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks.</b> The ecoregion {{is also home}} to a number of waterbirds.Mammals include the large ungulates moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), the predators brown bear (Ursus arctos) and wolf (Canis lupus) breed here, while smaller mammals include Alaskan hare (Lepus othus) and Arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryi).|$|R
50|$|The {{cycle of}} meadow vole {{abundance}} {{is an important}} proximate factor affecting the life histories of its major predators. Meadow voles are usually the most abundant small mammals in northern prairie wetlands, often exceeding 40% of all individual small mammals present. Numbers of short-eared owls, northern harriers, <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> (Buteo lagopus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and red foxes were related to large numbers of meadow voles in a field in Wisconsin. Predator numbers are positively associated with meadow vole abundance.|$|R

50|$|The Refuge is an {{important}} resting area for waterfowl migrating through Kansas. Thousands of mallards, blue-winged teal, Canada geese, and snow geese {{can be seen on}} the Refuge during their spring and fall migrations. The Refuge also provides valuable habitat for shorebirds, bald eagles, wild turkey, bobwhite quail, bobcats, white-tailed deer, and many species of warblers. The Refuge has been designated as an Important Bird Area and serves as a wintering area for bald eagles and dozens of red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, and <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> will vocalize alarm calls when intruders {{approach}} a nesting site. It {{is described as}} a downward slurring whistle, sounding like kiu wiyuk or a lengthy descending kee-eer {{similar to that of the}} red-tailed hawk. This cry is given in flight or from a perch every 15-30 seconds. During courtship, both sexes have been recorded to give a whistling sound that changes to a hiss. Following copulation, females will give a clucklike sound and males vocalize a whistling noise. Fledglings will give begging calls while waiting for parents to provide food.|$|R
50|$|The Monte Bello ridge's grasslands include California poppy, checker mallow, purple owl's-clover, bluedicks, and blue-eyed grass. Large mammals on {{the ridge}} include coyotes, bobcats, deer, badgers and {{mountain}} lions. Common raptors include red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, and American kestrels, and less commonly, <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks,</b> prairie falcons, merlins, and golden eagles can be seen during fall and spring migratory seasons. Monte Bello hosts {{a wide variety of}} owl species, including great horned, barn, pygmy, long-eared, western screech, and northern saw-whet. Secretive Virginia rails (Rallus limicola) inhabit the sag pond {{at the beginning of the}} Canyon Trail.|$|R

50|$|The <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{a member}} of the genus Buteo, a group of {{moderately}} large raptors exhibiting broad wings, short tails and wide robust bodies. This group is known as hawks in North America but referred to as buzzards in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Known predators of the Arctic hare are the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), {{gray wolf}} (Canis lupus), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), ermine (Mustela erminea), snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), {{gyrfalcon}} (Falco rusticolus), <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawk</b> (Buteo lagopus), and humans (Homo sapiens).|$|E
50|$|They also compete {{directly}} for lemmings and other prey with several predators, including <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks,</b> golden eagles, peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons, jaegers, glaucous gulls, short-eared owls, great horned owls, Eurasian eagle-owls, common ravens, wolves, Arctic foxes, and ermine. They are normally dominant over other raptors although may (sometimes fatally) lose in conflicts to large raptors such as other Bubo owls, golden eagles {{and the smaller}} but much faster peregrine falcons. Some species nesting near snowy owl nests, such as the snow goose, seem {{to benefit from the}} incidental protection of snowy owls that drive competing predators out of the area.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Fauna== Mammals that roam this refuge are brown {{bears and}} caribou. Raptors which prey {{on the many}} species of snakes, rodents, and fish in this area {{including}} bald and golden eagles, <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks,</b> gyrfalcons, and Peale's peregrine falcons. Marine mammals are common in the productive waters surrounding this refuge. Harbor seals, Steller's sea lions, and sea otters inhabit nearby coastal waters and lagoons. Harbor seals frequently haul out on sandbars in the lagoons and along the coast. killer, gray, and minke whales {{can be seen as}} they migrate along the shoreline and occasionally inside of Izembek Lagoon.|$|R
50|$|Amherst Island is internationally {{recognized}} for concentrations of wintering hawks and owls and {{is home to}} the famous Owl Woods nature reserve. Up to 10 species of owls have been recorded during a single winter. short-eared owls, long-eared owls and great horned owls are among the resident bird population. Visitors from the far and near north - snowy owls, saw-whet owls, and the rare boreal owl as well as eastern screech owls and barred owls - add to the owl population during late fall and winter. Both red-tailed <b>hawks</b> and <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> are usually present, and there are annual sightings of bald eagles, peregrine falcons and turkey vultures.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at {{about two years}} old. Breeding generally occurs during May but is variable depending upon dates of arrival at breeding grounds. The <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawk</b> {{is thought to be}} monogamous, mating with a single individual for multiple years. No evidence currently suggest otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Besides caribou, {{a visitor}} to the park may observe barren-ground grizzly bears and wolverines. Bird species such as the golden eagle, <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawk,</b> {{peregrine}} falcon, gyrfalcon, and swallows may be observed in the park. The last are found in large numbers and nest in the cliffs around the falls.|$|E
50|$|The {{ferruginous}} hawk (ferruginous = from Latin ferrum - iron, ferrugin-, iron rust, iron-rust color - reddish-brown), Buteo regalis (Latin, royal hawk), {{is a large}} bird of prey and belongs to the broad-winged buteo hawks. An old colloquial name is ferrugineous rough-leg, due to its similarity to the closely related <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawk</b> (B. lagopus).|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks</b> and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|R
50|$|The {{region is}} a noted {{location}} for observation of golden eagles and, {{to a lesser}} extent, bald eagles. In March and April, strong westerly winds help migrating flocks of eagles cross the Continental Divide {{so that they can}} spend the summer on the Great Plains. During these months, over 800 golden eagles and 129 bald eagles have been observed heading east. From mid-September through October, a similar migration occurs, but in the opposite direction. This is also a migration route used by other raptors such as northern goshawks, red-tailed <b>hawks,</b> and <b>rough-legged</b> <b>hawks.</b> Canada geese, tundra swans, and snow geese also use the pass during migration periods. The golden eagles and other birds can be observed from a distance as close as 100 to 500 ft.|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{multiple}} taxa across broad-scales suggest that species distributions are shifting poleward {{in response to}} global climate change. Recognizing the influence of distribution shifts on population indices {{will be an important}} part of interpreting trends within management units because current practice often assumes that changes in local populations reflect local habitat conditions. However, the individual- and population-level processes that drive distribution shifts may occur across a large, regional scale and {{have little to do with}} the habitats within the management unit. We examined the latitudinal center of abundance for the winter distributions of six western North America raptor species using Christmas Bird Counts from 1975 â€“ 2011. Also, we considered whether population indices within western North America Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) were explained by distribution shifts. All six raptors had significant poleward shifts in their wintering distributions over time. <b>Rough-legged</b> <b>Hawks</b> (Buteo lagopus) and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) showed the fastest rate of change, with 8. 41 km yrâˆ’ 1 and 7. 74 km yrâˆ’ 1 shifts, respectively. Raptors may be particularly responsive to warming winters because of variable migration tendencies, intraspecific competition for nesting sites that drives males to winter farther north, or both. Overall, 40 % of BCR population trend models were improved by incorporating information about wintering distributions; however, support for the effect of distribution on BCR indices varied by species with <b>Rough-legged</b> <b>Hawks</b> showing the most evidence. These results emphasize the importance of understanding how regional distribution shifts influence local-scale population indices. If global climate change is altering distribution patterns, then trends within some management units may not reflect changes in local habitat conditions. The methods used to monitor and manage bird populations within local BCRs will fundamentally change as species experience changes in distribution in response to climate change...|$|R
