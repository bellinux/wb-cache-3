The analysis will cover the global product chain and its different actors. <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals consist of 17 elements of the periodic table; the 15 lanthanides, scandium and yttrium. Despite their name, these elements are not rare, but quite abundant all over the earth’s crust. Nevertheless, their concentration in the deposits is often very low and they are difficult to extract and refine. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals are similar in their characteristics {{and can be used}} for many different applications. <b>Rare</b> <b>earths</b> are commonly used in green technology since their unique properties can save weight and increase efficiency in products such as light bulbs, generators in wind power plants, and in different parts of hybrid and electric vehicles. The focus in this report will be on the product chains of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals used in permanent magnets and batteries used in hybrid and electric vehicles, these are: neodymium, praseodymium, lanthanum, dysprosium, cerium and terbium. In nature these elements do not occur as metals and many complicated processes are needed to convert them into metals. The product chain starts with the mining and separation processes, next comes further refining and separation processes, and then production of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals and alloys before they can be shaped into parts in a final product. In total China has more than 95 % of the global market for mining and separation processes for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals, also the production of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals and alloys occur to a large extent in China. The production of most permanent magnets also takes place in China, but there is also production in Japan, Finland and Germany. Japanese car manufacturers have most of their parts produced within Japanese borders, which means that most permanent magnets used in hybrid and electric vehicles are produced in Japan. The same is true for the NiHM batteries, about 95 % of those that are inside these vehicles today are produced in Japan by Japanese manufacturers. The markets for green technology seem to expand, creating an increasing demand for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals. To meet the demand with a larger supply there is need for solutions such as new mining projects, reopening of closed mines, or recycling and recovering of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from <b>scrap</b> products and mine tailings. The urge for more supply of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals and also rising prices presents a good incentive for recycling and recovering different <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> metals from discarded products. These recycling and recovering processes are technically and often economically very demanding. Today there are processes that could recover <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> {{with a high level of}} purity, but the problem is often the huge costs for the processes as well as handling of waste chemicals and materials that might be toxic. New processes will have to be developed. There has been research for new processes, and recycling/recovering plants are planned to be constructed in Japan as well as other countries. This report will also look at the potential for having parts of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> product chain in Sweden, since the country has both the physical resources and also metallurgical knowledge. With this in mind we discussed the possibilities of eventually operating the processes in the product chain in Sweden, and aspects of this scenario...|$|R

Effect of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> Y 2 O 3 content on gradient bioceramic composite coating was studied. The experimental {{results indicated that}} adding <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> can refine grain.

40|$|AbstractChina is {{currently}} the largest producer of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> in the world, mining at least 90 % of world total production. Because of China׳s dominant position in global <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> production and the constant development of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> terminal industries, the study of China׳s <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> supply trends has gradually been a hot topic of world interest. However, the literature shows that previous research has mainly focused on the estimation of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> supply and its influence based on experiential judge of current and premonitory new <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> production capacity, rather than on quantitative modeling. The results are usually estimations of the productions of near future rather than longer term. Forecasts by mine types are particularly rare. Considering the different applications and demands of different <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements, the Generalized Weng model, a widely used quantitative model in exhaustible resource forecast, is adopted in this study to predict {{the production of the}} three major <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> in China (namely, mixed <b>rare</b> <b>earth,</b> bastnasite and ion-absorbed <b>rare</b> <b>earth)</b> before 2050. The results show that production of mixed <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> will peak in 2014 at 62, 757 t, followed thereafter by an annual decline of 2 %; production of bastnasite will peak in 2018 at 32, 312 t, preceded by an annual increase of 1. 67 % and followed by an annual decrease of 4 %; production of ion-absorbed <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> will peak in 2024 at 45, 793 t, preceded by an annual increase of 1. 72 % and followed by an annual decrease of 4 %. Based on these findings, Chinese government should enforce environmental and resource exhaustible taxes soon and different domestic regulations for different <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> according to their different production potential. Countries without resource endowments should make efforts to develop <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> recycling technologies and seek substitutes for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> resources, in addition to keeping good international trading relationships.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of our studies on the optical properties, doping mechanisms, and optical signal {{amplification}} processes of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer optical fiber and waveguide amplifiers. First, we develop our <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymers and investigate the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doping mechanisms. Second, we experimentally measure the optical properties of these materials and optimize these properties by designing the polymer structures and compositions. Thirdly, a numerical simulation model is developed to evaluate the optical performance of fiber and planar waveguide amplifiers based on these materials. ^ Due to the qualitatively different features of our <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer materials from their glass counterparts, ran earth ions can be doped into polymer hosts in extremely high concentrations, making short length optical amplification devices feasible in <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer systems. We fabricate our <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymers and measure their optical properties, such as the absorption spectra, the emission spectra and the metastable state lifetimes. Further, we calculate the optical transition cross-sections from the measured absorption and emission spectra as well as the fluorescence decay rate. The viability of light amplification is investigated in <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer optical devices based on planar waveguide as well as cylindrical waveguide configurations. The dependence of amplification performance on various parameters of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped amplifiers are studied by numerical calculations. Simulation results are utilized to optimize the configurations of our <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped optical amplifiers. ^ An important issue in <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped systems is the concentration effect.

Based on this technique, the dissociation constants of tetrakis <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> chromophores in <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymers are determined.

40|$|<b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> {{elements}} are applied in China to improve crop production, {{and the distribution}} patterns of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements in native plants have widely been reported. But our knowledge is still limited about the dose-dependent accumulation of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements in agricultural crops after application of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements. Effects of lanthanum and mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements were studied in pot experiments on the accumulation of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements in maize plants. All plant samples were divided into plant tops and roots. On addition of mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements and lanthanum to the soil, a significant dose-dependent accumulation of individual <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element(s) {{was found in the}} roots and in the plant tops. Application of mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements at > 10 mg kg(- 1) soil, resulted in a significant increase in contents of light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements in the roots, and at a dose of 50 mg kg(- 1) soil, a similar phenomenon was found in the plant tops. When mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements were replaced by lanthanum alone, at a dose higher than 10 mg La kg(- 1) soil, a significant increase in La content occurred in the roots and in the plant tops. The content ratio of La to Ce in maize plants appeared to increase as the application doses of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element(s) increased. At a highest dose (50 mg kg(- 1) soil), the transport of the absorbed La from the roots to the plant tops might be substantially reduced after treatment with lanthanum alone, compared with mixtures of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements. Increasing the application doses of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element(s) appeared to cause a positive Gd and negative Ce anomaly in the roots and in the plant tops, and the anomaly was more obvious in the plant tops than in the roots.

In the first study, {{the use of}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) complexes as stable actiable tracers, a method of stable-isotope tracing with post-sampling neutron activation analysis, was explored. The persistence of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> DTPA complexes in estuarine waters was measured in simulated laboratory studies and in two field studies conducted in the South Shore Marina in Newport, Oregon. The ability to use more than one <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> DTPA tracer simultaneously in a multitracing experiment was also tested in one field experiment. In the second study, theoretical calculations, laboratory experiments, and field experiments were used to study the solubility of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements in river water. The field experiments consisted of measuring the soluble <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elemental concentrations for seven Pacific Northwest rivers (Columbia, Fraser, Klamath, Mary's, Rougue, Sacramento, and Willamette) using radiochemical neutron activation analyses. The laboratory experiments consisted of measuring the soluble <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elemental concentrations in a mixture (sediments and water) from the Columbia or Willamette River as the pH was changed from 6 to 8. Also, the absorption of Tm on Willamette River sediments was studied.

40|$|<b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> element {{geochemistry}} in carbonate rocks is utilized increasingly {{for studying}} both modern oceans and palaeoceanography, with additional applications for investigating water–rock interactions in groundwater and carbonate diagenesis. However, {{the study of}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element geochemistry in ancient rocks requires the preservation of their distribution patterns through subsequent diagenesis. The subjects of this study, Pleistocene scleractinian coral skeletons from Windley Key, Florida, have undergone partial to complete neomorphism from aragonite to calcite in a meteoric setting; they allow direct comparison of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element distributions in original coral skeleton and in neomorphic calcite. Neomorphism occurred in a vadose setting along a thin film, with degradation of organic matter playing an initial role in controlling the morphology of the diagenetic front. As expected, minor element concentrations vary significantly between skeletal aragonite and neomorphic calcite, with Sr, Ba and U decreasing in concentration and Mn increasing in concentration in the calcite, suggesting that neomorphism took place in an open system. However, <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements were largely retained during neomorphism, with precipitating cements taking up excess <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements released from dissolved carbonates from higher in the karst system. Preserved <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element patterns in the stabilized calcite closely reflect the original <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element patterns of the corals and associated reef carbonates. However, minor increases in light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element depletion and negative Ce anomalies may reflect shallow oxidized groundwater processes, whereas decreasing light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element depletion may reflect mixing of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements from associated microbialites or contamination from insoluble residues. Regardless of these minor disturbances, {{the results indicate that}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements, unlike many minor elements, behave very conservatively during meteoric diagenesis. As the meteoric transformation of aragonite to calcite is a near worst case scenario for survival of original marine trace element distributions, this study suggests that original <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element patterns may commonly be preserved in ancient limestones, thus providing support for the use of ancient marine limestones as proxies for marine <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> element geochemistry...|$|R

The microstructure of coating {{is similar to that of}} solidification bath, and which is made up of phases of rich aluminum, rich zinc, rich silicon and <b>rare</b> <b>earth,</b> and intermetallic layer of Al-Zn-Fe-Si. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> phase is needle or rod, and mainly distributed inside rich zinc phase and on the interface between the coating and steel substrate. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> has no obvious influence on coating grain and spangle size. The appropriate addition of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> would be helpful to improve the coating bending formability and corrosion resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{deactivation}} of USY zeolites {{with different}} <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> contents {{due to the}} coke formed from n-heptane at 450 oC was studied. The {{results show that the}} presence of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements decreases the cracking and coking activities, increasing catalytic stability. However, reaction selectivity was not significantly influenced. The greater the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> content, the lower the coking rates and the coke contents. The TPO/DSC profiles suggested that the catalytic effect of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> elements promoted coke oxidation...|$|R
