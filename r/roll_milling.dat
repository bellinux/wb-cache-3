40|$|Common {{dispersion}} {{methods such as}} ultrasonic sonication, planetary centrifugal {{mixing and}} magnetic dispersion have been used extensively to achieve moderate exfoliation of nanoparticles in polymer matrix. In this study, {{the effect of adding}} three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> to these three dispersion methods for nanoclay dispersion into epoxy matrix was investigated. A combination of each of these mixing methods with three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> showed varying results relative to the unmodified polymer laminate. A significant exfoliation of the nanoparticles in the polymer structure was obtained by dispersing the nanoclay combining three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> to magnetic and planetary centrifugal mixing methods. This exfoliation promoted a stronger interfacial bond between the matrix and the fiber, which increased the final properties of the E-glass/epoxy nanocomposite. However, a combination of ultrasound sonication and three <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> on the other hand, resulted in poor clay exfoliation; the sonication process degraded the polymer network, which adversely affected the nanocomposite final properties relative to the unmodified E-glass/epoxy polymer...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of improved technology for the preparation of coal-water slurries that have potential for replacing fuel oil in direct combustion. Detailed investigations of the effect of solids content and chemical additives on the rheology of coal-water slurries, prepared with fines produced by the ball milling of Pittsburgh No. 8 coal, were conducted during {{the first phase of the}} research program.

The research during this quarter was, therefore, directed towards: (1) establishing the relationship between the packing characteristic of fines and the viscosity of slurries prepared with the fines; (2) investigation of the effect of mixing distribution on the rheology; and (3) study of the effect of grinding environment in the ball mill on the rheology of coal-water slurries...|$|E
40|$|Carbon nanofillers such as {{graphite}} nanoplatelets (GNPs) and vapour grown carbon nanofibres (VGCNFs) {{have enormous}} potential for developing thermal interface materials (TIMs), mainly {{due to their}} high thermal conductivity. In this project GNPs, VGCNFs and carbon black (CB) fillers were dispersed in the compliant polymer matrices, rubbery epoxy and silicone, to form composites. Mechanical mixing, dual asymmetric centrifuge speed mixing, three-roll milling or combined sonication and solvent mixing were used to produce composites. The effects of processing technique, wt. % offiller(s), particle size and silane-functionalisation of fillers on the properties of composites were studied. Composites were characterised mainly in terms of morphology, texture, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. The interfacial thermal transport performance of carbon nanofiller/polymer composites was studied using a steady state method, {{with a view to}} their use as 'thermal interface adhesives and thermal pads. <b>Roll</b> <b>milling</b> was found to be the best method for producing composites with superior transport properties. GNP/rubbery epoxy and GNP/silicone composites produced by <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> have thermal conductivities in the range of 1 - 3 W/m. K with 8 - 25 wt. % GNP. The thermal conductivities of the composites increase with increasing GNP loading and particle size but slightly decrease with silane-functionalisation of GNPs. Composites produced using GNPs) synthesised (in-ho~se) via graphite, oxidation and thermal exfoliation offered improved transport properties compared to corresponding composites produced with commercial GNPs. Development of good interconnects between carbon nanofillers was found to be vital for producing composites with improved transport properties. GNP/silicone composites are more compliant materials than GNP/rubbery epoxy composites. VGCNF/rubbery epoxy composites have thermal conductivities in the range of 0. 2 - 1. 8 W/m. K with 2 - 40 wt. % VGCNF. VGCNFs increase the compressive strength of both rubbery epoxy and silicone without compromising their compliant nature. The thermal conductivity of CB/polymer composites reached ~O. 2 - 0. 3 W/m. K with 8 - 36 wt. % CB, depending upon the CB used. CB incorporation improved dispersion of GNPs in hybrid CB/GNP/rubbery epoxy composites and produced a thermal paste-type morphology. Similarly, VGCNFs improved the dispersion of GNPs in GNPNGCNF/rubbery epoxy hybrid composites but reduced the density of interconnects between GNPs. GNP/rubbery epoxy and VGCNF/rubbery epoxy composites offered the best performance as thermal interface adhesives compared to CB/rubbery epoxy and commercial thermal interface adhesive. The thermal contact resistance of the adhesives depends on their viscosity/conformability, bond line thickness, filler particle size, surface roughness of the substrate and thermal conductivity.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to quantitatively analyze the {{dispersion}} ability of different methods for the preparation of vapor grown carbon nanofiber - epoxy composites. Four different dispersion methods were used, differing in stress level intensity: blender mixing, capillary rheometry mixing, 3 <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> and planetary centrifuge mixing. Furthermore, the relationship between dispersion and DC conductivity of the composites was evaluated. For the dispersion analysis, four nanofiber concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 3. 0 wt. % were prepared for each method, while the DC measurements were performed for eight concentrations, ranging from 0. 0 to 4. 0 wt. %. The dispersion was analyzed by transmitted light optical microscopy and greyscale analysis, following a methodology previously established. The results show that as the VGCNF content increases the dispersion level decreases, {{as indicated by the}} increase of the variance of the corresponding greyscale histograms. The 3 roll-mill method produces the samples with the highest dispersion levels, whilst the samples from the remaining methods show large VGCNF agglomerates. The dispersion was also estimated calculated {{along the length of the}} samples, indicating a symmetric variation of dispersion from the center. The dispersion method also strongly influences the overall composite electrical response. No relationship was found between the electrical conductivity and the greyscale analysis achieved by the different methods. Thus, this method for the quantification of dispersion works well for lengthscales around 0. 1 μm, but this is above the relevant scale that determines the electrical response...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of improved technology for the preparation of coal-water slurries that have potential for replacing fuel oil in direct combustion. This should be of major importance to the United States in its efforts to reduce dependence on imported oil and to rely more on its enormous low-cost coal resources. In accordance with this objective, in the first stage of this project, considerable work was conducted to standardize experimental procedures for sample preparation, coal grinding, and Theological measurements to assure reproducibility of the experimental results. Since a Haake RV- 12 viscometer with an MV-DIN sensor system was found to give the most reproducible results for measurement of slurry viscosities, it has subsequently been used for all of our Theological measurements. Methods were developed for applying the acoustophoresis technique for studying the electrokinetic behavior of concentrated coal-water suspensions. These measurements were carried out using this technique to identify the potential of chemical additives for functioning as reagents for effective dispersion.

40|$|A {{commercial}} {{unsaturated polyester}} resin {{has been used}} in combination with commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to study the effects of this nanofiller on the electrical properties of the mix in the liquid state, during the cure and in the solid state. The level of addition of the nanotubes ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 3 wt%. The dispersion of the filler particles in the matrix was carried out combining triple <b>roll</b> <b>milling,</b> horn sonication and high shear mixing. Qualitative optical and electronic microscopy characterisation supports the development of novel techniques for real-time quantitative assessments of dispersion quality. Fitting of shear dependent viscosity, measured between 0. 1 and 100 s- 1, to Carreau's model has been shown to provide an indicator of the state of nanotube dispersion in the mixture. Additionally, liquid electrical conductivity measurements offer the option of on-line monitoring, providing a promising tool for process optimisation. The formation of an effective conductive network of nanotubes during the cure was investigated by combining impedance spectroscopy measurements and equivalent circuit modelling with two parallel RC circuit in series with each other. This allows in-situ observation of the key phenomenon responsible for the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite, namely the filler re-aggregation during cure. Optimisation of dispersion and cure parameters results in a nanocomposite showing conductive behaviour in the solid state, achieving DC conductivity of 0. 13 S/m at 0. 30 wt% loading. The percolation threshold was estimated to occur at 0. 026 wt% filler loading. The conductivity achieved is comparable to state-ofthe-art epoxy thermosetting nanocomposites based on use of carbon nanotubes of equivalent quality.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate and compare the mechanical properties and processability of single-filler and hybrid poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) composites. Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) was used in this study to improve the impact strength of PVC while talc was used to improve stiffness. Filler was added into PVC at a constant loading level of 30 phr. SM 90 showed the most optimum properties in terms of impact strength and flexural modulus among all grades of CaCO 3 selected for hybrid study. Tests specimens were prepared by using dry blending, two <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> and compression moulding processes. Flexural, impact and tensile tests were then performed to determine and compare the effect of fillers on mechanical properties of PVC composites. Talc filled PVC composite showed the highest flexural modulus but the lowest impact strength. The impact strength of hybrid PVC composites gradually increased with increasing SM 90 content, but the flexural modulus showed an opposite behaviour. The flexural strength and impact strength were the highest among the hybrids when the talc/SM 90 weight ratio was 20 : 10. The distribution and dispersion of the fillers in PVC matrix were observed by using SEM. The well dispersion and interfacial adhesion of SM 90 and talc particles in PVC matrix had contributed and helped in improving the stiffness and the impact strength of PVC composite. The fusion time of hybrid talc/SM 90 filled PVC composite gradually increased as the talc content was gradually replaced by SM 90. However, the hybrid (10 phr talc: 20 phr SM 90) filled PVC composite showed the longest fusion time among all PVC composites.

The {{two types of}} resins and curing agents share the same chemical abstract service (CAS). The weight ratio of resin to curing agent was 100 : 26.4. The dispersion of the VGCNF in the epoxy resin was performed by four different methods: Method 1 : hand mixing with a Haeger blender for 2 min [12], where the velocity field and stress levels should generate a predominantly distributive mixing of the clusters; Method 2 : one pass extrusion through a Capillary Rheometer fitted {{with a series of}} rings with alternating directions [14], where the strong extensional fields are anticipated to result in a good filler dispersion but limited cluster distribution Method 3 : <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> (using a Lehmann 3 roll miller) for 5 min, with a gap of 25.4 μm {{between the first and second}} rolls and 600 r.p.m. for the third roll, which is expected to result in a good filler dispersion and a relatively good cluster distribution; Method 4 : a planetary-type Thinky ARE- 250 mixer, at revolution and rotation speeds of 2000 and 800 rpm, respectively, for 10 min, which should ensure a good cluster distribution. In all cases, the resin and curing agent were pre-mixed by hand [11].

40|$|Polyacetal or {{polyoxymethylene}} (POM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important engineering polymers and it has wide usability (automotive, aerospace, sport, medicine, household etc.), because of good balance between mechanical and chemical properties. It is considered as an excellent alternative material for replacement of metals due to its high strength and stiffness. However, range of POM application is limited due to some properties, for example, poor impact strength and sensitivity under ultraviolet light (UV). To tailor exploitation properties for customer, POM is modified with other thermoplastic polymers, as well as inorganic or organic fillers. Apart from ease of manufacturing and desirable intrinsic exploitation characteristics, an important aspect in materials design is its durability, i. e., resistance to the effects of the factors of external environment: UV-irradiation, moisture, aggressive chemical agents etc. There are many publication about POM modification, but in these researches practically no information is devoted to the durability aspects of POM/elastomer blends and their nanocomposites. Consequently this research is devoted to investigation of POM blends with ethylene octene copolymer (EOC) and nanosized ZnO, exposed to ageing (in water or oil ambience or UV light). POM composites with various EOC (0, 10, 30, 50 wt. %) and ZnO (0 and 2 wt. %) contents were prepared by <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> at 180 0 C. Compounding time was 7 min after introduction of ZnO in the polymer blend melt. Test specimens for ageing tests were manufactured by injection molding. Test specimens were immersed in water or hydraulic oil for 4 weeks at room temperature (25 o C). Dimensions, mass changes and tensile properties were measured at various exposure times (Day 7 th and Day 28 th). UV weathering test was carried out by using Q-Lab QUV accelerated weathering tester. Test specimens were exposed to the sequence of the following cycles: UV light for 8 h at 60 0 C (irradiance 0. 76 W*m - 2 *nm - 1 measured at 340 nm), condensation without UV irradiation for 4 h at 50 0 C). Tensile, structure properties were determined at various exposure times (366, 672 and 1344 hours). Results show that stress-strain characteristics (modulus of elasticity, tensile strength ultimate deformation) of the investigated POM/EOC blends after ageing in water or oil ambience are somewhat lower than those before ageing, however, keep similar trend along with changing the elastomer content. Addition of ZnO, in its turn, assisted in increasing of modulus of elasticity and strength of the investigated nanocomposites. In general it has been shown that selected POM/EOC compositions have certain applicability in the submerged state (immersed in oil or water). It has been shown that addition of small amount of ZnO considerably improves UV resistance and tensile properties after ageing in water (tensile strength, deformation at break) of POM/EOC composites, as confirmed by corresponding structural and stress-strain investigations...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{incorporation}} of carbon nanoparticles within continuous fibre reinforcements by liquid composite moulding processes, {{in order to provide}} enhanced electrical and delamination properties to the multiscale composites. The mechanisms controlling the flow and filtration of these nanoparticles during liquid composite moulding are studied, in order to develop a predictive 1 -D model which allows design of the processing of these composite materials. Five different carbon nanoparticles at 0. 25 wt% loading, three unmodified and one surface modified carbon nanotube systems and one carbon nanofibre system, were utilised to modify a commercial two-component epoxy resin utilised to impregnate carbon and glass reinforcements at high fibre volume fraction by resin transfer moulding. The dispersion of the nanofillers in the prepolymer was carried out by ultrasonication, high shear mixing or triple <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> or a combination of the three. Electrical conductivity measurements of the carbon nanoparticle liquid suspensions during dispersion, alongside optical microscopy imaging and rheological analysis of these allowed the selection of the concentration of nanofiller and the appropriate dispersion technique for each nanoparticle system. The resin transfer moulding process required adaptation to incorporate the dispersion and modify degassing steps, especially when utilising unmodified carbon nanoparticles suspensions, due to their higher viscosity and tendency to be filtered. Nanoparticle filtration was identified by electrical conductivity measurements and microscopy of specimens cut at increasing distances from the inlet. Cake filtration was observed for some of the unmodified systems, whereas deep bed filtration occurred for the surface modified CNT material. Property graded composites were obtained due to filtration, where the average electrical conductivity of the carbon and glass composites produced increased by a factor of two or one order of magnitude respectively. The effect of filler on the delamination properties of the carbon fibre composites was tested under mode I. The results do not show a statistically significant improvement of delamination resistance with the presence of nanoparticles, although localised toughening mechanisms such as nanoparticle pull-out and crack bridging as well as inelastic deformation have been observed on fracture surfaces. Particle filtration and gradients in concentration resulted in non-linear flow behaviour. An 1 -D analytical and a finite difference model, based on Darcy’s law accompanied by particle mass conservation and filtration kinetics were developed to describe the flow and filtration of carbon nanoparticle filled thermosets. The numerical model describes the non-linear problem by incorporating material property update laws, i. e. permeability, porosity and viscosity variations on concentration of retained and suspended particles with location and time. The finite difference model is consistent and converges to the analytical solution. The range of applicability of the analytical model is limited to lower filtration coefficients and shorter filling lengths, providing an approximate solution for through thickness infusion; whereas the numerical model presents a solution outside this range, i. e. in-plane filling processes. These models allow process design, with specified carbon nanoparticle concentration distributions achieved via modifying the nanofiller loading at the inlet as a function of time.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we report}} a new reproducible synthetic route to prepare LiFePO 4 /C composites. As starting materials an intimate stoichiometric mixture of lithium carbonate and an hybrid organic-inorganic Fe(II) organophosphonate, i. e. Fe[(RPO 3) (H 2 O) ] (R = methyl or phenyl group) were used. The idea behind {{it was to}} provide a single source for phosphorus, iron and carbon. The hybrid organic-inorganic compounds of formula Fe[(CH 3 PO 3) (H 2 O) ] and Fe[(C 6 H 5 PO 3) (H 2 O) ] are easy to handle because they are stable to the air and moisture [1, 2]. The mixture of Li 2 CO 3 and Fe[(RPO 3) (H 2 O) ] (R=CH 3 -, C 6 H 5) was heated in a tubular furnace under N 2 gas at temperatures above 600 °C for at least 16 h [3]. Nano-crystalline LiFePO 4 samples were obtained. One of the most interesting aspects of this new synthetic method is the formation of elemental carbon during the decomposition of Fe(II) methyl- and phenylphosphonate. In the final LiFePO 4 samples amounts of 2. 5 wt. % C in the case of Fe[(CH 3 PO 3) (H 2 O) ] precursor and 12 wt. % C in the case of Fe[(C 6 H 5 PO 3) (H 2 O) ] precursor have been found. This means that part of the theoretical carbon content in the reaction mixtures (8. 8 wt. % and 29. 6 wt. % respectively) is lost during the heating process. TG measurements on the initial precursor mixtures showed in both cases the elimination of the water molecules coordinated to the Fe(II) ions at temperatures up to 200 °C, while at higher temperatures (200 - 800 °C) weight losses of 30 and 45 % have been observed. An exothermic effect at 400 °C (Fe[(CH 3 PO 3) (H 2 O) ]) and 450 °C (Fe[(C 6 H 5 PO 3) (H 2 O) ]) has been evidenced in the DTA curves and might be related to the initial formation of Li 2 O from the corresponding carbonate followed by the decomposition of the organophosphonate precursor and final formation of LiFePO 4. The exact mechanism of the reaction is still under investigation. The crystalline LiFePO 4 powders were further characterized by X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Our LiFePO 4 samples crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnma and the LiFePO 4 phase consists of spherical aggregates of about 0. 2 μm diameter. Composite cathode tapes were made by <b>roll</b> <b>milling</b> a mixture of 75 wt. % active material and 10 wt. % binder (Teflon, DuPont). Carbon (KJB Carbon) was added until 15 wt. % final carbon content was reached. Electrodes disks of typically diameter of 10 mm were punched and the electrode weight ranged from 7. 4 to 10. 7 mg. T-shaped battery cells with lithium metal as counter and reference electrode were used for electrochemical characterization. The cells, filled with a 1 M solution of LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate / diethyl carbonate (1 : 1), were automatically cycled by means of a battery cycler (Maccor 4000). Composite cathode preparation, cell assembly, tests and storage were performed in the dry room (R. H. < 0. 1 % at 20 °C). To test the effect of different discharge rates, a cell was subjected to various discharge rates, i. e. C/ 10, 1 C, 3 C, 10 C, 20 C and 30 C. The cell was always charged using the same procedure to insure identical initial conditions: a constant current step at 1 C rate until the voltage reached 4. 0 V, followed by a constant voltage step until the current fell below C/ 10 rate. Figure 1 shows the Ragone plot for the cell discharged at different rates. The specific energy and specific power are based on the weight of the active material. The specific energy calculated at C/ 10 rate was about 550 Wh kg- 1. The specific power calculated at 30 C rate was in excess at 14, 000 W kg- 1 while the specific energy was about 28 % of the energy delivered at C/ 10. The excellent electrochemical performance of the LiFePO 4 /C composites can be ascribed to the tailored synthesis addressed to enhance the electrochemical properties of the material. The main advantage of this synthetic route is the formation of elemental carbon from the organic constituent of the precursor. The carbon particles interact with the LiFePO 4 grains just during their formation providing a good electronic contact between the grains and the carbon added for the composite electrode fabrication. The low particle size and the enhanced surface conductivity both result in the outstanding performance of the LiFePO 4 /C cathode. In conclusion, electrodes made of the cathode material reported here showed very high specific energy, specific power and capacity retention upon cycling. The new synthetic method is very simple and the Fe(II) organophosphonate precursors are air-stable. The good electrochemical performance of LiFePO 4 /C indicates that the reported method is very promising for developing high power lithium-ion batteries. Figure 1. Ragone plot for the cell discharged at different rates. LiFePO 4 was prepared starting from the Fe(II) phenylphosphonate. The cathode loading of LiFePO 4 was 7. 1 mg cm- 2. Electrode area was 0. 16 cm 2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank the Ministero Italiano per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (MIUR) for financial support. REFERENCES 1. 	C. Bellitto, F. Federici, M.
