In 1994 the Home Office, {{in agreement with the}} government and on the cooperation of many Chief Constables, changed the uniform from the business attire with no protection of the torso, to a uniform with black trousers, Blue NATO Jumper, stab vest, duty belt and <b>reflective</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E

The material combined waterproof fabric with a very thin layer of glass microspheres, which reflected even the weakest light sources with astonishing effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|La troisième partie de l'étude CVA (CVA 3) est une enquête auprès de 900 usagers de vélo, en distinguant : cyclistes enfants, cyclistes sportifs et " utilitaires ". Cette enquête mesure l'acceptabilité des équipements de sécurité (casque, éclairage, éléments fluo). Chez les cyclistes utilitaires, 47 % déclarent ne " jamais " porter de casque et 17 % " toujours ". La {{dimension}} " être bien visible " (conspicuité) est négligée. What is the behaviour of cyclists {{towards their}} own safety equipment: helmet and conspicuity equipment (being highly visible) ? Method: a survey was conducted {{in a big city}} (Lyon) and its surroundings. Three types of cyclists were used: children, sports cyclists and commuting cyclists. Results: helmet wearing is strongly related to cyclist type: the helmet is "always" worn by 49 % of riding children, by 68 % of sports cyclists and by 17 % of commuting cyclists. Commuting cyclists are less likely to wear a helmet if they are female, riding mostly in urban areas, driving a car "everyday" or "never", judging the helmet to be cumbersome (after parking the bike), and not feeling "fragile". Bright coloured clothes are "always used" by 9 % of commuting cyclists only. At night, the rear mandatory light is "always" used by 64 % of commuting cyclists. Reasons for non-use are mostly "out of order" and "oversight". A <b>reflective</b> <b>jacket</b> is "always" worn at night by 10 % of adult cyclists. Conclusion: there is much room for increasing the use of safety equipments by cyclists. Helmet wearing is put forward but conspicuity (pre-crash prevention) should not be overlooked; additionally, cyclists' compliance with conspicuity recommendations might be easier to increase. Finally, prevention campaigns should take cyclists types into account...|$|E
50|$|After 1998, the {{original}} foundations of Geoff McQueen's writing was relaxed {{to include some}} characters' private lives, but still remained that an incident would not be seen without a member of cast involved. The old title sequences were entirely removed, in favour of displaying things that are seen {{to be associated with}} policing, such as <b>reflective</b> <b>jackets,</b> a suspect being interviewed, and a map in the CAD room. The theme tune was also revamped, with a change from the irregular time signature.|$|R

50|$|In 1999, Belgrave Hall {{became famous}} {{across the world}} when two ghostly figures were {{recorded}} on security cameras outside the Hall. The building remained of interest to ghost hunters long after this sighting was explained. The ISPR (International Society for Paranormal Research) examined the footage and decided the image was environmental in nature rather than paranormal, namely a falling leaf, but went on to 'identify' quite a few cold spots and 'residual forces'. The team from Ghost Hunters International concluded it was most likely people with <b>reflective</b> <b>jackets</b> walking around. Living TV's Most Haunted crew investigated here in 2003 with celebrity guests Vic Reeves and his wife Nancy Sorrell. Belgrave Hall was featured on the 26 June 2012 episode of Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files.|$|R
25|$|Police {{uniforms and}} {{equipment}} in the United Kingdom have varied considerably from the inception {{of what was to}} become the earliest recognisable mainstream police force in the country with the Glasgow Police Act 1800 forming the City of Glasgow Police and then the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829, allowing the formation of the Metropolitan Police Service. With the various County Police Acts, policing became a more standardised practice in the United Kingdom throughout the late nineteenth century, the uniforms and equipment became equally standardised. From a variety of home grown uniforms, bicycles, swords and pistols the British police force evolved in look and equipment through the long coats and top hat, to the recognisable modern uniform of a white shirt, black tie (or cravat for women in many forces), <b>reflective</b> <b>jackets,</b> body armour, and the panda car.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Road traffic {{injuries}} {{continue to}} exert a huge {{burden on the}} health care system in Kenya. Few studies on the severity of road traffic injuries have been conducted in Kenya. We carried out a cross-sectional study to determine factors associated with severity of road traffic injuries in a public hospital in Thika district, Kenya. METHODS: Road crash victims attending the Thika district hospital, a 265 -bed public hospital, emergency room were recruited consecutively between 10 th August 2009 and 15 th November 2009. Epidemiologic and clinical information was collected from medical charts and through interview with the victims or surrogates using a semi-structured questionnaire. Injuries were graded as severe or non-severe based on the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Independent factors associated with injury severity were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 32. 4 years, three quarters were between 20 - 49 years-old and 73 % (219) were male. Nineteen percent (56 / 300) of the victims had severe injury. Five percent (15) had head injury while 38 % (115) had fractures. Vulnerable road users (pedestrians and two-wheel users) comprised 33 % (99 / 300) of the victims. Vulnerable road users (OR= 2. 0, 95 %CI= 1. 0 - 3. 9), road crashes in rainy weather (OR= 2. 9, 95 %CI= 1. 3 - 6. 5) and night time crashes (OR= 2. 0, 95 %CI= 1. 1 - 3. 9) were independent risk factors for sustaining severe injury. CONCLUSION: Severe injury was associated with vulnerable road users, rainy weather and night time crashes. Interventions and measures such as use of <b>reflective</b> <b>jackets</b> and helmets by two wheel users and enhanced road visibility could help reduce the severity of road traffic injurie...|$|R
25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short sleeved shirts may be worn open-necked. Long sleeved shirts must always be worn with a tie or cravat, worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short sleeved shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black wicking T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use combat trousers (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost never wear a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear <b>reflective</b> waterproof <b>jackets,</b> which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a type of body armour, when on duty.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} big {{competitions}} during Foulkes' time on CITV. One was {{in conjunction with}} the programme Streetwise (which was a show all about cycle couriers and starred the then-unknown Andy Serkis). Viewers had to design and draw a customised bike of their own, featuring reflective lights and other things, so it could be ridden safely in the dark. The main prizes for the winners were two Muddy Fox mountain bikes, with some special CITV <b>reflective</b> safety <b>jackets</b> and cycle lights as runner-up prizes. The competition had over 32,000 entries in total. Another competition was a tie-in with the adventure game-show Knightmare. Eagle-eyed viewers had to look out for random letters appearing on-screen during Episode 7 of Series 3, which would eventually spell out a word connected with fantasy. The actual word was 'Excalibur' and the prizes for the winner were a ZX Spectrum computer system and a copy of the first Knightmare computer game. Hordriss, a character from the show, appeared on CITV to set the competition and Foulkes announced the winner on 8 December 1989, just before Episode 14 of Series 3 of the show.|$|R
50|$|The Air Force {{designed}} a new physical training uniform that became mandatory for wear on 1 October 2006, now called Physical Training Gear. The gear consists of shorts, short-sleeve and long-sleeve T-shirts, jacket, and pants. The shorts are AF blue with silver reflective stripes on the leg, a key pocket {{attached to the}} inner liner and an ID pocket {{on the outside of}} the lower right leg. The T-shirts are a moisture-wicking fabric with reflective Air Force logos on the upper left portion of the chest and across the back. The jacket is blue with silver reflective piping and a reflective inverted chevron on the back. The pants are blue with silver piping and <b>reflective</b> stripes. The <b>jacket</b> and pants have since been redesigned with a lighter, quieter material. A line of commercially manufactured running shorts is also authorized for wear.|$|R
