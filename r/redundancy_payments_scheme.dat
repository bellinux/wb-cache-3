In 1967, a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic flat-rate maternity benefit. In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school “for those living more than three miles from the nearest school.” In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of pensionable age, while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.|$|E

The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 set up a Health and Safety Commission and Executive and a legal framework for health and safety at work. The Employment Protection Act 1975 set up the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Services (ACAS) to arbitrate in industrial disputes, enlarged the rights of employees and trade unions, extended the <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme,</b> and provided redress against unfair dismissal. The legislation also provided for paid maternity leave and outlawed dismissal for pregnancy. The Act also obliged employers to pay their workers a minimum guaranteed payment “if they are laid off {{through no fault of}} their own.” The Social Security Act 1975 introduced a maternity allowance fund, while the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 set up an Equal Opportunities Commission and outlawed gender discrimination (both indirect and direct). In addition, the Social Security Act of 1975 included progressive noise-induced hearing loss “in the list of prescribed diseases covered by the Industrial Injuries Scheme as Occupational Deafness.” ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> {{and other}} forms of {{compensation}} in employment relations The diploma thesis deals with forms of compensation in employment relations in contemporary Czech labour law. Aside from the Introduction and Conclusion, the thesis consists of four chapters. The second chapter discusses the concept of compensations in labour law, and provides an analysis of the functions of labour law compensations, from the perspective of both the employee and employer. An overview of the different types of compensations is provided, including their categorization. <b>Redundancy</b> <b>payment,</b> the primary and most frequent type of labour law compensation in Czech law, forms the content of chapter three. The functions of <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> are explained, and the terms and conditions which give rise to the right of employees to <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> are analyzed. Further, the amounts of <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> under different circumstances are dealt with in detail, including an explanation of the methods of their calculation; the author also focuses on the category of average monthly remuneration and its importance in this relation. Each of the manners of employment termination and their relevance for the right to <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> are discussed, as well as the amounts of <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> pertaining to each type of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide an}} economic rationale for the existence and pattern of <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments.</b> A model of firm-specific training with uncertain returns to training and uncertainty about the outside options of workers is constructed for this purpose. The central result is that an optimal contract will involve the firm in bearing {{only a part of}} the training costs because workers may quit. Since workers bear part of the cost of training, they will have to be compensated by a <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> if dismissed. Furthermore, the optimum level of this <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> will vary across firms, with large payments being offered by firms where the returns to training are highly variable. These insights into the nature of <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments</b> differ from those of other models, where they are viewed either as a transfer fee or as representing the difference between inside and outside wages for contracted workers.

Many <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> have been proposed, {{but none of them}} have been accepted as a standard payment system for a variety of reasons. In this paper, we evaluate <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> in terms of the three requirements: offline operability, anonymity and transferability. We think these three requirements are the most disired, thus most significant to characterize <b>payment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Finally, we propose a <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> which has offline operability, anonymity and transferability. ...|$|R

Such contracts are proven to yield negative profits and, hence, are not viable. The correct contracts require the firm to pay the second-period workers their expected productivity.

The authors show how time-series information on worker health, consumption, and work time can be used to measure the effort effects of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Estimates from longitudinal data describing farming rural households indicate that time-wage <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> and share-tenancy contracts reduce effort compared to piece-rate <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> and on-farm employment.

40|$|This paper explores how the {{development}} of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for water-related environmental services can be understood and supported. Currently, {{the development}} of such <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> is perceived mainly through theoretical lenses offered by economists and hydrologists. Notwithstanding the usefulness and appropriateness of these theoretical lenses, they have difficulties to accommodate certain aspects of {{the development of}} <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for water-related environmental services. Specifically, the discussion of negotiation aspects remains relatively isolated and superficial, even though it is generally acknowledged that the development of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> is often significantly influenced by political negotiations. This paper addresses this limitation. It shows how the main elements of negotiation analysis can provide a theoretical underpinning for important drivers behind the development of specific <b>payment</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are beyond the scope of hydrological or economic rationality. Four cases of water-related <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> in the Netherlands are studied, employing one of the key insights offered by negotiation analysis: the importance of the underlying interests and values of the parties involved. The findings of these four cases show the potential of negotiation analysis as a useful complement for understanding and supporting the development of <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> for environmental services.

50|$|Employers {{might want}} to dress up a {{redundancy}} as a business reorganisation to circumvent disciplinary procedure (e.g. right to be accompanied), consultation, paid time off and <b>redundancy</b> <b>payments.</b> Employers may want to save face for both parties where the real ground is conduct that was not addressed in time, capability {{that is difficult to}} prove, pregnancy or the hope simply that somebody who does not figure in future plans will grab an enhanced <b>redundancy</b> <b>payment</b> and run.

This makes the private discount factor, used by firms in making decisions about hiring and training new workers and firing existing ones, higher than the social one. As a consequence, not only do firms underinvest in training but employment becomes too cyclical.
