5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the {{marriage}} is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally {{responsible}} as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E
5|$|Under section 505(c) of the Penal Code, it is {{an offence}} to make, publish or {{circulate}} any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media with an intent to incite, or {{which is likely to}} incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons. The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years, a fine, or both. No offence is committed if the person who made, published or circulated the statement had <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for believing it was true, and did not intend to incite one community against another.|$|E

5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching officers have <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{of search}} and seizure are covered by Section 3, which also {{repealed}} the Obscene Publications Act 1857. This section allows a Justice of the Peace, if satisfied that there are <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> to believe obscene publications are kept on certain premises for profit, to issue a warrant for that location. This warrant allows a police officer to enter the premises, search them and remove any suspect publications; if such publications are found, the officer can also take records relating to the businesses trade. The articles must then be brought before a magistrate and either forfeited by the owners or returned. The owner, author or publisher of the articles, or the person from whom they were seized, may appear before the magistrate to argue why {{they should not be}} forfeited.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} much debate amongst historians about Philip's motives and aims in 346 BC, with {{particular}} regard to Athens. Although Philip had made peace and alliance with Athens prior to his settlement of the Sacred War, they failed to send him troops he requested {{under the terms of}} the alliance. Although these troops were not ultimately needed by Philip, the Athenian failure to honour the terms gave Philip <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for war. However, even when in possession of Thermopylae, he made no hostile moves towards Athens, and still prevented any punishment being meted on Athens by the Amphictyonic council. Why was Philip so lenient towards Athens? Cawkwell suggests that Philip was already beginning to contemplate a campaign against Persia in 346 BC (as tentatively suggested by Diodorus), for which purposes he desired the use of the powerful Athenian navy; hence his request for alliance, and his on-going patience with Athens. This may also provide another explanation for Philip's use of the Amphictyonic council to formally settle the Sacred War; if he was to campaign in Asia, he needed Greece to be peaceful, and a peace imposed through a pan-Greek organisation (backed with the threat of Macedonian intervention), was more likely to succeed than one directly imposed by Macedon.|$|E

25|$|All {{persons and}} goods {{entering}} Canada are subject to examination by CBSA officers. An examination {{can be as simple}} as a few questions, but can also include an examination of the subject's vehicle and/or luggage, more intensive questioning, or personal searches. The intensity of an examination depends on the <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> that the officer has to escalate the intensiveness of a search.|$|E

25|$|In October 2010, the Executive Secretary, Callixte Mbarushimana, {{was arrested}} in France under a sealed warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against {{humanity}} and war crimes allegedly committed in the Kivus (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The warrant concerns widespread attacks allegedly committed by FDLR troops against civilians in North and South Kivu in 2009. The Court's judges state that there are <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> to believe that Mbarushimana bears criminal responsibility for these attacks, including murder, torture, rape, persecution and inhumane acts. The warrant alleges that Mbarushimana {{was part of a}} plan to create a humanitarian catastrophe to extract concessions of political power for the FDLR.|$|E
25|$|A women's {{demonstration}} {{took place}} on 8 March, comprising more than 3,000 people. The police carried out systematic identity controls. In total, more than 750 people were arrested during the events (among them, about 140 foreigners). Based on a population of approximately a million in Copenhagen, the Monde diplomatique noticed that if the same proportion of arrests had been carried out in Paris, 8,000 persons would have been detained. Since the police {{did not have the}} facilities to detain this number of people, many of them were transported to Funen or to Jylland. A penitentiary building of Copenhagen had to be partially emptied of its common law detainees to make place for the arrested youth. From March 10 to March 19, Nørrebro and Christianshavn were decreed zones where any citizen could be searched and registered on databases, even without <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for suspicion.|$|E

25|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the burden of}} proof is given in Howard Marine and Dredging Co Ltd v A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd, where a shipping company told a client that its barge for hire would hold 1600 tonnes. This is what the Lloyd's Register of ships said. But the ships own documents, accessible to the shipping company, said the barge could only take 1055. The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR dissenting) held that in preferring a more convenient source (the Lloyd's Register) over another (the shipping documents), the shipping company had not been reasonable. It was up to the shipping company to positively prove this, and in the circumstances looking to the register was not reasonable. It is likely that a company's own standards and practices will be relevant to what constitutes <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for a belief.|$|E
25|$|Legal aid is {{available}} for civil proceedings in the District Court, the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal (both part of the High Court), and the Court of Final Appeal. It also covers proceedings in some tribunals and certain Coroner’s Court cases. An applicant must satisfy both a ‘means test’ and a ‘merits test’. For the means test, a person whose total financial resources do not exceed $155,800 may be granted legal aid. The Director of Legal Aid may waive the upper financial limit in meritorious cases when a breach of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights or inconsistency with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as applied to Hong Kong is an issue. For the merits test, the Director must be satisfied that an applicant has <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for bringing or defending the civil proceedings to which the application relates. A person aggrieved by a decision of the Director may appeal to the Registrar of the High Court.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{circumstances}} where the courts accept that procedural protections {{should be more}} limited or even placed in abeyance, {{and this is a}} function of context. This is especially so in matters of national security where the sensitivity of such matters demands that the courts do not look closely at government decisions to limit procedural rights. In wartime, the case of Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) is regarded to be of great constitutional significance. The House of Lords found that there could be no inquiry into whether there were <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> for the detention of the appellant as it was a subjective matter for the Home Security to determine, as prescribed by legislation. However, in Lord Atkin's acclaimed dissenting judgment, he refused to endorse this construction of the law. Lord Atkin's judgment is now taken as the correct decision, where every imprisonment is prima facie illegal until justified by the arresting authority. Nonetheless, national security is still an important issue that can and does limit procedural protection in certain cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{police also}} have stop and search powers {{which they can}} use if they have <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> {{to believe that they}} will find stolen or {{prohibited}} articles or controlled drugs. Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, a senior police officer can authorise police officers in a locality to stop and search any pedestrian or vehicle where the officer has grounds for believing that the individual is carrying an offensive weapon or dangerous instrument. In 1998 this legislation was extended to allow the officer to require the person to remove clothing worn for the purpose of concealing his identity, and to confiscate that article of clothing. Special extended powers also apply in the case of terrorist suspects. A person may be detained without charge for up to 24 hours, which can be extended for a further 12 hours by a senior officer {{in the case of a}} serious arrestable offence and further extended by a magistrates' court up to a total of 60 hours in respect of indictable offences. Suspected terrorists may be detained for up to 48 hours without charge and immigrants and asylum-seekers may be detained for examination by immigration officers for an unlimited period.|$|E
25|$|Coroners {{continue}} to have jurisdiction to enquire into any treasure found in their districts, and into who are or are suspected to be its finders. Anyone finding an object he or she believes or has <b>reasonable</b> <b>grounds</b> to believe is treasure must notify the coroner for the district in which the object is found within 14 days starting from {{the day after the}} find or, if later, the day on which the finder first believes or has reason to believe the object is treasure. Not doing so is an offence. Inquests are held without a jury unless the coroner decides otherwise. The coroner must notify the British Museum if his or her district is in England, the Department of the Environment if it is in Northern Ireland, or the National Museum Wales if it is in Wales. The coroner must also take reasonable steps to notify any person who appears may have found the treasure; any person who, {{at the time it was}} found, occupied land which it appears may be where the treasure was found; and any other interested persons, including persons involved in the find or having an interest in the land where the treasure was found at that time or since. However, coroners still have no power to make any legal determination as to whether the finder, landowner or occupier of the land has title to the treasure. The courts have to resolve that issue, and may also review coroners' decisions in relation to treasure.|$|E
