5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured {{that not only}} was the trackbed kept whole, but the majority of the <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E

Unlike the other six Yugoslav armies, the 7th Army did not have a corresponding army district during peacetime, and would be allocated divisions when it was formed. Zagreb, Karlovac, Trebnje and Velike Lašče were key centres for the mobilisation and concentration of the 7th Army due to their good <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructure.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Currently, rail control {{designers}} {{are looking for}} innovative types of control strategies {{in order to make}} <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructures</b> more robust, more reliable, and more efficient. Control {{designers are}} focusing on more flexible control strategies {{in order to keep the}} system performance stable when non planned situations occurs. Applying new control strategies to <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is difficult, because strategies cannot be fully assessed for their quality before implementation. Existing testing tools normally only assess the strategy itself and do not consider its impact on the whole system, nor do they assess the impact of the system on the strategy. This issue was confirmed during an inductive case study performed at a Dutch transportation company. To tackle this problem, a simulation based environment is proposed to better assess control strategies for <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R

Zagreb, Dugo Selo and Sisak were key centres for the mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army due to their good <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Prior {{to the issue of}} mobilisation orders for the 4th Army, the 4th Army District headquarters had been involved in planning border defences and conducting exercises for border troops, including demolition plans for bridges and other infrastructure in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|Given Alaska's limited {{road and}} <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> the {{territorial}} government saw {{the advantages of}} aerial transport. In 1925, the territorial legislature authorized the spending of up to $40,000 per year on airfield construction. Between that year and 1927, more than 20 airfields were built. By 1930, Alaska had more than 100. In Fairbanks, airplanes flew from a field that doubled as a baseball diamond until 1931, when the city bought the field, installed infrastructure, and named it Weeks Field. By the late 1930s, {{there were more than}} four dozen airplanes in the town of about 3,000 people, giving Fairbanks the reputation of having the most airplanes per capita in the world. Because of Fairbanks' location halfway between New York City and Tokyo, it became a crucial stop on the first around-the-world flights. Wiley Post's 1933 solo circumnavigation stopped in Fairbanks, as did Howard Hughes' 1938 effort.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the British Railways Board, London Transport Executive, Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment {{produced}} a report examining the modernisation of London transport. It recommended high priority given to reconstructing Liverpool Street and Broad Street stations and recommended financing this through property {{development on the}} site. Liverpool Street {{had a number of}} design and access issues, many of which derived from the 1890 extension which had effectively created two stations on one site, with two concourses linked by walkways, multiple booking halls, and inefficient traffic flows within the station. Additionally the <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructure</b> presented limitations; only seven of the platforms could accommodate 12-carriage trains, and the track exit layout was a bottleneck. In 1975 British Railways announced plans to demolish and redevelop both stations. The proposed demolition met considerable public opposition and prompted a campaign led by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, leading to a public inquiry from November 1976 to February 1977.|$|E

This is a group of companies and interested parties which together have the overall responsibility for the scheme, including Network <b>Rail</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> Ltd, J. Sainsbury Developments Ltd and Quintain Estates and Development (QED). The land was originally owned by British Rail, but passed to Railtrack when the railway system was privatised in the mid-1990s. It was sold to the New England Consortium in 1997. An initial planning application, including a new Sainsbury's supermarket, was rejected by the council in November 1997; the rejection was subsequently upheld on appeal in September 1998. URBED were then asked to develop a new master plan for the site. This design statement was published in July 2001, and was granted planning permission by Brighton & Hove City Council at the end of 2002. Construction work on the site began on 19 July 2004.|$|E

40|$|Urban <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructures</b> play a {{key role}} in {{ensuring}} accessibility and connectivity between suburban areas and the city center. However, if not embedded in integrated planning strategies, <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructures</b> might be origins of segregation and urban decay. Many cities are currently building new metro or tram lines in order to get the city center and urban peripheries closer. Only in few cases however, these transport schemes are jointly planned and designed with land uses of urban corridors or station areas they go through. The aim of this paper is to examine integrated planning processes of suburban areas and <b>rail</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> We conduct the study through the analysis of two rail corridors characterized by different strategies, implementation and governance: the Line 1 of the city of Naples (Italy) and the Zaancorridor in the metropolitan area of Amsterdam (The Netherlands). In Naples, the construction of new stations occurs in conjunction with the renewal of urban areas characterized by high levels of decay, both in the city center and in suburban areas. In Amsterdam, the Zaancorridor transformation is part of a long term planning strategy defined by the Plan Maak Plaats!: to strengthen the role of the rail system as the backbone of regional spatial development. The paper thus offers an analysis of these two examples, investigating the role of transport infrastructures in the transformation of two different contexts...|$|R
