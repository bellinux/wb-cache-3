40|$|For several years, most of antenna such as {{a simple}} dipole or {{monopole}} receives vertically polarized signals and re-radiates it with horizontal polarization, or vice-versa. The mode of converting antenna can be utilized in the in-line mode or in the reflection mode. Testing is conducted within ranging frequency and analyses are done due to their performances mainly on losses, <b>radio</b> <b>gain</b> and directivity. Due to that gap, this research will explore the development to construct a simple dipole and monopole by a running an antenna simulation system. The output {{will be used to}} compute the radio performances where both transmitting and receiving antennas are both polarized vertically. Some analyses are discussed accordingly to this conventional method...|$|E
