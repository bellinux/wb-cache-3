40|$|International audienceMotivated by routing in {{telecommunication}} network using Software Defined Network (SDN) technologies, {{we consider the}} following problem of finding short routing lists using aggregation rules. We are given a set of communications X, which are distinct pairs (s, t) ⊆ S × T, (typically S is the set of sources and T the set of destinations), and a port function π : X → P where P is the set of ports. A <b>routing</b> <b>list</b> R is an ordered list of triples which are of the form (s, t, p), If r(s, t) = π(s, t), then we say that (s, t) is properly routed by R and if all communications of X are properly routed, we say that R emulates (X, π). The aim {{is to find a}} shortest <b>routing</b> <b>list</b> emulating (X, π). In this paper, we carry out a study of the complexity of the two dual decision problems associated to it. Given a set of communication X, a port function π and an integer k, the A preliminary short version of this work has appeared in [7]. 2 Frédéric Giroire et al. first one called <b>Routing</b> <b>List</b> (resp. the second one, called List Reduction) consists in deciding whether there is a <b>routing</b> <b>list</b> emulating (X, π) of size at most k (resp. |X | − k). We prove that both problems are NP-complete. We then give a 3 -approximation for List Reduction, which can be generalized to higher dimensions.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{multicast}} scheme for the packet forwarding mechanism in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The scheme {{relies on the}} introduction of the Permanent Multicast <b>Routing</b> <b>List</b> (PMRL) and Temporary Multicast <b>Routing</b> <b>List</b> (TMRL) in each node of the network except UEs. In the PMRL we record the nodes of the next level that the messages for every multicast group should be forwarded. The TMRL is useful for the temporary record of information from the path from the mobile users to the GGSN. Additionally, a Multicast Group List (MGL) is kept in the GGSN which records the members of each multicast group. These lists lead to the decrement of the transmitted packets and the more efficient use of the network resources in the multicast routing in UMTS. We analyze the exact steps that the multicast packets are transmitted to the members of each multicast group. Furthermore, special issues such as joining/leaving a multicast service are described.

40|$|In {{wireless}} ad-hoc networks, network partitioning {{occurs when}} the mobile nodes move with diverse patterns and cause the network to separate into completely disconnected portions. Network partitioning is a wide scale topology change that can cause sudden and severe disruptions to ongoing network routing and upper layer applications. Its occurrence {{can be attributed to}} various reasons like node getting overloaded, broken, selfish, malicious and hand off (Graceful and Abrupt leave) etc. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a mechanism by name Destitute Node Collaborative Cure Culminating to Continued Connectivity (DNC 5) and Network Partition Panic Packet (NP 3) which underpins the creation of two lists namely Core <b>Routing</b> <b>List</b> (CRL) and Backup <b>Routing</b> <b>List</b> (BRL) for any sender – receiver pair. The intermediate node causing network partition/divide under the influence of the attacker offers seamless interconnectivity through this innovative technique. This solution encourages the activation of BRL in absence of the CRL service to guarantee faultless/flawless network routing service in ad hoc network. The destitute nodes which are deprived of the network service due to network split unite/collaborate in desecrating the culprit node to cure the network split and render uninterrupted network activities. The proposed solution offer remote opportunities for the orchestration of network partition in ad hoc network.

This leads to speculating about the proper use of the all-too-limited time available to today’s busy librarian. ¶ 1 Irecently had afew minutes to begin sorting the stacks of paper on my desk. When I saw a professional journal, I asked a basic triage question: can I cross my name off this <b>routing</b> <b>list</b> and move it along? (One of the most satisfying ways of dealing with a big pile of papers is to make part of the pile move onto someone else’s pile.) Sometimes I cross my name off after only seeing the title of the periodical. In fact, I have asked not to have some journals routed to me at all because I so seldom have the time to look at them, and my efforts when I do seldom seem justified. ¶ 2 This time I looked closer. The cover of the journal bore a list of five articles in the issue. One of them appealed to me: “Reference Work and the Value of Reading Newspapers. ” 1 I was intrigued enough to flip to the first page of the article and skim the abstract. The piece seemed interesting. Still, my pile of papers loomed before me. If I read the article right then, I would never sort the pile—let alone find the leave slip I was missing. So I slapped a Post-it Note on the first page of the article and shoved the journal into a tote bag that was filling with professional reading I hoped to get to. (I was the last person on the <b>routing</b> <b>list</b> of this journal, so hoarding it would not deprive a colleague.) ¶ 3 According to the article’s abstract, the authors suggest that reading newspapers is likely to improve the accuracy of reference service.

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple restriction of the PRAM model (called PPRAM), where the input is arbitrarily partitioned between a fixed set of p processors and the shared memory {{is restricted to}} m cells. This model allows for investigating the tradeoffs / bottlenecks {{with respect to the}} communication bandwidth (modeled by the shared memory size m) and the number of processors p. It is quite simple and allows the design of optimal algorithms without loosing the effect of communication bottlenecks. We have focused on the PPRAM complexity of problems that have O(n) sequential solutions (where n is the input size), and where m ^ p ^ n. We show tight time bounds for several problem in this model such as summing, Boolean threshold, <b>routing,</b> <b>list</b> reversal and k-selection. We get typically two sorts of complexity behaviors for these problems: Either O(n=p+p=m) which means that the time scales with the number of processors and with memory size (in appropriate range) but not with both. The other is a O(n=m) which does not scales with p and reflects a communication bottleneck (as long as m! p).

Simulation experiments using the topology of a real ISP network are used to compare CORD with name-based content routing approaches based on link-state and distance information.

As I return each summer, I find that new programs and systems have been adapted to better serve the needs of the Center and of the Agency. The NASA Agency has transformed itself the past couple years with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP). IFMP is designed to allow the Agency to improve its management of its Financial, Physical, and Human Resources through the use of multiple enterprise module applications. With my mentor, Joseph Kan, being the branch chief of the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch, I have been exposed to several modules, such as Travel Manager, WebTads, and Core Financial/SAP, which were implemented {{in the last couple of}} years under the IFMP. The implementation of these agency-wide systems has sometimes proven to be troublesome. Prior to IFMP, each NASA Center utilizes their own systems for Payroll, Travel, Accounts Payable, etc. But with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program, all the "legacy" systems had to be eliminated. As a result, a great deal of enhancement and preparation work is necessary to ease the transformation from the old systems to the new. All this work occurs simultaneously; for example, e-Payroll will "go live" in several months, but a system like Travel Manager will need to have information upgraded within the system to meet the requirements set by Headquarters. My assignments this summer have given me the opportunity to become involved with such work. So far, I have been given the opportunity to participate in projects resulting from a congressional request, several bankcard reconciliations, updating <b>routing</b> <b>lists</b> for Travel Manager, updating the majordomo list for Travel Manager approvers and point of contacts, and a NASA Headquarters project involving improper payments on firm fixed price contracts.

40|$|Traditional routing {{protocols}} in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) rely on routing tables which {{suffer from the}} scale-free and self-organizing nature of wireless networks. Routing protocols adopting destination-based routing tables introduce large overhead to maintain the routing tables in wireless networks. Many {{routing protocols}} cause flooding in updating and finding routes when topology changes. In information centric network (ICN), prior content routing approaches assume that the entire ICN use the same naming space for named data objects (NDO) and that <b>routing</b> tables <b>list</b> routes to NDOs or name prefixes, which incurs more overhead than routing to address ranges. In this thesis we present novel approaches {{to build a new}} hierarchy for routing in computer communication networks which collaborates information dissemination in networks with publish-subscribe mechanisms, network storage, scalable routing and social networks. We propose a few hierarchical, scale-free routing schemes which scale well with network size. In contrast to prior approaches to disseminate information through wireless networks over routing tables, our approaches exploit the social plane exiting in the wireless network to improve the efficiency to deliver information and eliminates the use of destination-based routing tables. In addition, different from prior works in adopting social networks into wireless networks that focus on physical aspects of connectivity over time, our approaches emphasize on the underlying social information among the wireless networks to analyze nodes potential delivery capability and efficiently utilize network storage resources. We also design novel use of Dominating Sets for improving the problems of broadcasting, information query and storage, topology management, and routing in MANETs and ICNs. Our new approaches allow distance-vector routing to scale by integrating it with adaptive publish-subscribe mechanisms. We propose to apply our approaches to address the existing issues of flooding, scale-free, routing efficiency, and routing table maintenance overhead that are faced by computer communication networks that use traditional routing tables for information dissemination...|$|R
