We had previously found, through modeling and mass balance analyses of an arid land afforestation experimental project in Western Australia, {{that a significant}} amount <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> could have been physically removed from the floors of natural forests. In order to analyze litter carbon dynamics in depth, we investigated the actual mobility <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> in several natural forests in Sturt Meadows in an arid region of Western Australia, and estimated {{the difference between the}} removal rate of leaf and woody (twigs and branches) litter on the forest floor. Then we redeveloped a litter carbon dynamics model by incorporating physical removal <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> to show the different mobilities of leaf and woody litters. We also analyzed carbon balances and the effect <b>of</b> differential <b>litter</b> mobility on litter carbon dynamics. Except for twigs in one plot in a high density forest, 29 – 100 % <b>of</b> leaf <b>litter</b> and 10 – 100 % <b>of</b> woody <b>litter</b> was removed annually, demonstrating the physical removal <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> in these natural forests. The main cause <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> removal was wind, not flooding. Decreases in leaf and woody litters could be approximated as first order decay functions in most plots; first order decay or disappearance rate constants were then determined. Estimated disappearance rate constants of leaf and woody litter ranged from 0. 19 to 11 and 0. 11 – 12 year− 1, respectively; most of the constants ranged from 0. 19 to 2. 0 and 0. 11 – 0. 74 year− 1, respectively. Based on the disappearance rate constant, the mobility <b>of</b> woody <b>litter</b> was estimated to be roughly 20 % that <b>of</b> leaf <b>litter,</b> confirming that climatic factors move leaves more easily than twigs.

Rates <b>of</b> net N mineralization in soil and both {{the quantity and quality}} <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> were characterized in various plant patches occurring within a grazed grassland. Soil incubations were performed in controlled conditions to assess the respective role <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> quantity and quality on N mineralization. In laboratory incubations, the effect <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> quantity on net N mineralization rates was found to depend on litter quality. High inputs <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> produced by grazing-promoted species (C/N 11) stimulated net N mineralization rates, while high inputs <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> produced by grazing-reduced species (C/N 46) decreased rates of net N mineralization. The intensity of either the negative or positive effects <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> was then regulated by litter quantity. In the field, litter quality only varied within a limited range. Litter with the highest quality in the field (C/N 22) increased N mineralization minimally compared to the lowest quality litter (C/N 46). Grazing-induced variations in litter quality monitored in the field thus appeared unlikely to cause measured variations in net N mineralization rates. Litter with C/N ratios of 46 and 22 stimulated N immobilization and reduction of their inputs increased the rate of N mineralization due to decreased microbial N immobilization. Within-grassland variations <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> quantity were large and negatively correlated with net N mineralization rates.

This experiment includes leaf litters originating from 33 circumpolar and high-altitude global change experiments. Two-year decomposition rates <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> from these experiments were measured earlier in two common litter beds in sub-Arctic Sweden. • Response ratios of LSTs in plants of high-latitude ecosystems in the global change treatments showed a three-fold variation, and this was in the same range as the natural variation among species.

We used footage acquired with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and a towed camera to investigate the distribution and composition <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> in the submarine canyons of the Bay of Biscay. This bay contains many submarine canyons housing Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) such as scleractinian coral habitats.

Plastic items were the most abundant (42 %), followed by fishing-related items (16 %). The litter had both a maritime and a terrestrial origin. The main sources could be linked to fishing activities, major shipping lanes and river discharges. Litter appeared to accumulate at water depths of 801 – 1100 m and 1401 – 1700 m. In the deeper of these two depth ranges, litter accumulated on a geologically structured area, accounting for its high frequency at this depth.

Despite slight differences in detail, effects of Proasellus on changes in the signature <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> phenolics were similar for both litter types, whereas terrestrial isopods—Porcellio and Eluma, although they differed from each other—digestively degraded phenolic compounds in Eucalyptus and Quercus litter, respectively, in different ways.
