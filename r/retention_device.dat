40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the bond strengths between resin composite veneer and laser-sintered cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy with and without <b>retention</b> <b>devices</b> (Laser-R and Laser-N respectively). Cast Co-Cr alloy with and without <b>retention</b> <b>devices</b> (Cast-R and Cast-N respectively) were also prepared for fabrication technique comparison. Disk-shaped Co-Cr alloy specimens were air-abraded with alumina and veneered with a veneering system, Estenia C&B (ES) or Ceramage (CE). After 20, 000 thermocycles, tensile testing was performed. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and multiple comparison test. When no <b>retention</b> <b>devices</b> were present, no significant differences were observed between Laser-N/ES and Cast-N/ES, or between Laser- N/CE and Cast-N/CE, but ES exhibited significantly higher bond strength than CE. With <b>retention</b> <b>devices,</b> Laser-R/ES, Cast- R/ES and Laser-R/CE showed no significant differences, and their retention strengths were significantly higher than that of Cast- R/CE.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve the mechanical properties of superporous hydrogels (SPHs), which were used to develop gastric <b>retention</b> <b>devices</b> for long-term oral drug delivery. The main approach used in this study was to form an interpenetrating polymer network by incorporating a second polymer network inside an SPH structure. Polyacrylonitrile was used as the second network inside an SPH. Mechanical properties including compression strength and elasticity were significantly improved, up to 50 times as compared with the control SPHs. The enhanced mechanical properties were a result of the scaffold-like fiber network structures formed inside the cell walls of SPHs. The fast swelling property of SPHs was not affected by the incorporation of the second polymer network because the interconnected pore structures were maintained.

These models operated on the short recoil, delayed locking block system, which yielded a faster cycle time.|$|E

50|$|Intel CPU sockets use the {{so-called}} Independent Loading Mechanism (ILM) <b>retention</b> <b>device</b> {{that holds the}} CPU in place while applying an exact amount of force required for a CPU to be properly seated. As part of their design, ILMs have differently placed protrusions which are intended to mate with cutouts in CPU packagings. These protrusions, also known as ILM keying, have the purpose of preventing installation of incompatible CPUs into otherwise physically compatible sockets, and preventing ILMs to be mounted with a 180-degree rotation relative to the CPU socket.Different variants (or generations) of the LGA 2011 socket and associated CPUs come with different ILM keying, which {{makes it possible to}} install CPUs only into generation-matching sockets. CPUs that are intended to be mounted into LGA 2011-0 (R), LGA 2011-1 (R2) or LGA 2011-v3 (R3) sockets are all mechanically compatible regarding their dimensions and ball pattern pitches, but the designations of contacts are different between generations of the LGA 2011 socket and CPUs, which makes them electrically and logically incompatible. Original LGA 2011 socket is used for Sandy Bridge-E/EP and Ivy Bridge-E/EP processors, while LGA 2011-1 is used for Ivy Bridge-EX (Xeon E7 v2) and Haswell-EX (Xeon E7 V3) CPUs, which were released in February 2014 and May 2015, respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: The mandibular implant overdenture is {{a popular}} {{treatment}} modality and is well documented in the literature. Follow-up studies with a long observation period are difficult to perform due to the increasing age of patients. The present data summarize a long-term clinical observation of patients with implant overdentures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1997, edentulous patients were consecutively admitted for treatment with an implant overdenture. The dentures were connected to the implants by means of bars or ball anchors. Regular maintenance was provided {{with at least one}} or two scheduled visits per year. Recall attendance and reasons for dropout were analyzed based on the specific history of the patient. Denture maintenance service, relining, repair, and fabrication of new dentures were identified, and complications with the <b>retention</b> <b>devices</b> specified separately. RESULTS: In the time period from 1984 to 2008, 147 patients with a total of 314 implants had completed a follow-up period of > 10 years. One hundred one patients were still available in 2008, while 46 patients were not reexamined for various reasons. Compliance was high, with a regular recall attendance of > 90 %. More than 80 % of dentures remained in continuous service. Although major prosthetic maintenance was rather low in relation to the long observation period, visits to a dental hygienist and dentist resulted in an annual visit rate of 1. 5 and 2. 4, respectively. If new dentures became necessary, these were made in student courses, which increased the treatment time and number of appointments needed. Complications with the <b>retention</b> <b>devices</b> consisted mostly of the mounting of new female retainers, the repair of bars, and the changing of ball anchors. The average number of events and the rate of prosthetic service with ball anchors were significantly higher than those with bars. Twenty-two patients changed from ball anchors to bars; 9 patients switched from a clip bar to a rigid U-shaped bar. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term follow-up study demonstrates that implant overdentures are a favorable solution for edentulous patients with regular maintenance. In spite of specific circumstances in an aging population, it is possible to provide long-term care, resulting in a good prognosis and low risk for this treatment modality. For various reasons the dropout rate can be considerable in elderly patients and prosthetic service must be provided regularly...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{approaches}} to percutaneous gastrostomy have evolved because of catheter clogging and displacement, which is commonly seen with currently available gastrostomy catheters. Low-profile button gastrostomy catheters, {{designed to be}} inserted into mature tracts, have recently been inserted into fresh gastrostomy tracts. Catheter clogging rarely occurs with these low-profile devices. Catheter displacement remains a problem but new buttons can be inserted at the patient's bedside {{without the need for}} a return visit to the radiology department. A 90 to 100 % success rate has been shown for placement of gastrostomy buttons. Pull-type endoscopic gastrostomy catheters can be placed radiologically using a standard puncture of the stomach and cannulation of the gastroesophageal junction. A guide wire is manipulated up the esophagus and out the mouth. The pull-type gastrostomy catheter is then attached and pulled down through the esophagus and out through the anterior abdominal wall.

40|$|The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle {{will one}} day carry astronauts to the Moon and beyond, and Orion's {{heatshield}} is a critical component in ensuring their safe return to Earth. The Orion heatshield is the structural component responsible for absorbing the intense heating environment caused by re-entry to Earth's atmosphere. The heatshield is primarily composed of Avcoat, an ablative material that is consumed during the re-entry process. Ablation is primarily characterized by two processes: pyrolysis and recession. The decomposition of in-depth virgin material is known as pyrolysis. Recession occurs when the exposed surface of the heatshield reacts with the surrounding flow. The Orion heatshield design was changed from an individually filled Avcoat honeycomb to a molded block Avcoat design. The molded block Avcoat heatshield relies on an adhesive bond to keep it attached to the capsule. In some locations on the heatshield, {{the integrity of the}} adhesive bond cannot be verified. For these locations, a mechanical <b>retention</b> <b>device</b> was proposed. Avcoat ablation was modelled in CHAR and the in-depth virgin material temperatures were used in a Thermal Desktop model of the mechanical <b>retention</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>retention</b> <b>device</b> was analyzed and shown to cause a large increase in the maximum bondline temperature. In order to study the impact of individual ablation modelling parameters on the heatshield sizing process, a Monte Carlo simulation of the sizing process was proposed. The simulation will give the sensitivity of the ablation model to each of its input parameters. As part of the Monte Carlo simulation, statistical uncertainties on material properties were required for Avcoat. Several properties were difficult to acquire uncertainties for: the pyrolysis gas enthalpy, non-dimensional mass loss rate (Bc), and Arrhenius equation parameters. Variability in the elemental composition of Avcoat was used as the basis for determining the statistical uncertainty in pyrolysis gas enthalpy and Bc. A MATLAB program was developed to allow for faster, more accurate and automated computation of Arrhenius reaction parameters. These parameters are required for a material model {{to be used in the}} CHAR ablation analysis program. This MATLAB program, along with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, was used to generate uncertainties on the Arrhenius parameters for Avcoat. In addition, the TGA fitting program was developed to provide Arrhenius parameters for the ablation model of the gap filler material, RTV silicone...|$|E

In this work, the use of different hydrocyclone configurations for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell separation was investigated following an experimental design. It was shown that cell separation efficiencies for cultures of the wild-type CHO. K 1 cell line and of a recombinant CHO cell line producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were kept above 97 %. Low viability losses were observed, as measured by trypan blue exclusion and by determination of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released to the culture medium.

When cells were monitored for any induction of apoptosis upon passage through the hydrocyclones, no increase in apoptotic cell concentration was observed within 48  h of hydrocycloning.

The results show that thallium species are mainly retained in the solid by-products and are not emitted to air with flue gases in significant amounts, proving that this technology is a more effective means of preventing thallium emissions than pulverized coal combustion technology (PCC). The mass balance of the thallium content in the solids shows that this element was retained in the ashes separated by the different devices installed in the plant. An evaluation of the ash fractions taken from the strippers, the heat recovery area, the hoppers in the air heater and the electrostatic precipitator, shows that thallium was relatively homogeneously distributed in all the ash samples, independently of their composition, but is slightly related to surface area, which in turn is dependent on particle size and unburned carbon content.

40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{is a model}} organism {{for understanding}} sensory molecules of multicellular organisms. Ovulating hermaphrodites produce putative pheromone(s) that cause male attraction. Because pheromones are produced in such small quantities, adult conditioned-media from large-scale synchronous culture is necessary to analyze these pheromones. Current protocols for culture synchronization have volume constraints that limit large-scale synchronous cultures and current methodology for adult conditioned-media production is impractical. Modification of Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF) systems was investigated {{for use as a}} method to increase the volume limits of bleach egg harvest for C. elegans culture synchronization. Also, an adult <b>retention</b> <b>device</b> built within the culture vessel was investigated to optimize the environment for aseptic conditioned-media production from dense large-scale C. elegans cultures. During this investigation, we have shown that synchronous C. elegans cultures for adult conditioned-media production can be grown at scales larger than reported before, with potential for further scale up. Our growth methodologies have also yielded denser cultures than previously achieved at large scales. Since rapid bleach harvesting appears to be the bottleneck for large-scale production of synchronous C. elegans cultures, our approach of using modified TFF systems with mesh to retain C. elegans eggs increased the amount of eggs that could be bleach harvested at one time. Using this method {{we have been able to}} achieve up to 5 x 103 synchronous C. elegans per mL at a 50 L scale.

40|$|This study {{outlines}} a prestressed reactor pressure vessel, with integrated core-catching device, whose principal design {{characteristics are}} essentially oriented {{to the requirements}} of a 1300 MW_e_ 1 Konvoi pressurised water reactor. On the one hand, this type of core meltdown is retained in a relatively limited volume, in the course of which a reaction with water entering from the outside is repressed. On the other hand the selection is permitted of a prestressed reactor pressure vessel which is far greater than the size of conventional steel pressure vessels and, in addition, avoids accident sequences deriving from the spontaneous integral failure of the steel pressure vessel (bursting). The special feature of prestressed vessels is the devolution of various subfunctions to the individual vessel components. By the separation into supporting, bearing and sealing functions, the individual components can be optimised according to their specific requirements. In none of the structural components and loading cases investigated have impermissible stress values been achieved or even exeeded. The tensile stresses in the vessel components lie markedly under those of conventional vessel and, as the stress calculation show, only occur in small ranges.

40|$|Heterogeneities {{occur in}} various {{bioreactor}} designs including cell <b>retention</b> <b>devices.</b> Whereas in external devices changing environmental conditions cannot be prevented, cells are retained in their optimal environment in internal devices. Conventional reverse-flow diafiltration utilizes an internal membrane device, but pulsed feeding causes temporal heterogeneities. In this study, {{the influence of}} conventional reverse-flow diafiltration on the yeast Hansenula polymorpha is investigated. Alternating 180 s of feeding with 360 s of non-feeding at a dilution rate of 0. 2 h(- 1) results in an oscillating DOT signal with an amplitude of 60 %. Thereby, induced short-term oxygen limitations result {{in the formation of}} ethanol and a reduced product concentration of 25 %. This effect is enforced at increased dilution rate. To overcome this cyclic problem, sequential operation of three membranes is introduced. Thus, quasi-continuous feeding is achieved reducing the oscillation of the DOT signal to an amplitude of 20 % and 40 % for a dilution rate of 0. 2 h(- 1) and 0. 5 h(- 1), respectively. Fermentation conditions characterized by complete absence of oxygen limitation and without formation of overflow metabolites could be obtained for dilution rates from 0. 1 h(- 1) - 0. 5 h(- 1).
