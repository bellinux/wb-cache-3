40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to analyze problem maps in drilling activity, iden­tifying and mapping drilling risks, and analyze risk management strategy which should be prepared for drilling activity. The re­search was conducted at the TJG-HZ 1 wells, Asset 5 Region PT Pertamina EP, South Kalimantan. The tools used measurement and map­ping risks according to Godfrey (1996). Data collection con­sisted of five stages: obser­vation, interview, questionnaire, literature review, and focus group discussion. The results showed there are 24 identified risks which were divided into four risk categories which is financial, strategic, operational, and hazard. From the 24 risks, there were eight <b>risks</b> <b>in</b> the extreme level, five <b>risks</b> <b>in</b> the high level, five <b>risks</b> <b>in</b> the medium level, and six <b>risks</b> <b>in</b> the low le­vel...|$|R

5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors.

There is also an increased <b>risk</b> <b>in</b> people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced <b>risk</b> <b>in</b> tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E
