The methods developed increase network performance by considering routing approaches that take advantage of more available network resources than do current methods.

Simulations of these two routing approaches and their components demonstrate significant improvement over traditional routing strategies. The hybrid-Scout algorithm requires 3 - 4 times to 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less routing cost compared to traditional dynamic <b>metric</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms while delivering comparable network performance. For multipath routing, nodes using the multipath protocol fully exploit the offered paths and increase performance linearly in the additional resources provided by the multipath network.

50|$|The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} distance-vector routing {{protocols}} which employ the hop count as a <b>routing</b> <b>metric.</b> RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance and the route is considered unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.|$|E

By default, the IGRP composite metric is a sum of the segment delays and the lowest segment bandwidth.

Scale-free schemes are given for three problem models: name-independent routing on graphs, labeled <b>routing</b> on <b>metric</b> spaces, and labeled routing on graphs.

40|$|Abstract—Traffic {{engineering}} (TE) {{is promising}} {{to provide a}} more efficient traffic accommodation while cost <b>metric</b> <b>routing</b> such as OSPF, which sets routes so as to minimize link cost, is widespreadly used. However, a path setting by TE does not offer cost minimum paths, which may be the best paths from the viewpoint of the quality of service (QoS). Here, we study a partial traffic engineering (Partial TE) scheme. First in this scheme, a part of the traffic matrix is subjected to cost <b>metric</b> <b>routing</b> and its bandwidth is reserved. Then, we perform path calculation {{for the remainder of the}} traffic matrix which realizes TE. We also consider a special situation of Partial TE, called an oversubscription. Oversubscription is the traffic accommodation that can be expected and really possible, even if the bottleneck link(s) is caused by QoS traffic accommodated in advance. The simulation results confirm that Partial TE allows the TE to set paths that coexist with the cost minimum paths, which can be used to increase traffic accommodation when non-uniform metric or traffic is used. And good oversubscription properties are obtained, too, in many examples in which non-uniform metric or traffic is used. Index Terms—Traffic engineering, cost metric, shortest path, metric.

50|$|Decentralization is {{accomplished}} through having all nodes {{in the network}} snoop on subscribe messages going past them {{on their way to}} the topics root node. If the topic is one to which the current node subscribes, it will stop forwarding the packet toward the root node and add the node trying to subscribe as one of its children. In this way a treelike structure is formed with the root node at the top sending out to the first few subscriber nodes and then each of these nodes forwarding the messages on to their children, and so on. Because packets from random nodes on the Pastry network destined for the same node often end up traveling along the same path very soon in their journey, they end up attaching to whatever part of the tree is nearest to them in the Pastry network. Since each hop along a pastry route represents what is locally the best route according to the <b>routing</b> <b>metric</b> in use, the subscribe message seeks out the closest portion of the tree and attaches itself there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Routing {{protocols}} for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) {{have been}} explored extensively in last few years. Much {{of this work}} is targeted at finding a feasible route from a source to a destination without considering current network traffic or application requirements. Routing may let a congestion happen which is detected by congestion control, but dealing with congestion in reactive manner results in longer delay, and unnecessary packet loss and requires significant overhead if a new route is needed. Routing should not be aware of, but also be adaptive to, network congestion. Adaptation to the congestion helps to increase both the effectiveness and efficiency of routing. These problems are solved by the congestion-aware routing protocols in certain degree. These protocols which are adaptive to congestion status of mobile ad-hoc network can greatly improve the network performance.

40|$|At {{the eve of}} a new decade, when energy {{concerns}} are {{at the top of the}} research priorities, this work presents a new cost-benefit function for wire-less sensor networks (WSNs) powered by harvesting energy sources. The models rely on a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) that combines a super-capacitor (SC) with a Rechargeable Battery (RB). While the SC has low energy storage capability but is capable of providing high level of energy throughput and frequent charge cycles, the RB has higher energy storage capability but limited charge cycles. Our proposal for the protocol associated with HESS assigns different weights to the residual energy in both energy storage systems whilst favouring routes with more SC energy and harvesting rates. The main innovation is the application of a new <b>routing</b> cost <b>metric</b> to prolong the network lifetime. An energy model framework has been de-veloped in MATLAB with different application scenarios to test the proposed cost metric.
