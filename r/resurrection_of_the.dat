5|$|Production of the Mellotron ceased in 1986, but it regained {{popularity}} in the 1990s, and was used by several notable bands.

5|$|The {{expansion}} Rise of the Zilart {{reveals that}} the Crystal War and the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shadow Lord had been masterminded by the Zilart princes Eald'Narche and Kam'lanaut, who survived the extinction of their race. The two Zilarts plan to become Gods by opening the path to paradise, and the player is charged with thwarting their plans.|$|E
5|$|The manner {{with which}} van der Weyden {{presents}} the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead across the five lower panels {{is reminiscent of}} a Gothic tympanum, specifically that at Autun Cathedral.

5|$|Varaha {{symbolizes the}} <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth from a pralaya (dissolution of the universe) and the {{establishment}} of a new kalpa (aeon).

5|$|Church {{belief in}} the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{with the}} option of nuclear weapons {{discarded}} {{and the likelihood of}} operations beyond the Swiss border severely restricted, the Federal Military Department (EMD) decided that the next generation of aircraft acquired by the Swiss Air Force would be for close air support. While <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P-16 was discussed in the Swiss press (FFA had continued theoretical development the aircraft at its own expense, with its final variant, the AR-7, to be equipped with a Rolls-Royce RB168-25 engine), the choice narrowed to the Milan (a joint Swiss-French prototype variant of the Mirage III) and the American A-7G Corsair II, each of which had strong advocates within the Swiss Air Force.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} the events in Aria of Sorrow, Soma is living peacefully, and {{believes}} that his powers have been lost. A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that his powers were never lost, only dormant. He informs Soma that Celia {{is the head of}} a cult that seeks the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark lord. He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.|$|E
5|$|The key {{themes of}} the early Quranic verses {{included}} the responsibility of man towards his creator; the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God {{in all aspects of}} life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E
2500|$|Christians regard <b>the</b> <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus as <b>the</b> central {{doctrine}} in Christianity.

5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{dead at the}} Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, Southern Rhodesia again enthusiastically {{stood behind}} the UK, symbolically declaring war on Germany in support of Britain before any other colony or dominion. Over 26,000 Southern Rhodesians served in the Second World War, making the colony once more the largest {{contributor}} of manpower, proportional to white population, {{in all of the}} British Empire and Commonwealth. As in World War I, Southern Rhodesians were distributed in small groups throughout the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Dedicated Rhodesian platoons again served in the KRRC, and the Rhodesian African Rifles, raised in 1940, were in many ways a <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesia Native Regiment. Military aviation, already associated with the colony following the First World War, became a great Southern Rhodesian tradition during the Second, with the colony providing No. 44, No. 237 and No. 266 Squadrons and other personnel to the Royal Air Force, as well as training in Southern Rhodesia for 8,235 Allied airmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> just {{and to the left}} is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E

50|$|All four {{canonical}} gospels {{report the}} incident with some variations. Jesus' body {{was laid out}} in the tomb after crucifixion and death. All the gospels report that women were the first to discover <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus. <b>The</b> first hint that something had happened was the rolled-away stone. This stone, as was typical of ancient tombs, had covered the entrance. They found the tomb to be empty, the body gone, and a young man or angel(s) within the tomb or on the rolled-away stone tells the women that Jesus has risen. These accounts, along with many <b>Resurrection</b> appearances <b>of</b> Jesus, lead to beliefs concerning <b>the</b> <b>Resurrection</b> <b>of</b> Jesus. <b>The</b> empty tomb points to <b>the</b> revelation <b>of</b> Jesus' <b>resurrection,</b> implicitly in <b>the</b> canonical Gospel <b>of</b> Mark (without <b>the</b> later endings) and explicitly in the other three canonical gospel narratives.|$|R

5|$|The first {{federation}} {{attempt was}} made in 1900 with a <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county plan. In 1902, Hanley Council led attempts to form an expanded county borough, but disagreement over the complex financial issues of rates, assets and loans caused Fenton to pull out, quickly followed by Burslem and Stoke, and the proposal was abandoned in 1903. The second and final federation process, between 1905 and 1910, was instigated by Longton Town Council with support from Stoke and Hanley and opposition from Fenton, Tunstall and Burslem. Issues again arose over the financial settlement and discussions continued during {{the progress of the}} Federation Bill through Parliament. The bill was passed in the House of Commons and was still under debate in the House of Lords when the six towns announced that they had come to an agreement. Passed in December 1908, the act came into force on 31 March 1910. The new Stoke-on-Trent was a county borough from then until 1974. In addition, city status was granted to Stoke-on-Trent by King George V on 1 July 1925.|$|E
5|$|The species {{pertaining}} to Deinosuchus since the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generic name in 1979 have been traditionally recognized as D. rugosus {{from the eastern}} side of the Western Interior Seaway and the larger D. riograndensis from the western side, characterized by differences of the shape of their osteoderms and teeth, this view was not always favored by all researchers and in 2002 it was proposed that there was only one species, Deinosuchus rugosus, with the differences found between the two species explained as the result of the larger size of the western morph. This proposal faced support and criticism and was dropped in 2010 when new fossils of specimens from both sides of the interior seaway showed that the differences between the two morphs were not just size related, teeth from large eastern specimens retained the common characteristics of other specimens of the region and osteoderms from small specimens of the western morph were no different from those of large ones, supporting the specific separation of the two morphs, now formalized as D. rugosus and D. riograndensis.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} {{weaknesses}} of the see of York was its lack of suffragan bishops. Thurstan managed to secure the <b>resurrection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Diocese of Galloway, or Whithorn, in 1125. It is possible that he compromised with Fergus of Galloway, who was the lord or sub-king of Galloway, {{in what is now}} Scotland. In this Thurstan secured another suffragan, and Fergus gained a bishop in his lordship, where previously ecclesiastical matters in his subkingdom had been handled by Scottish bishops. The first bishop was the native Galwegian– Gilla Aldan. This provoked the wrath of Wimund, Bishop of the Isles, who had previously had jurisdiction over Galloway; but the new bishopric survived, and York had a new suffragan, an important step in the battle between York and Canterbury over the primacy, which was mainly a battle over the prestige of their respective sees. The number of bishops subject to either archbishop was an important factor in the reputation of each. In 1133, Thurstan, who had received papal permission to found an entirely new diocese, consecrated Æthelwold as the first bishop of the new see of Carlisle.|$|E
