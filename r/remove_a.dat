50|$|Iodine has a {{nutritional}} relationship with selenium. A family of selenium-dependent enzymes called deiodinases converts T4 to T3 (the active hormone) by <b>removing</b> <b>an</b> iodine atom {{from the outer}} tyrosine ring. These enzymes also convert T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) by <b>removing</b> <b>an</b> inner ring iodine atom; and convert T3 to 3,3'-Diiodothyronine (T2) also by <b>removing</b> <b>an</b> inner ring atom. Both of the latter are inactivated hormones which are ready for disposal and have essentially no biological effects. A family of non-selenium dependent enzymes then further deiodinates the products of these reactions.|$|R
