25|$|Mostly sessile oak-hornbeam woodland, {{the site}} {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other tree and shrub species, including numerous exotics planted when the wood included parts of large gardens. The flora includes numerous indicators of long-established woodland; <b>ramsons</b> (Allium ursinum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa). Two British woodpeckers breed, along with nuthatch, treecreeper, tawny owl, kestrel and sparrowhawk, whilst hobby bred in 2015. Invertebrates are well recorded and include the purple hairstreak, white-letter hairstreak and speckled wood butterflies, several nationally scarce bees and wasps, and stag beetles. Fungi are also well recorded and mosses include Mnium punctatum at its only known London locality.|$|E
25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has the strangest appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and thermophile animals such as the sand lizard thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May <b>ramsons</b> turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the Cytisus scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E

Furthermore, we attempted to determine whether this inhibition could occur by targeting regulatory elements of the cell cycle. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to observe apoptosis and the cell cycle in AGS cell lines treated or not treated with <b>ramson</b> watery extract. Proteins related to the cell cycle were detected by Western blotting. Caspase activity was measured using a colorimetric assay kit according to the manufacturer&# 39;s instructions. Results: <b>Ramson</b> watery extract induced apoptosis and G 2 /M phase arrest in AGS cells. Western blotting showed that cyclin B was inhibited by <b>ramson</b> watery extract. However, G 1 phase-related proteins remain unchanged after treatment. Conclusion: Our results indicate that <b>ramson</b> effectively suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis and G 2 /M arrest in AGS cells by regulating elements of the cell cycle.

500|$|Green borscht (...) , a light soup {{made from}} leaf vegetables, {{is an example}} common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. The {{naturally}} tart-tasting sorrel is most commonly used, but spinach, chard, nettle, garden orache and occasionally dandelion, goutweed or <b>ramsons,</b> may be added as well, especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed. Like beetroot borscht, {{it is based on}} meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled with dill. There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} parks and allotments within Sneinton, such as Belvoir Park and the Dale Allotments, but {{by far the}} largest green space is Colwick Woods. Colwick Woods lies to the east of Sneinton, and, at 50 {{hectares}} or 123 acres, is almost as large as Sneinton itself. It is a mixture of grassland and ancient woodland, and forms a Local Nature Reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. [...] The ancient woodland is a habitat for indicator species such as dogs mercury and <b>ramsons.</b> The site is rich in mammal species including both species of pipistrelle and noctule bat. Public rights of way are marked out across the site, along with desire paths that run throughout the woods. The woods and meadows, unusually close to a city centre, are very popular with local people for outdoor activities including walking, mountain biking, and other activities.|$|E

50|$|Allium ursinum - {{known as}} <b>ramsons,</b> buckrams, wild garlic, {{broad-leaved}} garlic, wood garlic, bear leek, or bear's garlic - is a wild relative of chives native to Europe and Asia.

In Europe, where <b>ramsons</b> are popularly harvested from the wild, similarity to poisonous plants such as lily of the valley or Colchicum autumnale regularly leads to cases of poisoning.|$|E
