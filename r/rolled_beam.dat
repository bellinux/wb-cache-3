40|$|Heat {{straightening}} {{of steel}} beams on bridges struck by over height trucks has become {{common practice in}} recent years in Iowa. A study of the effects of this heat straightening on the steel beams thus straightened is needed. Appropriate samples for mechanical and metallurgical tests were cut from the same <b>rolled</b> <b>beam</b> from the end which was heated and the end which was not heated and the test results were compared. The test results showed beyond doubt that the steel was being heated beyond the permitted temperature and that the impact properties are being drastically reduced by the current method of heat straightening...|$|E
40|$|The {{smoothness}} of a beam line {{refers to}} the quality of the relative positioning of a number of adjacent beam guiding components. The fact that smoothness is of highest priority when positioning magnets can be seen in the local tolerances imposed by the beam optics. In the past, smoothing has been done by separating horizontal and vertical misalignments and then applying some sort of analytical or manual ''feathering'' technique. The Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) did not easily lend itself to this sort of smoothing because of the highly coupled nature of its pitched and <b>rolled</b> <b>beam</b> line. This paper will discuss an attempt to develop a repeatable method which is independent of the inconsistencies of human judgment and can simultaneously smooth in two or more dimensions. Four major goals were defined for the smoothing algorithm used on the SLC alignment. The first, was to simultaneously model errors for both horizontal and vertical directions. Secondly, a smooth curve whose shape was suggested by the data and not by a predetermined model was implied by the fact that unknown systematic errors were being eliminated. Thirdly, this curve must be a reproducibly fit, independent of the inconsistent nature of human judgment. Fourth, the result of the procedure was to minimize the number and size of magnet movements to reach the final alignment criteria...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{types of}} {{structural}} elements, like riveted or <b>rolled</b> <b>beams</b> and girders, etc., of older steels, often have tapered flanges and the steels themselves {{are as a}} rule mor or less inhomogeneous. The fracture toughness at in-plane loading of related structural details, has been observed to vary significantly in the thickness direction and generally increases outwardly from the mid-section part. The most common fracture toughness test specimen used for testing of samples taken from oldes steel structures, in e. g. assessment work, is the three point bend specimen. This specimen, like all standard specimen types, is plane-parallel and if machined from a tapered part it will not necessarily yield a fair estimate of the effective fracture toughness for a through crack in situations where fracture toughness varies across the thickness. In view of this, a modified three point bend specimen with partly tapered sides has been designed so as to accomodate samples with this feature. The project includes calibration, testing and evalutation of the modified specimen. The firt part of the project, which is reported here, is mainly analytical and is aimed at obtaining a first and rough estimate {{of the order of}} influence the modified geometry upon crack tip parameters.

40|$|With the {{increase}} in terrorist attacks in recent years, the effects of explosions on building become highly topical. In this regard, the paper deals with the analysis of blast loaded steel structures. When a blast loaded structure is analysed, as known, two major design issues and scientific challenges have to be approached and solved. The first issue derives from the analysis and description of the input dynamic load (time-pressure wave), being dependent {{on the type of}} explosion and explosive, while the second issue is related to the analysis of the actual dynamic response of the structure under impact. As such, real field blast tests using the so called ANFO explosives are first presented. The examined constructional system consists of steel <b>rolled</b> <b>beams</b> with two different type of cross sections (HEB 100 and IPE 120). The actual experimental observations are then assessed and compared with both SDOF and FE models carried out in ABAQUS. In doing so, the actual shape (i. e. decaying path for the pressure load) of the experimental blast wave is used, together with two further approximations for its description. The comparative calculations are then proposed for selected control points, in terms of mechanical and kinematic quantities (i. e. displacements, accelerations and strains). A critical discussion of the so collected comparative results is hence proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Lateral Torsional Buckling of Welded Wide Flange Beams Md. Imran Kabir Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) can {{be defined}} as a {{combination}} of lateral displacement and twisting due to an application of load on an unsupported beam. Design specifications of Canada CSA S 16 - 14 provides solutions for LTB of welded and <b>rolled</b> <b>beams</b> that were derived for constant moment situation. Same equations have been used over the years for design of rolled and welded shape beams. A recent study has shown that the current code equations might overestimate the capacity of the welded wide shape beams, which make them unsafe to use. Thus a detailed study is required to evaluate the existing LTB equations for welded wide flange (WWF) shapes. This thesis evaluates the performance of current equations in providing LTB capacities of WWF shape beams. A nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to investigate the LTB capacity of WWF shape beams. The validated FE model is used to analyze a series of simply supported WWF shape beams with varying unbraced lengths and subjected to equal end moments. Four different patterns of residual stresses and a constant initial imperfection of L/ 1000 are considered for the analysis. In total, 320 FE models are analyzed, and it is observed that current code overestimates the LTB capacity of WWF shape beams as much as of 37...|$|R

40|$|The {{bumper beam}} today is {{generally}} {{made of steel}} via stamping. The structural and Complexity potential of such parts is very high but investments and variable costs are significant. A process offering an economic and flexible alternative is roll forming. In this paper, a simulation {{has been done in}} order to compare between roll forming and stamping bumper beam. CAD softwares have been used for the simulation and analysis which are Solidwork 2005 and finite element analysis software Algor version 21. The bumper beams have been design in Solidwork and the Algor has been used to make stress analysis to the bumper beams. The static stress with linear material model has been applied to the both bumper beams that are from stamping and roll forming for comparison. The surface loads that have been applied to the bumper beams are calculated from the velocity of Gen- 2 car at 80 km/h to 120 km/h. From the analysis the maximum stress for stamping bumper beam is 282. 82 MPa and 243. 29 MPa for <b>roll</b> forming bumper <b>beam.</b> After that, the analysis about costs to produce each bumper beam has been done.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the behaviour of thin webbed rolled steel joists or universal beams when they are subjected to concentrated loads applied to the flanges. The prime concern is the effect of high direct stresses causing web failure in a small region of the beam. The review shows that although many tests have been carried out on <b>rolled</b> steel <b>beams</b> and built up girders, no series of tests has restricted the number of variables involved to enable firm conclusions to be drawn. The results of 100 tests on several different <b>rolled</b> steel universal <b>beam</b> sections having various types of loading conditions are presented. The majority of the beams are tested by loading with two opposite loads, thus eliminating the effects of bending and shear, except for a small number of beams which are tested simply supported on varying spans. The test results are first compared with the present design standard (BS 449) and it is shown that the British Standard is very conservative for most of the loading conditions included in the tests but is unsafe for others. Three possible failure modes are then considered, overall elastic buckling of the web, flexural yielding of the web due to large out of plane deflexions and local crushing of the material at the junction of the web and the root fillets. Each mode is considered theoretically and developed to establish the main variables, thus enabling a comparison to be made with the test results. It is shown that all three failure modes have a particular relevance for individual loading conditions, but that determining the failure load given the beam size and the loading conditions is very difficult in certain instances. Finally it is shown that there are some empirical relationships between the failure loads and the type of loading for various beam serial sizes...|$|R
