To date, the selected cells kept their loss of susceptibility for 100 microM. Here we evaluated two processes known {{to be important in}} insecticide resistance, namely metabolism and pharmacokinetics, in the selected methoxyfenozide- and 20 E-resistant subclones. Synergism experiments with piperonyl butoxide, S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate, and diethyl maleate, which are respective inhibitors of monooxygenases, esterases, and gluthation-S-transferases, did not affect the level of the <b>resistance.</b> <b>To</b> <b>check</b> the possible existence of active transport in the resistant cells, we used ouabain, an inhibitor of active membrane transport.

Aiming to study the Al effects on nutrient uptake of maize genotypes differing in Al <b>resistance</b> and <b>to</b> <b>check</b> whether differences in mineral nutrition under Al stress correspond with <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Al in maize, an experiment involving 10 maize genotypes differing in Al resistance and 2 concentrations of Al (0 and 100 µM Al) was established. Total plant (shoot + root) uptake of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) was determined in maize plants after 14 days of growth in culture solution at the two concentrations of Al. The relative uptake [(uptake at 100 µM Al/uptake at 0 µM Al) × 100] of the nutrients studied varied from 22 % to 157 %, indicating the existence of intraspecific variation for such feature {{in the presence of}} Al. Generally, Al had negative effects on the uptake of macro- and micronutrients. Al effects were most pronounced on the uptake of Ca and Mg, with respective reductions of 61 % and 72 %, when averaged across the 10 genotypes. Among the micronutrients, the most pronounced effects of Al were noted on Mn and Zn. Despite showing significant reductions in uptake of Ca and Mg, the maize genotypes showed a rather variable sensitivity to the Al stress imposed, which was related <b>to</b> their general <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Al previously assessed using root length as indicator.

40|$|Purpose: There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of individuals administered antiretroviral therapy (ART) in India but treatment outcome is hampered by increasing development of drug resistance. Previous reports from India have shown M 184 V as the commonest mutation in treated individuals. However, there is no evidence for any protease mutations in these reports. This study was done to observe the common/unique mutational patterns observed in reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (Pr) genes of clade C HIV- 1 strains from individuals showing treatment failure in India. Materials and Methods: The assay was done by sequencing the Pr and RT genes of the HIV- 1 strains from 18 individuals failing ART. Analysis was carried out using Stanford HIV drug resistance database (SHDB). The sequences were also submitted to the calibrated population resistance tool of SHDB and Rega HIV- 1 sub typing tool. Phylogenetic analysis and quality control were performed with Mega 4. Results: Among the 20 strains, 19 showed <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), one strain to NNRTIs and five strains showed protease inhibitors (PI) resistance and 3 -class resistance. The most common mutation conferring NRTI resistance was M 184 V (90 &#x 0025;) while K 103 N (45 &#x 0025;) was the most common mutation conferring NNRTI resistance. The M 46 I mutation was seen in 20 &#x 0025; of the Pr sequences. Conclusion: <b>Resistance</b> testing <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the prevalence of drug resistance mutations that arise following failure of the first line regimen to establish guidelines for second line regimens in India is a must.

Bioassays conducted on the NOQA strain with modified and non-modified Cry 1 Ac showed that modified Cry 1 Ac was in fact the less effective toxin. This supports the hypothesis that the mechanism of resistance in NOQA population is not cadherin based.

As per the survey conducted the pesticide application is very high in the study area and the level of awareness among the farmers was very poor regarding the method of application and its socio-economic and ecological impacts.

Out of the 9 strains isolated 6 were highly resistant to endosulfan (500 - 700 μg/ml) and the other 3 isolates showed the resistance of 250 - 500 μg/ml.

There are several methods of control to reduce losses due to sorghum midge, which include cultural practices, biological control, chemical control and resistant cultivars. The best long-term solution for sorghum midge control is the use of genetic resistance in cultivars and hybrids. Recently, sorghum midge resistant hybrids have been developed by several sorghum breeding programs, but there is limited information about agronomic performance relative to planting dates compared to susceptible standards. Thus, the objectives of this research project are: (1) to evaluate the value of sorghum midge resistant sorghum hybrids in the USA production system, (2) to confirm the presence of sorghum midge insect resistance in sorghum hybrids, and (3) to determine whether the resistance in eighteen sorghum hybrids is stable across two environments in Texas where sorghum midge is a damaging pest.

40|$|The main hydroxamic acid in maize (Zea mays L.) is 2 - 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxy- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one (DIMBOA). DIMBOA confers <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> leaf-feeding {{by several}} corn borers. Most genes {{involved}} in the DIMBOA metabolic pathway are located on the short arm of chromosome 4, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in maize <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> leaf-feeding by corn borers have been localized to that region. However, the low resolution of QTL linkage mapping does not allow convincing proof that genetic variation at bx loci {{was responsible for the}} variability for resistance. This study addressed the following objectives: to determine the QTLs involved in DIMBOA synthesis across genetically divergent maize inbreds using eight RIL families from the nested association mapping population, <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the stability of QTLs for DIMBOA content across years by evaluating two of those RIL families in 2 years, and to test the involvement of bx 1 by performing association mapping with a panel of 281 diverse inbred lines. QTLs were stable across different environments. A genetic model including eight markers explained approximately 34...|$|R
30|$|Another concern {{related to}} the {{patentability}} of cisgenic crops concerns the traceability of cisgenic plants. This becomes extra complicated when traditional breeding becomes capable of developing and commercializing a variety with for example <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> late blight, and both LBR potato via traditional breeding as well as GM co-exist. It then becomes difficult, if not impossible, <b>to</b> <b>check</b> whether a plant is cisgenic in retrospect and to keep control of where the patentable plant ends up, whether it crosses with other species and the assessment thereof. Moreover, there is uncertainty about the legal and economic consequences for farmers for unintended contamination through gene flow, {{as well as for}} the patent holder to potentially argue that his patent was breached.|$|R
40|$|Recently a {{heterozygote}} advantage was suggested {{to explain the}} high incidence (1 : 25 carrier individuals in Europeans) of the cystic fibrosis gene. This selective advantage was speculated to be due <b>to</b> a high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> chloride-secreting diarrhea, including cholera. Up to now the major efforts to test directly this hypothesis have been limited to animal models. We propose to verify the hypothesis directly on a sample of human individuals who died from cholera during the epidemic in the Mediterranean basin {{at the beginning of}} the nineteenth century. In this preliminary investigation we have attempted <b>to</b> <b>check</b> for the presence of amplifiable DNA in the human remains simultaneously in terms of genetic fingerprints and for cystic fibrosis mutations...|$|R
