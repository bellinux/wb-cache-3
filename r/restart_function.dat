50|$|The {{condition}} {{system is}} responsible for exception handling in Common Lisp. It provides conditions, handlers and restarts. Conditions are objects describing an exceptional situation (for example an error). If a condition is signaled, the Common Lisp system searches for a handler for this condition type and calls the handler. The handler can now search for restarts and use one of these restarts to automatically repair the current problem, using information such as the condition type and any relevant information provided {{as part of the}} condition object, and call the appropriate <b>restart</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

The 1957 Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. There were serious difficulties with the air suspension. Some owners found it cheaper to have the system removed and replaced with conventional coil springs. Only 400 Series 70 Eldorado Broughams were sold in 1957.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Progress is {{investigated}} for a shared-memory distributed {{system with a}} weak form of fault tolerance that allows processes to stop and <b>restart</b> <b>functioning</b> without no-tification. The concept of bounded fairness is introduced to formalize bounded delay {{under the assumption that}} each family of related processes continuously contains at least one active member. This is a generalization of wait-freedom, and also of a finitary form of weak fairness. Several useful proof rules are stated and proved. In a system with bounded fairness, a wait-free process can be constructed by forming a new process in which processes from the various families are scheduled in a round robin way. The theory is applied to prove progress within bounded delay for a linearizing con-current data-object in shared memory. The safety properties of this algorithm have been treated elsewhere...|$|R

For analytic *f* we derive a novel <b>restart</b> <b>function</b> that identifies the error in the Lanczos approximation. The restart procedure is then generated by a restart formula using a sequence of these restart functions. We present an error bound for the proposed restart scheme. We also present an error bound for the restarted Lanczos approximation of *f(A) b* for symmetric positive definite *A* when *f* is in a particular class of completely monotone functions. We illustrate for some important matrix function applications the usefulness of these bounds for terminating the restart process once the desired accuracy in the matrix function approximation has been achieved...|$|E

This problem arises in the implementation of exponential integrators for semilinear parabolic problems.

Moreover, we show how Ritz vectors can be included in order to speed up the computation even further. By a number of numerical examples, we will illustrate that the proposed method will reduce the total number of Krylov steps significantly compared to a standard implementation if the vectors correspond to the evaluation of a smooth function at certain quadrature points.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{projected}} Nesterov’s proximalgradient (PNPG) scheme for reconstructing sparse signals from compressive Poisson-distributed measurements with the mean signal intensity that follows an affine model with known intercept. The objective function to be minimized is a sum of convex data fidelity (negative log-likelihood (NLL)) and regularization terms. We apply sparse signal regularization where the signal {{belongs to a}} nonempty closed convex set within {{the domain of the}} NLL and signal sparsity is imposed using total-variation (TV) penalty. We present analytical upper bounds on the regularization tuning constant. The proposed PNPG method employs projected Nesterov’s acceleration step, <b>function</b> <b>restart,</b> and an adaptive stepsize selection scheme that accounts for varying local Lipschitz constant of the NLL. We establish O k 2 convergence of the PNPG method with step-size backtracking only and no restart.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of consecutive-k-out-of-n: F repairable systems and (k− 1) -step Markov dependence is studied. The model analyzed {{in this paper}} is more general than those of previous studies given that repair time and component lifetimes are random variables that follow a general distribution. The system has one repair service which adopts a priority repair rule based on system failure risk. Since crude simulation {{has proved to be}} inefficient for highly dependable systems, the RESTART method was used for the estimation of steady-state unavailability, MTBF and unreliability. Probabilities up to the order of 10 − 16 have been accurately estimated with little computational effort. In this method, a number of simulation retrials are performed when the process enters regions of the state space where the chance of occurrence of a rare event (e. g., a system failure) is higher. The main difficulty for the application of this method is to find a suitable function, called the importance function, to define the regions. Given the simplicity involved in changing some model assumptions with <b>RESTART,</b> the importance <b>function</b> used in this paper could be useful for dependability estimation of many systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} fast {{proximal}} gradient scheme for reconstructing nonnegative signals that are sparse in a transform domain from underdetermined measurements. This signal model {{is motivated by}} tomographic applications where the signal of interest {{is known to be}} nonnegative because it represents a tissue or material density. We adopt the unconstrained regularization framework where the objective function to be minimized is a sum of a convex data fidelity (negative log-likelihood (NLL)) term and a regularization term that imposes signal nonnegativity and sparsity via an ` 1 -norm constraint on the signal’s transform coefficients. This objective function is minimized via Nesterov’s proximal-gradient method with <b>function</b> <b>restart,</b> where the proximal mapping is computed via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To accelerate the convergence, we develop an adaptive continuation scheme and a step-size selection scheme that accounts for varying local Lipschitz constant of the NLL. In the numerical examples, we consider Gaussian linear and Poisson generalized linear measurement models. We compare the proposed penalized NLL minimization approach and existing signal reconstruction methods via compressed sensing and tomographic reconstruction experiments and demonstrate that, by exploiting both the nonnegativity of the underlying signal and sparsity of its wavelet coefficients, we can achieve significantly better reconstruction performance than the existing methods...|$|R
40|$|Mobile group II introns retrohome by an RNP-based {{mechanism}} {{in which the}} intron RNA reverse splices into a DNA site and is reverse transcribed by the associated intron-encoded protein. The resulting intron cDNA is then integrated into the genome by cellular mechanisms that have remained unclear. Here, we used an Escherichia coli genetic screen and Taqman qPCR assay that mitigate indirect effects to identify host factors that function in retrohoming. We then analyzed mutants identified in these and previous genetic screens by using a new biochemical assay that combines group II intron RNPs with cellular extracts to reconstitute the complete retrohoming reaction in vitro. The genetic and biochemical analyses indicate a retrohoming pathway involving degradation of the intron RNA template by a host RNase H and second-strand DNA synthesis by the host replicative DNA polymerase. Our results reveal ATP-dependent steps in both cDNA and second-strand synthesis and a surprising role for replication restart proteins in initiating second-strand synthesis {{in the absence of}} DNA replication. We also find an unsuspected requirement for host factors in initiating reverse transcription and a new RNA degradation pathway that suppresses retrohoming. Key features of the retrohoming mechanism may be used by human LINEs and other non-LTR-retrotransposons, which are related evolutionarily to mobile group II introns.

40|$|On 26 December 2004, an {{earthquake}} in the West Coast of Northern Sumatra {{set off a}} series of other earthquakes lasting for several hours {{which resulted in a}} Tsunami in the Indian Ocean. This led to widespread disaster, particularly in Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives, Indonesia and Thailand, with damage also in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Somalia, the Seychelles and Kenya. Sri Lanka, the ‘pearl of the Indian Ocean’, blessed with abundant natural resources, faced one of the worst natural disasters recorded in recent history. The Tsunami struck a relatively thin but long coastal area stretching over 1, 000 kilometers - two thirds of the country's coastline. The destructive ocean waves killed more than 35, 000 people, displaced nearly 2, 500, 000 people and destroyed thousands of houses. The overall damage to Sri Lanka is estimated at 1 billion, with a large proportion of losses concentrated in housing, tourism, fisheries and transportation. Development Partners range from private individuals both inside and outside Sri Lanka, to governments and NGOs. Coastal infrastructure, namely roads, railways, power, telecommunications, water supply and fishing ports were also significantly affected. Reactions ranged from immediate assistance to communities and local governments in <b>restarting</b> to <b>function</b> as speedily as possible, to short and long-term assistance in supporting communities to rebuild their infrastructure and housing so that they might again have normal lives and eventually recover from the trauma of the tsunami. As the infrastructure consists primarily of transportation, electric and telecommunications, and water and sewerage facilities that provide services to the public through a network of roads, rails, ports, airports, pipes and lines, the effectiveness of infrastructure systems impact on all economic activities. In this context, this paper aims to analyse the impact of the Tsunami on infrastructure facilities in Sri Lanka and how the postTsunami reconstruction process has affected the development of the same. A comprehensive literature review was carried out regarding the Tsunami {{and its impact on the}} nation. The infrastructure-related reconstruction and rehabilitation data were obtained from the RADA (Reconstruction And Development Agency, formerly TAFREN) through unstructured interviews conducted among personnel involved in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities.

50|$|Nucleus {{supports}} up to 256 processes, {{and schedules}} these automatically using a fixed priority scheme. OS4000 lives entirely within these processes. A set of system tables {{are used to}} configure Nucleus, and access to these system tables can be granted to processes which need to alter the configuration of Nucleus, e.g. to load new programs into processes, adjust the Nucleus scheduling for time-shared processes, etc. The system tables tell Nucleus which processes are permitted {{to communicate with each}} other, and these are updated as processes are created and destroyed, e.g. when users login and logout. All I/O is performed directly from processes, and the system tables identify which processes have access to which peripherals and handle peripheral interrupts. For example, a device driver for a disk controller is a process, which is responsible for issuing commands through Nucleus to the disk controller, and handling the interrupts passed back from the disk controller via Nucleus, and the system tables will explicitly state that process has access to that disk controller. The system tables will not grant this device driver access to any other peripherals. In the event of a process stopping or crashing, Nucleus looks up its owner process in the system tables, and informs it. The owner process can then take the decision to let the system continue running without that process, or to take out the system (like a Unix panic), or to take some action such as reload and/or <b>restart</b> the process. <b>Functions</b> such as filesystems, store allocation, terminal drivers, timing services, etc. also exist as separate processes.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{show through}} a {{contrastive}} analysis of person reference in Catalan and Spanish parliamentary discourse, {{that it is}} paramount {{to take into account}} not only syntactic but also pragmatic factors in order to adequately analyse the differences between two languages that have rather similar morphological paradigms. Indeed, whereas Catalan and Spanish are two Romance languages which share various important features concerning person reference, among others {{the fact that they are}} pro-drop languages, our analysis aims to show that important contrasts may be found at a pragmatic level, especially in a conflictual genre such as parliamentary debate (Blas Arroyo 2011). Based on previous language-specific studies (among others Gelabert 2006), we analyse all the occurrences of speaker- and addressee-reference in a corpus of Spanish and Catalan parliamentary debates, taking into account among others the reference established, the political function of the utterer and the position in the utterance. In the first place, we show that singular deictics are more used in Spanish, whereas plural forms are preferred in Catalan. This may be related to the political system as a whole, more specifically to the higher presence of coalitions in the Catalan system, which favour that the speaker refers to a group rather than to individuals. In the second place, we discuss differences in the use of the formal address forms, showing that, contrary to what is claimed in the literature, Catalan vostè is more frequent than Spanish usted. Moreover, both forms occupy different positions in the utterance, notably with respect to the verb form. Finally, we show that some differences in the use of vocatives (Cuenca 2004) may be due to the debating styles and history of the respective parliaments. Indeed, whereas the slightly archaic su señoría (‘your Lordship’) is still widely (though not exclusively) used in the Spanish parliament, this form is inexistent in the Catalan parliament, possibly due to the fact that the Catalan parliament <b>restarted</b> its <b>functioning</b> in 1980 after a 40 years-interruption, taking up a more modern style of address in which su señoría no longer had a place. We will show that the specific position of su(s) señoría(s) in Spanish impacts on the vocative use as a whole and explains the different frequencies of vocatives in Catalan and Spanish parliament, and also the different frequency of usted(s) and vostè(s) mentioned above. Thus, through this contrastive analysis of Spanish and Catalan, we will show that it is fruitful to take into account pragmatic and discursive features in contrastive studies of two closely related languages...|$|R

To examine the potential effect of IF 2 on restart mechanisms, we characterized its influence on cellular recovery following DNA damage by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and UV damage. Mutations that prevent expression of full-length IF 2 - 1 or truncated IF 2 - 2 and IF 2 - 3 isoforms affected cellular growth or recovery following DNA damage differently, influencing different restart mechanisms. A deletion mutant (del 1) expressing only IF 2 - 2 / 3 was severely sensitive to growth {{in the presence of}} DNA-damaging agent MMS. Proficient as wild type in repairing DNA lesions and promoting replication restart upon removal of MMS, this mutant was nevertheless unable to sustain cell growth in the presence of MMS; however, growth in MMS could be partly restored by disruption of sulA, which encodes a cell division inhibitor induced during replication fork arrest. Moreover, such characteristics of del 1 MMS sensitivity were shared by restart mutant priA 300, which encodes a helicase-deficient restart protein. Epistasis analysis indicated that del 1 in combination with priA 300 had no further effects on cellular recovery from MMS and UV treatment; however, the del 2 / 3 mutation, which allows expression of only IF 2 - 1, synergistically increased UV sensitivity in combination with priA 300.
