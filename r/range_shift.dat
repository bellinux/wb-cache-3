A study by Camille Parmesan and Gary Yohe published in 2003 illustrates this point well. 434 of the species analysed were characterized as having changed their ranges. 80% of observed range changes were made polewards or upward, as predicted by global climate change, at an average of 6.1 km per decade.

A correlation in time between the observed <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> and climatic changes has led to an expectation of climate as the driving factor, while other factors and their interactions with climate have received less attention. One factor which might affect species distribution, both directly and in interaction with climate, is dynamics in the species communities induced by two key factors of disturbance: large herbivores and hikers. Intensity of these factors has changed dramatically over the past century. I investigated the effect of large herbivore grazing and hiking on upward plant species <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> and dynamics in the summit flora species composition, through a resurvey study in three areas along the south-north axis of the Scandes.

Even so, the relative contribution of species detectability to the variation in measured <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> rates among species is poorly understood. How can true range shifts be discerned from sampling artefacts? Location: Australia. Methods: We simulate range shifts for species which differ in their abundance for comparison to patterns derived from empirical <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> data from two regional-scale (100 s km) empirical studies. We demonstrate the use of spatial occupancy data in a distance-to-edge (DTE) model to assess changes in geographical range edges of fish species within a temperate reef fish community. Results: Simulations identified how sampling design can produce relatively larger error in <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> estimates in less abundant species, patterns that correspond with those observed in real data. Application of the DTE model allowed us to estimate {{the location of the}} true range edge with high accuracy in common species. In addition, upper confidence bounds for range edge estimates identified species with range edges that have likely shifted in location. Conclusions: Simulation and modelling approaches used to quantify the level of confidence that can be placed in observed range shifts are particularly valuable for studies of marine species, where observations are typically few and patchy. Given the observed variability in <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> estimates, the inclusion of confidence bounds on estimates of geographical range edges will advance our capacity to disentangle true distributional change from artefacts of sampling design...|$|E

Range edges are naturally dynamic, and shifts in the location of range edges occur at different rates and are driven by different mechanisms. This leads to challenges when seeking to generalize responses among taxa and across systems. We focus on warming-related range shifts in marine systems to describe extensions and contractions as stages. Range extensions occur as a sequence of (1) arrival, (2) population increase, and (3) persistence. By contrast, range contractions occur progressively as (1) performance decline, (2) population decrease and (3) local extinction. This stage-based framework can be broadly applied to geographic shifts in any species, life-history stage, or population subset. Ideally the probability of transitioning through progressive <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> stages could be estimated from empirical understanding of the various factors influencing <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> rates.

40|$|Aim: Evidence {{indicates}} that species {{are responding to}} climate change through distributional <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> that track suitable climatic conditions. We aim to elucidate the role of meso-scale dispersal barriers in climate-tracking responses. Location: South coast of England (the English Channel). Methods: Historical distributional data of four intertidal invertebrate species were logistically regressed against sea surface temperature (SST) to determine a climate envelope. This envelope was used to estimate the expected climate-tracking response since 1990 along the coast, which was compared with observed range expansions. A hydrodynamic modelling approach was used to identify dispersal barriers and explore disparities between expected and observed climate tracking. Results: <b>Range</b> <b>shifts</b> detected by field survey over the past 20 years were less than those predicted by {{the changes that have}} occurred in SST. Hydrodynamic model simulations indicated that physical barriers produced by complex tidal currents have variably restricted dispersal of pelagic larvae amongst the four species. Main conclusions: We provide the first evidence that meso-scale hydrodynamic barriers have limited climate-induced <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> and demonstrate that life history traits affect the ability of species to overcome such barriers. This suggests that current forecasts may be flawed, both by overestimating <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> and by underestimating climatic tolerances of species. This has implications for our understanding of climate change impacts on global biodiversity...|$|R
