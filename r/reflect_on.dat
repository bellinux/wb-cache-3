40|$|This article {{proposed}} a psychological mechanism for improving future work motivation by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences. Previous studies {{have claimed that}} future motivation is maintained by present self-affirmation and a future ideal, and have overlooked the effect of <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences. Rather, it has been claimed that <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences leads to overconfidence or anxiety, and impairs future motivation. In contrast, this article points out that people can maintain motivation through (1) imagining clearly their future ideal selves (setting goals), (2) <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences related to the ideal, and (3) acquiring lessons from the past. In a review of previous studies, we examined the process of <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences to improve future motivation. We showed that people with a clear ideal (goal) <b>reflected</b> <b>on</b> past experiences related to that ideal, and acquired lessons and mental rewards from the past, thus improving their motivation. A new mechanism for maintaining work motivation by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences was presented, taking into consideration acquired lessons and mental rewards...|$|R

5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E

A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.|$|E

The story of Artemisia formed an iconography for Catherine and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents Marie de' Medici (1610–20) and Anne of Austria (1643–60) revived this iconography in their own service.|$|E

She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed.

Robyn collaborated with producers including Lindström & Ekhé, Christian Falk, Billy Mann, Thomas Rusiak and Masters at Work during its recording. A pop and R record, My Truth is an autobiographical album for which Robyn co-wrote all fourteen songs. Certain lyrics <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> the abortion the singer had {{in the fall of}} 1998, which sparked controversy when RCA Records began formulating a North American release.

5|$|The Nanjakana {{compound}} is {{the most}} highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga. Located to the northeast of Mahandrinoro, this compound {{is believed to have}} been first constructed by Andrianjafy in the late eighteenth century. To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers a clear view of the surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

For example, adaptations {{have been set}} {{in the midst of}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E
