5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. Two major {{exceptions to this}} are Hatzegopteryx, which was a robustly built raptorial predator of <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs; and Alanqa, {{which may have been}} a specialist molluscivore.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{typically}} have quite small brains relative to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish have <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|Harpole {{has also}} {{received}} media attention for his comments on refugees in Amarillo, which receives more refugees {{per capita than}} any other Texas city. He has expressed concern for the city's ability to accommodate the <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> number, but has asserted that Amarillo is supportive and accepting of refugees.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{determines the}} effects of {{household}} demographic composition and food aid on child farm labor supply controlling for household fixed effects. The results indicate that a child has a higher probability of working on farm {{if he or she}} is living with younger children, suggesting that older children are reducing resource constraints. The results on food aid indicate that receiving free distribution has <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> positive effects on the probability of girls working on farm than boys, while participating in food for work has <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> negative effects...|$|R

5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|Much like Within the Woods, The Evil Dead {{needed to}} be blown up to 35mm, then the {{industry}} standard, to be played at movie theaters. The <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> budget made this a much simpler process with The Evil Dead {{than it had been}} with the short film.|$|E
5|$|The Asian subspecies, the <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> intermedius also differs in {{structure}} and voice, and {{may represent a}} distinct species. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that they should be considered subspecies of T. maximus, but they differ {{in structure}}, voice and the appearance of the eye-ring.|$|E

50|$|There is {{very little}} sexual {{dimorphism}} in crimson rosellas. The most noticeable difference between genders is that males are up to 15% larger, and have a <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> and wider beak.|$|R
50|$|Aristonectidae were {{characterized}} by a <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> head and shorter neck than the Plesiosauridae and Elasmosauridae. Teeth resemble those of the Plesiosauridae. The group is known only from scanty and fragmentary remains.|$|R
5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|E
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are <b>relatively</b> <b>large,</b> while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} <b>relatively</b> <b>large,</b> seating 850. It is {{built in the}} Venetian Gothic style, and divided into a five-bay nave, transepts, chancel, morning chapel and organ chamber. Although Plumbe's {{original}} design envisaged a tower, none was ever built. By 1900, St Mark's was reported as having a congregation twice {{that of any other}} church in Wood Green.|$|E
30|$|Between 2005 and 2013, the Netherlands saw <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> {{shares of}} {{migrants}} {{coming to work}} {{or as part of}} EU free movement, whereas Sweden had <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> proportion of immigrants entering through asylum or family reunification (OECD & EU, 2015). The circumstances surrounding migration are important, since they may result in selection both in the country of origin and the country of arrival (Belot & Hatton, 2012). To better account for this heterogeneity in this study, I will distinguish between children of immigrants from the EU and from Third Country, and between those born in Sweden and those who were not.|$|R

5|$|The data {{returned}} from the Galileo flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later NEAR Shoemaker asteroid mission, permitted the first study of asteroid geology. Ida's <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features.

5|$|The {{shells of}} Amphidromus are <b>relatively</b> <b>large,</b> {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic {{helicoid}} shell of 5 to 8 whorls. The shell may be thin and fragile, or very heavy and solid, with no known correlation of shell structure with distribution or habitats.|$|E
5|$|There is a <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> {{difference}} in the electronegativity of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state going down carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the +4 state.|$|E

5|$|ZnO has a <b>relatively</b> <b>large</b> direct {{band gap}} of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages {{associated}} with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3â€“4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have <b>{{relative}}ly</b> <b>large</b> brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a <b>relatively</b> <b>large,</b> muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
50|$|For many years, many {{scientists}} {{thought that the}} frontal lobe was disproportionately enlarged in humans compared to other primates. They {{thought that this was}} an important feature of human evolution and was the primary reason why human cognition differs from that of other primates. However, this view has been challenged by newer research. Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all extant ape species and several monkey species, Semendeferi et al. found that the human frontal cortex was not <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> than the cortex of other great apes but was <b>relatively</b> <b>larger</b> than the frontal cortex of lesser apes and the monkeys.|$|R
