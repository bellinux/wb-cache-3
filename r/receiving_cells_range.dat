40|$|Retention of the {{capacity}} to induce the growth of hair by cultured adult rat vibrissa dermal papilla cells has been investigated. Small pellets of serially cultured papilla cells were implanted into the bases of the exposed follicular epidermis of amputated adult rat vibrissa follicles. Amputated follicles that <b>received</b> no <b>cell</b> implants or implants of cultured dorsal skin fibroblasts were used as controls. Over 50 % of follicles implanted with cultured papilla cells in the passage range 1 - 3 grew hairs. In contrast none of the follicles that <b>received</b> late passage <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 6 - 15) produced hairs; and spontaneous regeneration of hair occurred in only 3 % of the control follicles. These results demonstrate that cultured papilla cells of early passage numbers retain their ability to induce hair growth. Histological examination confirmed that the implanted papilla cells interacted with follicular epidermis to organize the development of new, hair-producing bulbs, each containing a discrete dermal papilla. An important observation was that aggregative behaviour leading to papilla formation was only manifested by early passage papilla cell implants. This persisting embryonic characteristic {{appears to be an}} essential functional component of papilla cell activity which operates to regulate the profound morphogenetic changes that occur during the hair growth cycle...|$|R

Aeration was shown to enhance the wetland cell 2 ̆ 7 s ability to remove not only nitrogen but also CBOD, COD, and phosphorus (retention) more effectively. There was a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in both total nitrogen and ammonia effluent concentrations comparing aerated to unaerated wetland cells, while no significance was found comparing planted and unplanted wetland cells.

30|$|The {{extension}} of the small cell size is achieved by selecting appropriate cell individual offset values for the handover measurements {{that are used to}} trigger the handover between radio cells. In the following, a <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion of x dB corresponds to a handover that is triggered when the UE receive signal strength of the macro cell is x dB higher than the signal strength of the micro cell. The overall system performance is very dependent on the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion (CRE) parameter since this defines the load distribution between a macro cell and the underlying small cells. Since the load situation is very dependent on the location of the small cell and is varying heavily over time, a dynamic adaptation of the <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion is an attractive solution to optimise the overall system performance.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{heterogeneous}} networks {{is on the}} increase, {{fueled by}} consumer demand for more data. The main objective of heterogeneous networks is to increase capacity. They offer solutions for efficient use of spectrum, load balancing and improvement of cell edge coverage amongst others. However, these solutions have inherent challenges such as inter-cell interference and poor mobility management. In heterogeneous networks there is transmit power disparity between macro cell and pico cell tiers, which causes load imbalance between the tiers. Due to the conventional user-cell association strategy, whereby users associate to a base station with the strongest received signal strength, few users associate to small cells compared to macro cells. To counter the effects of transmit power disparity, <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion is used instead of the conventional strategy. The focus of our work is on load balancing using <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion (CRE) and network utility optimization techniques to ensure fair sharing of load in a macro and pico cell LTE Advanced heterogeneous network. The aim is to investigate how to use an adaptive <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion bias to optimize Pico cell coverage for load balancing. Reviewed literature points out several approaches to solve the load balancing problem in heterogeneous networks, which include, <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion and utility function optimization. Then, we use <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> expansion, and logarithmic utility functions to design a load balancing algorithm. In the algorithm, user and base station associations are optimized by adapting CRE bias to pico base station load status. A price update mechanism based on a suboptimal solution of a network utility optimization problem is used to adapt the CRE bias. The price {{is derived from the}} load status of each pico base station. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by means of an LTE MATLAB toolbox. Simulations were conducted according to 3 GPP and ITU guidelines for modelling heterogeneous networks and propagation environment respectively. Compared to a static CRE configuration, the algorithm achieved more fairness in load distribution. Further, it achieved a better trade-off between cell edge and cell centre user throughputs.

We have assessed a two-stage technique in which a CD 34 + selection {{is followed by a}} tumour specific depletion stage using a B cell or breast cancer specific antibody panel. Initial small-scale selections on 11 patients with NHL and breast cancer showed that cell loss was greatest following the CD 34 + selection with a median yield of 38. 8 per cent (range 17. 2 - 56. 4 per cent). The addition of the depletion stage resulted in a minimal loss of CD 34 + cells with a yield for this step of 94. 2 per cent (range 77. 5 - 99. 3 per cent).

In 30 transplant recipients with no history or evidence of cancer the mean SCE rate was 10. 3 per <b>cell</b> (<b>range</b> 5. 8 - 24. 5); four (13 %) of these patients had a mean SCE frequency outside the control range.

40|$|In {{diabetic}} patients, elevated plasma {{levels of}} t-PA and PAI- 1 accompany impaired fibrinolysis. To identify mechanisms for these abnormalities, we examined whether vascular endothelial cells exposed to high glucose upregulate t-PA and PAI- 1 production and whether ambient PA activity is decreased concomitantly. In 17 cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown to confluency in 30 mM glucose, the t-PA antigen {{released to the}} medium in 24 h was (median) 52 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 10 - 384) and the PAI- 1 antigen was 872 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 217 - 2074) -both greater (P < 0. 02) than the amounts released by paired control cultures grown in 5 mM glucose- 29 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 7. 5 - 216) and 461 ng/ 106 <b>cells</b> (<b>range</b> 230 - 3215), respectively. In the presence of high glucose, the steady-state levels of t- PA and PAI- 1 mRNAs were increased correspondingly (median 142 and 183 % of control, respectively, P < 0. 05); high glucose per se and hypertonicity contributed to the upregulation in additive fashion. The PA activity of conditioned medium from cultures exposed to high glucose was 0. 4 IU/ml (range 0. 2 - 0. 6), which was significantly lower (P < 0. 02) than the PA activity of control medium (0. 5 IU/ml, range 0. 2 - 0. 9). No difference was observed when comparing the PA activities of acidified conditioned media, expected to be depleted of inhibitors. Thus, high glucose coordinately upregulates endothelial t-PA and PAI- 1 expression through effects exerted at the pretranslational level and enhanced by even mild degrees of hypertonicity. The decrease in ambient fibrinolytic potential may reflect an overwhelming effect of the increased availability of PAI- 1. These findings propose a contributory mechanism for the fibrinolytic abnormalities of diabetes and the thrombotic tendency of the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExosomes {{are small}} {{extracellular}} vesicles, which stem from endosomes fusing with the plasma membrane, {{and can be}} recaptured by <b>receiving</b> <b>cells.</b> They contain lipids, proteins and RNAs able to modify the physiology of <b>receiving</b> <b>cells.</b> Functioning of the brain relies on intercellular communication between neural cells. These communications can modulate the strength of responses at sparse groups of specific synapses, to modulate circuits underlying associations and memory. Expression of new genes must then follow to stabilize the long-term modifications of the synaptic response. Local changes of the physiology of synapses from one neuron driven by another, have so far been explained by classical signal transduction to modulate transcription, translation and post-translational modifications. In vitro evidence now demonstrate that exosomes are released by neurons in a way depending on synaptic activity; these exosomes can be retaken by other neurons suggesting a novel way for interneuronal communication. The efficacy of inter-neuronal transfer of biochemical information allowed by exosomes would be far superior to that of direct cell to-cell contacts or secreted soluble factors. Indeed, lipids, proteins and RNAs contained in exosomes secreted by emitting neurons could directly modify signal transduction and protein expression in <b>receiving</b> <b>cells.</b> Exosomes could thus represent an ideal mechanism for inter-neuronal transfer of information allowing anterograde and retrograde signalling across synapses necessary for plasticity.
