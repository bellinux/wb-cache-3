5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E

25|$|Although Piper had {{the right}} to remain {{anonymous}} because of the sexual assault, she chose to waive her anonymity, in an attempt to increase public awareness of the situation for burn victims, and also the treatment they go through. Piper also took part in a documentary about her experience, Katie: My Beautiful Face, which was aired by Channel 4 on 29 October 2009, and, according to figures from Attentional, gained over 3.3million viewers. The programme was <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> during 2009: once on Christmas Day, 2009 on Channel 4 (to tie in with Piper giving the Alternative Christmas Message) and twice on More4 (in early November and late December, each a few days after a C4 screening). There was further More4 screening on 13 February 2011 ahead of the release of Piper's book and follow-up series. The film was broadcast to viewers in Wales on the now-defunct analogue service of S4C on 15 November 2009 at midnight: digital viewers in Wales had access to the Channel 4 and More4 broadcasts.|$|E

500|$|The song {{ends with}} a triple chorus (the third of which {{features}} a key change to A major) as [...] "French horn counterpoints usher the song towards its climax", the line [...] "jumping off the fence" [...] <b>repeating</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> before a staccato finish with Rhys singing [...] "into your corner", drawing out the last word.|$|R

500|$|... (For he [...] hath {{done to me}} great things), {{concentrates}} on two ideas from the canticle verse. Marked [...] "Andante maestoso", the choral movement in D major opens with solemn dotted rhythms, features of the French overture. A motiv of four measures is <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times,</b> interrupted by fanfares. Then it is repeated five times, beginning with only the basses, marked piano, adding the motif in a higher part each time, with two sopranos, and increasing volume and intensity.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of the second chorus, the [...] "funereal brass" [...] is introduced, {{stressing}} the ominous lyrics.

500|$|The {{piece is}} notated in 3/4 {{time with the}} main theme <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> in the {{work as well as}} in the {{introduction}} and the coda. The [...] "sadly poignant", [...] "graceful, wistful" [...] and tenderly nostalgic mood is partly dictated by this main theme, which starts with the melody note A harmonised against a G major chord thus creating a dissonance. In the next measure the theme is set against a different harmony before Joplin creates variations. There are variants of the theme in the [...] "haunting" [...] B minor key of the D strain and in the E strain's D major key which [...] "brightens the mood".|$|E
500|$|The solo soprano (or treble) {{sings the}} prayer to the [...] "good Jesus" [...] for {{everlasting}} rest. The one line of text is <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times,</b> {{the first two}} times asking for [...] "requiem" [...] (rest), then intensified for [...] "sempiternam requiem" [...] (everlasting rest). The first call is a modal melody in B-flat major of six measures, the second call is similar but reaching up higher. The words [...] "" [...] begin with more expansion, but reach alternating between only two notes on two repetitions of [...] "". The last call begins as the first and leads again to alternating between two notes in even lower range, until the last [...] "requiem" [...] has a gentle upward motion.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title track}} and lead single [...] "Eazy-Duz-It", written by MC Ren, {{opens with a}} woman acclaiming Eazy-E's style. Eazy then {{interrupts}} saying [...] "Bitch shut the fuck up, get the fuck outta here." [...] This {{is followed by a}} bass line provided by Dr. Dre. Soon, Eazy begins to rap about himself and things that he does. The song declares that Eazy is a [...] "hardcore villain" [...] who collects money from his prostitutes, and feels great when his [...] "pockets are fat." [...] The chorus, <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times,</b> states that he [...] "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several drugs.|$|E

500|$|The work is {{concluded}} by the doxology, [...] (Glory to the Father), {{performed by}} the ensemble in two parts. The first part addresses the Trinity. Glory is given three times.

In the third , leading to [...] (to the Son), in a similar pattern soprano I begins, followed by alto, soprano II, tenor and bass. In the fourth , leading to [...] (and to the Holy Spirit), in again [...] similar pattern the voices follow each other from top to bottom, ending in a long cadenza.|$|E
500|$|The {{elections}} of 1878 returned {{control of both}} houses of Congress to the Democrats {{for the first time}} since before the Civil War. [...] The new Democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections. [...] Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President. [...] Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. [...] Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military's involvement in Southern politics. [...] The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. [...] Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> more. [...] Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.|$|E
500|$|A video compilation, titled Madonna, was {{released}} by Warner Music Video and Sire Records in November 1984 to promote the album. The singer's first video compilation, it contained three music videos from the album—"Burning Up", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star"—as well as the then current single [...] "Like a Virgin". The music video for [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was a special extended dance mix, and when she says [...] "ooh yeah" [...] it is echoed three times and her image is <b>repeated</b> <b>three</b> <b>times.</b> [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] omits the scene where the lion's tongue moves {{in time with the}} beat of the music. These videos were later released on the 1990 greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection with these edits changed. The video was promoted at the Cabaret Metro club in Chicago, on February 9, 1985. Dubbed as 'The Virgin Party', the event drew a crowd of around 1,200 and promoted Madonna's LPs, cassettes, CDs and the videocassette. Attendees were encouraged to wear white, and for $5 admission fees, were able to view the Madonna videocassette and the premiere of the music video of her then upcoming single [...] "Material Girl". The event was organised as a drive to promote music videos, which at that point did not have a large market.|$|E
