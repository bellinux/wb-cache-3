500|$|The two volume {{biography}} of Whitehead by Victor Lowe {{is the most}} definitive presentation {{of the life of}} Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his [...] "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. [...] This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, [...] "No professional biographer in his <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> touch him." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of the preview {{release of}} RT 8.1 was mixed; both ExtremeTech and TechRadar praised the {{improvements}} to the operating system's tablet-oriented interface, along {{with the addition of}} Outlook; TechRadars Dan Grabham believed that the inclusion of Outlook was important because [...] "nobody in their <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> try and handle work email inside the standard Mail app—it's just not up to the task." [...] However, both experienced performance issues running the beta on the Tegra 3-based Surface; ExtremeTech concluded that [...] "as it stands, we’re still not sure why you would ever opt to buy a Windows RT tablet when there are similarly priced Atom-powered x86 devices that run the full version of Windows 8." ...|$|E

She stated that the report was ridiculous and that the timing of the video would draw publicity to two of her upcoming television performances. In an interview with Chris Harris of Rolling Stone, Zeghibe said that he was surprised by how much attention the clip received and by Beyoncé's reaction to it.

It says [...] "if anyone had wanted to learn the language of the boghogs, they would have discovered that they don't and are just as cold and miserable as everyone else". It also mentions that no one wanted to, because the boghogs communicate by biting each other very hard on the thigh.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{judicial}} review of an ombudsman's decision brought by an independent financial adviser (IFA), the judge further clarified that the ombudsman is [...] "free to make an award different from that which a court applying the law would make".

5000|$|Bailey {{joined the}} O. J. Simpson defense team {{just before the}} {{preliminary}} hearing. Bailey held numerous press conferences to discuss {{the progress of the}} case. In a press conference prior to his cross-examination of Mark Fuhrman, Bailey said, [...] "Any lawyer in his <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> who <b>would</b> not be looking forward to cross-examining Mark Fuhrman is an idiot." [...] His famous cross-examination of Fuhrman is {{considered by many to be}} the key to Simpson's acquittal. In front of a jury composed predominantly of people of color, Bailey got the detective to claim, [...] "marine to marine", he never used the word nigger to describe blacks at any time during the previous ten years, a claim the defense team easily found evidence to refute. Ultimately, the statement that Bailey drew from the detective forced Fuhrman to plead the Fifth in his next courtroom appearance, thereby undermining his credibility with the jury and the otherwise devastating evidence he allegedly found. Bailey also attracted minor attention for keeping a silver flask on the defense table, which fellow defense attorney Robert Kardashian claimed contained only coffee.|$|R

And did he not persuade her to give up her money to him for investment, and after all never invest it? What greater proofs of {{insanity}} could you have than those? And then that dreadful fever at Spanish Town, and the shock of losing his kind entertainer, worn out with nursing him, had quite completed the downfall of his reason. So Ethel Sutherland, in her pure beautiful woman's soul, went on believing, as steadfastly as ever, in the faith and the goodness of that Cecil Mitford that had never been. His ideal had faded out before the first touch of disillusioning fact; hers persisted still, {{in spite of all the}} rudest assaults that the plainest facts could make upon it. Thank heaven for that wonderful idealising power of a good woman, which enables her to walk unsullied through this sordid world, unknowing and unseeing.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{the trio}} reach the island, Cicero {{launches}} into {{an examination of}} law. He begins by saying that law does not, and cannot, begin with men. Men, to him, are the instruments of a higher wisdom which governs the entire earth and has the power, through shared morality, to command good or forbid evil. Cicero also makes a distinction in this section between legalism (actual written law) and law (right and wrong as dictated by the eternal wisdom). To Cicero, human laws can be good or ill depending on whether they are {{in sync with the}} eternal, natural law. A law enacted for a purely temporary or local purpose is law, according to him, by dint of public approval. It has force of law only so long as people observe it and the state enforces it. Natural law, however, needs no encoding, no enforcement. By way of example, Cicero mentions that when Sextus Tarquinius, son of King Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, raped Lucretia, there were no laws in Rome governing rape. However, even then, the populace knew viscerally that what had happened was against shared morality, and followed Lucius Junius Brutus to correct matters. Evil laws, or ones that go against the eternal law, further, do not deserve the title, and states that enact them to the exclusion of the eternal law do not deserve the title states. To demonstrate, Cicero uses the analogy of unschooled people or quacks passing themselves off as doctors and prescribing deadly treatments. No one in their <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> Cicero argues, <b>would</b> dare call such treatments [...] "medicine" [...] or their practitioners [...] "doctors".|$|R
