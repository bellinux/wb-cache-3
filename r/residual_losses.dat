50|$|In general, {{much care}} and {{attention}} to detail must be exercised in the experimental setup of SRF cavities {{so that there is}} not Qo degradation due to RF losses in ancillary components, such as stainless steel vacuum flanges that are too close to the cavity's evanescent fields.

40|$|Abstract — Multi-hop {{wireless}} meshed {{networks are}} being considered as backbones in metro broadband deployments. In such networks, wireless links need to offer low link-latencies, high goodput and low <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> rates. Due to non-line-of-sight deployments involving fading/interference, such links experience high/bursty errors, especially at higher bit rates. Traditionally, wireless links use retransmissions (ARQ) and adaptive modulation/coding to overcome loss. The price paid is reduced goodput (affecting bulk applications) and higher per-hop latencies (affecting latency-sensitive applications over multiple hops). Our paper {{starts with the}} design of a link-level hybrid ARQ scheme (LL-HARQ) to achieve high goodput and low <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> rate with limited ARQ attempts. While LL-HARQ performs well, it exports a small <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> rate under high/bursty loss scenarios. Over multiple hops, this small <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> accumulates and TCP-SACK performance suffers. A transport protocol (LT-TCP) designed for loss tolerance achieves the best performance in combination with LL-HARQ, though TCP-SACK is sufficient if <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> accumulation is under 5 %. This suggests a division of reliability functions where link-layer attempts reliability with tight latency constraints, and transport layer support handles residual erasures. We develop insights for structuring FEC, and verify the goodput-loss rate-latency trade-offs and impact of bursty losses and multiple hops through simulations. I...|$|R

40|$|Many {{previous}} event {{studies have}} found unexpectedly large losses to firms involved in negative incidents. Many of these studies’ authors explain such losses as “goodwill losses” or "reputation effects. " To test this hypothesis, we search for <b>residual</b> <b>losses</b> (in excess of direct costs) to firms involved in events which produce ill will, but do not {{affect the quality of}} their final products nor break implicit labor or supply contracts. We find an overall insignificant capital market response to a sample of 98 negative environmental events (representing all such incidents reported in the Wall Street Journal between 1970 and 1992 in which electric power companies or oil firms with listed stocks were involved). Although others have found similar outcomes for more limited samples, our results enhance previous research by extending similar findings to a broader range of environmental incidents over a longer time period. Further, our findings suggest that the large <b>residual</b> <b>losses</b> of other studies may be due to reputation (and not measurement errors or event study idiosyncrasies), but only when the notion of "reputation effects " is limited to punishment solely by those who are directly harmed by the firms' conduct...|$|E

Our recent enhancements, called LT-TCP make TCP loss-tolerant in heavy/bursty erasure environments.

When the underlying source of loss is interference (e. g., 802. 11 environments), MAC-level mechanisms misinterpret interference as noise leading to poor scheduling (e. g., capture effects) and limit the benefit of transport layer mitigation efforts. We propose enhancements to link-level protocols that enable survival during disruptions.

This is especially clear {{in the case of}} the much debated determination of stray load losses, which no longer can be specified as 0. 5 % of input power, but now instead should be determined from the so called <b>residual</b> <b>losses.</b> The <b>residual</b> <b>losses</b> are what is left when the resistive, iron and friction and windage losses have been subtracted from the difference between input and output power.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{dependence on}} wireless networks {{as an integral}} part of the communication infrastructure, it is critical that data link and transport layer protocols perform reasonably under potentially severe lossy conditions. A key strategy is to use Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) with erasure codes (a. k. a. Forward Error Correction or FEC) sent both proactively and reactively in response to feedback about dynamic loss statistics. A challenge is to design HARQ to satisfy multiple objectives such as high goodput, low latency and negligible <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> rate. In this paper, we analyze the performance benefits and trade-offs of these reliability strategies (Hybrid ARQ+FEC). We derive expressions for the expected goodput (and overhead in terms of FEC wastage), latency, and <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> for a given raw erasure loss process (e. g. uniform and bursty loss models). We show how the analysis can be used to explain and provide specialized design guidance for link-layer HARQ that is subject to tight delay constraints and a recently designed transport layer HARQ scheme (called Loss-Tolerant TCP). We validate our analysis by comparing the predictions with values obtained from simulations performed on the link and transport layer HARQ strategies with ns- 2.

40|$|Under {{a rule of}} {{comparative}} causation, an accident loss is shared between a victim and a tortfeasor when the parties are either both negligent (as with comparative negligence) or when they are both non-negligent. When {{one or the other}} party is found solely negligent, the negligent party bears the entire accident loss. Comparative causation is the only tort regime that allows sharing of an accident loss between a non-negligent injurer and his non-negligent victim. By allowing the sharing of an accident loss in equilibrium, the comparative causation rule has efficiency and risk-allocation properties that are never observed under conventional negligence or strict liability regimes. With respect to efficiency, the comparative causation rule spreads activity level and R&D incentives between the parties, rather than concentrating them on one or the other party (the residual bearer). With respect to the allocation of risk, comparative causation avoids the all-or-nothing allocations of the <b>residual</b> <b>loss</b> that we observe under other legal rules. In doing so, comparative causation provides a mechanism of mutual insurance of victim and tortfeasor with a more equitable apportionment of the <b>residual</b> <b>loss.</b> In spite of these interesting attributes, the existing literature still falls short of establishing the compatibility {{of comparative}} causation with efficiency. In this paper, we show that loss sharing can be achieved while preserving optimal care incentives for both parties. ...|$|R
