5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces. The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet, which will be decommissioned as of 2025, with multi-role fighters. The project has been named the HX Fighter Program. The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quotation</b> will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start the fighter candidates’ environmental testing in Finland in 2019. The buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.|$|E

50|$|Sales force {{management}} has a critical function in industrial selling, where it assumes {{a greater role}} than {{other parts of the}} marketing mix. Typical industrial organisations depend on the ability of their sales people to build relationships with customers.

5000|$|Supplier communication: When {{one or more}} {{suitable}} suppliers have been identified, an organization will typically conduct a competitive bidding process. Organizations can {{use a variety of}} competitive bidding methods including <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation,</b> <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> proposals, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> information, <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> tender, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> solution or a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> partnership. Some institutions choose to use a notification service in order to raise the competition for the chosen opportunity. These systems can either be direct from their e-tendering software, or as a re-packaged notification from an external. During this step direct contact may be made with the suppliers. References for product/service quality are consulted, and any requirements for follow-up services including installation, maintenance, and warranty are investigated. Samples of the product/service being considered may be examined, or trials undertaken. Organizations should do a risk assessment, total cost of ownership analysis and best value assessment before selecting the final suppliers/solution.|$|R

40|$|Small {{to medium}} {{manufacturing}} companies {{are coming to}} realise the increasing importance of performing fast and accurate cost estimates at {{the early stages of}} projects to address customers’ <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation.</b> However, they cannot afford the implementation of a knowledge-based cost estimating software. This paper explains the development and validation of a consistent methodology for the cost estimating of manufactured parts (focused on pistons) based on the design features. The research enabled the identification of the sources of variability in cost estimates, and the main one is the lack of formal procedures for the cost estimates in manufacturing SMEs. Finally, a software prototype was developed that reduces the variability in the cost estimates by defining a formal procedure, following the most appropriate cost estimating techniques.

The {{results of this study}} indicate that it is feasible to transfer small purchase workload under certain conditions. The primary factors to optimize customer response time are: (1) can the requirement be procured through an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA), or automated <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Quotations</b> (RFQ); (2) technical complexity; (3) purchase priority; (4) receiver of the shifted workload; (5) customer; (6) proximity of the contracting activity tot he customer and supplier; and, (7) age of the document. It is recommended that small purchase documents be shifted among Navy Field Contracting System activities as a viable means for improving overall customer response time.

50|$|Though it is {{tailored}} to the industry's quality system expectations and regulatory requirements, an organization {{does not need to}} be actively manufacturing medical devices or their components to seek certification to this standard, in contrast to the automotive sector's ISO/TS 16949, where only firms with an active <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation,</b> or on the bid list, of an International Automotive Task Force supply chain manufacturer can seek registration.|$|E
50|$|The {{main concern}} for {{commercial}} orders {{is that there}} must be agreement (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotation,</b> request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.|$|E
40|$|Participation {{of small}} {{businesses}} {{in the market for}} public contracts is widely recognized as a key policy issue. It is also commonly held that the adoption of e-procurement solutions can be effective in pursuing such an objective. To this end, we analyze the transactions completed in the period 2004 - 2007 through the Italian Government’s e-procurement platform, that is, the marketplace managed by the Italian Public Procurement Agency (Consip S. p. A.). Although descriptive statistics indicate that micro suppliers are the most represented group of firms in the marketplace, our econometric treatment provides some evidence that the former are less successful than all other suppliers in getting public contracts. Degree of loyalty with buyers, location and the use of other MEPA negotiation tools, also emerge as relevant factors of success in the e-procurement market.

40|$|Engaging in {{corporate}} social responsibility has become increasingly important for organisations. This has increased the focus on sourcing processes and how social and environmental aspects can be incorporated. Organisations are now taking action {{in an attempt to}} trace their use of so called conflict minerals, and to assure that their supply chain is free from them. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how automotive manufacturers can source components potentially containing conflict minerals in a socially responsible way. This is done through a case study at an automotive manufacturer not yet affected by any regulation. The study highlights that incorporating requirements and policies into codes of conducts and/or <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotations,</b> traceability and collaborative measures such as sharing of information are crucial to ensure a supply chain free from conflict minerals, whereas supply chain complexity and the lack of monitoring activities constitutes barriers.
