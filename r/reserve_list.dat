5|$|After {{starting}} safety Sean Foudy {{left the}} Rough Riders {{as a free}} agent, Allen competed with Hency Charles and Ken Walcott in training camp for the starting role. Allen emerged as the starter in July, but he was sidelined a month later with a knee injury. While Allen returned quickly from the injury, he was replaced by Walcott as starter and {{was moved to the}} <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> for a short time. He was reactivated after Walcott was injured with turf toe, but Remi Trudel was started at safety in place of Allen.|$|E
5|$|Allen had a {{physical}} altercation with Walcott {{outside of a}} Rough Riders practice in August 1993. Shortly afterward, Ottawa traded Allen to the BC Lions for safety Burtland Cummings.

5|$|Burns {{continued}} to play club cricket in Somerset for Taunton St Andrews Cricket Club until 2009, helping them to become West of England Premier League champions in his final season with the club. He made minor counties appearances for Cumberland throughout 2006, before switching to Cornwall in 2008. He also toured with the Marylebone Cricket Club, travelling to Brazil and Chile in March 2007, and to Saint Kitts and Nevis in March 2008. He has subsequently stood as an umpire, and after standing in second-eleven matches in 2011, he {{was added to the}} ECB's <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> of umpires for 2012.

5|$|On 12 November 1934, Hessen was {{withdrawn}} from fleet service {{and placed in}} reserve. On 31 March 1935, Hessen was stricken from the <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> and converted into a target ship. Her armament was removed, the hull was lengthened, and new machinery was installed. The longer hull allowed room for two additional watertight compartments, which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13. The ship's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely; Hessen retained only a single funnel, a tower foremast, and the two armored barbettes for the main battery turrets. The ship had a crew of 80, but could be operated by remote control when {{being used as a}} target.|$|E

5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the <b>reserve</b> <b>list.</b> In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a sense of direction lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
5|$|For Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 {{first-class}} runs in {{a season}} twice, and {{was part of the}} team which won the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. He provided Somerset with a batting all-rounder, particularly in one-day cricket in which he averaged 27 with the bat and 30 with the ball for the county. He took over as Somerset captain in 2003, primarily {{due to the lack of}} other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players being threatened with being sacked. He was replaced as captain in 2005 by Graeme Smith, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an umpire, and was promoted to the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, {{in which}} the Vikings played the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka {{replaced}} Bridgewater {{as a member of}} the team's backup offense in the middle of the second quarter. Kafka threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end MyCole Pruitt, before he was substituted for Heinicke in the third quarter. Kafka did not play in the team's second preseason game, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and he was the fourth quarterback to play in the third game against the Oakland Raiders. He played one drive in the fourth preseason game, throwing an incomplete pass against the Dallas Cowboys, before suffering a hamstring strain. The Vikings waived/injured him on September 1, and he was placed on season-ending injured reserve on September 2 after he cleared waivers. He was waived off of the injured <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> on September 15.|$|E

50|$|After {{the arrival}} of more {{forwards}} in 2008, Jonas lost his place, sometimes even failing to make the <b>reserves</b> <b>list.</b> The most consistent criticism from the press was his lack of physical strength when playing up front against powerful defenders. By July, he {{decided to leave the}} club.|$|R
5|$|Entering the 1987 Cleveland Browns season, Junkin was {{projected}} to be the starting outside linebacker opposite Clay Matthews, Jr. despite playing inside linebacker in college, which generated criticism around the league as a transition that {{would be difficult for}} him to make. After a 16-day , the Browns and Junkin agreed to a four-year deal worth nearly two million dollars. After missing the first preseason game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made his debut against the New York Giants. In that game, he played the second half and failed to record a tackle. By the end of training camp, due to struggles learning the outside linebacker position, he made the roster, but lost the starting job to Anthony Griggs. After the Browns moved to a 4-3 defense for the second game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Junkin made his debut, and the plan was for him to gradually see more playing time each week. In early November, due to a combination of a players' strike and an injured wrist, Junkin was placed on the injured <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> and replaced on the active roster by David Grayson.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, {{following}} the lockout, the Oilers traded Brewer, Jeff Woywitka and Doug Lynch to the St. Louis Blues {{in exchange for}} defenceman Chris Pronger. At {{the time of the}} trade, Brewer was a restricted free agent, so on August 15, 2005, Brewer accepted the Blues' qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $2-million contract. Brewer's first season with the Blues was a particularly poor one. After playing the first 18 games of the season, Brewer separated his shoulder on November 16, 2005, in a 2–0 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. Brewer missed ten games before being activated from the injured <b>reserve</b> <b>list,</b> returning to the St. Louis line-up for a game on December 20, 2005, against the Phoenix Coyotes. Less than a month later, in a game on January 13, 2006, against the Atlanta Thrashers, Brewer collided with the Thrashers' centre Karl Stewart, and dislocated his left shoulder, which ended his season. In just 32 games, Brewer finished his season with nine points, including six goals, two shy of his career best of eight set in the 2002–04 season. Despite his limited play, the Blues re-signed Brewer to a one-year, $2.014 million contract for the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|Returning to North America, Sweatt {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Vancouver Canucks on May 31, 2010. Nearly three months later, the Canucks also signed Sweatt's brother, Bill, from Colorado College. Following the pre-season, the Canucks assigned both Sweatt brothers to their AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Joining the Moose, Lee and Bill became the first pair of brothers in the team's history {{to play for the}} club at the same time. After recording 14 points in 41 AHL games, the Canucks recalled him on January 23, 2011. Filling in for injured defenseman Alex Edler, he made his NHL debut three days later against the Nashville Predators. He scored his first NHL goal that night, a game-winner in the third period against goaltender Pekka Rinne; the Canucks won the game 2–1. The following shift, he blocked a shot from Predators defenseman Shea Weber with his foot; a post-game X-ray diagnosed him with severe bruising. After resting the foot over the All-Star break, he played in two more games for the Canucks, before being reassigned to the Moose. On the morning of his scheduled flight back to Manitoba, he blocked another shot during a Canucks practice, breaking his foot. Sweatt was consequently retained on the NHL team's roster and placed on the long-term injured <b>reserve</b> <b>list</b> (injured players are not eligible to be sent down to the minors). Unable to skate on his injured foot until mid-June, Sweatt was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
