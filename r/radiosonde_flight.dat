The maximum altitude to which the balloon ascends {{is determined by the}} diameter and thickness of the balloon. Balloon sizes can range from 100 to 3000 g. As the balloon ascends through the atmosphere, the pressure decreases, causing the balloon to expand. Eventually, the balloon will expand to the extent that its skin will break, terminating the ascent. An 800 g balloon will burst at about 21 km.

40|$|Spectral {{measurement}} of {{direct solar radiation}} was made by a spectrometer on the ground, and {{the total amount of}} water vapor was estimated. The result was 0. 09 g/(cm) ^ 2 at least in April and 0. 16 g/(cm) ^ 2 at most in December. In the present work, 0. 9 μm near infrared absorption band of water vapor was measured in a rather low resolution and the total absorption was obtained. Using the relation of the water vapor amount and the total absorption (curve of growth), the water vapor amount was derived from the measured total absorption. Uncertainties in the 100 % transmission line and uncertainties in deriving the column amount of water vapor for the actual inhomogeneous distribution from the equivalent amount, resulted in errors. Since the measurement was made at Mizuho Station and there was no aerological data for comparison, the data of <b>radiosonde</b> <b>flight</b> at Syowa Station was compared.

40|$|Atmospheric {{temperature}} profiles play a {{very important}} role in the study of atmospheric stability and turbulence structures. The temperature profile for Troposphere and lower Stratosphere are derived from backscattered signal of Indian MST radar located at Gadanki (13. 50 N, 79. 20 E), using vertical wind observations. The altitude profiles of Brunt-Vaisala (BV) frequency are obtained from the derived spectra of vertical wind. The temperature profiles are then obtained from BV frequencies following Revathy et al. This method leads to poor temperature profiles under unstable atmospheric conditions and large horizontal winds due to low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Better temperature profiles even at severe weather conditions with low SNR can be obtained by priori application of denoising technique. In the present paper, Dual tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) is implemented, and is used as denoising technique. DTCWT provides a high degree of shift-invariance and better phase information compared to other complex wavelet transforms. The MST Radar data is first denoised with DTCWT and then the temperature profiles are derived using the above mentioned technique of identifying BV frequencies. The derived temperature profiles are compared with the profiles of original MST data without denoising and <b>radiosonde</b> <b>flight</b> data at radar site during the observations, for validation.

40|$|The GCOS {{recommends}} that upper-air stations use a particular model radiosonde {{for as long}} as is feasible and if change is necessary that an overlapping flight series of old and new radiosondes be conducted at representative sites. The overlapping flights enable the formulation of bias transfer functions. These functions are then applied to the new data sets. This is to ensure a consistent historical data series suitable for long-term climate trends analysis by the climate community. There are 163 GUAN radiosonde sites from over 67 countries using radiosondes from six providers. Forty percent of these GUAN sites are launching one or less radiosondes per day either because of operational forecasting requirements or because of the costs of radiosonde flights. Next generation radiosondes and technical adjustments to existing radiosondes used in the GUAN network are taking place, and {{a significant portion of the}} GUAN network is obsolete and no longer supportable.

40|$|AbstractPrecipitation in {{the cold}} sector of mid-latitude, extratropical {{cyclones}} has come under scrutiny recently, especially banded rain and snow that occurs poleward, and often upstream (“wraparound precipitation”), of the surface cyclone center (usually called the “northwest quadrant”). The Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) project was conducted {{during the winter months}} of early 2009, and again during the 2009 - 2010 winter season, to gather data on such storms. During this time, data from 138 high-resolution <b>radiosonde</b> <b>flights</b> were collected to establish, in part, the static stability conditions in which wraparound precipitation occurred. Of chief interest in this paper is the prevalence of conditions conducive to upright convection in the sampled storms. Indeed, {{all but one of the}} 17 sampled storms presented upright convection (verified by radar) in the wraparound region, so the static stability values reported herein are likely underestimates due, in part, to the unique path of each radiosonde balloon. Of the 17 storms that were sampled, 12 (71 %) captured at least one sounding with elevated convective available potential energy (CAPE), while of the 138 individual soundings, only 52 (38 %) had elevated CAPE. We may thus conclude that the majority of sampled cyclones revealed elevated CAPE, but it was often short-lived. Those soundings also revealed that the most unstable CAPE values appear about 3 hours prior to the onset of wraparound precipitation, but still had a median value of 77 J kg- 1 at the time of onset...|$|R

An additional (and separate from the actual) hydrological cycle has been introduced into the chemistry–climate model EMAC, including the water isotopologues HDO and H 2 18 O and their physical fractionation processes. Additionally an explicit computation of the contribution of methane oxidation to H 2 O and HDO has been incorporated. The model expansions allow detailed analyses of water vapour and its isotope ratio with respect to deuterium throughout the stratosphere and in the transition region to the troposphere. In order to assure the correct representation of the water isotopologues in the model’s hydrological cycle, the expanded system has been evaluated in several steps.

40|$|Radiosonde {{measurement}} errors occur for various reasons: calibration, mishandling of sensors, poor software, radiation, etc. It {{is important that}} these errors be found and corrected, or at the least, corrections determined that might be sensibly applied. Radiation errors apparently are the most serious since the lack of radiative equilibrium between the thermistor and its surrounding environment can not be corrected for just a single thermistor without serious intervention. However, errors may be determined using the Accurate Temperature Measuring (ATM) radiosonde. The ATM radiosonde development was initiated in the mid- 1980 's using three thermistors; five thermistors are presently incorporated in the ATM <b>radiosonde.</b> Test <b>flights</b> at different locations indicated that the radiative effect on the thermistor varies because of the different environment of each location and, can be corrected.

The first chilled mirror (SNOW WHITE) radiosonde was flown from Wallops Flight Facility in 1997.

A small, expendable instrument package is suspended below a 2 m wide balloon filled with hydrogen or helium, then released daily at or shortly after 1100 and 2300 UTC, respectively. As the radiosonde rises at about 300 meters/minute (1,000 ft/min), sensors on the radiosonde measure profiles of pressure, temperature, and relative humidity.

When the balloon has expanded beyond its elastic limit and bursts (about 6 m in diameter), a small parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde, minimizing the danger to lives and property. Data obtained during the flights is coded and disseminated, at which point it can be plotted on a Skew-T or Stuve diagram for analysis.

Gravity wave activity and seasonal behavior {{was found to}} be similar to that seen in earlier studies from Antarctica. Interstation comparisons of zonal wind and gravity wave activity showed very high correlations throughout the entire data set, between Mawson and Davis stations (∼ 600 km distant), with a lag near 0. 5 days. The correlations between Casey and Davis (1400 km apart) were lower but still significant, with a lag near 1 day. There is no significant correlation between stratospheric gravity wave activity and surface winds. Our results suggest a pattern of winds and waves moving eastward over the stations with a speed near 15 m s− 1. As this is comparable to planetary wave speeds, we interpret our results as being evidence for a significant planetary wave–induced modulation of the zonal wind and the gravity wave field, although we are unable to identify the mechanism by which this operates. Our work suggests that the high-latitude lower-stratosphere gravity wave fields are relatively uniform on spatial scales of 500 – 1000 km and on timescales of around 0. 5 – 1 days. Innis, J. L., A.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{examination}} in {{some detail}} {{of the relationships between}} air quality and the thermal structure of the lowest layers of the atmosphere constituted the primary objective of this thesis. Data for the study were assembled during April-June 1965 at the U. S. Weather Bureau Station, McNary Field, Salem, Oregon. The measures of air quality employed were the estimated mean concentrations of suspended particulate material collected on standard high volume filters near the surface during two six-hour periods each day : early morning (0000 to 0600 L. S. T.) and afternoon (1200 to 1800 L. S. T.). To represent thermal structure, lapse rates of temperature were computed twice daily for each 150 -meter-thick layer of air between the surface and 1500 meters above the surface. The information for these computations was taken from the original records of the U. S. Weather Bureau <b>radiosonde</b> <b>flights</b> conducted daily at 0300 and 1500 L. S. T. Graphical and statistical analysis of the relationships between lapse rate and air quality for each of the 150 -meter-thick layers and each of the cumulative layers (by 150 meter increments) originating at the surface produced results that were quite different for the morning and afternoon sampling periods. The relationships for the morning period were determined graphically to be continuous and determined statistically to be linear. For this period the stability of the lowest 450 meters appeared to affect most directly the air quality while the thermal structure above about 1000 meters appeared unrelated to air quality. The afternoon relationships, on the other hand, were poorly defined. In fact, the air quality of the afternoon period was better related to the thermal structure of the early morning period than to the contemporaneous thermal structure. On the premise that for a given lapse rate, air quality may fluctuate because of variations in pollutant emission rates and/or because of changes in meteorological variables, supplementary studies were conducted. The test procedure was the same for each variable, and consisted of dividing the data for each sampling period into classes of the parameter, then comparing the resulting relationships both graphically and statistically with the combined relationships. Surface wind velocities, average upper air wind speeds, prominent synoptic features and air mass types, and the stability of the lowest layers of the atmosphere prior {{to the beginning of the}} sampling periods were the meteorological parameters considered. Division of data by weekend and work week, and then by day of the week was also considered to assess possible variations of pollutant emission rates over these periods. In no case did subdivision of data by additional parameters produce any apparent increased information. Since pilot balloon data are more numerous and less expensive than corresponding radiosonde data, and since theory indicates that wind shear may be a reasonable estimate of stability, the vertical shears of the horizontal wind profiles of the lower atmosphere were also compared with concurrent estimates of air quality. The relationships between shear and air quality for both sampling periods were judged both graphically and statistically to be poorly defined. Although the development of relationships for the purposes of estimating and predicting air quality was not an objective of this study, many of the developed relationships between lapse rate and air quality might be used for one of these purposes. In particular, selected combinations of lapse rate of the morning period may be used as an estimator of air quality for this period. Similarly, lapse rate of the morning period might be utilized as a predictor of air quality of the afternoon period...|$|R
