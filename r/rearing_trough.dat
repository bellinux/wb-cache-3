40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} was to test the semi-intensive rearing of grayling (Thymallus thymallus) using technical equipment to lure flying insects. The experimental fish came from two sources and were reared in these localities: The Trout Farm ČRS Kaplice and The Experimental Fish Culture and Experimental Facility (ERPP) of the Faculty of Fisheries and Protection of Waters SBU in Vodňany. The rearing was carried out between the beginning of May {{and the end of}} October or half November 2014. Three concrete troughs were used in Kaplice. One for the control group and the other ones with technical elements installed to lure insects: one with a light source pointed to a plastic board placed under the water surface and the second with electric insect traps. In Vodňany, the fish were reared in two nurseries. One was used for the control group and the second was fitted with the combination of underwater light and insect traps. All groups were fed with commercially manufactured pellet feed. The fish were regularly measured (total length, body length, weight) and examined by a veterinarian. During {{the experiment}}, better growth in the trough with the lighted board was noticed in the first period of rearing in Kaplice. It was visually confirmed that the fish took the insects {{in the vicinity of the}} technical elements in both localities. The course of the experiment was later strongly influenced by the deteriorating health condition of the fish with the subsequent bad intake of feed in both localities especially between June and the end of September. In Kaplice, the inflow water quality became unstable and some predatory fish invaded the <b>rearing</b> <b>trough.</b> This led to high losses of the reared fish in both localities. In spite of some positive findings, the effect of the applied elements on grayling rearing in the selected objects has not been successfully proved...|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also an}} Ohio Department of Natural Resources fish {{hatchery}} located below Senecaville Dam. This facility was acquired from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987. The hatchery has 37 ponds containing a total of 37 acre of water. The facility also has two outdoor raceways and 18 indoor <b>rearing</b> <b>troughs.</b> Water is supplied by Seneca Lake, which can deliver [...] This water supply allows the hatchery to raise saugeye, walleye, hybrid striped bass, and channel catfish. [...] The hatchery is open to visitors and will accommodate tour groups with advanced reservations.|$|R
40|$|The growth {{response}} of F 1 hybrid fry of female Heterobranchus longifilis and male Clarias gariepinus were investigated under laboratory conditions in glass aquaria glass tanks and plastic basins. The larvae were produced artificially after inducement with Ovarptim. The hatching percentage was very high. Weekly mean length and weight were monitored for 6 weeks. The average length increase was higher in aquaria glass tanks than in plastic basins. However, there were depressed and irregular weight increases in {{both types of}} <b>rearing</b> <b>troughs</b> while significant weight increase (P< 0. 05) was recorded at week 6 in the plastic basin. Generally, the growth rate and survival in both containers were not significantly differen...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} view of a fish hatchery, California, ca. 1910. Vats (or tanks?), some covered, are lined up in rows across the room. The vat in the foreground has some type of filtering device attached to it. Lined along the walls are pipes where more filter devices (or water pumping devices?) can be seen pouring water into the vats. Dozens of glass containers, filled with fish specimens, sit on a table {{near the center of}} the room. Other hatchery devices are seen scattered throughout the room. Nets hang from the roof. In the center of the room hangs a sign that reads: "California Northwestern fish hatchery, [ [...] . ]y Co. "; "The hatchery still houses the initial stages of the process, where fertilized eggs are placed in plastic hatching trays and incubated with a continuous flow of fresh water to provide adequate oxygen. In the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, tall glass hatching jars were used for this process. Today, hatched fish are kept in <b>rearing</b> <b>troughs.</b> When the fish reach 3 to 4 inches they are transferred to one of the ponds. In the spring fish are distributed to the State's waterways. When this was done by train and wagon, fish were transported in "fish cans" with perforated inserts for ice that provided oxygen to the fish as it melted. Today, they are distributed by trucks in large installed tanks. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
60|$|Then {{some one}} in E Troop--men {{said it was}} the Troop-Sergeant-Major--swung his horse round and yelled. No one can account exactly for what {{happened}} afterward; but it seems that, at least, one man in each troop set an example of panic, and the rest followed like sheep. The horses that had barely put their muzzles into the <b>troughs</b> <b>reared</b> and capered; {{but as soon as the}} Band broke, which it did when the ghost of the Drum-Horse was about a furlong distant, all hooves followed suit, and the clatter of the stampede--quite different from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade, or the rough horse-play of watering in camp--made them only more terrified. They felt that the men on their backs were afraid of something. When horses once know that, all is over except the butchery.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{production}} systems {{on the welfare}} of ducks grown for meat is becoming increasingly controversial. In the UK, approximately 18 million ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were reared for meat in 2006 (British Poultry Council, 2008; [URL] Despite the association between ducks and water in the wild, there are no legal requirements {{for them to have}} water for bathing or swimming. Some have troughs in which they dip their heads and splash water onto their bodies but for some, their only contact with water is drinking water from ball-bearing 'nipples'. The Council of Europe (1999) recommends that ducks should be able to dip their heads in water and spread water over their feathers. We here provide clear evidence that duck welfare is related to {{the nature and extent of}} their access to water. We recorded body and plumage condition and undertook three behavioural techniques to assess the effect of water source on the welfare of ducks. Ducks were reared with access to one of five water sources: a bath (small pond), a trough, an overhead shower, nipple drinkers only or nipple drinkers until 5 weeks and a bath thereafter. Their behaviour was assessed by recording (i) the time spent with a single resource, (ii) rebound in water related behaviour when given access to a bath and (iii) their preference for water source when given a four-way choice of all resources. The results showed that without the opportunity to at least dip their heads and splash their feathers with water, ducks were unable to keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers fully clean. Importantly, there was no difference in the time spent bathing from the bath, trough or shower, indicating resources were equivalent in their provision of bathing water. Very little time, however, was spent showing bathing movements at the nipples. Only ducks in the nipple-only group showed 'compensatory rebound' when finally given access to water in a bath, indicating previous bathing deprivation. There was no rebound in groups <b>reared</b> with a <b>trough</b> or shower, again indicating that the trough and shower were equivalent to the bath in its provision of bathing water. When given choice, the ducks preferred to rest and drink-dabble with the shower, and bathe with the bath; the shower was intermediate to the trough. Little time was spent with the nipples when the ducks were given access to other water sources and little time was spent swimming in the bath. The results suggest that commercial farmers may be able to improve duck welfare as much by providing water in troughs or from overhead showers (both clean and economical of water) as from actual ponds (baths). © 2008 Elsevier B.
