5|$|Facing an {{uncertain}} future owing {{to the cost of}} restoration and refurbishment necessary to meet the stringent engineering standards required for main line operation, salvation came in 1996 when Dr Tony Marchington, already well known in the vintage movement, bought the locomotive, and had it restored over three years to <b>running</b> <b>condition</b> at a cost of £1million, a restoration which, at the time, was recognised as the most extensive in the locomotive's history. Marchington's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in a documentary, the Channel 4 programme A Steamy Affair: The Story of Flying Scotsman.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fault {{diagnostic}} method for pump <b>running</b> <b>conditions.</b> The method {{is a combination}} of a process modeling and a classification procedure. The pump head and hydraulic losses in the pipe system are modeled by two equations. The values of the coefficients in the equations are determined from measurable output variables of the pump. Since the pump <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> affect the coefficient values, they are detected by classifying those values. A multi-layer neural network is employed for the classification. Three <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> of a drainage pump are clearly detected by this method. The accuracy of detection is improved by increasing the hidden layers and their units in the neural network...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of off-energy electron {{background in the}} DELPHI luminometer STIC are reported. The study simulates the <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> at 68 GeV with and without bunch trains. The electrostatic separators, which create the vertical separation bumps for the the bunch trains, cause {{a high concentration of}} background in the vertical plane. The simulations are compared to LEP data taken under similar <b>running</b> <b>conditions.</b> A comparison between the simulated <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> at 68 GeV and those of the new LEP 2 beam optics at 80. 5 GeV is made. Moreover, the study investigates background components entering STIC elsewhere that through the front of the detector, and a significant portion is found to enter either from the back or from below. Possible improvements of the background situation are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the problem of {{determining}} the tire-road interaction forces for vehicle dynamic simulations. The work is an attempt to develope a numerical scheme that is universally applicable to all possible <b>running</b> <b>conditions.</b> The tire-road contact patch is approximated as a two-dimensional array of nodal points. Properties such as distribution of normal pressure, deflection and stresses over the contact patch are expressed as sets of the respective nodal values rather than analytical functions. Such a representation enables the treatment of any arbitrary, two-dimensional variation of contact patch properties. The representation of non-rectangular contact patch shapes and trapezoidal pressure distributions is also discussed. For steady state <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> the performance of the scheme is compared with that of an existing analytical model. The applicability of the scheme to transient <b>running</b> <b>conditions</b> is also shown...|$|R

Also on display are extracts from Montgomery's personal papers, which are held by the Imperial War Museum's Department of Documents. Other tableaux depict scenes from post-1945 conflicts such as the Korean War, the Northern Ireland Troubles, the Falklands War, British peacekeeping contributions in Bosnia and the Gulf War. As many of the {{vehicles in}} the Land Warfare Hall are maintained in <b>running</b> <b>condition,</b> the site features garages and a running area behind the building.|$|E
5|$|Following the report, the NRM {{commissioned}} First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently {{review the}} remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations {{on how to}} proceed. In March 2013, the museum announced FCP had determined the locomotive would {{not return to the}} main line until 2015, and believed the outstanding work should be put out to external tender. On 29 October 2013 the museum announced Riley & Son in Bury as the winning contractor, and the same day the locomotive was moved to their workshop in order to return it to <b>running</b> <b>condition</b> no earlier than summer 2015. On 29 April 2015, Flying Scotsmans boiler left the National Railway Museum to be reunited {{with the rest of the}} locomotive at Riley & Son in Bury.|$|E

25|$|Duntov {{came up with}} a {{lightweight}} version of the C2 in 1962. Concerned about Ford and what they were doing with the Shelby Cobra, GM planned to manufacture 100 Grand Sport Corvettes, but only five were actually built. They were driven by historic drivers such as Roger Penske, A. J. Foyt, Jim Hall, and Dick Guldstrand among others. Today the five cars (001-005) are all held by private owners, and are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built. 002 is exhibited in the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum and is in <b>running</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some heavy armored {{fighting}} {{vehicles were}} obtained, notably British Cromwell tanks (150 {{provided by the}} United Kingdom) and captured German tanks (44, of which 12 were Panthers). The 12th Regiment of Dragoons received 12 Cavalier tanks among other British equipment in April 1945. In other cases, FFI units used vehicles no longer favored by Allied forces, such as the U.S. M6 Fargo, a light truck with a portee 37mm antitank gun. Finally, civilian vehicles and practically anything else in <b>running</b> <b>condition</b> were pressed into service and used until {{they could no longer}} be maintained.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, the Israeli Navy {{consisted}} of three former Aliyah Bet ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in Haifa harbor, where they were tied up at the breakwater. Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background – one, the INS Eilat, was an ex-US Coast Guard icebreaker, and the other two, the INS Haganah and INS Wedgwood, had been Royal Canadian Navy corvettes. The ships were put into minimum <b>running</b> <b>condition</b> by contractors dressed as stevedores and port personnel, who were able to work in the engine rooms and below deck. The work had to be clandestine to avoid arousing British suspicion. On 21 May 1948, the three ships set sail for Tel Aviv, and were made to look like ships that had been purchased by foreign owners for commercial use. In Tel Aviv, the ships were fitted with small field guns dating to the late 19th century and anti-aircraft guns. After the British left Haifa port on 30 June, Haifa became the main base of the Israeli Navy. In October 1948, a submarine chaser was purchased from the United States. The warships were manned by former merchant seamen, former crewmembers of Aliyah Bet ships, Israelis who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II, and foreign volunteers. The newly refurbished and crewed warships served on coastal patrol duties and bombarded Egyptian coastal installations in and around the Gaza area all the way to Port Said.|$|E
25|$|D9016 (55 016) Gordon Highlander was {{purchased}} by the Deltic 9000 Fund, with the intention {{that it would be}} restored to <b>running</b> <b>condition,</b> whilst acting as a 'twelve wheeled mobile source of spares'. It was moved to Wansford, on the Nene Valley Railway to join D9000, where the temptation to restore it to operational condition became too great to resist. Eventually, like D9000, the locomotive left the railway for the Network SouthEast depots at Selhurst and Old Oak Common. After D9000 had been operating on the main line for three years {{the decision was made to}} overhaul and recertify D9016, to provide cover for Royal Scots Grey, and the locomotive was moved to Brush Traction at Loughborough. Following overhaul it spent a short period on the main line, on charter work, its operation sponsored by Porterbrook Leasing, in recognition of which it was painted in their purple and grey house colours, based upon the original two-tone green style. It lasted in this livery until 2002, when the original two-tone green livery was reapplied. Following the demise of Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited the locomotive {{was purchased}} and based at the Peak Rail (Heritage Railway), near Bakewell, Derbyshire. In July 2008, this locomotive was sold by the private owner to HNRC, as a business venture. In spite of previous announcements to the contrary, HNRC put the locomotive up for sale at the end of September 2008. Bids from the Gordon Highlander Preservation Group and Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. (the owners of 55 022) were rejected by HNRC in favour of a higher offer from Direct Rail Services (DRS) Ltd. Direct Rail Services (DRS) Ltd kept D9016 at Barrow Hill for a year with the intention of a full overhaul but these plans never surfaced. The locomotive was sold one year later to Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. and it was based at East Lancashire Railway with 55 022. The aim is to return D9016 to mainline condition once again. D9016 donated one of its two engines to 55 022 in April 2010 to replace one of 55 022's engines, a former marine example that had been temporarily fitted to 55 022 following an earlier engine failure. During 2014 D9016 left the East Lancashire Railway for the Great Central Railway. In January 2015 the locomotive moved to the Washwood Heath site of Boden Rail, for bodywork repairs.|$|E

500|$|In late 1962, Air Marshal Sir John Nicholls instigated a trial when he flew Spitfire PM631, a PR Mk 19 in {{the custody}} of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, against an English Electric Lightning F 3 (a {{supersonic}} jet-engined interceptor) in mock combat at RAF Binbrook. At the time British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible action against Indonesia over Malaya and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P-51 Mustang, a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19. The first airframe (PM631) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial. Another PR Mk 19, PS853, which is now owned by Rolls-Royce, was on gate-guard duties at Binbrook, having been retired from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) one year before. It had been maintained in <b>running</b> <b>condition</b> by ground crews at Binbrook, and after a short time was participating in the trials. At the end of the trials, RAF pilots found that Firestreak infra-red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low exhaust temperature, and decided that the twin ADEN [...] cannons were the only weapons suited to the task, which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire and the Lightning's proclivity for over-running the Spitfire. It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet-engined fighter to attack a piston-engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire, and behind it to perform a hit-and-run attack, contrary to all established fighter-on-fighter doctrine at that time.|$|E
