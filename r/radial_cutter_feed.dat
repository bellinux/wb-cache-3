40|$|AbstractIn the {{aircraft}} industry, drilling {{has recently been}} performed for Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) /titanium alloy stacks. The cutting processes should be designed with reviewing in the cutting simulation. The paper presents an analytical model to predict the cutting forces in drilling of multi-layered materials. The force model makes the chip flows on the chisel and the lips with piling up the orthogonal cuttings in the planes containing the cutting velocities and the chip flow velocities along the cutting edges. The chip flow directions on the chisel and lips are determined to minimize the cutting energies. The cutting force is predicted in the determined the chip flow models. In the CFRP/titanium alloy stacks, the material to be removed changes with the <b>cutter</b> <b>feed.</b> Therefore, the orthogonal cutting data of CFRP and those of titanium alloy are applied to make the cutting models according to the change of material.

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} on wear mechanism {{and characteristics of}} tool is a key issue for machining silicon carbide particle reinforced aluminum matrix composites (SiCp/Al). The machining adaptability, wear characteristics of the cermet cutting tools, TiN-coated tools and cemented carbide tools have been studied while milling SiCp/Al composites with large particle and high volume fraction. The {{results indicate that the}} wear resistance of the three kinds of tools are almost the same during machining large particle, high volume fraction SiCp/Al composite, and the tool wear is mainly presented as flank wear, which is caused by the mechanical wear of SiC particles. The wear rate of tools increases with increasing the cutting speed, but the difference is not very obvious. However, no matter high-speed cutting or low-speed cutting, the tool will be seriously worn in short distance.

The shape of the single cutter does not change, but the <b>cutter</b> <b>radial</b> position is shifted towards the tool center. This causes deviations in the profile cut and the screws consequently need a long breaking in.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{conventional}} drilling process and a circular milling process are compared {{with respect to}} delamination and fiber protrusion when machining carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The tool design (tool orthogonal clearance, drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed rate, cutting speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when circular milling. In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral {{angle at the circumference}} <b>cutter</b> and no <b>feed</b> in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special circular milling process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) as well as the setting parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed, up and down milling) are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope.

40|$|Purpose: Aluminum-Silicon (Al-Si) alloys are {{commonly}} used in the automotive industry. At high Si levels they offer good wear resistance. Abrasive wear however, {{has been identified as}} the main insert cutter damage mechanism during High-Speed-Milling (HSM). This study investigates the effect of the tool cutter immersion on Al-Si bi-metallic materials in HSM operation. Design/methodology/approach: This study considers the effects of the tool cutter immersion on the resultant cutting forces, associated machined surface roughness, and machined subsurface microstructural damage caused by the tool cutter during the Minimum Quantity Lubricant – High Speed Milling (MQL-HSM) operation of Al-Si bi-metallic materials with varying amounts and morphologies of the silicon phase. Findings: Experimental results indicate that a combination of gray cast iron with the W 319 microstructure yields the greatest resistance to the tool cutter rake face during the face milling operation for all investigated tool <b>cutter</b> <b>radial</b> immersions. Machined surface roughness measurements reveal that surface roughness is a function of both the silicon content and morphology, as well as the percentage of tool cutter immersion. Matrix hardness measurements indicate that machining at all immersions has the same effect on compressing the matrix structure. Research limitations/implications: This study considers the effects of the radial tooling immersion and material selection while the speed, feed, and axial depth-of-cut are kept constant. Future work should address variability in the machining parameters in an attempt to maximize tool life, while optimizing the machined surface quality. Practical implications: Material selection affects the machining conditions in HSM of Al-Si bi-metallic materials. As a result careful consideration should be given when tailoring the machining conditions to the cast microstructures. Originality/value: North American automakers rely heavily on Al-Si precision sand cast components. As a result bi-metallic machining has to be often addressed during the face milling of engine blocks and cylinder heads. The research conducted here broadens the understanding of the impact of radial immersion on the machining behavior of Al-Si bi-metallic materials...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{part quality}} and {{productivity}} depend on many parameters in CNC milling processes, such as workpiece material, <b>cutters,</b> tool paths, <b>feed</b> rate, and spindle speed, etc. To pursue high performance machining, the cutting parameter optimization is {{in high demand}} in industry, though it is quite challenge. This innovative research successfully addresses some essential problems in optimizing the cutting parameters by developing a new geometric-and-physics integrated model of milling and proposing an effective approach to the medial axis transforms of free-form pockets. In this research, an original geometric model of 21 / 2 - and 3 -axis CNC milling is developed and integrated with a well-established mechanistic model. A main research contribution is that this integrated model can predict complex milling processes in higher fidelity with instantaneous material remove rates, cutting forces and spindle powers, compared to prior machining models. In the geometric model, an in-process workpiece model is introduced by using a group of discrete Z-layers and applying the B-Rep scheme to represent the workpiece shape on each layer, in order to accurately represent instantaneous cutter-and-workpiece engagement in 2 Yz- and 3 -axis milling. Hence, the un-deformed chip geometry can be found even for complex part milling, which is then fed to the mechanistic model to predict instantaneous cutting forces. By using this integrated model, cutting parameters can be optimized for profiling, pocketing, and surface milling to ensure steady cut and the maximum material removal rates. This model has been verified by experiments, and will be implemented into a software tool for Bombardier Aerospace. Another important research in this work is to propose aggressive roughing of free-form pockets for ultimately high cutting efficiency. For this purpose, an accurate, efficient approach to the medial axis transforms of free-form pockets and an optimal approach to multiple cutters selection and their path generation are proposed. The main contributions of this research include (1) a new mathematical model of medial axis point, (2) an innovative global optimization solver, the hybrid global optimization method, (3) an optimization model of selecting multiple cutters for the maximum material removal rate. This research can substantially promote aggressive roughing in the machining industry to increase cutting efficiency of free-form pockets. The technique has been validated using considerable number of cutting tests and can be directly implemented into commercial CAD/CAM softwar...|$|R
40|$|Several {{years ago}} I saw an {{interesting}} {{account of a}} feeding experiment in a newspaper, but the result was not satisfactory. The statement was as follows: “Two fat steers which had been off feed for twelve hours, were fed good rations of corn meal in the morning, {{and as soon as}} it was eaten, they were driven across the street to a slaughter house and butchered. When their stomachs were examined, it was found that most of the meal had passed directly from their gullets to the third apartments or manifolds of their stomachs,” but here the experiment was dropped. Dr. Armsby says in his work on cattle feeding, “that cows have been wintered on corn meal exclusively, and that, although rumination was entirely suspended for several months, no ill effects were observed. ” As many farmers feed meal and grain to their cows before they give them hay, it is important that we should know whether the remastication of such food is advantageous or not. When we feed meal in large quantities to fattening cattle, much of it passes through them undigested. By mixing meal with cut hay or straw, we could compel cattle to remasticate a large share of it. Would it pay to do so or not, is a question which I tried to solve in February and March of 1889. From a lot of twenty-nine calves, I selected six animals that were from 9 to 10 months old, and much alike in size and vigor. On the eighth day of February, three of them were placed in one stall and the other three in another. On the first day of the trial each lot o f calves received ten pounds of corn and cob meal in the morning and as much more in the evening, and both lots received all of the hay and water that they wanted from the beginning to the end of the experiment. In the west stall the meal was fed dry and timothy hay was fed afterwards. We ran a part of the hay for the lot in the east stall through a <b>feed</b> <b>cutter,</b> and at the regular feeding times some of it was moistened and the rations of meal were thorouglv mixed with it before they were given to the calves. In a few days the daily allowance of meal for each lot of calves was increased from twenty to twenty-four pounds, which was the daily meal ration afterwards to the end of the trial. After the 12 th o f March, each lot of calves received daily seven pounds of beets. The weight of each calf was recorded daily from the beginning to the end o f the experiment...|$|R
40|$|In {{the short}} and medium {{perspective}} an essential development of ultra-precision machining and micromachining is expected. It concerns the ultra-precision equipment and processing technology for optical elements and components of machines and devices of different size and purpose. The paper reviews the literature references in the field concerned, investigates the results of national and international researches associated with development of computational models, which describe the process of ultra-precision machining and micromachining. The main objective of the computation models {{is the relationship between}} the operating condition parameters and process indicators, such as cutting forces and temperatures, wear and tool life. A significant disadvantage of the models presented in the literature references is their poor adaptation to a possible change in the input data and machining conditions. Usually, their using makes it possible to conduct design analysis of incorporated parameters interrelation, but it is quantitatively impossible to determine the process output parameters with changing machining conditions. One of examples to apply the ultra-precision machining is the plane reflectors made of aluminum alloy. They are used in space technology {{as a part of the}} radiative cooler. For such reflector a technology has been designed to provide machining with a diamond milling head on the ultra-precision CNC machine. The calculation part of the paper analyses the kinematic scheme of machining and presents a model to determine a cutting length for the particular surface type. In subsequent calculations the cutting length is treated as a parameter to calculate the tool wear, cutting force and temperature. The presented computational model enables us to determine the cutting forces and temperature on the rake and clearance surface. The calculation takes into account the radius of cutting edge and the wear on the clearance surface, which depends on the path length of the cutting tool along the work piece. The literature references contain information about the single-point diamond cutters used in various operations of ultra-precision machining. It is established that the final diamond turning with a new (resharpen) <b>cutter</b> with the <b>feed</b> less than 9 micrometer per revolution and the depth of cut 3 [...] 4 micrometer ensures that the copper and aluminum surfaces are processed with a maximum height of profile within 50 nm. This roughness allows us to use treated surfaces as reflecting ones in optical elements for various purposes. Based on the analysis, a model have been created to calculate the cutting force and temperature for ultra-precision machining of flat reflector made of aluminum alloy by using a diamond milling head. According to the calculated dependences, it was concluded that the value of tangential force changes little, while the radial component of the force increases with increasing cutting length and tool wear. The cutting forces are within tenths of Newton. The paper conducts a comparison of the calculated values of the cutting forces with the experimental data presented in the literature references. When finishing the cutting temperature changes within 50 … 70 0 С. After considering the modeling results a technology for ultra-precision machining of the reflector has been developed, tested, and implemented. The experimental part presents the machining results of flat reflectors using the developed technology. After machining the treated surface has passed a quality control using the μSurf NanoFocus AG confocal microscope. Measuring results have shown that the arithmetical mean deviation of the reflecting surface profile is within the range of 0, 01 micrometer, which meets the requirements. A development of dynamic model of aerostatic spindle for the ultra-precision machine is expected to be the next step of research. The input parameters of the dynamic model to be used are the calculated cutting forces, as well as the experimentally measured stiffness and damping coefficients of the spindle assembly. Dynamic model will enable us to determine the spatial displacement of the spindle assembly rotor, to analyze and reduce the processing errors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{harvesting}} {{of strawberries}} {{has been at}} the experimental stage since the early l 960 's, but has not attained any commercial success until recently. One of the main problems has been that the strawberries ripen successively during a couple of weeks, and that most harvesters are based on the once-over principle. This results in a decrease in yield {{at the same time as}} a relatively large quantity of green strawberries is harvested. It has frequently been considered profitable to hand-pick the first large berries and then harvest mechanically about one week later. Another approach frequently used by growers is to hand-pick several times and then harvest the remaining berries by machine. When a late harvesting of this kind is carried out, there are very few berries left, many of which are over-ripe or have not been picked because they are mouldy. In such a situation there are not only too few berries to pay for the machine-costs, but r also the berries are of such poor quality that extensive sorting is needed before they can be used. This type of mechanical harvesting has been found very unprofitable. The early trials are all centered on harvesting in normal row crops. During he l 960 's, prototype harvesters were developed at several universities in the USA and in Canada. All prototypes worked on the principle of stripping the berries from the plant. Fingers made of plastic or metal, placed at suitable intervals, combed through the plant and removed the strawberries. Tests were made of stripping forwards, backwards, and sideways, etc. Almost all possible approaches have been tested. Similar machines have been constructed also in Holland, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Denmark. The Danish machine is only a couple of years old, and this harvesting method is being tested actively in Denmark. One of the large problems with the stripping strawberry harvesters is their low capacity. Driving speeds are normally only 300 - 400 metres per hour. In order to be able to drive faster, the fingers which strip off the berries must also move faster, and then the number of berries thrown out and lost increases. Another problem is that the runners easily become entangled in the fingers and are pulled off, thus hindering the harvesting. In the late l 960 's, harvesters working on the principle of cutting off the entire plant started to appear. This method was developed simultaneously by the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering (NIAE) in England, and by growers and universities in Oregon, USA. The fundamental principle is as follows: strawberries and leaves are located on different stems, and if the plant is cut off close to the soil, the berries and leaves can be separated by blowing away the leaves and other light material. This harvesting method allows a considerable increase in the driving speed. Similar harvesters are being (or have been) developed also in Canada, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Other methods than the two described above have been tested: vibrating the stems of the plants, causing the ripe strawberries to fall off, for example; or lifting the berries with a net laid out on the ground in the spring. Whatever method is used, it has become apparent that growing technique must be modified if harvesting is to be carried out satisfactorily. There is probably no existing field that can be successfully harvested mechanically without modifications. In some cases, harvest-efficiency has been increased from 50 to 90 %, simply by removing stones etc. and levelling out the beds. It became apparent that one of the largest problems is the lifting of the berries from the soil so they can be harvested. A large number of the berries lie on the outer edge of the row. Also, if the soil between the rows has been compressed by tractor wheels, this worsens matters. Great efforts have been made to breed varieties with an erect growth habit, but with little success. Various solutions have been tried for lifting the berries from the soil, different types of brushes and reels, for example. Fingers which comb through the plant (similar to the crop-lifter on a combine-harvester) are commonly used on the cutting harvesters. Air has also been used, both as a negative pressure (the vacuum cleaner principle) and by blowing compressed air from the sides of the row. Most of these methods have caused undesirable damage to the berries. Another problem with harvesting strawberries cultivated in rows, is the varying degrees of ripeness due to uneven exposure to sunlight. Berries on the outside of the rows ripen 3 - 4 days earlier than those in the middle. It is therefore difficult to find the optimum time of harvesting, with the maximum of ripe berries, but without any being over-ripe. A complete system of cultivation, of which the harvester is an integrated part, has been developed by Michigan State University in the USA. In this system, the strawberries are grown in a field without rows, thus covering the entire field. This solves a number of problems encountered in row-cropping. The increased number of plants (the aim is to have 150 established crowns per square metre in a fully-grown population) results in the straw-berries being raised higher from the soil, since the stems support the fruit. Moreover, the ripening is more uniform when all the berries are shaded beneath the foliage. Another important advantage is that the yield, according to American results, is twice as high as that obtained in the conventional row system. The rows cover only 40 % of the field as opposed to the 100 % coverage with the new system. This also means that the harvester doubles its capacity at the same driving speed and cutting width. Also, in the USA there are fewer problems with diseases as the berries do not lie directly on the soil. The fields are harvested with a machine developed at Michigan State University which cuts off the plant very close to the soil, preferably closer than 2 cm from the ground. To make this possible, it is vital that the field be absolutely level. The harvest is facilitated by crop-lifters which lift up the berries, and a reel which also lifts up the berries in front of the <b>cutter</b> bar, and <b>feeds</b> them into the harvester. Conveyors transport the straw-berries backwards into the machine, where they fall onto a grid conveyor. As they fall, they pass through a powerful current of air which blows away leaves and other light material. The grid conveyor transports the berries over two more fans which blow air from below, and raise the stems while the berries remain on the grid. A double-sickle shortens the stems to 3 - 4 cm. Bunches of berries are thus separated, giving individual berries with short stems. These fall onto a conveyor which transports them sideways out to storage boxes. Under normal conditions, the harvester has a capacity of approximately 2 tonnes per hour, and can harvest one hectare in approximately 6 - 8 hours. The harvesting efficiency is frequently higher than 90 %. This figure can be compared with manual harvesting, where efficiency is often as low as 75 %, ie one fourth of the strawberries are left in the field. Irrespective of whether the harvesting is done by stripping or by cutting, the berries must undergo further treatment before they can be frozen or processed in a factory. The harvester which gives the cleanest product is probably the one developed by Michigan State University. When these strawberries are to be used for making puree, for example, they can simply be tipped from the boxes into a tank of water for washing, after which all mouldy fruit is removed manually from an inspection belt. The remainder is fed into a puree-press. If the berries are to be IQF-frozen, a product which has a higher price, and probably also a wider market, both stem and cap must be removed. This can be done in a decapping machine. There are different types of decappers, one of which uses counter-rotating rubber rollers. When the stem is caught between two rollers, it is pulled off. On most varieties of strawberries the cap remains on the berries and they cannot be used for jam, for example. Another type of decapper has been developed at Michigan State University. This uses a conveyor with a number of smooth plastic-covered, counter-rotating rollers. When the stem is caught between two rollers it is held in place and transported past a band knife (a band saw without teeth) which cuts off the stem and cap. The capped berries can then be IQF-frozen, or used in making, for example, jam...|$|R
