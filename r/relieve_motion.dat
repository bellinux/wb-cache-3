5000|$|Food Detectives was a {{food science}} show hosted by Ted Allen that aired in North America on Food Network from July to September 2008. Ted Allen, backed by {{research}} conducted by Popular Science magazine, investigated food-related beliefs, such as {{the validity of the}} five-second rule or the effectiveness of ginger in <b>relieving</b> <b>motion</b> sickness. In addition to support from scientists such as molecular biologist Dr. Adam Ruben and Popular Science staff members, Allen was assisted on-screen by a group of [...] "Food Techs," [...] often-silent assistants who are the participants in simple experiments exploring food-related myths, beliefs, practices, and folkways.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Eel {{calcitonin}} (elcatonin) injection {{is widely}} used for elderly patients suffering from somatic pain in Japan. However, {{there have been few}} reports on the analgesic effects of elcatonin injection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the analgesic effects of elcatonin injection in postmenopausal women with lower back pain. Methods: This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-six women aged � 50 years with acute lower back pain participated in this study. They were randomly divided into two treatment groups according to whether they received a placebo or a weekly trigger point injection of elcatonin (20 units). They were observed for 5 weeks and the extent of pain at motion and at rest according to the visual analog scale (VAS) was evaluated. The mean VAS scores for the elcatonin group were then compared with those of the placebo group. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the mean VAS scores for pain at rest between the two groups during the 5 -week treatment course. However, the mean VAS scores for motion pain in the elcatonin group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group at the third, fifth and sixth weeks. Conclusions: Elcatonin injection (20 units) significantly <b>relieved</b> <b>motion</b> pain in the lower back in postmenopausal women after three weeks of treatment. This analgesic effect continued for the subsequent 3 weeks...|$|R

40|$|Can {{tamoxifen}} <b>relieve</b> <b>motion</b> sickness? Motion sickness (MS) is {{an unpleasant}} and sometimes dis-abling condition {{in response to}} the perception of certain kind of motions. Its pathogenesis is incompletely understood; inter-actions between endocrine mechanisms and the vestibular ap-paratus are likely, as suggested by a higher incidence and severity of MS in females and pregnancy, the reported changes in MS susceptibility during the menstrual cycle, and an affinity with migraine [1, 2]. We recently heard about two sisters, both breast cancer patients who were followed-up at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan (Table 1), who had experienced a striking reduction of their intense sea sickness after receiving tamoxifen (TAM). We evaluated the patients by means of a standardize...|$|E

40|$|A novolac {{phenol-formaldehyde resin}} was {{investigated}} by thermally stimulated depolarization current using the integral and partial measurements in the temperature range from 137 K to 270 K. Two broadened peaks assigned as 1 and 2 appeared at about 160 K and 190 K. The influence of water was investigated. The {{analysis of the}} activation energy, Ea vs. T, {{and the search for}} compensation phenomena were performed. Three different regions in relaxations were distinguished and the related compensation temperature s (Te) were determined. Contamination with water increases the polarizability, decreases the structure differences and <b>relieves</b> the <b>motions</b> in resin. The influence of water was discussed in the terms of the shifts of Tc 2 ̆ 7 s. All the motions were attributed to the rotation of the phenyl rings with different surrounding structures...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An ununited {{scaphoid}} fracture whose proximal fragment is small, sclerotic, fragmented, or badly deformed {{is usually}} not suitable for bone-grafting. We treated twenty-one such patients by excision of the small proximal fragment through a volar incision and the insertion of a hand-carved silicone-rubber spacer. After surgery, twenty patients (95 per cent) were {{able to return to}} work and engage in strenuous activities, including sports. Pain was significantly <b>relieved,</b> al-though wrist <b>motions</b> and grip were only minimally im-proved. Preoperative and postoperative comparative measurements of carpal collapse and translation showed only insignificant changes after this procedure. Most scaphoid fractures that are still ununited after six months of immobilization or more will heal after bone...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} total joint {{arthroplasty}} {{of the hip}} and knee is to safely and effectively <b>relieve</b> pain, restore <b>motion,</b> and im-prove function. In less than three months, {{the vast majority of}} patients can return to the activities of daily living and can par-ticipate in certain sports. As a result, total joint arthroplasty {{has become one of the}} most successful and widely acclaimed procedures of the modern era. Recently, minimally invasive surgery, which involves a smaller incision (defined as < 10 cm) or multiple smaller inci-sions, has been introduced to both hip and knee replacement surgery 1 - 3. The premise is to reduce the trauma of surgery while maintaining the perceived high levels of safety, efficacy, and durability of the procedure. If it is done successfully, pa-tients can expect a shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery, faster rehabilitation, improved function, and better cosmeti...|$|R
40|$|Palliative Schanz {{proximal}} femoral valgus osteotomy {{is considered}} a common option for treatment of irreducible hip dislocation in cerebral palsy. From 1992 to 2005, Schanz osteotomy was indicated on 55 occasions in 35 nonambulatory patients with the quadriplegic form of cerebral palsy aged 9 – 18. Postoperatively, the main emphasis focussed on clinical presentation, improvement of hip range of motion, and pain relief. X-rays were carried out at three, six, and 12  months postoperatively with subsequent average follow up 98 [*]±[*] 4. 5  months. In all patients, the range of hip abduction and flexion increased. In 54 (98. 2 %) cases painful symptoms significantly improved. One patient (1. 8 %) had a subsequent femoral head excision because of persistent hip pain. Transient hip pain persisted in four patients (7. 3 %). Schanz valgus osteotomy improves the hip range of <b>motion,</b> <b>relieves</b> pain, and facilitates care of the patient. Schanz femoral osteotomy is a less invasive method compared to proximal femoral excision and should preferably be used in older children with neurogenic hip dislocation in whom reconstructive surgery is not indicated...|$|R
40|$|When {{planning}} a mutation to test some hypothesis, one crucial {{question is whether}} the new side chain is compatible with the existing structure; only if it is compatible can the interpretation of mutational results be straightforward. This paper presents a simple way of using the sensitive geometry of all-atom contacts (including hydrogens) to answer that question. The interactive MAGE/PROBE system lets the biologist explore conformational space for the mutant side chain, with an interactively updated kinemage display of its all-atom contacts to the original structure. The Autobondrot function in PROBE systematically explores that same conformational space, outputting contact scores at each point, which are then contoured and displayed. These procedures are applied here in two types of test cases, with known mutant structures. In ricin A chain, the ability of a neighboring glutamate to rescue activity of an active-site mutant is modeled successfully. In T 4 lysozyme, six mutations to Leu are analyzed within the wild-type background structure, and their Autobondrot score maps correctly predict whether or not their surroundings must shift significantly in the actual mutant structures; interactive examination of contacts for the conformations involved explains which clashes are <b>relieved</b> by the <b>motions.</b> These programs are easy to use, are available free for UNIX or Microsoft Windows operating systems, and should be of significant help in choosing good mutation experiments or in understanding puzzling results...|$|R
40|$|The Ras-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factors Son of sevenless (Sos) and Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RasGRF 1) transduce {{extracellular}} stimuli into Ras activation by catalyzing {{the exchange}} of Ras-bound GDP for GTP. A truncated form of RasGRF 1 containing only the core catalytic Cdc 25 domain is sufficient for stimulating Ras nucleotide exchange, whereas the isolated Cdc 25 domain of Sos is inactive. At a site distal to the catalytic site, nucleotide-bound Ras binds to Sos, making contacts with the Cdc 25 domain and with a Ras exchanger motif (Rem) domain. This allosteric Ras binding stimulates nucleotide exchange by Sos, but the mechanism by which this stimulation occurs has not been defined. We present a crystal structure of the Rem and Cdc 25 domains of Sos determined at 2. 0 -Å resolution {{in the absence of}} Ras. Differences between this structure and that of Sos bound to two Ras molecules show that allosteric activation of Sos by Ras occurs through a rotation of the Rem domain that is coupled to a rotation of a helical hairpin at the Sos catalytic site. This <b>motion</b> <b>relieves</b> steric occlusion of the catalytic site, allowing substrate Ras binding and nucleotide exchange. A structure of the isolated RasGRF 1 Cdc 25 domain determined at 2. 2 -Å resolution, combined with computational analyses, suggests that the Cdc 25 domain of RasGRF 1 is able to maintain an active conformation in isolation because the helical hairpin has strengthened interactions with the Cdc 25 domain core. These results indicate that RasGRF 1 lacks the allosteric activation switch that is crucial for Sos activity...|$|R
