5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from <b>rat</b> <b>poison,</b> but when common adulterants used in <b>rat</b> <b>poison</b> {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|Other {{compounds}} {{of barium}} find only niche applications, {{limited by the}} toxicity of Ba2+ ions (barium carbonate is a <b>rat</b> <b>poison),</b> {{which is not a}} problem for the insoluble BaSO4.|$|E
50|$|For many decades, arsenic {{was used}} medicinally to treat syphilis. It is still used in sheep dips, <b>rat</b> <b>poisons,</b> wood preservatives, weed killers, and other pesticides. Arsenic is also still used for murder by poisoning, for which use {{it has a}} long and {{continuing}} history in both literature and fact.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} {{eradicate}} murine typhus fever by control of rats and rat-fleas in rural foci {{was carried out}} in Georgia between July 1953 and May 1954. Anticoagulant <b>rat</b> <b>poisons</b> and DDT powder were the principal agents used. Rats were eliminated from 89 % of rat-infested premises and satisfactory flea reduction was achieved...|$|R
5000|$|From ancient times, {{humans have}} used cardiac-glycoside-containing plants and their crude {{extracts}} as arrow coatings, homicidal or suicidal aids, <b>rat</b> <b>poisons,</b> heart tonics, diuretics and emetics, {{primarily due to}} the toxic nature of these compounds.  US poison centers reported 2632 cases regarding digotoxin toxicity, and 17 cases regarding digotoxin-related deaths in 2008.|$|R
5|$|The odorless and {{tasteless}} thallium sulfate {{was once}} widely used as <b>rat</b> <b>poison</b> and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example in subsequent years. Thallium salts {{were used in}} the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. This use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{first came}} into {{commercial}} use in 1948 as a <b>rat</b> <b>poison.</b> In 1954 it was approved for medical use in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Warfarin is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$1.12 to 7.20 for a typical month of treatment. In the United States it usually costs less than $25 a month.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as <b>rat</b> <b>poison.</b> This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
50|$|Mouse and <b>rat</b> <b>poisons</b> {{containing}} cholecalciferol cause hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in dogs. Clinical signs include depression, loss of appetite, vomiting blood, weakness, and shock. Treatment is {{as above}} for recent exposure. When hypercalcemia occurs (which can take 1 to 2 weeks), treatment is with intravenous fluids (saline), diuretics, corticosteroids, and calcitonin. Long term prognosis is good once {{the dog is}} stabilized.|$|R
500|$|Soluble {{thallium}} salts (many {{of which}} are nearly tasteless) are toxic, and they were historically used in <b>rat</b> <b>poisons</b> and insecticides. Use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries, because of their nonselective toxicity. Thallium poisoning results in hair loss. Because of its historic popularity as a murder weapon, thallium has gained notoriety as [...] "the poisoner's poison" [...] and [...] "inheritance powder" [...] (alongside arsenic).|$|R
40|$|Three histochemical {{reactions}} for the localization {{of copper}} {{were applied to}} liver and {{different parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract of normal as well as of <b>rats</b> <b>poisoned</b> with a solution of copper. Variable quantities of copper were demonstrated in the livers of all the <b>poisoned</b> <b>rats</b> and in 21 out of 24 sections of jejunum. Rubeanic acid counterstained with 0 · 5 % Cresyl violet gave the best results. Copper was not demonstrable in the livers or the gastrointestinal tract of normal rats. As the metal was concentrated in the upper jejunum, it is likely that this is the site of absorption. Detection of this metal may assist in the diagnosis of hepatolenticular degeneration...|$|R
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing <b>rat</b> <b>poison.</b> The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing could happen to anyone.|$|E

25|$|Cyanides {{are used}} as {{insecticides}} for fumigating ships. Cyanide salts are used for killing ants, and have in some places been used as <b>rat</b> <b>poison</b> (the less toxic poison arsenic is more common).|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 60-70% of {{thallium}} {{production is}} used in the electronics industry, and the remainder {{is used in}} the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. Thallium is highly toxic and was used in <b>rat</b> <b>poisons</b> and insecticides. Its use has been reduced or eliminated in many countries because of its nonselective toxicity. Because of its use for murder, thallium has gained the nicknames [...] "The Poisoner's Poison" [...] and [...] "Inheritance Powder" [...] (alongside arsenic).|$|R
5000|$|Restricting {{sales of}} {{certain types of}} <b>rat</b> <b>poisons,</b> known as Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARs). SGARs are found in many animals that have eaten {{poisoned}} rodents, such as barn owls, coyotes, bobcats and the endangered San Joaquin kit fox. Not only does this restriction help protect these animals in California, but it also spurred changes at the national level. Following DPR's action, the pesticide manufacturer agreed to phase out their SGARs across, yielding a parallel success for the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|R
40|$|Paraquat: PQ (1. 1 dimetil- 4 - 4 -bipiridilo) is an {{agricultural}} herbicide, whose poisoning unleashes {{a series of}} histological pulmonary injuries. Vitamin E (VE) is a biological antioxidant which sweeps away free radicals. Dexametasone (DMX) has an anti inflammatory action. In the present work, the histological changes in lung of <b>rats</b> <b>poisoned</b> with PQ and treated with VE, DMX and related substances were evaluated. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups (G) : G 1 (Negative Control) 6 rats that received saline solution; G 2 (Positive control) 6 rats that received (PQ) 11 mg/kg i. p; G 3 : 8 rats pretreated 10 days before the poisoning with oral VE 500 mg/Kg; G 4 : 8 <b>rats</b> <b>poisoned</b> with PQ + VE; G 5 : 8 rats that received IM PQ + DMX 1 mg/kg; and G 6 : 8 rats that received PQ + VE + DMX. The experimental period lasted 31 days. The G 2 rats that received PQ died within 48 hours; whereas G 3, G 4, G 5 and G 6 survived 294, 504, 438, 300 hours, respectively. The histopathological analysis revealed severe pulmonary damage produced by PQ, which was lessened by treatment with VE, DMX and related substances. Results suggest a possible protective effect of such medicines on the oxidative damage induced by the herbicide...|$|R
25|$|On Christmas Day, the ARM then {{claimed in}} writing {{to two of}} Vancouver's biggest chains, Save-On Foods and Canada Safeway, that they had {{injected}} <b>rat</b> <b>poison</b> into turkeys in supermarkets. Evidence of contamination was not found.|$|E
25|$|In January 2003, red pandas {{died after}} eating <b>rat</b> <b>poison</b> {{that had been}} buried in their yard by a pest control contractor. The {{incident}} led the city of Washington, D.C. to seek to fine the zoo over its claim of federally granted immunity.|$|E

50|$|Animals {{are known}} to have {{different}} sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some animal repellents (especially for such large mammals as deer). It has been used to safeguard <b>rat</b> <b>poisons</b> from human consumption, as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents. However, some cats have been known to be tempted by them—it may not be as effective a deterrent for cats as it is for humans, or perhaps some cats are not deterred due to a genetic factor similar to that affecting human perceptions of the taste of phenylthiocarbamide.|$|R
40|$|Ricin induced {{the release}} of tumour {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta by human peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibition induced by ricin upon the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) -driven lymphocyte proliferation was greater in cultures of mononuclear cells than that observed in monocyte-free cultures of lymphocytes, and was decreased after addition of an anti-TNF-alpha antibody to PHA-activated cultures. Low levels of TNF-alpha were detected in plasma from <b>rats</b> <b>poisoned</b> with ricin. These results suggest that ricin induced {{the release of}} macrophage-derived cytokines which may {{have a role in}} the pathogenesis of ricin toxic effects...|$|R
5|$|The use {{of oxygen}} as {{treatment}} began in 1868. The use of hyperbaric oxygen in <b>rats</b> following <b>poisoning</b> was studied by Haldane in 1895 while {{its use in}} humans began in the 1960s.|$|R
25|$|James's {{parents and}} {{siblings}} – The family immigrated to the United States when James was 8 years old.

He had two older brothers and three sisters.|$|E
25|$|Broadnax {{recovered}} (although she ultimately {{suffered the}} effects {{for the rest}} of her life, and received some support from Jefferson). Broadnax told many people that she had seen Sweeney put a powder in their morning coffee. Other black witnesses saw Sweeney drop paper from the jail, which appeared to contain <b>rat</b> <b>poison.</b> However, both trial judges agreed that Virginia race laws prohibited blacks from testifying at the trial.|$|E
25|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} conflict, the Rhodesian {{government}} resorted to biological warfare. Watercourses at several sites close to the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with cholera and the toxin Sodium Coumadin, an anti-coagulant commonly used as the active ingredient in <b>rat</b> <b>poison.</b> Food stocks in the area were contaminated with anthrax spores. These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA, but caused considerable distress to the local population. Over 10,000 people contracted anthrax in the period 1978 to 1980, of whom 200 died. The facts about this episode became known during the hearings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the late 1990s.|$|E

50|$|The toxins {{react with}} pyridoxal 5-phosphate—the {{activated}} form of pyridoxine—and form a hydrazone. This reduces {{production of the}} neurotransmitter GABA via decreased activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase, which {{gives rise to the}} neurological symptoms. MMH also causes oxidative stress leading to methemoglobinemia. Additionally during the metabolism of MMH, N-methyl-N-formylhydrazine is produced; this then undergoes cytochrome P450 regulated oxidative metabolism which via reactive nitrosamide intermediates leads to formation of methyl radicals which lead to liver necrosis. Inhibition of diamine oxidase (histaminase) elevates histamine levels, resulting in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Giving pyridoxine to <b>rats</b> <b>poisoned</b> with gyromitrin inhibited seizures, but did not prevent liver damage.|$|R

25|$|New York City {{publishes a}} guide for {{property}} owners and tenants, entitled Preventing Rats on Your Property: A Guide for Property Owners and Tenants, that discusses how the Health Department inspects for rats, and how to control rats, including looking for evidence, cleaning up, starving them, shutting them out, and wiping them out. The guide covers the use of traps, <b>rat</b> <b>poison,</b> and wire mesh {{at the base of}} trees, as well as the new rules for garbage pickup, with landlords bringing out garbage in the morning immediately prior to pickup rather than the night before. Rodent baiting is suggested as an effective approach to wiping out rats.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{industrial}} innovations were {{not limited to}} weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a textile industry {{in an effort to}} compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians. Additionally, by hiring European managers, he was able to introduce industrial training to the Egyptian population. To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a corvée labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as Syria. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with <b>rat</b> <b>poison</b> and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.|$|E
50|$|The {{crimes of}} three murderesses, Yvonne Fletcher, Caroline Grills and Veronica Monty are {{examined}} {{in the context of}} a wave of dozens of thallium poisonings that took place in Sydney in the period 1947-1953. The events are related to post-war poverty and social stresses, and to the ready availability of thallium sulphate rodenticides (<b>rat</b> <b>poisons)</b> which could be easily administered to humans in food and drink, being virtually tasteless and odourless. The three were convicted and imprisoned, but the documentary suggests that many more murders by other persons could have remained undetected. As a result of these events, the Australian states began to ban unrestricted availability of thallium in 1952.|$|R
5000|$|Its use {{worldwide}} {{has been}} banned since 1984, {{but due to}} continuing demand and its ease of production, it is still readily, although illegally, available in China {{and can be found}} in some illegally imported <b>rat</b> <b>poisons.</b> The best known Chinese rodenticide, containing about 6-20% TETS, is Dushuqiang, [...] "very strong rat poison". It has been used for mass poisonings in China: in April 2004, there were 74 casualties after eating scallion-flavored pancakes tainted by their vendor's competitor; and in September 2002, 400 people were poisoned and 38 died from contaminated food. [...] In 2002, there was one documented case of accidental poisoning in the US.|$|R
5000|$|Mahmud's {{strategy}} in prosecuting the Insurgency War was {{to reduce the}} number of insurgents through peaceful means by, in the words of one commentator, giving them [...] "every chance to surrender and escape from being killed". Mahmud reportedly [...] "saw immense propaganda value in former terrorists who were now alive, repentant, and leading full productive lives", he analogised the war to exterminating <b>rats.</b> <b>Poisoning</b> and killing them would not work as long as they reproduced; instead by attacking the root causes such as the habitat, the rats could be extinguished. His strategy was approved of by civilian superiors such as the later Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.|$|R
