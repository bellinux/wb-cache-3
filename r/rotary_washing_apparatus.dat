Some can be folded up {{when not in}} use (although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught, so there is usually a safety button).|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a general}} exclamation of [...] "Capital, mamma!" [...] and then a burst of {{laughter}} {{at the idea of}} making sugar with a mangle. The mangle in question was part of a patent <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> which Mr. Hardy had brought with him from England, and consisted of two strong iron rollers, kept together by strong springs, and turning with a handle.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1850s steam-driven {{commercial}} laundry machinery were {{on sale in}} the UK and US. Technological {{advances in}} machinery for commercial and institutional washers proceeded faster than domestic washer design for several decades, especially in the UK. In the United States there was more emphasis on developing machines for washing at home, though machines for commercial laundry services were widely used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The <b>rotary</b> <b>washing</b> machine was patented by Hamilton Smith in 1858. As electricity was not commonly available until at least 1930, some early washing machines were operated by a low-speed, single-cylinder hit-and-miss gasoline engine.|$|R

50|$|Heath Town public baths were {{designed}} by H. B. Robinson, Borough Surveyor and Engineer. They were opened on 16 December 1932, by Alderman F. A. Willcock, chair of Wolverhampton Borough Council's Parks and Baths Committee. The Main Swimming Bath was 75 feet long by 34 feet wide. The Children's Swimming Bath was 40 feet long by 25 feet wide-ranging from a depth from three feet to three feet three inches deep. The building also included Wolverhampton's first large public washhouse which housed four <b>rotary</b> <b>washing</b> machines, twenty one drying horses, three electrically operated hydro-extractors, fifteen washing stalls for hand washing, drying houses and irons. The building also housed Heath Town's public library. The baths eventually closed in 2002, and the library closed on November 3, 2006.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{originally}} named Priorswood Secondary Modern School and opened on 28 May 1956 by the school's first headmaster, Arthur George Miller, with 258 children in attendance. When the school first opened no electric or gas supply was available, except to <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> in the canteen kitchen. Heating was supplied by an oil fuelled boiler. The library, stage, gymnasium, domestic science, woodwork and metalwork rooms were incomplete {{and could not}} be used. However, the playground {{on the north side of}} the building was available for recreation. The facilities of the school were completed on 7 June 1956 allowing the school to function as normal.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the open}} space, garden areas and {{established}} trees are of importance to the setting {{and understanding of the}} school. In particular the split-level Terrace, an open lawned area forming a central court which retains a vista toward the river via a small lawn to the south-west of the Main Building. St Gertrude's playing grounds in the northern corner of the school is an established area with important planting including a bougainvillea hedge and a large weeping fig. The gardens surrounding the convent provide a buffer zone between this and the other, more public, buildings on the site. These areas are the chapel garden, the driveway, the former kitchen garden to the north-east and the lawn between the convent and Ann Street which houses many <b>rotary</b> <b>washing</b> lines. There are many large established trees on the site.|$|R
60|$|Within, {{there is}} one long narrow cabin, the whole length of the boat; from which the state-rooms open, on both sides. A small portion {{of it at the}} stern is {{partitioned}} off for the ladies; and the bar is at the opposite extreme. There is a long table down the centre, and at either end a stove. The <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is forward, on the deck. It is a little better than on board the canal boat, but not much. In all modes of travelling, the American customs, with reference to the means of personal cleanliness and wholesome ablution, are extremely negligent and filthy; and I strongly incline to the belief that a considerable amount of illness is referable to this cause.|$|R

The lady's piano, drawing-materials, books, and other such evidences of refinement are {{as much a part of}} the rough place as the iron bedsteads of the little patients. They are put to shifts for room, like passengers on board ship.

60|$|There is {{no denying}} that he looks very small aboard a great ship, and that a boy must have a strong and decided {{speciality}} for the sea to take to such a life. Captain Harris was not on board, but the other chief officers were, and were highly obliging. We went over the ship. I should say {{that there can be}} little or no individuality of address to any particular boy, but that they all tumble through their education in a crowded way. The Admiral's servant (I mean our Admiral's) had an idiotic appearance, but perhaps it did him injustice (a mahogany-faced marine by station). The Admiral's <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{is about the size of}} a muffin-plate, and he could easily live in his chest. The meeting with Bromley was a piece of great good fortune, and the dear old chap could not have been left more happily.|$|R
40|$|A soil <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> was {{constructed}} and tested {{in collaboration with}} colleagues from the grant authority and project partners in Austria and Romania. It {{is based on a}} similar apparatus used in the USA but our apparatus can quickly process a large number of samples. The eggs were extracted by sieving and then floating on MgSO 4 -solution followed by sedimentation in water. Eggs of D. virgifera virgifera were separated from those of other species by studying the structure of egg surface. The efficiency of extraction of the apparatus was checked using samples spiked with blue coloured eggs. In co-operation with Austrian and Romanian colleagues a method was developed for sampling in the field. Eggs of D. virgifera virgifera were extracted from soil samples collected from fields in Austria and Romania in spring/summer and autumn 2011. The beetles did not appear to prefer to lay eggs at either the edges or centres of fields. As very few eggs were found at the edges of oil seed squash fields this crop {{does not appear to be}} a suitable habitat for egg laying...|$|R
40|$|The 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, {{earthquake}} provides {{case histories}} of ground failure and non-ground failure that are valuable {{to the ongoing}} development of liquefaction susceptibility, triggering and surface manifestation models because the data occupy sparsely populated parameter spaces (i. e. high cyclic stress ratio and high fines content with low to moderate soil plasticity). In this paper, we document results from several large site investigation programs conducted in Nantou, Wufeng and Yuanlin, Taiwan. The seismic performance of the investigated sites include non-ground failure building and free-field sites, building sites with partial foundation hearing failures, free-field lateral spread sites, and free-field level ground sites with sediment boils. Field and laboratory investigation protocols for the sites are described, including cone penetration testing (some with pore pressure and shear wave velocity measurements) and <b>rotary</b> <b>wash</b> borings with standard penetration testing (including energy measurements). Implications of the SPT energy measurements with respect to established guidelines for the estimation of SPT energy ratio (including short rod corrections) are presented. Finally, data for three example sites are shown that illustrate potential applications of the data set, and which also demonstrate a condition where existing liquefaction analysis procedures fail to predict the observed field performance.

500|$|Chromic acid is a {{powerful}} oxidizing agent and is a useful compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any trace of organic compounds. It is prepared by dissolving potassium dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid, which is then used to <b>wash</b> the <b>apparatus.</b> Sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (50 g/L versus 200 g/L respectively). The use of dichromate cleaning solutions is now phased out due to the high toxicity and environmental concerns. Modern cleaning solutions are highly effective and chromium free.|$|R
50|$|Soft ground {{drilling}} can {{be undertaken}} using a <b>rotary</b> auger or <b>wash</b> boring techniques, while rock drilling often use {{methods such as}} NMLC which allow for recovery of a core of material which can be examined to determine the strength, degree of weathering, understanding of any how intact the rock is (RQD) and identify any discontinuities or other planes of weakness.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next thing}} that I {{remember}} was opening {{my eyes and}} perceiving the form of Job, who had now practically recovered from his attack of fever. He {{was standing in the}} ray of light that pierced into the cave from the outer air, shaking out my clothes as a makeshift for brushing them, which he could not do because there was no brush, and then folding them up neatly and laying them on the foot of the stone couch. This done, he got my travelling dressing-case out of the Gladstone bag, and opened it ready for my use. First he stood it on the foot of the couch also, then, being afraid, I suppose, that I should kick it off, he placed it on a leopard skin on the floor, and stood back a step or two to observe the effect. It was not satisfactory, so he shut up the bag, turned it on end, and, having rested it against the foot of the couch, placed the dressing-case on it. Next he looked at the pots full of water, which constituted our <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> [...] "Ah!" [...] I heard him murmur, [...] "no hot water in this beastly place. I suppose these poor creatures only use it to boil each other in," [...] and he sighed deeply.|$|R
6000|$|On {{hearing this}} the archdeacon slammed the door, and retired to his <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus.</b> At {{the present moment}} he was very angry with his wife, but then he was so {{accustomed}} to such anger, and was so well aware that it in truth meant nothing, {{that it did not}} make him unhappy. The archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly had now been man and wife for {{more than a quarter of}} a century, and had never in truth quarrelled. He had the most profound respect for her judgment, and the most implicit reliance on her conduct. She had never yet offended him, or caused him to repent the hour in which he had made her Mrs. Grantly. But she had come to understand that she might use a woman's privilege with her tongue; and she used it,--not altogether to his comfort. On the present occasion he was the more annoyed because he felt that she might be right. [...] "It would be a positive disgrace, and I never would see him again," [...] he said to himself. And yet as he said it, he knew that he would not have the strength of character to carry him through a prolonged quarrel with his son. [...] "I never would see her,--never, never!" [...] he said to himself. [...] "And then such an opening as he might have at his sister's house." ...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{disadvantage}} of the present home and aboard biomass gasifiers, a new design was conducted to improve the current conditions such as low combustion, high tar and dust, low heat value and so on. A suite of gasification was achieved to decrease tar, sulfur and dust during gasification process. The developing system provides a feasible strategy for improving and developing gasifier equipment. The improved gasifier equipment includes gas generator, high temperature pyrolysis apparatus, the first dust filter, the second dust filter, heat-cold exchange <b>apparatus,</b> <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus,</b> motive power apparatus, tar removal apparatus, and sulfur removal apparatus. The harmless combustible gases enter the gas container, and go through a dedicated pipeline, and then the gas was delivered to the house for coking, heating or generating electricity. Up to now, the improved gasifier equipment has been successfully applied to some communities in Qinghai and inner Mongolia of China. Implications of the improved gasifier equipment is improving human health, reducing fuel consumption, deforestation and global climate change. It was found cost-effective and renewable in nature and suitable for both urban and rural areas, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau because of the anoxia.

40|$|Washing of {{biodiesel}} removes contaminants (soap, catalyst, methanol {{and free}} glycerin) from biodiesel, {{even though this}} activity will sometimes cause an emulsion. This research aims to develop new method of washing that can minimize emulsification. The method used is misting water in crude biodiesel by certain nozzle. <b>Washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> has 5 main part i. e. nozzle, washing chamber, circulation pump, valve to set level of debit and piping channel. The {{research has been done}} to study dependency of biodiesel washing on the numbers of nozzles (2, 3 and 4), the distance between nozzle and constrictor plate (2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm and 8 cm) and the level of wash water debit 45. 3 ml/min, 83. 6 ml/min and 150 ml/min. Parameters measured were pH of wash water, emulsion formed, rendemen of biodiesel, quality of biodiesel and energy consumption. Variation of the numbers of nozzles are purposed to have more extensively contact between water and biodiesel. At optimum level of debit, high performance biodiesel washing expeted, with little emulsion can be obtained. The research indicates that the numbers of nozzles, the distance of nozzle and level of water debit are significant variables to determine washing performance. The research showed that washing biodiesel with the numbers of nozzles 4 pc, debit of washing water 83. 6 ml/min and 45. 3 ml/min and distance between nozzle and constrictor plate 8 cm produce 100 % biodiesel for every step washing, with pH of washing water at third washing 7. 1 and emulsion formed 81. 6 ml. Misting water in oil method needs smaller energy than others, i. e. only 4 % of stirrer method and 1. 2 % of bubble method.

60|$|She {{was fully}} rested, and greatly pleased. Lance's arm was quite {{sufficient}} now, and {{she studied the}} Cathedral and its precincts in a superexcellent manner. Mr. Harewood, who had spent almost his whole life under its shadow, and knew the history of almost every stone or quarry of glass, {{was the best of}} lionisers, and gave her much attention when he perceived how intelligent and appreciative she was. He showed her the plan of the old conventual buildings, and she began to unravel the labyrinth through which she had been hurried. The Close and Deanery were modernised, but he valued the quaint old corner where he lived for its genuine age. The old house now divided between him and Mr. Shapcote had been the infirmary; and the long narrow building opposite, between the Bailey and the cloister, had been the lodgings either of lay-brothers or servants. There being few boarders at the Cathedral school, they had always been lodged in the long narrow room, with the second master in a little closet shut off from them. Cherry was favoured with a glance at Lance's little corner, with the old-fashioned black oak bedstead, solid but unsteady table and stool, the equally old press, and the book-case he had made himself with boards begged from his friend the carpenter. A photograph and drawing or two, and a bat, completed the plenishing. She thought it very uncomfortable, but Lance called it his castle; and Mr. Harewood, pointing to the <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus,</b> related that in his day the cock in the Bailey was the only provision for such purposes. The boys were safely locked in at eight every night when the curfew rang, and the Bailey door was shut, there being no other access to the rooms, except by the Cathedral, through the Library, and the private door that led into the passage common to the Harewoods and Shapcotes.|$|R
50|$|Merely {{advancing}} the drill by <b>rotary</b> action (and <b>washing)</b> causes a core to be extracted inside the barrel as shown. However, {{at a depth}} of perhaps 300 m, there must be a way to retrieve the core and take it to the surface. Constantly withdrawing the entire heavy drill pipe is impractical, so methods were developed to pull up the core inside the barrel. If the rock would always be solid granite, and the core would always break at the drill bit, then it would be a simple matter to stop the drilling, and lower a simple grabbing device by a wire and pull up the core. Unfortunately, many applications require an undisturbed core in fractured rock, which calls for elaborate wire-line devices.|$|R

60|$|Away we go again, by muddy roads, {{and through}} the most {{shattered}} and tattered of villages, where {{there is not a}} whole window among all the houses, or a whole garment among all the peasants, or the least appearance of anything to eat, in any of the wretched hucksters' shops. The women wear a bright red bodice laced before and behind, a white skirt, and the Neapolitan head-dress of square folds of linen, primitively meant to carry loads on. The men and children wear anything they can get. The soldiers are as dirty and rapacious as the dogs. The inns are such hobgoblin places, that they are infinitely more attractive and amusing than the best hotels in Paris. Here is one near Valmontone (that is Valmontone the round, walled town on the mount opposite), which is approached by a quagmire almost knee-deep. There is a wild colonnade below, and a dark yard full of empty stables and lofts, and a great long kitchen with a great long bench and a great long form, where a party of travellers, with two priests among them, are crowding round the fire while their supper is cooking. Above stairs, is a rough brick gallery to sit in, with very little windows with very small patches of knotty glass in them, and all the doors that open from it (a dozen or two) off their hinges, and a bare board on tressels for a table, at which thirty people might dine easily, and a fireplace large enough in itself for a breakfast-parlour, where, as the faggots blaze and crackle, they illuminate the ugliest and grimmest of faces, drawn in charcoal on the whitewashed chimney- sides by previous travellers. There is a flaring country lamp on the table; and, hovering about it, scratching her thick black hair continually, a yellow dwarf of a woman, who stands on tiptoe to arrange the hatchet knives, and takes a flying leap to look into the water-jug. The beds in the adjoining rooms are of the liveliest kind. There is not a solitary scrap of looking-glass in the house, and the <b>washing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is identical with the cooking utensils. But the yellow dwarf sets on the table a good flask of excellent wine, holding a quart at least; and produces, among half- a-dozen other dishes, two-thirds of a roasted kid, smoking hot. She is as good-humoured, too, as dirty, which is saying a great deal. So here's long life to her, in the flask of wine, and prosperity to the establishment.|$|R

30|$|The {{separation}} {{performance of}} activated carbons was evaluated {{according to the}} following procedure. At first, the sapphire cell was dismounted from the <b>apparatus,</b> <b>washed</b> with distilled water, dried, and loaded with a certain mass of activated carbon. Subsequently, the cell was installed into the apparatus again and connected to the blind cell, and the whole system was evacuated. Afterward, the top valve of the sapphire cell was closed and the blind cell was charged with the feed gas until the desired pressure was achieved. The air-bath temperature was then regulated to the desired value. When the temperature and {{the pressure of the}} gas mixture in the blind cell were stable at the specified value for a period of time, the stable pressure of the blind cell was recorded as P 1. Thereafter, the top valve of the sapphire cell was opened and the desired amount of feed gas originating from the blind cell was injected into the sapphire cell. When the pressure of the sapphire cell reached the desired value (recorded as P 0), the top valve was closed. Then, the adsorption separation experiment took place in the sapphire cell. After the pressure of the sapphire cell remained constant for a period of time, the separation process was deemed to have ended. The pressure of the residual gas in the blind cell and in the sapphire cell was recorded as P 2 and PE, respectively. The equilibrium gas mixture in the sapphire cell was sampled under constant pressure by pushing the piston using a hand pump, and the corresponding composition was analyzed by HP 7890 gas chromatography.|$|R
