50|$|He joined Norwich City on a free transfer. Norwich {{had been}} {{promoted}} to the English FA Premier League and saw Helveg as a signing who would bring class and experience to the side. His signing was seen {{as something of a}} coup for Norwich, but Helveg struggled to reproduce the form shown in Serie A and on the international scene, and he lost his place in the starting line-up in the opening weeks of the season. After a long absence, partly due to injury, he regained his place in the side in early 2005, this time in central midfield.
