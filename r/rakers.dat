5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill <b>rakers,</b> the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill <b>rakers,</b> targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill <b>rakers.</b> A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill <b>rakers</b> for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
25|$|These {{fish have}} muscular bodies, ossified bones, scales, well {{developed}} gills and central nervous systems, and large hearts and kidneys. Mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine gill <b>rakers,</b> while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser gill <b>rakers.</b> The vertically migratory fish have swimbladders.|$|E
50|$|Adjacent to the cutters {{there is}} {{generally}} a <b>raker.</b> The void {{on either side}} of the <b>raker</b> is known as the gullet. A <b>raker</b> is what does the actual removal of the wood that is being cut. The <b>raker</b> follows the cutters, paring the bottom of the kerf like a chisel or plane. As the <b>raker</b> pares the bottom of the kerf, a strip of wood is lifted upward, and curled forward into the gullet.|$|R

25|$|Like {{other members}} of its order, the oarfish has a small yet highly protrusible oblique mouth with no visible teeth. The body is scaleless and the skin is covered with easily abraded, silvery guanine. In the {{streamer}} fish (Agrostichthys parkeri), the skin is clad with hard tubercles. All species lack gas bladders {{and the number of}} gill <b>rakers</b> is variable.|$|E
25|$|Bathypelagic {{fish are}} black, or {{sometimes}} red, with few photophores. When photophores are used, {{it is usually}} to entice prey or attract a mate. Because food is so scarce, bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits, but grab whatever come close enough. They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping gill <b>rakers</b> which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping.|$|E
25|$|The longfin {{trevally}} is a predatory fish, {{known to}} take a variety of small fishes, cephalopods including squid, and crustaceans such as crabs and mantis shrimp. The species' long gill <b>rakers</b> also help to filter minute organisms from the seawater, adding to the fish's diet. Longfin trevallies reach sexual maturity at 21 to 22cm in length. There has been no research into their spawning patterns, although it is known juveniles inhabit shallow bays and occasionally estuaries.|$|E

25|$|Cyprinids are stomachless {{fish with}} toothless jaws. Even so, food can be {{effectively}} chewed by the gill <b>rakers</b> of the specialized last gill bow. These pharyngeal teeth allow {{the fish to}} make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a bony process of the skull. The pharyngeal teeth are unique to each species and are used by scientists to identify species. Strong pharyngeal teeth allow fish such as the common carp and ide to eat hard baits such as snails and bivalves.|$|E
25|$|The lateral {{line has}} a moderate, regular arch anteriorly, which is roughly equal in length to the {{straight}} posterior section. The straight section has no to 15 scales followed by 40 to 52 small scutes. The breast is devoid of scales ventrally to behind the pelvic fin origin and diagonally {{up to the}} pectoral fin base. Both jaws contain uniform bands of small, weak teeth becoming wider posteriorly and irregular conical outer teeth in adults. It has 21 to 23 gill <b>rakers</b> and 24 vertebrae.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{trophic ecology}} of closely-related species is {{important}} for providing insight on inter-specific competition and resource partitioning. Although catostomids often dom-inate fish assemblages in lotic systems, {{little research has been}} conducted on their ecology. This study was developed to provide information on the trophic ecology of catostomids in several Iowa rivers. Food habits, diet overlap, and gill <b>raker</b> morphology were examined for highfin carpsucker Carpiodes velifer, quillback C. cyprinus, river carpsucker C. carpio, golden redhorse Moxostoma erythrurum, shorthead redhorse M. macrolepidotum, silver redhorseM. anisurum, and northern hogsucker Hypentelium nigricans sampled from four Iowa rivers (2009). Diet overlap among all species was calculated with Moristas index (C). Food habit niche width was quantified with Levins index (B) and similarity in gill <b>raker</b> morphology was compared with analysis of covariance. Values from Moristas index suggested significant overlap in the diets of highfin carpsucker and river carpsucker (C = 0. 81), quill-back and river carpsucker (C = 0. 66), and shorthead redhorse and silver redhorse (C = 0. 67). Levins index indicated that golden redhorse (B = 0. 32), quillback (B = 0. 53), and river carpsucker (B = 0. 41) had the most generalized feeding strategies as their food niche widths were substantially wider than the other species. Gill <b>raker</b> length and spacing were positively correlated with the standard length of the fish for all species (gill <b>raker</b> length: r 2 = 0. 67 – 0. 88, P £ 0. 01; gill <b>raker</b> spacing: r 2 = 0. 63 – 0. 73, P £ 0. 01). Slopes of regression of gill <b>raker</b> length and spacing to standard lengths were significantly (P £ 0. 05) different among species, indicating that rates of change in gill <b>raker</b> morphology with body length varied among species. Differences in gill <b>raker</b> morphology likely allow catostomids to partition resources and reduce compet-itive interactions...|$|R

25|$|Woodward {{initially}} assigned Leedsichthys to the Acipenseroidea, {{considering it}} {{related to the}} sturgeon, having the large gill <b>rakers</b> and branching finrays in common. In 1905, he changed this to the Pachycormidae. The Pachycormidae have a somewhat uncertain position. Often they are considered very basal Teleostei — if so, Leedsichthys would be the largest known teleost — others see them {{as members of a}} Pachycormiformes forming the sister group of the Teleostei, and sometimes they are seen as even more basal Amiiformes. In the latter case the extant bowfin, Amia calva, would be the closest living relative of Leedsichthys.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill <b>rakers</b> that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
25|$|The toothless {{mouth is}} small and terminal, ending in a pointed snout. As in related {{families}} (e.g. Argentinidae), an epibranchial or crumenal organ is present behind the fourth gill arch.

The living body of most species is a dark brown, covered in large, silvery imbricate scales, but these are absent in Dolichopteryx, leaving the body itself a transparent white. In all species, a variable number of dark melanophores colour the muzzle, ventral surface, and midline.|$|E

25|$|The {{ventral fin}} {{consists}} of 1 spine and 5 soft rays, while the caudal fin is strongly forked. The species lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, with 50 to 60 scales in this section, while the straight section contains 0 to 4 scales and 30 to 40 strong scutes. The pattern of breast scales is variable, ranging from fully scaled to naked ventrally. The species has moderately well developed adipose eyelids, while its dentition {{consists of an}} outer row of widely spaced canines and an inner band of villiform teeth in the upper jaw and a row of widely spaced conical teeth on the lower jaw.

25|$|Threespine {{sticklebacks}} (Gasterosteus spp.) in post-glacial {{lakes in}} western Canada have {{contributed significantly to}} recent research of character displacement. Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of gill <b>rakers,</b> {{all of which is}} related to divergence in their diet. Hybrids between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of selection for benthic and limnetic morphologies, which can also lead to sympatric speciation.|$|E

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: This paper {{investigates the}} {{capacity}} of full triangle (fixed) <b>raker</b> shores using New Zealand Timber, through analytical analyses and experimental tests. Full triangle (fixed) <b>raker</b> shores, or simply <b>raker</b> shores, are a temporary structure used to support collapsed or damaged buildings. They are used extensively by Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams {{around the world to}} allow the safe location and rescue of victims of collapsed or damaged buildings following an earthquake event. The shores used by New Zealand USAR are similar to those used in the United States; however they are made from Radiata Pine which has different mechanical properties than the timber used in the U. S. Hence, the need to verify the shores constructed in New Zealand still provide the required design strength. The analytical verification suggests that <b>raker</b> shores are unsafe, according to the New Zealand Timber Structures Standard NZS 3603 : 1993. However, the experimental results on full-scale specimens indicate that the performance of the <b>raker</b> shores satisfies the required demands, with a safety factor of 2 with regard to the design load, and a ductile type of failure.
