40|$|Family Law within Australia has {{undergone}} extensive legislative and operational changes since its inception. It {{is an area}} of law that impacts upon a number of stakeholders such as children, parents, law enforcement agencies, the Government and judicial officers. The research took a small facet of the operation of the Family Law Act 1975, namely the enforcement of parenting orders by police services. The focus of the research was to unfold the process and difficulties encountered by police services when executing a recovery order issued by the Courts under s. 67 of the Family Law Act 1975. It further explored police perspective, training and organisational service delivery, in carrying out their duties. Two qualitative methodological approaches were used in this research. The main approach used was Grounded Theory. Narrative Inquiry was also incorporated into the research. The objective of Narrative Inquiry is to create social context from story telling. Participants were asked to describe their experiences when executing <b>recovery</b> <b>orders.</b> Interviews were undertaken with members from the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who have had experience with the execution of <b>recovery</b> <b>orders.</b> These participants were also asked to construct the process when a recovery order is executed and to describe the atmosphere. In addition, journaling and observations were used. These observations took place in the Family Court and Federal Magistrates&# 039; Court in Victoria. The findings and relevant literature indicated that police disliked becoming involved in executing <b>recovery</b> <b>orders.</b> The Police perceived family law in general not to be a central area of policing. These findings parallel earlier findings from an Australian Parliamentary report in 1992. Furthermore, the findings indicated that little organisational commitment was placed on the function of enforcing <b>recovery</b> <b>orders.</b> This was indicated by the limited and inconsistent resources provided by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to fulfil their obligations, and the lack of training offered to police members. The findings indicated that the Police would take initial steps prior to executing the order. They would contact the applicant parent to assist with inquiries to locate a child, assess variables such as the potential for violence and arrange with the applicant parent where the child would be delivered. In addition, even though the findings outlined that <b>recovery</b> <b>orders</b> were fairly non-complex to execute, at times there would be difficulties in locating a child and finalising arrangements for a child to be returned to a parent. The findings also indicated that there was no clear practice as to which section of the Victoria Police would execute a recovery order if requested by the AFP. Whilst the findings need to be considered carefully in light of the small sample group, it did indicate that there are some difficulties with the process and value placed by police services within Australia on the execution of <b>recovery</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|E

30|$|Figure  8 {{shows the}} oil {{recovery}} variation in reservoirs of different types. The oil <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> is homogeneous reservoir > compound-rhythm reservoir > reverse-rhythm reservoir > positive-rhythm reservoir. The oil recoveries in compound-rhythm and reverse-rhythm reservoirs are close, but {{higher than that}} in positive-rhythm reservoir. Oil recoveries {{at the end of}} steam stimulation processes in the five reservoirs are about 19 %, indicating that reservoir rhythm has little impact on steam stimulation. The ultimate oil recovery in homogeneous reservoir after hot-water flooding is about 38.19 %, however, those in the other reservoirs positive-rhythm, reverse-rhythm, compound-rhythm (Ι) and compound-rhythm (II) are 32.61 %, 36.02 %, 36.66 % and 36.10 %, respectively. The results show that heavy oil recovery can be further improved by hot-water flooding after steam stimulation. The development effect in positive-rhythm reservoir is relatively poor. But this technique is suitable for reverse-rhythm and compound-rhythm reservoirs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTraining {{in sports}} is a {{practical}} activity that requires {{a certain level of}} effort. Energy has various organi sources in accordance with the activities performed. Under current conditions, both the training and competitions pose significant demands. The nutritional resources that release energy are used up during effort. One of the priorities in training is to ensure the complete recovery of the tired body. Recovery is a condition for success in sports achievements. Some means of recovery are widely known and are frequently used by athletes. Other means are newer, more refined and less used, but they may prove to be necessary and useful in order to speed up recovery. Recovery targets anatomical and physiological mechanisms and it is managed by the neurological and endocrine systems. Means for <b>recovery,</b> <b>ordered</b> by specificity, are managed by physicians while non-specific means are managed by coaches. Most athletes prefer traditional means for recovery...|$|R

40|$|A speedy {{recovery}} of damaged digitized photographs based on orientation driven multi structure morphology is proposed. The <b>recovery</b> <b>order</b> {{plays an important}} factor for human visualization and hence it is guided by the orientation of edges at the surrounding known regions of the missing domain. The image is edge detected by thresholding the image gradient along the eight possible orientations. These eight edge images are represented as eight edge planes. The edge-plane-sliced information is used twice manifold for reconstructing the regions within the missing part, {{as well as for}} guiding the integration that follows. The damaged regions are morphologically eroded using the structuring elements of corresponding orientations dictated by the edge-planes. The resultant filled image is obtained using local isotopic driven integration. The novelty of our approach is to explicitly specify the direction of filling herby ensuring ease in convergence in different orientations and then streamlining the process to guarantee complete and natural look. By implementing region-filling through morphological erosion, several pixels instead of one can be restored at every inpainting step, making the method faster than many traditional texture synthesis inpainting algorithms and successfully recovers images with better Peak Signal to Noise ratios even for massive damages...|$|R
40|$|The Illinois Crime Victim's Rights Amendment, {{added to}} the Illinois Constitution by the {{legislature}} and the voters in 1992, includes a 'right to restitution'. The amendment spurred some new legislation, now within the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act.

The paper first examines the Illinois constitutional right to restitution and the three separate acts recognizing possible monetary remedies for crime victims during criminal cases. Upon concluding that the constitutional right to restitution has not been adequately implemented by the legislature or the courts, the paper looks to other American state approaches to crime victim recoveries. For Illinois it proposes that the three acts be combined into a single statutory scheme, organized by the stages in a criminal case.
