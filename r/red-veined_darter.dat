5|$|<b>Red-veined</b> <b>Darter</b> â€“ {{following}} influxes {{in previous}} years, this species, like Yellow-winged Darter, has formed temporary breeding colonies. However, since the mid-1990s, {{the number of}} these colonies has increased and many have continued to be present from year-to-year, so this species is now better regarded as a successful colonist.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a <b>red-veined</b> <b>darter</b> appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E

50|$|The <b>red-veined</b> <b>darter</b> or nomad (Sympetrum fonscolombii) is a {{dragonfly}} of {{the genus}} Sympetrum. It is a widespread and common species found from the south {{to the north of}} Africa, southern Europe and eastwards to the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and the Indian Ocean Islands. It is a common species in southern Europe and from the 1990s onwards has increasingly been found in northwest Europe, including Britain and Ireland. Its name is sometimes spelt fonscolombei instead of fonscolombii but Askew (2004) gives the latter as the correct spelling. There is genetic and behavioural evidence that S. fonscolombii is not closely related to {{the other members of the}} Sympetrum genus and will at some time in the future be removed from this genus.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has long}} been a pool on the {{northern}} part of the site and this has attracted some birds as it is currently one of the few standing open waters in East Lothian. Waterbirds regularly seen here include mute swan*, mallard*, common teal, wigeon, tufted duck, little grebe*, moorhen* and coot* (* confirmed breeding since 2008 [...] ). Gadwall also bred in 2012 with two broods seen in 2014. Regular counts are undertaken for BTO Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) monitoring. [...] Other characteristic birds of the site include grey partridge*, common kestrel, common buzzard, stock dove, skylark*, common grasshopper warbler, sedge warbler*, tree sparrow, reed bunting* and yellowhammer*, with altogether 29 species confirmed to breed in the period 2008-2013, with 17 [...] "probable" [...] breeders and a further 9 [...] "possible" [...] breeders (using BTO Atlas classifications [...] ). Scarcer species recorded include little egret, northern shoveler, greater scaup, smew (drake plus 3 redheads, Feb 2012), marsh harrier (occasional extended presence), common quail, wood sandpiper, spotted redshank, black-tailed godwit, short-eared owl and barn owl. There is rich insect fauna too with nine species of dragonfly and damselfly having been recorded including <b>red-veined</b> <b>darter</b> and there is a colony of grayling and narrow-bordered five-spot burnet moth, which is currently on the edge of its UK range in this part of Scotland (photo, right).|$|E
