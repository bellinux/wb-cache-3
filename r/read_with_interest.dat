5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were <b>read</b> <b>with</b> <b>interest</b> by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E
25|$|Part VII, Cost-Pius Contracts, is {{analytical}} and suggestive, and contains that {{which will be}} regarded {{by many as the}} most valuable material in the volume.

In chapter 33, likewise, are found his personal opinions regarding the proper terms of cancellation of such contracts. These chapters are most timely and will be <b>read</b> <b>with</b> <b>interest</b> by professional accountants and contractors.|$|E
25|$|His {{impressions}} of the Mormons came when Utah was seen by many of his readers back home as rebellious and dangerous as those states in the Confederacy, with which the Union was then involved in the American Civil War. Ludlow encountered frequent snide comments about {{the disintegration of the}} Union, with some Mormons under the impression that with the flood of immigrants to Utah fleeing the draft, and with the decimation of the male population in war time making polygamy seem more practical, the Mormon state would come out of the war stronger than either side. Ludlow’s opinions were <b>read</b> <b>with</b> <b>interest</b> back East, and would constitute an appendix to the book he would later write about his travels.|$|E

25|$|Many of Mircea Eliade's {{literary}} works, {{in particular}} his earliest ones, are noted for their eroticism and {{their focus on}} subjective experience. Modernist in style, they have drawn comparisons to the contemporary writings of Mihail Sebastian, I. Valerian, and Ion Biberi. Alongside Honoré de Balzac and Giovanni Papini, his literary passions included Aldous Huxley and Miguel de Unamuno, as well as André Gide. Eliade also <b>read</b> <b>with</b> <b>interest</b> the prose of Romain Rolland, Henrik Ibsen, and the Enlightenment thinkers Voltaire and Denis Diderot. As a youth, he read the works of Romanian authors such as Liviu Rebreanu and Panait Istrati; initially, he was also interested in Ionel Teodoreanu's prose works, but later rejected them and criticized their author.|$|E
25|$|Released in 1928, Bhupen {{resumed his}} usual multifarious role of {{maintaining}} contacts with various Jugantar leaders from Surya Sen in Chittagong to Bhagat Singh in Punjab (who {{had been in}} constant touch with Bhupen since 1923), editing the party organ Swadhinata, making bombs, collecting arms and distributing them, looking after the volunteer movement. Busy sheltering the absconding revolutionaries of the Chittagong Armoury Raid, Bhupen was arrested again in 1930, {{for a period of}} eight years. During 1938-41 and 1946-51 he edited the weekly Forward : his editorials were <b>read</b> <b>with</b> <b>interest</b> by patriots of all political trends.

Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as number crunching tools.|$|E
