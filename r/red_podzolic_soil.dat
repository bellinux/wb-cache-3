Uptake of K„ appeared insignificant after exchangeable K, as measured on the bulk soil, had been depleted by about 607 o, and its contribution to total plant uptake thereafter was independent of species. For setaria and maize, plant K concentrations at this time were above the critical level, so that K represents a potassium resource that can be exploited during normal growth of an appropriate species. Uptake of K from the krasnozem was relatively small. The <b>red</b> <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> yielded much more K than a similar soil in earlier experiments.

Realizaram-se também, testes de avaliação da qualidade fisiológica das sementes de amendoim, os quais foram constituídos pelo teste-padrão de germinação após 20, 40 e 80 horas de permanência das sementes na câmara de envelhecimento precoce, que estava regulada para funcionar a 42 °± 3 °C e 95 % de umidade relativa. No campo observou-se predominância de trevo (Oxalis sp), picão-branco (Galinsoga parviflora Cav.) e tiririca (Cyperus rotundus L.). Trifuralin, fluorodifen e pendimenthalin fo-ram os herbicidas da maior eficiência no controle do trevo, enquanto para tiririca o tratamento com nitralin não diferiu da testemunha capinada, e para o picão-branco, o tratamento com pendimethalin controlou totalmente esta planta daninha. Para a produção de sementes de amendoim, não houve diferenças entre os tratamentos. A produção de casca e a produção de amendoim com casca, o tratamento com fluorodifen diferiu apenas da testemunha sem capina, suplantando-a. A ocorrência de patógenos nas sementes da testemunha sem capina, e o herbicida nitralin prejudicaram a germinação das sementes. O tratamento das sementes de amendoim na câmara de envelhecimento precoce, pelo período de 20 horas, promoveu nas sement es do tratamento testemunha sem capina e do tratamento com trifl uralin, deteriorização precoce.

Five years after continuation of treatment application, soil samples were taken from top soils (0 - 20 cm) and sub soils (20 - 40 cm) at monthly intervals for 10 months and analyzed for exchangeable potassium and magnesium (1 M ammonium acetate extraction at pH 7. 0) and water soluble potassium and magnesium (1 : 10 soil/water ratio).

The first soil type is the most base-depleted soil and has a higher clay content than the second one. Despite the initial differences in clay and cations contents between the forest sites the total soil carbon content at 0 - 30 cm in both forest were circa 3. 7 kg C/m 2. After pasture installation soil bulk density were higher in the first 0 - 5 cm soil layer, mainly in one chronosequence but small changes were detected in deeper soil layers. Forest conversion to pasture caused appreciable increases in soil pH and exchangeable cation content, at least until nine years after pasture installation. pH levels were greater in the first chronosequence, with highest values (6. 8 to 7. 6) found in 3 and 5 years old pastures respectively. In the most base-depleted soil Ca content increased from 0. 07 kg/m 2 in the forest sites to 0. 25 kg/m 2 in the 5 year old pasture. After normalization by clay content total soil carbon contents to 30 cm in the 20 year old pastures were 17 to 20 % higher than in the original forest sites. Calculations of carbon derived from forest (Cdf) and from pasture (Cdp) using soil delta 13 C values showed that Cdf decrease sharply in the first 9 years after pasture establishment in both chronosequences and reached stable values of 2. 12 kg C/m 2 and 2. 02 kg C/m 2 in sequences 1 and 2, respectively [...] .

De modo geral, pode-se dizer que: (a) o lote com livre crescimento evapotranspirou 97 % do total de chuva e não contribuiu efetivamente com os reservatórios subterrâneos; (b) o recepado evapotranspirou 94 % do total de chuva e teve uma drenagem profunda efetiva de 55 mm; (c) o 'Catuaí' evapotranspirou 88 % do total de chuva e teve uma drenagem profunda efetiva de 152, 6 mm.

The minimum and maximum storage observed were, respectively, 500 and 620 mm for 'Catuaí', 460 and 600 mm for the cut back field, and 390 and 590 mm for the field with normal growth. In general we can say that: (a) the normal growth field used about 97 % of the total rainfall as evapotranspiration and did not have an effective deep drainage; (b) the evapotranspiration of the cut back field was about 94 % of the total rainfall with an effective deep drainage of 55 mm; (c) the 'Catuaí' field evapotranspired about 88 % of the total rainfall and contributed effectively with 152. 6 mm to the deep drainage...|$|R
50|$|The olivine basalt caps create red/brown <b>soils,</b> {{known as}} <b>red</b> <b>podzolics</b> or krasnozems. They {{have been exposed}} to a {{considerable}} degree of chemical weathering, with a higher iron-oxide concentration than with podzols, hence the reddish colour. Vegetation on these basalt based soils are associated with rainforest, moist eucalyptus forest and the tourist attraction gardens at Mount Wilson and the Blue Mountains Botanic Garden.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{research}} are mixed forests of spruce and fir {{in the area of}} NP Kopaonik, which belong to the community of spruce and fir - Abieti-Piceetum abietis Mišić et Popović, 1978. The basis {{for the study of the}} structural development and production potential of these forests are data from 12 sample plots, with the average size of 0. 18 ha. In terms of coenoecological affiliation all the sample plots belong to the group of ecological units - forests of spruce and fir (Abieti-Piceetum abietis, Mišić et Popović, 1978) on acid brown and brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soils,</b> which are differentiated into 5 ecological units: Abieti-Piceetum abietis oxalidetosum on brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> Abieti-Piceetum abietis oxalidetosum on acid brown soil, Abieti-Piceetum abietis vaccinietosum on brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil,</b> Abieti-Piceetum abietis typicum on brown <b>podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> and Abieti-Piceetum abietis Dr. ymetosum on brown pozolic soil. In structural terms, these forests are characterized by very diverse structural forms, ranging from the structure of even-aged stands to typical multi-storey, unevenaged-aged stands. The form of cumulative curves of tree distribution is in most cases determined by spruce as the dominant species. At the same time, thin and medium-thick trees dominate, while the presence of stems with large dimensions is minimal. The average volume of these forestse is 777 m 3 •ha- 1, with a mixture ratio of 0. 7 : 0. 3 in favor of spruce. The average value of the current volume increment is 14 m 3 •ha- 1, with a 68 % share of spruce and 32 % of fir. The percentage of increment ranges from 1. 6 % to 2. 5 % in all sample plots and is somewhat higher for fir. The site potential, stand characteristics and relations among the tree species have resulted in structural complexity, high productivity and ecological stability of these forests. Therefore, future forest management should avoid radical measures and procedures that would violate the established relationships and dynamic processes.

40|$|Applicability of the carbon-dating {{method of}} {{analysis}} to studies in Soil Science was investigated. Factors affecting {{the accuracy of the}} method, e. g. precision, isotopic fractionation, bomb produced C 14, 'Suess effect', and 'de Vries effect', were found to either cause insignificant errors, or errors for which corrections could easily be made. Mean residence times (m. r. t's) of humus from the Ap horizon of five Saskatchewan soils ranged fram 250 years for a Gray-Wooded <b>Podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> to 1000 years for the Black Chernozemic soils. The humus of the Dark Brown Chernozemic soils from Lethbridge, Alberta, was older. Humic fractions from a Chernozemic and a <b>Podzolic</b> <b>soil</b> were dated and chemically characterized. The fractions differed significantly in their m. r. t's and optical properties. The 'calcium' humates and non-hydrolysable humic acids of the Chernozem dated 1400 years while the humic acids hydrolysate was, in comparison, extremely young (25 years). There were indications that a close relationship between optical properties and m. r. t. exists. Except for a small fraction (the humic acids hydrolysate) the major portion of soil humus is inert to decomposition. Calculations employing the m. r. t. of the fractions of a Chernozem showed that the humic acids hydrolysate accounts for 80 per cent of the nitrogen released per annum. Data for the soils and fractions showed the humus of <b>Podzolic</b> <b>soils</b> to be much more labile than that of Chernozems, and also served to emphasize the importance of different types of organo-mineral bonds in the stabilization of humus. It is concluded that the carbon-dating technique, supported by other chemical methods of analysis, is a useful research procedure for resolving problems in soil organic matter investigations...|$|R
