40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A growth {{model is}} {{developed}} for coho salmon {{which accounts for}} temperatures and feeding rates typically encountered in fish hatchery operation. Feeding rates utilized by the model <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>to</b> maximum utilizable rations. The model is derived from an empirical equation for maximum growth rate, and a theoretical equation for net energy utilization. The resultant equation is modified to improve fit at higher feeding levels. Calibration is accomplished with experimentally obtained data. The model is similar to one developed by G. D. Stauffer, but represents an improvement because points on the growth curve between maintenance and maximum ration can be fitted even if maintenance and maximum requirements are obtained independently. An optimization method is then developed using this growth model that determines, for a given temperature regime, a feeding schedule that minimizes total food consumption for a given rearing period. The method is then extended to determine simultaneously feeding schedules and temperature regimes that minimize total food consumption...|$|R

A key to automated computer aided work is location and situation awareness. This allows the system to operate independently from direct user input, minimizing {{the impact on the}} original process. For demonstration purposes a large area tracking system using existing RFID technology and infrastructure is developed and evaluated. As a first possible application we embed the system into an aircraft cabin. The localization procedure is based on the coordinates of the RFID transponders detected by the RFID reader, as well as the orientation information measured by a gyroscope. Position estimation is accomplished through an iterative algorithm, optimizing the position of the antenna’s readability field with respect to the currently visible tags. The average error is below half a meter. Possible use cases <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> assistance <b>to</b> way finding in commercial shops or underground parking lots. ...|$|R

An efficient {{maintenance and}} rehabilitation policy {{is essential for}} a safe, comfortable and cost-effective transportation system. But, decisions to maintain existing road facilities involve {{a number of possible}} options in activities <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitation or reconstruction, in choices for allocation of resources throughout a highway network, and to decide between investments versus non-investment option. Moreover, any economic analysis should not only consider the cost factor but also be designed to give maximum coverage of benefits like changes in road maintenance costs, changes in accident rates, increased travel or demand etc. which makes development of a maintenance and rehabilitation policy for roads difficult. In the present study it was aimed to formulate a multi-objective optimization model considering all necessary as well as sufficient factors responsible in ‘maintenance and rehabilitation activities’ of highway facilities so as to minimize the total cost and increase the total return in terms of benefits from improved road condition subject to the practical limitations faced by concerned agency and user due to deterioration in road condition.

In all organisms that contain selenocysteine, both the synthesis of selenocysteine and its incorporation into a selenoprotein requires an elaborate synthetic and translational apparatus, which does not resemble the canonical enzymatic system employed for the 20 standard amino acids. In humans, three synthetic enzymes, a specialized elongation factor, an accessory protein factor, two catabolic enzymes, a tRNA, and a stem-loop structure in the selenoprotein mRNA are critical for ensuring that only selenocysteine is attached to selenocysteine tRNA and that only selenocysteine is inserted into the nascent polypeptide in response to a context-dependent UGA codon. The abnormal selenium homeostasis and mutations in selenoprotein genes have been causatively linked to a variety of human diseases, which, in turn, sparked a renewed interest in utilizing selenium as the dietary supplement to either prevent or remedy pathologic conditions. In contrast, the importance of the components of the selenocysteine-synthetic machinery for human health is less clear. Emerging evidence suggests that enzymes responsible for selenocysteine formation and decoding the selenocysteine UGA codon, which by extension are critical for synthesis of the entire selenoproteome, are essential for the development and health of the human organism...|$|R

A great variety of process types, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> production <b>to</b> <b>maintenance</b> process, has <b>to</b> be covered in order to ensure a smooth and economically feasible IPS 2 operation. Therefore, an approach for the modelling and automation of IPS 2 delivery processes is of specific interest.

The presented approach allows for an easy adaption of the product share configuration. To achieve this goal, a workflow management system represents the backbone of all customer provider relationships that distributes the tasks and responsibilities to the IPS 2 network partners according to the IPS 2 business model. For machine-oriented service shares the workflow management system interacts with an implemented Java-based software agent system by means of web services.

The objective {{of this research is}} to review the literature on economic evaluation of treatment of opiate dependence (including detoxification, maintenance and psychosocial support). A literature review was performed on several electronic databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, NHS Economic Evaluation Library Database (via Cochrane Library), Web of Science, Social Science Citations Index, EMBASE and PsycINFO. A sensitive approach was used in order to maximize the number of articles retrieved; no language or publication year limitations were applied to the searches. A combination of subject heading term searches and natural word searches were used. The Drummond checklist was applied to assess the quality of economic evaluations. A total of 259 articles were considered relevant, with eight review studies identified. The treatment spectrum <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> detoxification <b>to</b> <b>maintenance</b> treatments involving the use of agonist and/or antagonist treatments. The evidence suggests that, although the quality of economic evaluations is reasonably good, there is a dearth of knowledge about the cost effectiveness of treatments for opiate dependence. The majority of the literature reporting the results of cost-effectiveness analyses used surrogate outcome measures and adopted a narrow treatment provider perspective. Studies that have conducted cost-benefit analyses, in spite of methodological divergences, generally adopted a societal perspective and consistently demonstrated positive economic returns from opiate treatment. A paucity of research examined the extent to which psychosocial or behavioural interventions support or replace conventional pharmacological approaches. Economic evaluation provides a useful framework to assist policy makers in allocating resources across competing needs. Opiate dependence is a considerable burden on society 2 ̆ 7 s resources, and treatment provides a cost-beneficial solution to address these consequences.

40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{silencing}} {{affects a}} broad range of regulatory processes in all eukaryotes <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> chromatin structure <b>maintenance</b> <b>to</b> transcriptional and translational regulation and longevity of the mRNAs. Particularly in plants, it functions as the major defense mechanism against viruses. To counter-act this defense, plant viruses produce suppressors of RNA silencing (Viral suppressors of RNA silencing, VSRSs), which are essential for viruses to invade their specific host plants. Interactions of these VSRSs with the hosts’ silencing pathways, and their direct and indirect interference with different cellular regulatory networks constitute one of the main lines of the molecular virus-host interactions. Here we have used a microarray approach to study the effects of the Potato virus X Potexvirus (PVX) -specific P 25 VSRS protein on the transcript profile of tobacco plants, when expressed as a transgene in these plants. Results The expression of the PVX-specific P 25 silencing suppressor in transgenic tobacco plants caused significant up-regulation of 1350 transcripts, but down-regulation of only five transcripts in the leaves, and up- and down-regulation of 51 and 13 transcripts, respectively, in the flowers of these plants, as compared to the wild type control plants. Most of the changes occurred in the transcripts related to biotic and abiotic stresses, transcription regulation, signaling, metabolic pathways and cell wall modifications, and many of them appeared to be induced through up-regulation of the signaling pathways regulated by ethylene, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Correlations of these alterations with the protein profile and related biological functions were analyzed. Surprisingly, they did not cause significant alterations in the protein profile, and caused only very mild alteration in the phenotype of the P 25 -expressing transgenic plants. Conclusion Expression of the PVX-specific P 25 VSRS protein causes major alterations in the transcriptome of the leaves of transgenic tobacco plants, but very little of any effects in the young flowers of the same plants. The fairly stable protein profile in the leaves and lack of any major changes in the plant phenotype indicate that the complicated interplay and interactions between different regulatory levels are able to maintain homeostasis in the plants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Elk (Cervus elaphus spp) {{are widely}} used as a {{terminal}} sire in the New Zealand deer industry because elk red deer crosses are heavier at 12 months of age than pure-bred red deer (Cervus elaphus) and therefore better fit market demands. However, {{it is unclear whether}} nutritional requirements differ between genotypes. A series of experiments compared young (4 - 12 months) red deer and red deer-elk cross (hybrids) in various aspects of their nutrition. Single genotype groups (10 - 15) of red deer and hybrid weaner stags were offered one of four pasture allowances (2 to 12 kg DM/head/day) on a rotationally grazed mixed ryegrass - white clover pasture system for 9 weeks in winter (June-July), spring (October-December) and summer (February - March). Stags were weighed and given a new allocation of pasture weekly. Pre-grazing pasture mass <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 800 kg DM/ha for low pasture allowances to 4500 kg DM/ha for higher allowances. Winter live-weight gain was low (40 - 80 g/day), relatively unaffected by pasture allowance and similar for both genotypes. In spring however, hybrids gained live-weight on average 100 g/day more than red deer across all pasture allowances and the response to additional pasture allowance was large (110 g/day at 2 kg DM/head/day to 300 g/day at 9. 5 kg DM/head/day). At the highest pasture allowance, hybrids grew faster (350 g/day) than red deer (250 g/day), although red deer were able to achieve this live-weight gain when offered less pasture (4 vs 12 kg DM/head/day, respectively). Summer live-weight gain was lower for both genotypes and responded less to increases in pasture allowance than during spring. A second experiment compared the live-weight gain of both genotypes at ad lib feeding in an indoor environment where intake could be accurately measured. A group of red deer (n = 15) and a group of hybrid (n = 15) weaner stags were housed indoors during winter (3 June - 27 August) and spring (16 October - 16 December) and fed a pelleted grain based ration ad lib. Mean daily intake for each group (kg DM/head/day) was calculated as the difference between feed offered and feed refused. Hybrids had a significantly higher (P< 0. 05) absolute DM intake compared with red deer in both seasons, although when expressed on a metabolic body weight basis, {{there was no difference between}} genotypes irrespective of season. Live-weight gain during winter did not differ significantly between genotypes regardless of whether it was expressed on an absolute or metabolic weight basis. Spring live-weight gain, expressed both on an absolute and metabolic live-weight basis, was significantly higher for hybrids compared with red deer (P< 0. 05). Red deer and hybrids increased their feed intake from winter to spring by 20 % and 24 % respectively on a metabolic body weight basis. Although the difference between genotypes in their seasonal increase in intake was relatively small there was a large difference in their pattern of live-weight gain. Red deer exhibited a 34 % and hybrids a 76 % seasonal increase in live-weight gain expressed on a metabolic live-weight basis from winter to spring. These results indicate the greater rate of live-weight gain displayed by hybrids compared with red deer was not associated with a greater ad lib intake (expressed on a metabolic body weight basis) and the seasonal increase in live-weight gain is greater for hybrids than for red deer. A further experiment estimated the energy requirement for maintenance of both genotypes. Five deer of each genotype were housed in separate pens (3. 5 m²) during winter (3 June - 27 August) and spring (16 October - 16 December) and randomly assigned to one of 5 feeding levels (0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8, or 0. 9 times estimated ad lib intake of l. 5 and l. 7 kg DM/head/day during the winter and 3. 0 and 3. 3 kg DM/head/day during the spring for red deer and hybrids, respectively. Maintenance requirement was determined by regression analysis of live-weight gain on ME intake. Although there was no seasonal effect on the live weight gain response to intake there was a significant genotype effect. To maintain live weight during either season, hybrids required a higher ME intake (0. 52 MJ ME/W 0. 75 /day compared with red deer 0. 41 MJ ME/W 0. 75 /day). The rate of increase in live weight gain to increasing intake declined as intake increased and more so for red deer than hybrids. The final experiment in the series involved individually housed deer and aimed to more precisely determine differences in maintenance requirement and examine the difference in composition of gain between genotypes. In addition, in vivo apparent DM digestibility was measured in both genotypes. Red deer (n= 7) and hybrid weaner stags (n= 7) were housed in individual pens for a period of 8 weeks in both winter (July - August) and spring (November - December) and offered one of 7 feeding levels which <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>to</b> ad lib. During each 8 week experimental period, live weight gain, apparent digestibility and feed intake were measured. Immediately prior to, and at the conclusion of each 8 week period body composition was estimated using computer-assisted topography (CT scan). In winter, there was no significant difference in the live weight gain response to intake although red deer tended to have a higher (44 vs 55 MJ/kg) requirement for gain than hybrids. In spring, red deer had a lower requirement for maintenance (0. 35 vs 0. 47 MJ ME/W 0. 75 /day) but a greater requirement for live weight gain (64 vs 35 MJ/kg) than hybrids. In spring, mean ad lib intake was about 30 % higher than in winter and was greater for hybrids than for red deer. Energy retention in whole body (kJ/W 0. 75 /day) did not differ between genotypes in either winter or spring but both the energy requirement for zero energy balance (0. 59 vs 0. 48 MJ ME/W 0. 75 /day) and the efficiency of utilisation (0. 37 vs 0. 24) was greater in spring than in winter. The disparity between live weight gain and whole body weight gain may have been due to differences in gut fill. There was no significant difference between genotypes in relative growth coefficients for lean, bone or adipose tissue in whole body. However hybrids tended to have a higher winter and lower spring growth coefficient for fat compared with red deer. Growth coefficients for adipose, lean and bone, respectively were 0. 983, 1. 063 and 1. 026 for winter and 1. 02, 0. 708 and 1. 727 for spring. At the same whole body weight, deer in October had less adipose tissue than in August. It is unclear whether this represents a strategy for rapid spring growth or is an artefact of experimental protocol. Apparent dry matter digestibility (DMD) did not differ between genotypes but was higher by between 7 and 15 percentage units in winter compared with spring. Unexpectedly, digestibility was positively correlated with intake. Digestibility increased by 2. 6 percentage units for every 10 g DM/W 0. 75 /day increase in either season in one group and 4. 1 and 2. 1 percentage units for deer in winter and spring respectively in another group. Errors in faecal collection were discounted as causes of the unexpected result...|$|R

Taking this disease as an example for pathogenesis due to altered macroautophagy, we discuss here how macroautophagy supports innate and adaptive immunity. This support <b>ranges</b> <b>from</b> <b>maintenance</b> of components of the immune system, antigen processing for presentation to the immune system, to education of the immune system in order to distinguish self from dangerous non-self. A better understanding of these mechanisms should allow us not only to develop therapeutical strategies for CD but also to utilize macroautophagy for enhanced immunity against pathogens and tumors...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear receptors are ligand {{activated}} transcription factors, where upon binding {{with small}} molecule ligands, these proteins {{are involved in}} the regulation of gene expression. To date there are approximately 48 human nuclear receptors known, involved in multiple biological and cellular processes, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> differentiation <b>to</b> <b>maintenance</b> of homeostasis. Due to their critical role in transcriptional regulation, these receptors are implicated in several diseases. Currently, 13 % of prescribed drugs in the market are NR ligands for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis. In addition to drug discovery, the mechanism of function, mobility and trafficking of these receptors is poorly understood. Gaining insight into the relationship between the function and /or dysfunction of these receptors and their mobility will aid in {{a better understanding of the}} role of these receptors. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has revolutionized molecular biology by providing the ability to monitor protein function and structure via fluorescence. The fluorescence contribution from this biological marker is the chromophore, formed from the polypeptide backbone of three amino acid residues, buried inside 11 -stranded â-barrel protein. Synthesis of GFP derivatives of is based on the structure of the arylmethyleneimidazolidinone (AMI), creating a molecule that is only weakly fluorescent. Characterizing these AMI derivatives for other proteins can provide a powerful visualization tool for analysis of protein function and structure. This development could provide a very powerful method for protein analysis in vitro and in vivo. Development of such fluorescent ligands will prove beneficial for the nuclear receptors. In this work, libraries of AMIs derviatives were synthesized by manipulating various R groups around the core structure, and tested for their ability to serve as nuclear receptor ligands with the ability to fluoresce upon binding. The fluorogens are developed for steroidal and non-steroidal receptors, two general classes of nuclear receptors. Specific AMIs were designed and developed for steroid receptor estrogen receptor á (ERá). These ligands are showed to activate the receptor with an EC 50 of value 3 ìM and the 10 -fold activation with AMI 1 and AMI 2 in comparison to the 21 -fold activation observed with natural ERá ligand, 17 â-estradiol. These novel ligands were not able to display the fluorescence upon binding the receptor. However, fluorescence localized in nucleus was observed in case of another AMI derivative, AMI 10, which does not activate the receptor. Such ligands open new avenues for developing fluorescent probes for ERá that do not involve fluorescent conjugates attached to a known ERá ligand core. AMIs were also characterized for non-steroidal receptors,specifically the pregnane x receptor (PXR) and retinoic acid receptor á (RARá). To date, fluorogens which turn fluorescence upon binding and activate the receptor have not been developed for these receptors. With respect to PXR, several AMI derivatives were discovered to bind and activate this receptor with a fold-activation better than the known agonist, rifampicin. The best characterized AMI derivative, AMI 4, activates the receptor with an EC 50 of value 6. 3 ìM and the 154 -fold activation in comparison to the 90 -fold activation and an EC 50 value of 1. 3 ìM seen with rifamipicin. This ligand is not only able to activate PXR but also displays fluorescence upon binding to the receptor. The fluroscence pattern was observed around the nucleus. Besides AMI 4, 16 other AMI derivatives are identified that activate PXR with different activation profiles. Thus, a novel class of PXR ligands with fluorescence ability has been developed. The AMI derivatives able to bind and activate RAR, also displayed activation profiles that were comparable to the wild-type ligand, all trans retinoic acid. These ligands activated the receptor with an EC 50 value of 220 nM with AMI 109 in comparison to an EC 50 value of 0. 8 nM with the natural ligand for RARá. When these ligands were tested for fluorescence in yeast, the yeast were able to fluoresce only in the presence of the receptor and the AMI derivative, indicating that these agonists also have the ability to fluoresce.
