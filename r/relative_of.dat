40|$|A {{positive}} {{family history}} {{is associated with}} increased risk for dementia. It is not known whether a negative family history with long-lived relatives predicts a reduced risk for dementia. We studied the survival rate and the occurrence of dementia in 232 parents and siblings of 43 optimally healthy individuals > or = 84 {{years of age and}} compared them with 233 parents and siblings of 51 random controls and 499 parents and siblings of 88 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Prevalence of dementia after age 60 years was. 031 for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> healthy elderly,. 066 for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> random controls, and. 217 for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> AD patients. The cumulative incidence of dementia by age 85 years was estimated as. 041 (+/-. 019) for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> healthy elderly individuals,. 102 (+/-. 038) for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> random controls, and. 360 (+/-. 037) for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> AD patients. Hazard-ratio estimates suggest that the risk of dementia for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> healthy elderly is 3 times lower than the risk for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> random controls (P <. 03) and is 11 times lower than the risk for the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> AD patients (P <. 00005).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a familial disorder and that chronic tics (CT) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) appear to be etiologically related to the syndrome.

The rates of TS, CT, and OCD in the total sample <b>of</b> biological <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> TS probands were significantly greater than in the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> controls. In addition, the morbid risks of TS, OCD, and CT were not significantly different in families of probands with OCD when compared to <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> probands without OCD.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have found {{a greater risk of}} {{schizophrenia}} among the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> female schizophrenic probands than the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> male schizophrenic probands.

The current investigation, using family data collected in the 1950 's and 1960 's in Sweden, did not find a difference in the risk of schizophrenia among the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> male and female schizophrenic probands. However, significantly more <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> female probands than <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> male probands had manic-depressive psychosis. These findings suggest that the earlier studies may have included some female schizophrenic probands who would be classified as having manic-depression by modern criteria. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Relatives play a {{vital role}} in caring for {{patients}} with severe mental illness but receive inadequate support from psychiatric services. Evidence suggests that although intensive case management is directed primarily at patients, relatives may benefit a's well. This study examined whether <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients who were receiving intensive case management had more contact with mental health professionals than <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients who were receiving standard case management. It also examined whether <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients receiving intensive case management appraised caregiving less negatively and experienced less psychological distress than <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients receiving standard case management. Methods: The sample was drawn from the pool of patients participating in the UK 700 randomized controlled trial of intensive case management. Prospective data on contact between case managers and the <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> 146 patients were collected over a two-year period. At a two-year follow-up assessment, <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> 116 patients were. interviewed with the Experience of Caregiving Inventory and the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire. Results: Considerably more <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients receiving intensive case management had contact with a case manager during the study period than <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients receiving standard case management (70 percent compared with 45 percent). However, <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients receiving intensive case management did not-appraise caregiving less negatively or experience less psychological distress than <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients who were receiving. standard case management. Conclusions: Reducing case managers' caseloads alone. will not guarantee adequate support for relatives [...] Instead, providing more support will need to be an explicit aim, and staff will require specific additional training to achieve it...|$|R

We also evaluated the prevalence of ADs in CD patients and compared it with that in a control series. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the prevalence of ADs in 125 (51 males and 74 females with a mean age of 8. 9 years) children with CD (group A), 125 (67 males and 58 females with a mean age of 8. 1 years) matched "healthy" children (group B), all 1352 first- and second-degree <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> the 125 children with CD (group C), all 1238 first- and second-degree <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> the control group B of "healthy" children (group D), and all 205 first- and second-degree <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> 20 children with AD (group E). We also used the antiendomysium antibody assay to screen 354 of the 373 first-degree <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> group C. An AD was present in 9 of the 125 (7. 2 %) children with CD (group A), in 1 of the 125 (0. 8 %) healthy children (group B), in 67 of the 1352 (4. 9 %) <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> CD patients (group C), in 14 of the 1238 (1. 1 %) <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> healthy children (group D), and in 7 of the 205 (3. 4 %) <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> patients with AD (group E).
