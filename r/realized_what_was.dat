5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death {{as the crowd}} rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening, but {{it was already too}} late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Strikebreakers {{made another}} attempt to move the streetcars into their carhouses {{to protect them from}} being vandalized. When rioters in the mob <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> being done, they {{attacked}} the policemen protecting the strikebreakers, and the police clubbed the rioters to drive them back. The rioters fled, and the police resumed their attempt to move the cars only to have the rioters renew the attack. Strikebreakers opened fire on the crowd; four rioters were killed. Numerous injuries were reported, including among the policemen. The rioters eventually overpowered the police and strikebreakers and forced them to abandon their efforts.|$|E

25|$|With {{their land}} and route secured, in 1905, Page (with Rogers' {{identity}} still not revealed) began building {{the rest of the}} new railroad. By the time the larger railroads finally <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening, their new competitor could not be successfully blocked. Rogers' identity and backing were finally disclosed more than a year later. Early in 1907, the Deepwater and Tidewater Railways, still under construction, were combined to become the Virginian Railway (VGN).|$|E
25|$|By autumn in {{the eighth}} lunar month, as Cao Cao's army reached the valley of Daling River (大凌河), Tadun and his allies <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{happening}} and hastily withdrew from their prepared positions and gathered to face Cao Cao to the north. With {{tens of thousands of}} men gathered, Tadun, along with Yuan Shang, Yuan Xi, and the two Wuhuan chanyus Louban (樓班) and Wuyan (烏延), met Cao Cao's army at White Wolf Mountain (白狼山; near present-day Lingyuan, Liaoning).|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} carried out {{on the night of}} August 1. Mu'izz al-Dawla led a number of men north, instructing them to light torches and blast {{trumpets}} along the way. The Hamdanid army, seeing his movements, moved north as well to prevent him from crossing the river. Saymari and his soldiers were therefore free to cross to the eastern side and began to do so. When the Hamdanid army <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening, they sent a number of men in zabzabs to stop him, and a fierce fight broke out. Eventually the Dailamites were victorious and the Hamdanid forces were pushed back to the Shammasiyyah gate at the northeastern corner of the city.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing ride. The ride operator was {{not paying attention}} and started the ride without putting the restraint bars down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started yelling at the ride operators. One of the passengers stood up, {{trying to get the}} ride operator's attention. Soon after this, one of the ride operators <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on, and stopped the ride. The same ride operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel. The ride went through the layout normally. No injuries were reported, but some guests were shaken up. The ride operated normally {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, over in Virginia, in 1905, {{with the land}} and route secured, {{construction}} got underway on the Tidewater Railway, which as it turned out, went nowhere near its headquarters in Staunton on the C Instead, it started building an alignment which would match up amazingly well with the Deepwater Railway near Glen Lyn, and run almost parallel to the N & W {{all the way to}} Norfolk. By the time the larger railroads finally <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening, and that Page was involved in both the Deepwater and Tidewater Railways, their new competitor could not be successfully blocked on the basis of right-of-way. The building of another major railroad from the mountains-to-the-sea seemed to have been set in motion. Completion, however, was still far from assured.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Joseph, {{who later}} became the emperor, arrived at Landau with his entourage of 250 courtiers on 26 July. Joseph took nominal command of the army, while Louis of Baden {{continued}} {{to make all the}} critical decisions. Two days later, when the Imperial army paraded for the archduke's inspection, Mélac believed that a relief army under Catinat was at hand and he made preparations to defend against an assault. When the French commander finally <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on, the frustrated Mélac sent a message asking where Joseph's headquarters was located so he could bombard it. Joseph, whose headquarters was out of range anyway, replied that the Frenchman must do his duty. The archduke visited the siege lines and even aimed some of the cannon. In one close call, Joseph was talking with a gunner when the man was hit in the chest by a bullet.|$|E

500|$|When The Band {{began work}} on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they {{employed}} a recording technique {{similar to the one}} they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, [...] "We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. Like the Big Pink technique." [...] That technique influenced groups including The Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record [...] "in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that The Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes".|$|E
500|$|Historian David Carter {{presents}} information {{indicating that}} the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those {{who worked in the}} Financial District. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered, ...|$|E
500|$|Sometime around September 19, 1869, Corbin, at {{the urging}} of Gould, sent a letter to Grant desperately urging him not to release gold from the Treasury. Grant {{received}} the letter from a messenger while playing croquet with Porter at a deluxe Pennsylvania retreat. He finally <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on and was determined to stop the gold manipulation scheme. When pressed for a reply to Corbin's letter, Grant responded curtly that everything was [...] "all right" [...] {{and that there was no}} reply. One Grant biographer described the comical nature of the events as an Edwardian farce. Grant, however, did have his wife Julia respond in a letter to Corbin's wife that Abel Corbin needed to get out of the gold speculation market. When Gould visited Corbin's house, he read the letter from Mrs. Grant containing the warning from Grant, after which he began to sell gold, while also buying small amounts of gold in order to keep people from getting suspicious. [...] Gould never told Fisk, who kept buying gold in earnest, that Grant was catching onto their predatory scheme.|$|E

500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{of giving}} up, Page (and Rogers) {{secretly}} planned and had surveyed a route {{to provide a}} new, third major railroad, {{all the way to}} new coal pier facilities at Sewell's Point on the harbor of Hampton Roads, fully [...] away from the railhead on the Kanawha River. In early 1904, the Tidewater Railway, a new railroad, was quietly formed in Virginia by a Rogers attorney. The necessary sections of right-of way and land were acquired before the large railroads <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening. Efforts to block Page and Rogers through many legal tactics and even several violent confrontations ultimately failed.|$|E

[...] The plot failed, however, when the eunuchs <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening and counterattacked with soldiers under their command. [...] Li Xun, Zheng, {{as well as many}} of their associates and other officials were slaughtered, and thereafter, the eunuchs had an even firmer control over Emperor Wenzong and his government than before.|$|E

2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. Cooking food with microwaves {{was discovered by}} Percy Spencer on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar {{he had in his}} pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg. In 1947, Raytheon under Percy Spencer demonstrated the world's first {{microwave oven}} built at the company which was called the [...] "Radarange".|$|E

[...] He continues to add [...] "when we were touring for our last album, The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, even if we had a 75-minute-long set, we could only play five songs because they were all so long, and that can be tiring for an audience." [...] They are also intent on making it clear that the album is not simply negative in message. [...] "The title also pays tribute to how amazing touring most often feels. It's also a tribute to the joy that burns inside when you reach a place and people who don't speak your language are rooting for your songs and welcoming you into their unique environment".|$|E
2500|$|During {{his work}} in the FSB Litvinenko {{discovered}} numerous connections between top brass of Russian law enforcement agencies and Russian mafia groups, such as Solntsevo gang. He wrote a memorandum about that to Boris Yeltsin. Berezovsky arranged a meeting for him with FSB director Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Director of Internal affairs Ovchinnikov to discuss the corruption problems; however, this had no effect. Litvinenko gradually realized that the entire system was corrupted from the top to the bottom. He explained: [...] "If your partner bilked you, or a creditor did not pay, or a supplier did not deliver - where did you turn to complain? ...When force became a commodity, there was always demand for it. [...] "Roofs" [...] appeared, people who sheltered and protected your business. First it was provided by the mob, then by police, and soon even our own guys <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> what, and then the rivalry began among gangsters, cops, and the Agency for market share. As the police and the FSB became more competitive, they squeezed the gangs out of the market. But in many cases competition gave way to cooperation, and the services became gangsters themselves." [...] According to US diplomats, Litvinenko coined the phrase Mafia state.|$|E
