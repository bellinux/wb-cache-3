25|$|The MAR has {{undergone}} several changes over time, {{and it is}} worth noting that it may also be found with a polymer-coated aluminum stock or an all-polymer stock. The Model 699 is available with a 267mm barrel and optional left-side charging handle which is welded onto the left side of the bolt carrier and protrudes through a slot cut in the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> that is covered by a spring-loaded cover while the bolt carrier is forward.|$|E
25|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear peep sight moved further to the rear on the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> and a stock that folds {{up and over the}} receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators and flash hiders.|$|E
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|E
50|$|Their {{marketing}} strategy has expanded {{in recent years}} to include PLUGZ, a series of custom Class II and Class III trailer hitch <b>receiver</b> <b>covers</b> for full-sized vehicles as well as So Real 1/24-scale diecast static car models.|$|R

50|$|Due to its {{relatively}} low cost and widespread availability and usage, the SKS {{has spawned a}} growing market for both replacement parts and accessories. Many aftermarket parts are available to modify the carbine—sometimes so considerably that it bears {{little resemblance to the}} original firearm. This may include items such as synthetic stocks, pistol grips, higher capacity magazines, replacement <b>receiver</b> <b>covers</b> (to allow the mounting of scopes, lasers, etc.), different muzzle brakes, recoil buffers, bipods, and more.|$|R
50|$|A polymer cheek rest is {{fitted to}} the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
50|$|The AK-107 is a {{selective}} fire weapon, with a three-round burst capability {{in addition to}} semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes. The system on the AK-107 resets to three-round burst each time the trigger is released, even if {{only one or two}} rounds were fired. External differences between the AK-107 and its predecessors are minor. They include a modified ejection port and a much thicker operating rod cover. The method of attaching the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> now involves a rotating latch in place of the traditional Kalashnikov button {{at the rear of the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>cover.</b> The rear sight is also attached directly to the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> rather than to the receiver itself and the selector has four positions instead of three. Optical and night sights can be installed, the rifle can also accept a 40 mm GP-25 grenade launcher.|$|E
50|$|For {{maintenance}} {{the weapon}} is field stripped {{into the following}} components: the receiver and barrel, bolt carrier, bolt, return mechanism, gas tube, <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> and magazine.|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 {{shows the}} {{geometry}} of the observations. Two ionosondes are located near the magnetic equator. From {{the rate of increase}} in h’F at the magnetic equator, we estimated vertical drift caused by eastward electric fields during the PRE period. The field-of-view of all GPS <b>receivers</b> <b>covers</b> an area from near the magnetic equator up to 15 °S in geographic latitude. The geometry of the observations therefore allows us to study the relation between the upward E[*]×[*]B drift and the latitudinal extension of plasma bubble at the low latitudes in the Southeast Asian sector.|$|R
40|$|The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array(ALMA) Band 1 <b>receiver</b> <b>covers</b> the 35 - 50 GHz {{frequency}} band. Development of prototype receivers, {{including the}} key components and subsystems {{has been completed}} and two sets of prototype receivers were fully tested. We will {{provide an overview of}} the ALMA Band 1 science goals, and its requirements and design for use on the ALMA. The receiver development status will also be discussed and the infrastructure, integration, evaluation of fully-assembled band 1 receiver system will be covered. Finally, a discussion of the technical and management challenges encountered will be presented...|$|R

5000|$|Hi-Point {{carbines}} use a polymer stock, stamped {{sheet metal}} <b>receiver</b> <b>cover,</b> and a receiver and bolt cast from zamak-3. The barrel is steel and button rifled using a 1-10" [...] right hand twist.|$|E
50|$|The single-piece frame/receiver is molded from ABS {{plastic and}} largely {{unmachined}} {{with the exception}} of the bolt guides which the bottom of the bolt rides on. A stamped steel <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> rests over the top of the bolt, sandwiching it in place. The <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> hinges at the front of the frame and latches onto the rear of the bolt assembly. The bolt assembly consists of a cast steel bolt that rides on a spring and follower; a thin firing pin channel runs down the center of the bolt, allowing the stamped firing pin to be struck by the hammer and impact the cartridge at the front of the bolt.|$|E
2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band <b>receiver</b> <b>covers</b> 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band <b>receiver</b> <b>covers</b> 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|R

5000|$|The WASR-22 fires the [...]22 long rifle cartridge. They are {{designed}} as trainers or starter AKs. They usually ship with two 10-round magazines. There {{are reports of}} jams caused by the smaller shell casing lodging in the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover</b> and blocking the action. Most people switch the top cover with a military one or adjust the extractor spring tension under the bolt assembly.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a matter}} of {{contention}} whether the AKMSU was actually manufactured by the Soviet Union or was simply a one-off production, a [...] "Khyber Pass Copy" [...] from Pakistan's Khyber Pass region, an area known for diverse and unique weapon production in small shops. The AKMSU can be produced by combining an AKMS receiver with an AKS-74U gas system, front trunion, and <b>receiver</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
50|$|The FAL {{operates}} {{by means}} of a gas-operated action very {{similar to that of the}} Russian SVT-40. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the barrel, and the locking mechanism is what is known as a tilting breechblock. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy receiver much like the bolts of the Russian SKS carbine and French MAS-49 series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of rifle grenades and manual operation. The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed stock versions of the FAL, the recoil spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the <b>receiver</b> <b>cover,</b> necessitating a slightly different <b>receiver</b> <b>cover,</b> recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.|$|E
40|$|Six {{receivers}} for the MicroWave Radiometer (MWR) {{are currently}} under development at JPL. These <b>receivers</b> <b>cover</b> a frequency range of 0. 6 to 22 GHz in approximately octave steps, with 4 % bandwidth. For calibration and diagnosis three noise diodes and a Dicke switch are integrated into each receiver. Each receiver {{is connected to}} its own antenna which is mounted with its bore sights perpendicular to the spin axis of the spacecraft. As the spacecraft spins at 2 RPM, the antenna field of view scans Jupiter's atmosphere from limb to nadir to limb, measuring microwave emission down to 1000 -bar...|$|R
