50|$|Revenue or Sales {{reported}} on the income statement are net sales after deducting Sales <b>Returns</b> <b>and</b> <b>Allowances</b> and Sales Discounts.|$|E
50|$|The items deducted will {{typically}} include tax expense, financing expense (interest expense), {{and minority}} interest. Likewise, preferred stock dividends will be subtracted too, {{though they are}} not an expense. For a merchandising company, subtracted costs may be the cost of goods sold, sales discounts, and sales <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> For a product company advertising, manufacturing, and design and development costs are included.|$|E
2500|$|All {{accounts}} have corresponding {{contra accounts}} {{depending on what}} transaction has taken place e.g., when a vehicle is purchased using cash, the asset account [...] "Vehicles" [...] is debited as the vehicle account increases, and simultaneously the asset account [...] "Bank" [...] is credited due to the payment for the vehicle using cash. Some balance sheet items have corresponding contra accounts, with negative balances, that offset them. Examples are accumulated depreciation against equipment, <b>and</b> <b>allowance</b> for bad debts (also known as allowance for doubtful accounts) against accounts receivable. United States GAAP utilizes the term contra for specific accounts only and doesn't recognize {{the second half of}} a transaction as a contra, thus the term is restricted to accounts that are related. For example, sales <b>returns</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>and</b> sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit). To understand the actual value of sales, one must net the contras against sales, which gives rise to the term net sales (meaning net of the contras).|$|R
5|$|In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff {{including}} more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. There are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in <b>return</b> for fees <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> These fees <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about £30,000 per annum.|$|R
50|$|Gross {{sales are}} {{the sum of}} all sales during a time period. Net sales are gross sales minus sales <b>returns,</b> sales <b>allowances,</b> <b>and</b> sales discounts. Gross sales do not {{normally}} appear on an income statement. The sales figures reported on an income statement are net sales.|$|R
5000|$|Contra {{accounts}} are accounts that are related, yet separate from its particular account. A contra expense account will behave {{in the opposite}} way a normal expense account will; instead of debiting to increase, a contra account must credit to increase. Instead of crediting to decrease, it will be credited to increase. [...] An example of a contra expense account is Purchase <b>Returns</b> <b>and</b> <b>Allowances.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Revenue - Cash inflows {{or other}} {{enhancements}} of assets (including accounts receivable) of an entity {{during a period}} from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing major operations. It is usually presented as sales minus sales discounts, <b>returns,</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> Every time a business sells a product or performs a service, it obtains revenue. This often {{is referred to as}} gross revenue or sales revenue.|$|E
50|$|In accounting, {{purchases}} is {{the amount}} of goods a company bought throughout this year. It also refers to information as to the kind, quality, quantity, and cost of goods bought that should be maintained. They are added to inventory. Purchases are offset by Purchase Discounts and Purchase <b>Returns</b> <b>and</b> <b>Allowances.</b> When it should be added depends on the Free On Board (FOB) policy of the trade. For the purchaser, this new inventory is added on shipment if the policy was FOB shipping point, and the seller remove this item from its inventory. On the other hand, the purchaser added this inventory on receipt if the policy was FOB destination, and the seller remove this item from its inventory when it was delivered.|$|E
50|$|Various {{abbreviations}} {{may be used}} {{in financial}} statements, especially financial statements summarized on the Internet. Sales reported by a firm are usually net sales, which deduct <b>returns,</b> <b>allowances,</b> <b>and</b> early payment discounts from the charge on an invoice. Net income is always the amount after taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below).|$|R
50|$|Bowen {{was born}} in North Adelaide, an inner suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. As a young girl, Bowen enjoyed drawing and {{convinced}} her mother {{to allow her to}} study with Margaret Preston. However, her desire to pursue art training in Melbourne was thwarted by the ill health of her mother and the latter's reluctance to let her daughter follow such a career. When her mother died in 1914, Bowen left for England with a <b>return</b> ticket <b>and</b> an <b>allowance</b> of £20 per month. In cosmopolitan London, she studied at the Westminster School of Art and mixed in the exhilarating company of writers, artists, poets and political activists.|$|R
