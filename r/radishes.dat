5|$|Broadly speaking, <b>radishes</b> can be {{categorized}} into four main types according to the seasons when they are grown {{and a variety of}} shapes lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow <b>radishes,</b> with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a parsnip.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radishes</b> can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and <b>radishes</b> seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and <b>radishes</b> also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E

5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. <b>Radishes</b> are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. <b>Radishes</b> owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some <b>radishes</b> are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E

Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while not {{suitable}} for human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel.

40|$|Leaves of twenties <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus L.) {{inbred lines}} were {{mechanically}} inoculated with Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) strain HY to evaluate TuMV {{resistance of the}} <b>radish</b> inbred lines. The inoculated <b>radish</b> plants were incubated at 22 °C± 3 °C and resistance assessment was examined using symptom development for 4 weeks. Based on the reactions of differential <b>radish</b> inbred lines, 16 <b>radish</b> lines were produced mild mosaic, mottling, mosaic and severe mosaic symptoms by TuMV infection. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of TuMV coat protein gene, suggesting that TuMV {{is responsible for the}} disease symptoms. Four resistant <b>radish</b> lines did not induce systemic mosaic symptoms on upper leaves and chlorosis in stem tissues for 4 weeks, showing they were symptomless by 8 weeks. Further examination of TuMV infection in the 4 <b>radish</b> lines showed no TuMV infection in all systemic leaves.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as <b>radishes,</b> pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, <b>radishes,</b> sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
