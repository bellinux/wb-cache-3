Those who suffer from arachnophobia, an acute fear of spiders, become particularly horrified. The spider web {{is used as a}} motif to adorn dark passageways, depicting the <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the unknown.|$|E

5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the globe, {{including}} the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in the <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> walls, and, on occasion, {{the use of}} wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, {{and the influence of}} this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the windows and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Megabats mostly roost {{in trees}} and shrubs. Only those that possess {{echolocation}} {{venture into the}} dark <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> caves. Because they eat fruit, some megabat species are unpopular with orchard owners. Megabats are frugivorous or nectarivorous, i.e., they eat fruits or lick nectar from flowers. Often, the fruits are crushed and only the juices are consumed. The teeth are adapted to bite through hard fruit rinds.|$|E
30|$|Ultrasound is well able {{to assess}} {{superficial}} joints {{such as the}} MCPJs of the hands for joint effusion, synovial proliferation and synovitis as well as bone erosion (Fig.  1) [25]. It is actually not very time-consuming once the small initial learning curve has been overcome. It can assess bursae and larger joints and entheses. However, the more areas investigated the more time-consuming it becomes. Naredo et al. [26] have shown that for routine diagnostic and treatment response purposes it suffices to assess the anterior and posterior <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the elbow, the dorsal carpal <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, {{the second and third}} MCPJ dorsally and palmar, the suprapatellar recess and the lateral parapatellar <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the knee, the anterior tibiotalar <b>recess</b> <b>of</b> the ankle and the medial and lateral tendon sheaths in the ankle area. In a recent review Spencer et al. [25] suggested more focused concentration on the wrist area and the MCPJs for assessment.|$|R

Sandbed Gill was the first new route in the Lake District to be pioneered by the brothers George and Ashley Abraham in 1890. Although George was only 18 at the time, and Ashley 14, they had already gained true rock-climbing skills elsewhere in the Lakes. Walkers should leave the gill well alone.|$|E
25|$|The Ilm-e-Kshnoom ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is {{a school}} of Parsi-Zoroastrian {{philosophy}} based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the Saheb-e-Dilan ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the Caucasus (alternatively, in the Alborz range, around Mount Damavand).|$|E
25|$|Willy DeVille's Backstreets of Desire stands tall as his {{masterpiece}} as both {{a singer}} and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of roots rock and Crescent City second line, traces of 1950s doo-wop, and elegant sweeping vistas of Spanish soul balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying {{to get off the}} street. The sound of the album balances Creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the human heart.|$|E

Finally Nether Beck Bridge on the shore of Wastwater provides access via Scoat Tarn onto the southern flanks. From the upper <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> Nether Beck the walker can aim for either of the cols which connect the objective to Red Pike or Haycock. Perhaps the greatest number of visitors will cross the top as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, also climbing Red Pike and Pillar.|$|E
25|$|The Temple of Jagannath at Puri {{is one of}} {{the major}} Hindu temples in India. The temple is built in the Kalinga style of architecture, with the Pancharatha (Five chariots) type {{consisting}} of two anurathas, two konakas and one ratha. Jagannath temple is a pancharatha with well-developed pagas. 'Gajasimhas' (elephant lions) carved in <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the pagas, the 'Jhampasimhas' (Jumping lions) are also placed properly. The perfect pancharatha temple developed into a Nagara-rekha temple with unique Oriya style of subdivisions like the Pada, Kumbha, Pata, Kani and Vasanta. The Vimana or the apsidal structure consists of several sections superimposed one over other, tapering to the top where the Amalakashila and Kalasa are placed.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} di Penates is more defined in Etruria: Arnobius (citing a Caesius) {{states that the}} Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; {{according}} to Nigidius Figulus, they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men. According to Varro the Penates reside in the <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> Heaven and are called Consentes and Complices by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves. While these last gods {{seem to be the}} Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.|$|E

25|$|His {{word has}} given {{warning of the}} {{impending}} danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when {{it is too late}} to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, as {{expected}} Janus {{is present in}} region I of Martianus Capella's division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, {{are to be found}} the Ianitores terrestres (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea, deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the forca, a iugum, low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the limes, boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, here of the gates separating Earth and Heaven. The problem posed by the qualifying adjective terrestres earthly, can be addressed in two different ways. One hypothesis is that Martianus's depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth. However Martianus's depiction does not look to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> Heaven. Thence one may argue that the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the theologem of the Gates of Heaven (the Synplegades) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.|$|E
