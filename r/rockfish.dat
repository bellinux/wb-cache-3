5|$|Skyline Drive takes {{a winding}} north–south path along the mountaintops of the Blue Ridge Mountains {{east of the}} Shenandoah River from Front Royal to <b>Rockfish</b> Gap, serving as the only public road through Shenandoah National Park. There are four {{entrance}} points to Skyline Drive located at US 340 near I-66 in Front Royal, US 211 in Thornton Gap, US 33 in Swift Run Gap and US 250 near I-64 in <b>Rockfish</b> Gap. At the south end in <b>Rockfish</b> Gap it connects to the northern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a free-access road that continues southward along the Blue Ridge Mountains. On {{the west side of}} the drive, mileposts are present. They are numbered from 0 to 105 (north to south) and serve as reference points to directions in the drive. There are 75 overlooks throughout the drive, providing views of the Shenandoah Valley to the west and the Piedmont to the east.|$|E
5|$|In August 1969, Canadian Forces Maritime Command divers {{made more}} dives during {{scientific}} {{studies by the}} Fisheries Research Board of Canada. They found very dense shoals of <b>rockfish</b> floating over Bowie's flat-topped summit {{and a variety of}} bottom life. A number of monochrome photographs were taken and a few seaweeds were collected, but no species record was created for other types of oceanic life around Bowie Seamount.|$|E
5|$|Bowie Seamount {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, <b>rockfish,</b> halibut and sablefish. Eight species of marine mammal {{have been found in}} the Bowie Seamount area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E
40|$|In the kelp {{forests of}} Carmel Bay {{there are six}} common <b>rockfishes</b> (Sebastes). Three are pelagic (S. serranoides, S. mystinus, and S. melanops) and two are {{demersal}} (S. chrysomelas and S. carnatus). The sixth (S. atrovirens) is generally found a few meters above the sea floor. The pelagic <b>rockfishes</b> which are spatially overlapping have different feeding habits. All <b>rockfishes</b> except S. mystinus utilize juvenile <b>rockfishes</b> as their primary food source during the upwelling season. Throughout the non-upwelling season, most species consume invertebrate prey. The pelagic <b>rockfishes</b> have shorter maxillary bones and longer gill rakers than their demersal congeners, both specializations for taking smaller prey. They also have longer intestines, enabling them to utilize less digestable foods. S. mystinus, which has the longest intestine, {{may be able to}} use algae as a food source. Fat reserves are accumulated from July through October, when prey is most abundant. Fat is depleted {{throughout the rest of the}} year as food becomes scarce and development of sexual organs takes place. Gonad development occurs from November through February for all species except S. atrovirens...|$|R

5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, <b>rockfish,</b> sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. <b>Rockfish</b> {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E

40|$|Literature was {{reviewed}} for data describing fecundity, maturity, and {{growth in the}} ovoviviparous genus Sebastes (<b>rockfishes).</b> Assembled data were examined for patterns associated with geographic location and fish length. <b>Rockfishes</b> display great range in length at maturity (9 - 52 cm total length) and estimated fecundity at maturity (1, 700 - 417, 000 eggs or embryos). Within species, length at maturity usually increases at higher latitudes and tends to be greater for females than males. Among species, length at maturity of females is positively and significantly correlated with maximum length and with the ratio of fecundity at maturity to fecundity at maximum length. Fecundity of <b>rockfishes</b> is not notably lower than oviparous fishes such as snappers (Lutjanidae) andcods (Gadidae) ...|$|R

Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and <b>rockfish</b> (also known as striped bass).|$|E
5|$|Of the {{fin whale}} stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids {{dominated}} the diet for {{four of the}} five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%). Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera (9%), and the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) (7%); only trace amounts (<0.5% each) were found of Pacific saury (C. saira) and juvenile <b>rockfish</b> (Sebastes jordani). In the Gulf of California, they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex.|$|E
5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and <b>Rockfish</b> Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E

40|$|Biomass {{estimates}} of {{several species of}} Alaskan <b>rockfishes</b> exhibit large interannual variations. Because <b>rockfishes</b> are long lived and relatively slow growing, large, short-term shifts in population abundance are not likely. We attribute the variations in biomass estimates to the high variability in the spatial distribution of <b>rockfishes</b> that is not well {{accounted for by the}} survey design currently used. We evaluated the performance of an experimental survey design, the Trawl and Acoustic Presence/Absence Survey (TAPAS), to reduce the variability in estimated biomass for Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus). Analysis of archived acoustic backscatter data produced an acoustic threshold for delineating potential areas of high (“patch”) and low (“background”) catch per unit of effort (CPUE) in real time. In 2009, we conducted a 12 -day TAPAS near Yakutat, Alaska. We completed 59 trawls at 19 patch stations and 40 background stations. The design performed well logistically, and Pacific ocean perch (POP) accounted for 55...|$|R
40|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{predator}} controlling ecosystem productivity through cascading effects on basal, habitat-forming kelp species. However, their indirect effects on other kelp-associated taxa like fishes are poorly understood. We examined the effects of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) reintroduction along the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) distributions and the trophic niches and growth of two common kelp forest fishes, black (Sebastes melanops) and copper (S. caurinus) <b>rockfishes.</b> We sampled 47 kelp forests, and found that red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) were eliminated in the presence of otters, and that kelp forests were 3. 7 times deeper and 18. 8 times larger. Despite order-of-magnitude differences in kelp forest size, adult black and copper <b>rockfishes</b> contained less kelp-derived carbon in their tissues (as measured by stable isotopes of C and N) in regions with otters. Adults of both species had higher mean trophic positions in the presence of otte rs, indicating more frequent consumption of higher trophic level prey such as fishes. Smaller trophic niche space of <b>rockfishes</b> in the presence of otters indicated a higher degree of trophic specialization. Juvenile black <b>rockfishes</b> rapidly shifted to higher kelp-carbon contents, trophic positions, and body condition factors after settling in kelp forests. The relationships of growth to length, percentage of kelp carbon, and trophic position varied between the two regions, indicating that potential effects of kelp forest size on trophic ontogeny may also affect individual performance. Our results provide evidence that the indirect effects of otters on <b>rockfishes</b> arise largely through the creation of habitat for fishes and other prey rather than a direct trophic connection through invertebrates or other consumers of kelp productivity...|$|R
5|$|Field {{survey for}} the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an {{official}} groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place. The {{first section of}} the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run Gap to Thornton Gap. The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, Congress approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct Skyline Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run Gap. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would have {{a hand in the}} construction of Skyline Drive. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along Skyline Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes {{on both sides of the}} roadway, built guardrails and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for bituminous surfacing of the road. The section of Skyline Drive between Thornton Gap and Swift Run Gap opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge Bureau of Public Roads and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build Skyline Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton Gap at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of Skyline Drive from Swift Run Gap to Jarman Gap was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman Gap and <b>Rockfish</b> Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of Skyline Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of Skyline Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.|$|E
25|$|The Bay {{is famous}} for its <b>rockfish,</b> a {{regional}} name for striped bass.
