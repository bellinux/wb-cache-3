2500|$|The first 2,200 cars {{produced}} used a windshield-embedded antenna. This type of antenna {{proved to}} be unsuitable with poor <b>radio</b> <b>reception.</b> Oftentimes the <b>radio</b> would continually [...] "seek", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna {{was added to the}} outside of the front right fender. While improving <b>radio</b> <b>reception,</b> this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved, this time {{to the rear of the}} car. Automatic antennas were installed under the grills behind the rear driver's-side window. While giving the reception quality of a whip antenna, these completely disappear from view when not in use.|$|R

40|$|Clarke’s {{classical}} {{model of}} mobile <b>radio</b> <b>reception</b> assumes isotropic rich scattering around the mobile receiver antenna. The assumption of isotropic scattering is valid only in limited circumstances. In this contribution we develop a generalized Clarke model, which is applicable to mobile <b>radio</b> <b>reception</b> in general scattering environments. We give expressions for the autocorrelation and {{power spectral density}} (PSD) of the channel fading process and demonstrate the generality of the model by applying it to different non-isotropic scattering scenarios. Using the generalized model, we analyze the effect of mobile direction of travel and the non-isotropicity on the statistics of the channel fading process. We also show that if the mobile direction of travel is equiprobable in all directions, a non-isotropic scattering environment on average {{is as good as}} an isotropic scattering environment...|$|R
