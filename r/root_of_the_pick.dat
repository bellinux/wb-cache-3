Sure enough, he kept his word; and within the week, the mine was dry, and the men {{were sent to the}} bottom. This was a grand job for George's future. The manager, a Mr. Dodds, not only gave him ten pounds at once as a present, in acknowledgment of his practical skill, but also appointed him engine-man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new pit, another rise in the social scale as well as in <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> wages.
