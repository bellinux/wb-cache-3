40|$|One of the {{important}} environmental issues raised recently in regard to coal ash reuse for highway construction purposes (e. g., embankment development) is that of worker, and public, exposure to radiation which might possibly be emitted by these types of <b>residuals.</b> <b>Radiation</b> emission is, in fact, a natural phenomenon for most materials, both natural and man-made, {{but in the case}} of coal ash residuals the process of combustion produces an inevitable concentration of radionuclides from the original virgin coal. INDOT’s corresponding environmental concern consequently focuses on the following basic question: does this magnification of radionuclides found within these coal ash residuals cause sufficiently high levels of radiation to impose harmful effects due to exposure? This research project subsequently addressed the associated issue of radiation emission by coal ash residuals generated within the State of Indiana, covering both fly ash and bottom ash materials. Samples were obtained at sixteen (16) different coal-fired power generating facilities within Indiana and subjected to a quantitative analysis of their associated gamma-ray emission levels. After identifying the responsible radionuclides, a conservative approximation was then developed for the worst-case potential occupational exposure with construction employees working on this type of highvolume, coal ash embankment. In turn, these potential emission levels were compared to those of other traditional construction materials and other common sources. The observed results indicated that these coal ash residuals did contain levels of gamma-ray emitters that were, in fact, higher than those of traditional construction materials (i. e., clay, sand, brick, and limestone). However, these levels of gamma-ray emission were not excessively high, and considerably below the limits respectively promulgated for public exposure and occupational exposure by the Environmental Protection Agency (100 mrem/yr for a single man-made source) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (5 rem/yr) ...|$|R

50|$|After its {{operating}} cycle, the reactor {{is shut down}} for refueling. The fuel discharged at that time (spent fuel) is stored either at the reactor site (commonly in a spent fuel pool) or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites.

The spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid, which provides both cooling (the spent fuel continues to generate decay heat {{as a result of}} residual radioactive decay) and shielding to protect the environment from <b>residual</b> ionizing <b>radiation,</b> although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to dry cask storage.|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{temperature}} of the spent fuel bundles decreases significantly between 2 and 4 years, and less from 4 to 6 years. The fuel pool water is continuously cooled to remove the heat produced by the spent fuel assemblies. Pumps circulate water from the spent fuel pool to heat exchangers, {{then back to the}} spent fuel pool. The water temperature in normal operating conditions is held below 50 °C (120 °F). Radiolysis, the dissociation of molecules by radiation, is of particular concern in wet storage, as water may be split by <b>residual</b> <b>radiation</b> and hydrogen gas may accumulate increasing the risk of explosions. For this reason the air in the room of the pools, as well as the water, must be continually monitored and treated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{air burst}} is usually 100 to 1000 m above the hypocenter {{to allow the}} {{shockwave}} of the fission or fusion driven explosion to bounce {{off the ground and}} back into itself, creating a shockwave that is more forceful than one from a detonation at ground level. This [...] "mach stem" [...] only occurs near ground level, and is similar in shape to the letter Y when viewed from the side. Airbursting also minimizes fallout by keeping the fireball from touching the ground, limiting the amount of debris that is vaporized and drawn up in the radioactive debris cloud.

5000|$|Neutron effects: A neutron {{interacting}} with the semiconductor lattice will displace its atoms. This leads {{to an increase in}} the count of recombination centers and deep-level defects, reducing the lifetime of minority carriers, thus affecting bipolar devices more than CMOS ones. Bipolar devices on silicon tend to show changes in electrical parameters at levels of 1010 to 1011 neutrons/cm², CMOS devices aren't affected until 1015 neutrons/cm². The sensitivity of the devices may increase together with increasing level of integration and decreasing size of individual structures. There is also a risk of induced radioactivity caused by neutron activation, which is a major source of noise in high energy astrophysics instruments. Induced radiation, together with <b>residual</b> <b>radiation</b> from impurities in used materials, can cause all sorts of single-event problems during the device's lifetime. GaAs LEDs, common in optocouplers, are very sensitive to neutrons. The lattice damage influences the frequency of crystal oscillators. Kinetic energy effects (namely lattice displacement) of charged particles belong here too.|$|E
