2500|$|During {{the course}} of 1943, a number of {{improvements}} were gradually introduced. In an attempt to increase the pilot's field of view an armoured glass head-rest, the so-called Galland Panzer was developed, and subsequently began replacing the bulky armour plate {{in the spring of}} 1943. Towards {{the end of the year}} the clear-view, three-panel Erla Haube canopy appeared, named after the Erla Maschinenwerk sub-contractor involved in building new examples, and upgrading older examples of the Bf 109. Often misnamed the [...] "Galland Hood" [...] in postwar Western aviation books and periodicals, it eventually replaced the older heavily framed two-piece canopy — comprising the starboard side-hinged six-panel main canopy, and the three-panel fixed <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> fixed to the fuselage — on the Bf 109G. The canopy structure was completely redesigned to incorporate a greater area of clear perspex; the welded framing for the three-panel Erla Haube design was reduced to a minimum and there was no longer a fixed rear portion, with the entire structure aft of the windscreen being hinged to swing to starboard when opened.|$|E
2500|$|Also new for 1977 was VAM's first {{station wagon}} {{that was not}} an economy base model, the first in 17 years. This model was not a new trim level but a package {{included}} with {{the order of the}} automatic transmission. Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the 258 six to the 282 cu in unit and the 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift and high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold down <b>rear</b> <b>unit)</b> and special side panels. Accessories shared with both luxury sedans included power brakes, power steering, heavy duty suspension, bumper guards, full bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, [...] "4.6" [...] emblems (GFS only), tinted windshield, luxury steering wheel, electric analog clock, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light) as well as all the general line novelties of the year. This created a luxury wagon {{for the first time in}} VAM's line up. The downside was that the economy base wagon would no longer be available with the option of an automatic transmission. VAM wagons with this package did not obtain a specific name since it was not a trim level, it was known within VAM and in printed materials as [...] "Camioneta Automática" [...] (automatic wagon). It would be until 1979 that it would officially obtain a designation, now based on the Concord-wagon, making [...] "American DL" [...] its full name.|$|E

40|$|The {{reproductive}} potential of Chrysoperla mediterranea (HÖLZEL, 1972) was investigated, when adults {{were subjected to}} different densities per <b>rearing</b> <b>unit.</b> Couples after emergence were placed into rectangular cages of 450 cm 3, fed enzymatic protein hydrolysate of yeast and kept in a climatic chamber at 20 ± 1 °C, RH 70 – 80 % and 16 h-photophase. The treatments were repeated six times utilizing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 couples with a couple/volume ratio of 1 / 450, 1 / 225, 1 / 150, 1 / 112, 1 / 90, 1 / 75 and 1 / 64 cm 3, respectively. It was observed that the average pre-oviposition period for one couple was 5. 8 ± 0. 3 days while for the other treatments it was 7 – 8 days. For the oviposition period {{no significant differences were}} found, 100 days being ob-tained on the average, but for the daily and total oviposition the results showed differences among the treatments with one couple per <b>rearing</b> <b>unit</b> showing the greatest fecundity (520 ± 26. 0 eggs/female). By increasing the couple numbers, the total oviposition capacity de-creased, becoming more marked from four couples per <b>rearing</b> <b>unit,</b> with only 270. 0 ± 103. 0 eggs/female when seven couples were utilized (density 1 / 64 cm 3). Longevity was equally af-fected by density and for a single couple, it was 138. 3 ± 11. 2 days for the males and 117. 8 ± 12. 8 days for the females.

40|$|Fish {{weighing}} {{less than}} 30 g {{and more than}} 100 g were sampled from 38 <b>rearing</b> <b>units</b> on 10 commercial farms growing rainbow trout for the table market. A fin index was calculated {{for each of the}} eight rayed fins on 949 trout by dividing their length by the standard length of the fish. There was a large range in the indices of all eight fins. The fin indices of the small and large fish were compared, controlling for farm effect. With the exception of the dorsal fin, all the indices were larger for the small fish than for the large fish, but the magnitude of the difference was greater for some fins than others. In comparison with the fins of wild fish, the pectoral and dorsal fins appeared to be most eroded and the damage to these fins was evident even in the small fish. The erosion of the caudal, anal and ventral (or pelvic) fins was more prominent in the larger fish. Variations in the fin indices of the caudal, anal and ventral fins suggested that there was little variation between <b>rearing</b> <b>units</b> on the same farm, but that there was significant variation between individual fish in the same <b>rearing</b> <b>units,</b> and between fish on different farms...|$|R
50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit ring gear from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that ring gear. From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same ring gear in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that ring gear were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> band was not applied for reverse, the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|E
50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the <b>rear</b> <b>unit</b> ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Standardized larval <b>rearing</b> <b>units</b> for {{mosquito}} production {{are essential}} {{for the establishment of}} a mass-rearing facility. Two larval <b>rearing</b> <b>units,</b> developed respectively by the Guangzhou Wolbaki Biotech Co. Ltd. (Wolbaki) and Insect Pest Control Laboratory, Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture (FAO/IAEA-IPCL), are tested to assess their potential uses to mass-rear the larval stages of Aedes albopictus in support of the establishment of a medium-scale mosquito facility for the application of mosquito genetic control strategies. Methods The triple Wolbachia-infected Ae. albopictus strain (HC strain) was used in this study. The effects of larval densities of two larval rearing trays (corresponding to 2. 4, 3. 0 and 3. 6 larvae/cm 2) and tray size/position (top, middle and bottom layers) on the pupae production and larval survival were assessed when trays were stacked within the larval <b>rearing</b> <b>units.</b> The male pupae production, female pupae contamination after sex separation, and male mating competitiveness were also studied by using both larval <b>rearing</b> <b>units</b> in their entirety. Results The optimal larval rearing density for Wolbaki-tray (Wol-tray) was 6, 600 larvae (equal to 3. 0 larvae/cm 2) and 18, 000 larvae (3. 6 larvae/cm 2) for the FAO/IAEA-IPCL tray (IAEA-tray). No significant difference in pupae production was observed when trays were stacked within top, middle or bottom layers for both units. At thirty-four hours after the first pupation, the average male pupae production was (0. 89 × 105) for the Wol-unit and (3. 16 × 105) for the IAEA-unit. No significant difference was observed in female pupae contamination between these two units. The HC males showed equal male mating competitiveness to wild type males for mating with wild type females in large cages, regardless of whether they were reared in the Wol-unit or IAEA-unit. Conclusions The current study has indicated that both the Wol-unit and IAEA-unit are suitable for larvae mass-rearing for Ae. albopictus. However, the IAEA-unit, with higher male production and less space required compared to the Wol-unit, is recommended to be used in support of the establishment of a medium-sized mosquito facility...|$|R
