5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest <b>radar,</b> <b>satellite</b> and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E

25|$|USA 193, {{also known}} as NRO launch 21 (NROL-21 or simply L-21), was an American {{military}} reconnaissance satellite launched on December 14, 2006. The USA-193 was owned by the NRO and its precise function and purpose are classified. However, several websites speculate that the satellite was probably a high resolution <b>radar</b> <b>satellite</b> intended to produce images for the NRO. This argument is additionally supported {{by the fact that}} the satellite used a similar inclination to that of a Lacrosse <b>Radar</b> <b>Satellite.</b> Lacrosse is a terrestrial radar imaging reconnaissance satellite operated by the NRO. It utilizes a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to acquire high resolution images regardless of cloud cover.|$|E

This project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the ADEOS II (Midori) Earth Observation Mission.

25|$|In 2007, the C-27J {{was being}} {{considered}} as a sole-source C$3 billion contract by Canada as a future replacement for its current search and rescue air fleet. Alenia Aermacchi submitted its final bid {{a few weeks before}} the 11 January 2016 deadline. Alenia Aermacchi bid their C-27J FWSAR/MPA aircraft, a heavily modified C-27J for its role as a Search and rescue/Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Exclusive modifications and upgrades include a mission systems pallet from General Dynamics Mission Systems Canada, additional observation windows, an AESA search <b>radar,</b> <b>satellite</b> and ATC radios, flare/markers launchers, an electro-optical/infrared turret. Other enhancements include upgrades to avionics and performance such as a new flight management system. Alenia Aermacchi has bid up to 32 aircraft with lifetime maintenance from KF Aerospace and in-service support from General Dynamics Canada. The bids Canada will select from include the C-27J FWSAR/MPA, Airbus C-295 FWSAR, and the Embraer KC-390.|$|E
