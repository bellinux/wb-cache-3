5|$|Like their <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elapidae family, the {{majority}} of the Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E

5|$|After killing Yeates, Tabak {{attempted}} to cast suspicion {{for the murder}} onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands.

They met at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 31 December, where Tabak elaborated on his story, but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic work being carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a previous statement.|$|E

To save money, the family often left London during the summer, to take long visits to <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, in particular her brother Henry Tucker. Not until 1905 did the family lease a house in Brunswick Gardens, near Kensington Palace, when Dorothy returned home to live with her parents.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Anas, {{such as the}} American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would rather have a new apartment than the money.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{the development of}} the ICSI-SRI speech recognition system for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Spring 2006 Meeting Rich Transcription (RT- 06 S) evaluation, highlighting improve-ments made since last year, including improvements to the delay-and-sum algo-rithm, the nearfield segmenter, language models, posterior-based features, HMM adaptation methods, and adapting to a small amount of new lecture data. Results are reported on RT- 05 S and RT- 06 S meeting data. Compared to the RT- 05 S con-ference system, we achieved an overall improvement of 4 % <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MDM and SDM conditions, and 11 % <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IHM condition. On lecture data, we achieved an overall improvement of 8 % <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SDM condition, 12 % on MDM, 14 % on ADM, and 15 % on IHM. ...|$|R

5|$|Rodents {{are thought}} to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were {{severely}} affected by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European <b>relatives.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were allowed to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years.|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster has one close living relative, the {{beaded lizard}} (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Helodermatidae, the {{evolutionary}} history of which may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is better placed in a separate family.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, cigarette ends, and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from friends or <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from the canteen or the black market.|$|E

5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} B. grossa are adapted to a dry climate. The lower {{surfaces}} {{are protected by}} the strongly revolute shape of the leaf, the leaf margins curling around underneath almost to the mid-vein. The trichomes (leaf hairs) run along the mid-vein and the margins, further protecting the surface where the stomates are located, thus minimising water loss. Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series Abietinae developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|The life of {{the royal}} family was {{relatively}} quiet and withdrawn. The Athenian court was not as brilliant and sumptuous as that of Saint Petersburg, and days in the Greek capital were sometimes monotonous for members {{of the royal family}}. In spring and winter, they divided time between the Royal Palace in Athens, and Tatoi Palace at the foot of Mount Parnitha. Summers were spent on vacation at Aix-les-Bains in France, visiting <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian capital or at Fredensborg and Bernstorff in Denmark, and relaxing at Mon Repos, Corfu.|$|E
30|$|In {{separate}} estimations, {{we study}} both independent and joint effects {{of having a}} <b>relative</b> living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and receiving remittances during the presidential election cycle. While other studies have argued that having a close <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and receiving remittances is correlated and thus including both measures would lead to multicollinearity and inflated standard errors in OLS model estimates (Bravo, 2009), we believe that having a <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and receiving remittances, as opposed to only having a <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S., might convey different kinds of political information affecting non-migrant political interest. In our sample, {{it is the case}} that receiving remittances and having a U.S. relative is correlated, 4 as individuals receiving remittances must know someone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>in</b> order to receive contributions from migrants, but {{there is no evidence of}} multicollinearity. We proceed by studying first, if international migration affects the political interest of non-migrants in any capacity and second, if there is something systematically different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political awareness of those respondents that also receive material resources from kin abroad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Since we use the doubly robust estimation technique in conjunction with propensity score matching to avoid selection bias in our estimations, inflated standard errors arising from multicollinearity is less of a factor in our estimations and we are able to evaluate the independent and joint effects of having a <b>relative</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and receiving remittances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> logistic regression. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present sample, the majority of respondents do not receive remittances from the U.S. (87 %), but many do have a close <b>relative</b> living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. (46 %). Of those respondents that report having a U.S. relative, 20 % also receive remittances while 80 % do not. This provides additional support for analyzing the effects of social ties and material transfers separately.|$|R

5|$|The redback and its <b>relatives</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Latrodectus are {{considered}} dangerous, alongside funnel-web spiders (Atrax and Hadronyche), mouse spiders (Missulena), banana spiders (Phoneutria) and recluse spiders (Loxosceles).

The venom of the redback spider {{is thought to be}} {{similar to that of the}} other Latrodectus spiders. It contains a complex mixture of cellular constituents, enzymes and a number of high-molecular-weight toxins, including insect toxins and a vertebrate neurotoxin called alpha-latrotoxin, which causes intense pain in humans.|$|E
5|$|Their {{motives for}} {{escaping}} evolved over time.

By contrast, later escapees {{had grown up with}} the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its <b>relatives.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E
