5|$|By June 1954, 1.4 {{million acres}} of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had {{received}} land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial credit {{to the people who}} received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was twice as much as the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it.

25|$|As {{with many}} other {{microcredit}} methodologies, village banking eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and social pressure {{makes it possible for}} even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a <b>repayment</b> <b>rate</b> of over 97% in its worldwide network.|$|E
40|$|Unexpected {{increases}} {{in the cost of}} mortgage funds have imposed substantial losses on mortgage lenders. The losses are compounded by the decline in mortgage repayments as homeowners hang on to their low-rate mortgages. The enforcement of due-on-sale clauses is one option lenders have had to inhibit reductions in the turnover of low-rate mortgages. Recently a California Supreme Court ruling restricted the use of due-on-sale clauses. As a result, California state-chartered associations can no longer use due-on-sale clauses to raise mortgage rates. At the same time, most federally chartered associations in California continued the unrestricted enforcement of due-on-sale clauses. This paper examines the behavior of <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> at restricted state and unrestricted federal associations in California. The results suggest that for each percentage point new mortgage interest rates exceeded rates on existing mortgages, <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> at federal associations declined by 1. 532 percentage points. The inability to prevent mortgage assumptions caused <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> at state-chartered associations to fall 0. 406 percentage points more than federal association <b>repayment</b> <b>rates.</b> The additional decline has added substantial income losses to California state associations.

40|$|Various {{theories}} have arisen {{to explain why}} joint liability, group-based lending can be an improvement over traditional individual-based lending. But these theories are rarely tested. Here we exploit {{the idea that if}} a model were true, observed <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> would vary systematically. We sign the derivative of <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> with respect to (exogenous) change in covariates. The basic models are four representative and often cited models of joint liability lending, featuring moral hazard in project choice, monitoring by non-borrowing members, strategic default, and adverse selection. The paper places all these models on a common empirical footing, deriving and highlighting the key project selection, monitoring equation, default region, and risk selection equation, respectively. The paper also features some new implications, signing the derivative of <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> with respect to co-variation of returns, cooperation among borrowers, selection criteria, and loan size, for example. The models agree on some dimensions and conflict on others. For example, we find that several (but not all...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} what corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies, entrepreneurial and business skills and programmes for training and monitoring improve microbusiness performance and loan repayment rates: ‘To what extent do corporate social responsibility strategies, entrepreneurial and business skills and programmes for training and monitoring improve loan <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> of microfinance debtors in developing countries?’ MFIs that adopt CSR strategies provide for both financial and social empowerment services. Social empowerment services may include primary health care services, occupational skills training for microfinance debtors and debtor monitoring programmes. The 2008 credit crunch led many MFIs to abandon their CSR strategies. We analyse the case of uniCredit Ghana MFI and argue that CSR strategies contribute to {{public support for the}} MFI. This helps raise deposits and improves funding opportunities. Social empowerment investment improve microbusiness performance and loan <b>repayment</b> <b>rates.</b> We expect those MFIs that adopt CSR strategies to improve their sustainability, more than do MFIs that specialize in providing financial services only. We establish that those microfinance debtors who consider themselves endowed with entrepreneurial and business skills do not repay loans better than those microfinance debtors lacking these skills. Highly educated entrepreneurs do not repay their loans any better relative to those with primary or secondary education only. We establish that business experience is the only constituent of human capital that matters for business performance and loan <b>repayment</b> <b>rates.</b> Experienced microfinance debtors systematically repay their loans better than do those entrepreneurs lacking business experience. We observe that microfinance debtors do not agree on what skills they think are important for loan repayment probabilities. This result implies that every single microfinance debtor needs to acquire specific skills. Training programmes cannot be standardized and should be tailored towards the needs of the individual microfinance debtor. We establish that MFI loan officers neither agree on the ranking of specific skills they think are important for microfinance debtors to repay their loans promptly. This result suggests that MFI loan officers should be trained to better understand the relevance of specific entrepreneurial and business skills for microfinance entrepreneurs. We empirically establish that training programmes fail to improve loan <b>repayment</b> <b>rates.</b> Programmes for intensive microfinance debtor monitoring significantly improve loan <b>repayment</b> <b>rates.</b> Intensive monitoring is equally effective for highly and poorly educated, experienced and unexperienced, female and male microfinance debtors: MFIs may significantly improve <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> should they consistently monitor their microfinance debtors intensively...|$|R

Based on a primary survey of neighborhood groups in two communities, the study examines {{the dynamics of}} high <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> and the social impact of this micro-enterprise program. The study found that <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> are relatively lower in non-agricultural activities because of the marketing problems (resulting from the creation of non-tradables), while it is relatively successful in the agricultural sector. High <b>repayment</b> <b>rates</b> {{are found to be}} propelled by dynamic incentives like subsidies and the prospect of loan renewal. Finally, the study found that borrowers did considerable double-dipping (borrowing from other microfinance programs) and borrowed from non-institutional sources. This raises questions about their real indebtedness. Kudumbashree's real impact could be found in its social capital impact. It creates considerable social interactions among the poor and facilitates women's empowerment. Peer monitoring and peer mentoring interactions among the members of the group create positive externalities - a common knowledge pool and social safety nets. It is able to leverage these externalities with local governments, which enables women to exert influence in their communities' political power structures.

Not only are there bigger obstacles to surpass, like regulation and heavy competition, but also the main driver for microcredit, peer pressure, is almost inexistent.
