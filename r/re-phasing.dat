50|$|Social {{protection}} measures {{to ensure that}} piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer’s ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and discounts, bill <b>re-phasing</b> and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used {{at the national level}} in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{expression}} of the CCU/CCA/CCG-decoding tRNAPro 3 on a multicopy plasmid leads to suppression of several + 1 frameshift mutations in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Systematic analysis of the site of frameshifting indicates that excess tRNAPro 3 promotes near-cognate decoding at CCC codons. <b>Re-phasing</b> of the reading frame {{can be achieved by}} a subsequent slippage of the tRNA onto a cognate codon in the + 1 reading frame. Frameshifting appears to be due to an imbalance of CCC-cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, as the effect of excess tRNAPro 3 on reading frame maintenance can be reversed by increasing simultaneously the concentration of the cognate tRNAPro 2. Finally, the cmo 5 U modification present at position 34 of tRNAPro 3, which allows this tRNA to decode CCU in addition to CCG and CCA, also affects frameshifting, indicating that the ability of the near-cognate tRNA to decode a cognate codon efficiently in the alternative reading frame is important for <b>re-phasing</b> of the reading frame...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{challenging}} {{issue of how}} CP violation is realized in higher dimensional gauge theories without higher dimensional elementary scalar fields. In such theories interactions are basically governed by a gauge principle and therefore to get CP violating phases is a non-trivial task. It is demonstrated that CP violation is achieved {{as the result of}} compactification of extra dimensions, which is incompatible with the 4 -dimensional CP transformation. As a simple example we adopt a 6 -dimensional U(1) model compactified on a 2 -dimensional orbifold $T^{ 2 }/Z_{ 4 }$. We argue that the 4 -dimensional CP transformation is related to the complex structure of the extra space and show how the $Z_{ 4 }$ orbifolding leads to CP violation. We confirm by explicit calculation of the interaction vertices that CP violating phases remain even after the <b>re-phasing</b> of relevant fields. For completeness, we derive a <b>re-phasing</b> invariant CP violating quantity, following a similar argument in the Kobayashi-Maskawa model which led to the Jarlskog parameter.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} a + 2 °C global warming on {{temperature}} and precipitation over tropical Africa is examined, based on an ensemble of 12 regional climate model scenario simulations. These 12 scenarios are <b>re-phased</b> so that they all correspond to the same global warming of 2 °C with respect to pre-industrial conditions. The continental temperature increase is above the global average. If heat waves are defined with the same temperature threshold in the reference climate and in the scenario, their frequency increases {{by a factor of}} 10. When the temperature threshold is adapted to future conditions, there is still a slight increase in frequency. The average precipitation does not show a significant response, due to model-to-model spread. However two compensating phenomena occur, which are robust among the models: (a) the number of rain days decreases whereas the precipitation intensity increases, and (b) the rain season occurs later during the year with less precipitation in early summer and more precipitation in late summer. Simulated daily temperature and precipitation data are combined in two impact models, one for the hydrology of the Nile and Niger basins, one for the food security of the different countries. They show that the main feature of the climate change is not a continuous trend signal, but an alternation of dry and wet decadal to multidecadal episodes...|$|R

This configuration forms a star or “Y”-configuration {{that consists of}} in total six baselines in the sizes of 1.48 λ, 1.65 λ for the shortest baselines (N 2 -N 4 and N 2 -Z 1 /N 2 -Z 2) and 2.67 λ for the three longer baselines. The complex time series for each receiver pair combination is averaged for the experiment runtime to derive reliable phase differences. These averaged phase differences along the individual baselines are attributed to the length and their orientation to estimate the dominant (mean) position of the scattering structure, {{which is the same}} principle as Lau et al. (2006) described for the individual time series samples observing meteor echoes. The angular position of the scattered signal are estimated applying a least-squares inversion. The covered angular range of this antenna configuration using only the longest baselines reaches 14.4 ^∘ off the nominal beam pointing direction. The nominal beam pointing can be vertical (zenith) or off-vertical depending on the actual experiment settings. For off-vertical pointing directions, the complex raw data can also be <b>re-phased</b> to cover a symmetric area around zenith.

The full system used to generate the 40 eV radiation and collect the far-field speckle patterns is outlined and critical criteria discussed. The algorithms used to <b>re-phase</b> the data are outlined and some simple 1 -dimensional examples are given. The question of how to appropriately state the resolution of a coherent diffraction system is addressed and the concluding results are applied to the work in the experimental chapters, of which this thesis contains two. The first, is a published result which investigates the treatment of partial temporal coherence through the coherent diffraction process. Partial coherence for a high harmonic source is slightly more complex to treat than standard broad-bandwidth sources since the spectrum is modulated by the narrow-bandwidth harmonic comb underneath a broad-bandwidth envelope. An experimental investigation is presented by illuminating the same amplitude mask under broad-band and narrow band conditions using the same imaging systems. The results are discussed and conclude that a much greater than expected (20 %) relative bandwidth can used for such an experiment and still reproduce a reliable and fairly stable reconstruction. This construction is not a solution to the phase problem however, and hence only provides an improved support constraint for potential further processing.

30|$|Instead {{of using}} direct MAOA methods, {{typically}} using {{just a few}} antennas, the authors proposed to apply HDI, post statistics beam forming, to find the effective beam pointing due to better SNR. This suggestion bases {{on the idea of}} ideally making use of all antennas available in the array, <b>re-phasing</b> the individual subarrays data to steer the beam on reception to different positions searching for the maximum echo power. This method will certainly work for an antenna array split into a sufficient number of rather small antenna subarrays that are connected to individual receiver channels. For HDI a compromise between the size and number of subarrays needs to be found to have enough resolution without generating too large grating lobes. Promising results are shown for the BPMF in the review paper by Reid (2015) displaying the scatter between the nominal off-vertical beam pointing and zenith using 2  min HDI estimates as MAOA. This technique is potentially also advantageous for momentum flux studies with the Saura radar.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, various works {{based on the}} receiver-based PLC scheme have been proposed. Early PLC {{algorithms}} recover from packet at the receiver stage by inserting a silence, or noise, or previous packet [12]. Furthermore, a pitch waveform replication [13] and overlap-add interpolation [14] techniques have been developed as receiver-based PLC schemes. These techniques are easy to implement, but are known poor on speech quality at high packet losses. A linear prediction (LP)-based PLC algorithm which estimates the excitation signal of the missing segment by repeating the excitation signal of the previous received speech was described by Gunduzhan et al. [15]. More advanced approaches such as waveform similarity overlap-and-add (WSOLA) [16] and time-warping and <b>re-phasing</b> [17] methods have been proposed to produce a more natural sound. Recently, parametric regression approaches to PLC such as the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) [18] and hidden Markov model (HMM) [19] have been proposed where relevant codec parameters such as the pitch period, line spectral frequencies (LSFs), and codebook gain are estimated by using their specific models. However, these methods often introduce annoying artifacts for consecutive packet losses so that they cannot provide a high-quality output.|$|E

40|$|At Low Earth Orbits a {{differential}} in {{the drag}} acceleration between coplanar spacecraft {{can be used}} for controlling their relative motion in the orbital plane. Current methods for determining the drag acceleration may result in errors due to the inaccuracy of density models and misrepresentation of the drag coefficient. In this work a novel methodology for relative maneuvering of spacecraft under bounded uncertainties in the drag acceleration is developed. In order to vary the relative drag acceleration, the satellites modify their pitch angle. Two approaches are proposed. First, a dynamical model composed of the mean semi-major axis and argument of latitude is utilized for describing long range maneuvers. For this model, a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is implemented, accounting for the uncertainties in the drag force. This controller guarantees asymptotic stability of the system up to a certain magnitude of the state vector, which is determined by the uncertainties. Furthermore, based on a cartesian relative motion formulation, a min-max control law is designed for short range maneuvers. This provides asymptotic stability under bounded uncertainties. The two approaches are tested in numerical simulations illustrating a long range <b>re-phasing,</b> performed using the LQR controller, followed by a short range rendezvous maneuver, accomplished using the min-max controller...|$|E

Already several intriguing applications have developed, like HOMOGENIZED and IDEAL spectroscopy, that allow high resolution spectra to be obtained in inhomogeneous fields, such as in-vivo. The theoretical and experimental research in this thesis concentrates on the fundamental signal properties of DDF-based sequences {{in the presence of}} relaxation (T 1 and T 2) and diffusion. A general introduction to {{magnetic resonance}} phenomenon is followed by a more in depth introduction to the DDF and its effects. A novel analytical signal equation has been developed to describe the effects of T 2 relaxation and diffusing spatially modulated longitudinal spins during the signal build period of an HOMOGENIZED cross peak. Diffusion of the longitudinal spins results in a lengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time, delaying the <b>re-phasing</b> of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture.

40|$|One of todayâs {{challenges}} to realise computing based on {{quantum mechanics is}} to reliably and scalably encode information in quantum systems. Here, we present a photon source to on-demand deliver photonic quantum bits of information based on a strongly coupled atom-cavity system. The source operates intermittently for periods of up to 100 Î¼ s, with a single-photon repetition rate of 1 MHz, and an intra-cavity production efficiency of up to 85 %. Our ability to arbitrarily control the photonsâ wavepackets and phase profiles, together with long coherence times of 500 ns, allows to store time-bin encoded quantum information within a single photon. To do so, the spatio-temporal envelope of a single photon is sub-divided in d time bins which allows for the delivery of arbitrary qu-d-its. This is done with a fidelity of > 95 % for qubits, and 94 % for qutrits verified using a newly developed time-resolved quantum-homodyne measurement technique. Additionally, we combine two separate fields of quantum physics by using our deterministic single-photon source to seed linear optics quantum computing (LOQC) circuits. As a step towards quantum networking, it is shown that this photon source can be combined with quantum gates, namely a chip-integrated beam splitter, a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate {{as well as a}} CNOT 4 gate.

The tolerance of the needed precision of {{the parameters of the}} linearization mechanisms of all of these modulators is compared over the entire interesting range of noise bandwidth. A computer program was written to analyze the frequency dependence of any modulator transfer function under any set of functional inputs. The program is used to illustrate and compare the frequency dependence of the figures of merit of all of the modulators for which a d-c analysis was performed. Further analysis looks at the effect of greater noise-bandwidth and recovering the frequency-dependent degradation of gain and dynamic range through <b>re-phasing</b> techniques.

40|$|Increasing {{demands in}} speed, {{bandwidth}} and power efficiency in computing and communications {{has led to}} a burgeoning of the field of silicon photonics. Given their compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology, optical systems on silicon provide a low cost, scalable solution to meet future data demands. In this dissertation, we address some of the issues necessary for optics to become a viable platform for applications such as data centers and microprocessors. First, using the concepts in coupled mode theory and finite difference time domain modeling, add drop filters are designed using coupled vertical gratings. The filter is further applied for use as a 1 by 4 wavelength division multiplexer offering bandwidths and a free spectral range unparalleled by state of the art alternatives such as ring resonators. Next, the issue of group velocity dispersion engineering in photonic lightwave circuits is addressed. By incorporating linear chirp into a single vertical grating, quadratic phase may be imparted to an incident wave. To overcome the loss limitations associated with the chirped vertical grating operating in reflection, a coupled chirped vertical grating structure is introduced for operation in transmission. The high index contrast in the silicon-on-insulator platform implies that weak coupling and equivalently small bandwidths, are difficult to achieve in channel waveguide geometries. We present the theory and experimental demonstration of a cladding- modulated Bragg grating implemented using periodic placements of cylinders along a silicon waveguide which enable a wide range of coupling strengths to be realized. Next, group velocity dispersion engineering by varying the waveguide geometry is studied in silicon nitride. Nonlinear loss mechanisms such as two photon absorption are shown experimentally to be absent in the fabricated waveguides at high optical intensities. Two-fold broadening of an incident pulse is demonstrated, showing that silicon nitride is a viable nonlinear material. Finally, we present the first demonstration of a nonlinear optical pulse compressor implemented on silicon. Incident pulses undergoing self phase modulation followed by spectral <b>re-phasing</b> using dispersive elements result in temporal compression.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} {{specialist}} analyses were made on the material from old excavations of Mesolithic-Neolithic sites in the Danube Gorges. These new results altered significantly {{our understanding of the}} Lepenski Vir culture. The question of chronology of this regional phenomenon has been acute since the discovery of Lepenski Vir in the 1960 s, and it remains of key importance for understanding the character of Mesolithic-Neolithic transformations in this and the neighbouring regions. The most heated debate was fuelled by the initial stratigraphic and chronological attribution of the type-site itself. There remained the question about the adequate dating of the most prominent phase at this site characterized by buildings with trapezoidal bases covered with limestone floors and with rectangular stone-lined hearths placed in the centre of these features. There have been suggestions that these features also contain Early Neolithic Starčevo type pottery and other similar items of material culture and should thus be dated to the Early Neolithic historical context. Moreover, the first series of conventional radiocarbon determinations (21 dates) also suggested that the absolute chronology of these features should be confined to the period from around 6400 - 5500 cal BC (Fig. 1). Due to the importance of defining more precisely the chronology for the start of construction of these particular features at Lepenski Vir and for establishing the life-span of these buildings and their associated material culture, we have AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) dated a number of contexts from this site. The results are presented in this paper. The project was made possible through the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerate Dating Service (ORADS) programme funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) of the Great Britain. Apart from those dates presented in this paper, there are 29 previously published radiometric dates from Lepenski Vir 21 made by the conventional 14 C dating of charcoal and 8 AMS dates made on animal (3 dates) and human bones (5 dates). There is also a series of 20 new AMS dates made on human bones from Lepenski Vir. The last group of dates has not been published with all the contextual details and are of limited use in our analyses of absolute chronology and stratigraphy of Lepenski Vir. New dates are listed in Table 1. From 32 dated contexts from Lepenski Vir, 27 contexts are stratigraphically related to trapezoidal buildings while 5 dates are connected with the area outside of buildings. From those contexts related to trapezoidal structures, 24 contexts are dated with animal and 3 with human bones. The emphasis on the dating of animal bones is connected with problems of precision when dating samples made on human and dog bones due to the reservoir effect and the deposition of 'old' carbon. Dated remains of animal and human bones originate from the following types of stratigraphic contexts a) beneath building floors, i. e. stratigraphically the oldest contexts in the settlement (2 dates) (Fig. 2); b) between two superposed floors of trapezoidal buildings as 'sealed' contexts (8 dates) (Fig. 3); c) lying directly on top of the floors of trapezoidal buildings but not overlapped by a later floor (17 dates) (Fig. 3); d) outside of trapezoidal buildings, found in contexts such as pits, domed ovens, and burials, or in contexts that {{can be attributed to the}} occupation layer only (6 dates) (Fig. 4). The new dates indicate a very long duration of the Mesolithic period, from around 9400 to around 7500 cal BC (Fig. 2, 23). These early dates are concentrated in two particular periods that may point to two separate phases within these two millennia, with settlement discontinuities. It remains possible that there were many more occupation episodes that these dates do not encompass, and more AMS dates may indicate whether these two groupings with three dates per grouping are meaningful and representative of two separate and defined phases of occupation at this locale. This early period would correspond with the phase that the excavator of Lepenski Vir defined as Proto-Lepenski Vir although his ideas about the spatial distribution of this phase, its interpretation, duration and relation to the later phase of trapezoidal buildings must be revised in the light of new AMS dates and other available data. The phase with trapezoidal buildings most likely starts only around 6200 cal BC and most of the trapezoidal buildings might have been abandoned by around 5900 cal BC. The absolute span of only two or three hundred years and likely even less, for the flourishing of building activity related to trapezoidal structures at Lepenski Vir significantly compresses Srejović's phase I. Thus, it is difficult to maintain the excavator's five subphases which, similarly to Ivana Radovanović's more recent <b>re-phasing</b> of Lepenski Vir into I- 1 - 3, remain largely guess works before more extensive and systematic dating of each building is accomplished along with statistical modeling in order to narrow the magnitude of error. On the whole, new dates from these contexts better correspond with Srejović's stratigraphic logic of sequencing buildings to particular phases on the basis of their superimposing and cutting than with Radovanović's stylistic logic, i. e. her typology of hearth forms, ash-places, entrance platforms, and presence/absence of -supports around rectangular hearths used as reliable chronological indicators. The short chronological span for phase I also suggests that phase Lepenski Vir II is not realistic. This has already been shown by overlapping plans of the phase I buildings and stone outlines that the excavator of the site attributed to Lepenski Vir II phase. According to Srejović, Lepenski Vir phase II was characterized by buildings with stone walls made in the shape of trapezes, repeating the outline of supposedly earlier limestone floors of his phase I. However, the trapezoidal buildings must be envisioned as dug-in features with their rear, narrow side dug deep into the slope since these features were dug into the sloping terrace where the site is situated. It is more likely that these stone constructions assigned to a separate phase were part of the same trapezoidal buildings with limestone floors assigned by the excavator to phase I. Thus, vertical stone walls existed on the level above limestone floors, built in dry wall technique around buildings' floors and cuts. The visual overlap of phases I and II clearly shows the match between these stone constructions and trapezoidal limestone floors (Fig. 27). Even on the published section of the western part of the settlement of Lepenski Vir which runs through the backs of Houses 43, 34, 27, 20, 33 and 32, phase II is not marked (see Fig. 28), which might lend further support to our conclusion about its elusive character. Furthermore, no activity areas were reported with regard to the 'floor' level of these structures, with the exception of the largest building at the site, XLIV. Therefore, trapezoidal stone walls previously attributed to phase II were part of the same phase I buildings. Henceforth we suggest treating Srejović's phases I and II as a single phase and we refer to this building horizon as Lepenski Vir I-II (see Table 2). The new dating programme also suggests no temporal break between phases Lepenski Vir I-II and phase III. The dates indicate that Srejović was right to separate the latter as it seems that most of the trapezoidal buildings were abandoned by 5900 cal BC and that new and different occupation pattern commenced at the site in the period following 5900 cal BC. Yet, some of the dates indicate that, at the current resolution of the chronological scale there could have been some overlapping between the use of particular trapezoidal buildings, perhaps primarily for the interment of human burials (e. g. House 21 and Burials 7 /I and II, see Fig. 11), and the new types of contexts that appear around 5900 cal BC. These new contexts included a number of pits, dug primarily in the rear area of the site, outside of the zone with trapezoidal buildings. There are also several domed ovens the function of which remains unclear. Also, crouched inhumations became the dominant burial rite (of possibly migrant individuals) during this phase. Some of these crouched burials were found lying on the floors of trapezoidal buildings. This seems to have been the time of significant changes in patterns of habitation of the Lepenski Vir community. Bones of domestic animals were also found in those features assigned to phase III. We have directly dated four samples that come from domestic animals (sheep/goat, cattle and pig) found in these contexts at Lepenski Vir. In this way, it was possible to directly date the introduction of domestic animals to the site. The results suggest that the these domestic animals must have been introduced to Lepenski Vir in the post- 5900 cal BC period. The upper limit of this Middle Neolithic phase Lepenski Vir III remains to be elucidated further. While previous charcoal dates indicated that the site was used up until around 5400 cal BC, the upper limit of new dates is around 5700 cal BC. Existing dates from the neighbouring site of Padina suggest that some trapezoidal buildings at that site (Houses 15 and 18) might have been used up until 5500 cal BC. It is possible that future dates will move this limit to the end of the Middle Neolithic, i. e. c. 5500 cal BC. At this time, previously occupied sites on the Danube, such as Lepenski Vir, Padina, Vlasac, etc., were abandoned for more than a millennium. Lepenski Vir is used again during the Eneolithic period, when a burial of the Salkuţa culture, AMS dated to around 4300 cal BC, was interred here (see Burial 2, Fig. 25). New radiometric dates from Lepenski Vir, together with all other newly available data, demand a revision of conclusions previously made with regard to the absolute chronology of particular phases as well as stratigraphic attribution of certain contexts. Such a revision inevitably leads us to suggest a new stratigraphic division and phasing of Lepenski Vir (see Table 2). This revised phasing largely keeps the old nomenclature of the excavator of Lepenski Vir. We would like to avoid confusions and complications in suggesting completely new labels for particular phases when there is no need for such a radical break from the original understanding of the site's stratigraphy. We are aware that the future dating of Lepenski Vir may affect certain elements of our conclusions and that the suggested changes thus remain tentative. Yet, at present, our conclusions are firmly grounded in the available data...|$|E
