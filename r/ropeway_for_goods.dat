In addition to production of hard coke, BCCL operates washeries, sand gathering plants, a network of aerial <b>ropeways</b> <b>for</b> transport of sand, and a coal bed methane-based power plant in Moonidih.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{reliably}} monitor the operating status of one-way aerial <b>ropeways</b> <b>for</b> underground mine and better guarantee {{the safety of}} mine personnel, a hierarchical routing protocol based on energy efficiency and chain-type structure is proposed in this paper. Previous studies show that uniform cluster formation can prolong the lifetime of network. So a novel time allocation algorithm based on the residual energy of node is put forward {{to ensure that the}} starting time uniformly distributes in duration time of establishing network, when the nodes compete to become the cluster head node. Total energy consumption model based on free-space radio signal transmission model is used to search the optimal radius of node which can minimize total consumed energy of the network per round. The simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol is suitable for the operating status monitoring of one-way aerial <b>ropeways</b> <b>for</b> underground mine and the performance is better than LEACH...|$|R
50|$|As well as {{an aerial}} <b>ropeway</b> <b>for</b> {{transporting}} ore to the mill built in the late 1930s the mine also operated a small narrow gauge railway in the mine, utilising diesel and battery powered locomotives, one of which (Wingrove & Rogers Battery loco) {{is now at the}} Sprinfield Agricultural Railway, three 2 ft gauge wagons from the mine are to be found at the Moseley museum in Redruth Cornwall.|$|R

50|$|It {{differs from}} {{traditional}} cable ropeways {{by using a}} perfectly flat rolling way to limit the wear, rolling resistance and noise. The functions dedicated to rope tension and rolling way are handled by separate parts. Narrow span intervals (~50m) coupled with tension much higher than common <b>ropeway</b> allow <b>for</b> low sag, permitting high speed operation.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of {{decommissioning}} a society was founded, Världens längsta linbaneförening ("World's longest <b>ropeway</b> society"), <b>for</b> {{the preservation of the}} cableway. Section IV, one of the eight parts of roughly 13 km, was preserved and converted to passenger transport. As of 2013 it is still operated during the summer and a few other occasions by Linab i Norsjö AB.|$|R
30|$|The task of {{the optimal}} design of aerial {{passenger}} <b>ropeway</b> <b>for</b> the conditions of a highly urbanized environment and high irregularity of the earth’s surface {{is a very complex}} mathematical task. Indeed, with the distances between neighboring stations for boarding passengers, which are characteristic of ropeway lines, the number of variable parameters in the optimization problem can reach up to 100 unknown values. The number of these unknown quantities determines the dimension of the optimization problem. At the same time, it is also necessary to take into account 11 types of various structural, strength and operational constraints, which should be imposed on variables during the solution of the optimization problem. These constraints are expressed using 99 mathematical dependencies in the form of inequalities. Thus, the practical implementation of the proposed mathematical model and the problem of minimizing the objective function (Eq.  1) are possible only through the use of numerical mathematical methods and computer equipment.|$|R

50|$|One example {{involves}} spillovers {{from the}} labor market to the goods market. If there is labour market disequilibrium such that individuals cannot supply all the labor they want to supply, then the amount {{that they are able}} to supply will influence their demand for goods; the demand <b>for</b> <b>goods,</b> contingent on the constraint on the amount of labor that can be supplied, is their effective demand <b>for</b> <b>goods.</b> In contrast, if there were no labor market disequilibrium, individuals would simultaneously choose both their quantity of labor to supply and the quantity of goods to purchase, and the latter would be their notional demand <b>for</b> <b>goods.</b> In this example, the effective demand <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> would be less than the notional demand <b>for</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|R
