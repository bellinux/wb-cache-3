60|$|So {{the battle}} raged, and bruised knuckles, {{splinters}} in fingers, torn clothes, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>shoes,</b> {{were the only}} wounds received, while {{a great deal of}} fun was had out of the maltreated logs, and a lasting peace secured between two of the boys.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{was quite}} right,' {{returned}} his master, 'and you're a blockhead, possessing no judgment or discretion whatever. Tell {{him to come}} in, and see that he <b>rubs</b> his <b>shoes</b> for exactly five minutes first.' ...|$|R
60|$|A small double knock, like a presumptuous single one, {{was that}} instant heard at the street-door. It was Tibbs; {{it could be}} no one else; for no one else {{occupied}} five minutes in <b>rubbing</b> his <b>shoes.</b> He had been out to pay the baker’s bill.|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} compositions of self-lubricating, plasma-sprayed, composite coatings with {{calcium fluoride}} dispersed throughout cobalt alloy-silver matrices were evaluated on a friction and wear apparatus. In addition, coatings of the cobalt alloys alone and of one coating with a nickel alloy-silver matrix were evaluated for comparison. The wear specimens consisted of two, diametrically opposed, flat <b>rub</b> <b>shoes</b> sliding on the coated, cylindrical {{surface of a}} rotating disk. Two of the cobalt composite coatings gave a friction coefficient of about 0. 25 and low wear at room temperature, 400 and 650 C. Wear rates were {{lower than those of}} the cobalt alloys alone or the nickel alloy composite coating. However, oxidation limited the maximum useful temperature of the cobalt composite coating to about 650 C compared to about 900 C for the nickel composite coating...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At your service, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, who {{had been}} {{stopping}} outside to <b>rub</b> his <b>shoes</b> clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat {{in one hand and}} a bundle in the other. 'Shall I shut the door, ma'am?' ...|$|R
40|$|Neural network {{systems were}} {{evaluated}} {{for use in}} predicting wear of mechanical systems. Three different neural network software simulation packages were utilized {{in order to create}} models of tribological wear tests. Representative simple, medium, and high complexity simulation packages were selected. Pin-on-disk, <b>rub</b> <b>shoe,</b> and four-ball tribological test data was used for training, testing, and verification of the neural network models. Results showed mixed success. The neural networks were able to predict results with some accuracy if the number of input variables was low or the amount of training data was high. Increased neural network complexity resulted in more accurate results, however there was a point of diminishing return. Medium complexity models were the best trade off between accuracy and computing time requirements. A NASA Technical Memorandum and a Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers paper are being published which detail the work...|$|R
50|$|As an example, when {{a person}} walks over a nylon carpet, the <b>rubbing</b> of <b>shoes</b> on carpet {{performs}} {{the role of a}} battery and resistor, while the person acts as a capacitor (C1 and C2), and the air between a hand and a door knob is a spark gap. Stray inductance acts as L.|$|R
50|$|Haglund's {{deformity}} (also {{referred to}} as Mulholland deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, posterior calcaneal tuberosity, and pump bump) is a bony enlargement {{on the back of}} the heel that most often leads to painful bursitis, which is an inflammation of the bursa (a fluid-filled sac between the tendon and bone). In Haglund's deformity, the soft tissue near the Achilles tendon becomes irritated when the bony enlargement <b>rubs</b> against <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hetty essayed to draw {{her foot}} farther beneath {{the hem of}} the dusty skirt, and the colour grew a trifle plainer in her face; but Ingleby made a little reproachful gesture, and taking up the <b>shoe</b> <b>rubbed</b> it with his handkerchief.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of special {{features}} that may be used to ornament a floor or perform a useful service. Examples include Floor medallions which provide a decorative centerpiece of a floor design, or Gratings used to drain water or to <b>rub</b> dirt off <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main cause}} is a type-I {{hypersensitivity}} reaction to products containing abietic acid, {{such as the}} rosin/colophony, which is commonly used as a friction-increasing agent. Players of bowed string instruments (violin, viola, cello, double bass) rub cakes or blocks of rosin on their bow so it can grip the strings. Ballet and flamenco dancers sometimes <b>rub</b> their <b>shoes</b> in powdered rosin to reduce slippage before going on stage. Gymnasts, baseball pitchers and ten pin bowlers use rosin to improve grip. Common locations of this contact dermatitis are hands, face and neck.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman at}} whose cabin Harry found himself was Charity Allen, and a good, {{sensible}} woman she was. She made Harry hurry into the house, {{and she got}} him her husband's Sunday trousers, which she had just washed and ironed, and insisted on his putting them on, while she dried his own. She hung his stockings and his coat before the fire, and made {{one of the boys}} <b>rub</b> his <b>shoes</b> with a cloth so as to dry them as much as possible before putting them near the fire.|$|R
5000|$|Some of his carvings are painted, stained or <b>rubbed</b> {{with black}} <b>shoe</b> polish and adorned with rhinestones and pearl beads. He also used metal punches and stamps, {{of his own}} design, to create lizard-like surface textures, as in the pair of {{serpentine}} sculptures [...] "Beast With Wings" [...] and [...] "Created Beast With Many Heads." ...|$|R
50|$|Plantar fibromatosis is most {{frequently}} {{present on the}} medial border of the sole, near the highest point of the arch. The lump is usually painless and the only pain experienced is when the nodule <b>rubs</b> on the <b>shoe</b> or floor. The overlying skin is freely movable, and contracture of the toes does not occur in the initial stages.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the walk}} began, Wallenda {{realized}} the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat {{on his hands}} and <b>rubbed</b> his <b>shoes</b> for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying [...] "Thank you, Jesus." [...] Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. [...] Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.|$|R

2500|$|Before his death, {{the state}} of Oklahoma {{commissioned}} a statue of Rogers, to be displayed {{as one of the}} two it has in the National Statuary Hall Collection of the United States Capitol. Rogers agreed on the condition that his image would be placed facing the House Chamber, supposedly so he could [...] "keep an eye on Congress". Of the statues {{in this part of the}} Capitol, the Rogers sculpture is the only one facing the Chamber entrance. According to Capitol guides, each US president <b>rubs</b> the left <b>shoe</b> of the Rogers statue for good luck before entering the House Chamber to give the State of the Union address.|$|R

"I don't {{know what}} you mean, Bows," [...] said Miss Fotheringay, placidly, <b>rubbing</b> the second <b>shoe.</b> [...] "If he had had half of the two {{thousand}} a year that Papa gave him, or the half of that, I would marry him. But what is the good of taking on with a beggar? We're poor enough already. There's no use in my going to live with an old lady that's testy and cross, maybe, and would grudge me every morsel of meat." [...] (Sure, it's near dinner time, and Suky not laid the cloth yet.) [...] "And then," [...] added Miss Costigan quite simply, [...] "suppose there was a family?--why, Papa, we shouldn't be as well off as we are now." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Adams, {{an early}} version of the song was about Cardinals bassist Chris Feinstein, who died in December 2009. In August 2011, Adams stated: [...] It was a {{difficult}} song to write. The first version was called [...] "Chris". I was trying to write a song for my friend and former bandmate who passed away. The song I wrote was too direct, and I realised that there needed to be more self-reflection. I needed to make this feeling relatable to others, so that it could be relatable back to myself. In some strange way, it needed to be more altruistic, by being more first-person. It's a very strange concept, but when I listen to songs, I need to feel the narrator's <b>shoes</b> <b>rubbing</b> against my feet, you know? I needed to put myself in that place." ...|$|R
5000|$|Oklahoma leaders asked Rogers to {{represent}} the state {{as one of their}} two statues in the Capitol, and Rogers agreed on the condition that his image would be placed facing the House Chamber, supposedly so he could [...] "keep an eye on Congress".

According to guides at the Capitol, each President <b>rubs</b> the left <b>shoe</b> of the Rogers statue for good luck before entering the House Chamber to give the State of the Union address.Oklahoma has named many places and buildings for Rogers. His birthplace is located two miles east of Oologah, Oklahoma. The house was moved about ¾ mile (1.2 km) to its present location overlooking its original site when the Verdigris River valley was flooded to create Oologah Lake. The family tomb is at the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in nearby Claremore, which stands on the site purchased by Rogers in 1911 for his retirement home. On May 19, 1944, Rogers's body was moved from a holding vault in Glendale, California, to the tomb; his wife Betty was interred beside him later that year upon her death. A casting of the Davidson sculpture that stands in National Statuary Hall, paid for by Davidson, resides at the museum. Both the birthplace and the museum are open to the public.|$|R
