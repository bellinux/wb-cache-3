Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

30|$|If d< c, then Q is {{decreasing}} on (-∞,-c], so Q has at most one <b>root</b> <b>in</b> this interval. Therefore Q {{has at least}} three <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> the interval (-c, 0).

According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.|$|E

40|$|Root–soil contact {{entails a}} {{trade-off}} between uptake opportunities and aeration requirements. A single <b>root</b> <b>in</b> {{the center of}} a cylinder of soil has been the standard geometry for which most root-level water and nutrient uptake models have been derived. However, this implies assumptions about complete root–soil contact and regularly spaced, parallel roots that do not conform to the situation in the field. In reality, the frequency distribution of transport distances will differ from what the cylinder model assumes, both by partial root–soil contact and irregular three-dimensional (3 -D) distribution. We derived analytical equations describing the transport of water and nutrients to and uptake by <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> partial contact with soil for two extremes: (i) part of each <b>root</b> <b>in</b> contact or (ii) part of all <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> full contact and the rest without.
