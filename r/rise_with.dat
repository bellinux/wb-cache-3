5|$|Increase {{the supply}} of labor and {{aggregate}} compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021-2025 period. CBO cited the ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> income as disincentives to work, so repealing the ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more hours of labor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
6000|$|It begins, [...] "If ye then be <b>risen</b> <b>with</b> Christ." [...] Now {{that does}} not mean that St. Paul had any doubt whether the Colossians, to whom he was speaking, were <b>risen</b> <b>with</b> Christ or not. He does not mean, [...] "I am not sure whether you are risen or not; but perhaps you are not; but if you are, you ought to do such and such things." [...] He does not mean that. He was quite sure that these Colossians were <b>risen</b> <b>with</b> Christ. He had no doubt of it whatsoever. If you look at the chapter before, he says so. He tells them that they were buried with Christ in baptism, in which also they were <b>risen</b> <b>with</b> Christ, through faith of the {{operation}} of God, who has raised Him from the dead.|$|R

Maintenance {{grants are}} also {{available}} to current students in England, although these are scheduled to cease with the 2016-17 academic year. Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016-17, when the maintenance grant system is phased out. There will be {{a vote in the}} autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017-18 year. Several universities have already advertised fees of £9,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how William Adam became a {{successful}} architect from these beginnings, but by 1721 he was engaged on major projects at Floors Castle, where he executed a design by Vanbrugh, and designing extensions to Hopetoun House. John Gifford links Adam's <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> the retirement of James Smith, the most prominent architect of the early 18th century, who was in his 70s by this time. Like Smith, Adam was a trained mason, had social connections through his family, and had the financial backing of successful business ventures. It was in 1721 that Adam became a Freemason being initiated in The Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel), No.1.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{continued}} his <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> a more productive and consistent second season {{with both the}} ball and bat. In his second match in 1906–07, Macartney broke through for his first century, scoring 122 before taking match figures of 4/92 in an innings win over Queensland. In the next match, he took his first five-wicket innings haul, recording figures of 5/18 and 2/17 in an innings win over South Australia, including leading Test batsman Clem Hill twice. Macartney took wickets in each match; he ended the season with 405 runs at 40.50, with two further fifties, and took 30 wickets at 18.20 in nine matches.|$|E

Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites though Asian home ownership has doubled.

Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record. They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E

5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the <b>rise,</b> <b>with</b> these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while all {{construction}} was stayed, Reclamation conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the dam site, even though these delays caused {{the cost of the}} project to <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> every passing year. The studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn Dam site, with many folds of metamorphic rock formed by the contact of the foothill rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada. Reclamation predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey projected a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, Reclamation redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch gravity dam, to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Public {{transport}} in Kuala Lumpur and {{the rest}} of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to <b>rise</b> <b>with</b> the opening of 2 light metro (LRT) extension lines on 30 June 2016. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light metro (LRT), monorail, commuter rail and Airport rail link. The LRT system has 2 lines namely, Kelana Jaya Line and Ampang Line, connecting many locations in the city with major suburbs in Greater Kuala Lumpur. The Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter runs between the city and the suburbs. The main rapid transit hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the rail systems. KL Sentral is also a hub for intercity railway service namely KTM Intercity and KTM ETS. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more train lines due for completion or in the pipeline. In December 2016, the 1st phase of Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Project, Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line was completed, the remaining phases of the line has been open in July 2017, providing a more efficient ride around Greater Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
