25|$|If the {{end-user}} {{accepts the}} OpenID provider's request {{to trust the}} <b>relying</b> party, then the user-agent is redirected back to the <b>relying</b> party along with the end-user's credentials. That <b>relying</b> party must then confirm that the credentials really came from the OpenID provider. If the <b>relying</b> party and OpenID provider had previously established a shared secret, then the <b>relying</b> party can validate {{the identity of the}} OpenID provider by comparing its copy of the shared secret against the one received along with the end-user's credentials; such a <b>relying</b> party is called stateful because it stores the shared secret between sessions. In contrast, a stateless or dumb <b>relying</b> party must make one more background request (check_authentication) to ensure that the data indeed came from the OpenID provider.|$|R

5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} <b>relies</b> on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, {{it is argued that}} radiometric dating technique of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay <b>relies</b> on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E
