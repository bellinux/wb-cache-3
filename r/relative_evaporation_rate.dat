40|$|Evaporation from {{bare soil}} {{surfaces}} represents an important water loss for agriculture in semi-arid regions, Numerous {{efforts have been}} undertaken to modify the topsoil characteristics (mulching, tillage) {{in order to create}} a thin dry topsoil that reduces evaporation. However, little attention was paid to the role of natural rock fragments in topsoils with respect to evaporation. This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments simulating evaporation from initially wet and air-dry soils containing a range of rock fragment contents, and compares them to field conditions, Evaporation was stimulated by blowing fans at one (high) evaporative demand (E(o) = 7. 7 - 9. 2 mm day(- 1)). Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to investigate the relation between the water content of the topsoil and the actual evaporation rate. For soils at field capacity, initial fine earth water content decreases with rock fragment content, and consequently evaporation rates decrease in the same order. For air-dry soils that received a limited amount of rain (10 and 20 mm), an opposite behaviour was observed. Initial fine earth water content and evaporation rates increase with rock fragment content. A strong positive sigmoidal relation between <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> (actual over open-pan evaporation rates) and fine earth water content in the centre of the wetted soil section was observed during the laboratory experiments. Except for the columns covered with a mulch, there were no systematic differences in this relation between the treatments, A rock fragment mulch reduces evaporation rate at a given soil water content significantly, These trends explain the often ambivalent effects of rock fragments on evaporation rates in the field. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Plastic film mulch {{technology}} is a cropping system feature for water saving that is used extensively in and and semiarid areas of northwest China. When evaporative demand is fairly strong, film mulching can greatly reduce soil water evaporation. However, research on water flow beneath and through various open hole ratios of the perforated film mulches is limited, and questions concerning soil water flow and soil heat transfer {{for this type of}} water-saving system remain unanswered. It is, therefore, very important to perform research on soil water evaporation and soil temperature distribution with various open hole ratios of the perforated plastic mulches. A series of soil water evaporation experiments using different open hole ratios of perforated plastic mulches was conducted. The columns received mulches with various open hole ratios: 0 % (covered with a solid plastic mulch), 1. 39 %, 2. 84 %, 7. 24 %, 30. 5 %, and 100 % (nonmulched bare surface). In conjunction with the water movement of evaporation from film hole studies, soil temperature distributions were also analyzed. Our measurements indicated that film hole mulch had a restraining effect on evaporation and that the restraining effect decreased with the increase in open hole ratios. Compared with bare soil evaporation, the percentage of evaporation reduction rates for open hole ratios of 0 %, 1. 39 %, 2. 84 %, 7. 24 %, and 30. 5 % were 69. 26 %, 33. 09 %, 22. 80 %, 20. 05 %, and 11. 82 %, respectively. The results showed a linear relationship between cumulative water evaporation and square root of time for the different open hole ratios of the perforated plastic mulches, and the coefficients of the linear function, i. e., the C parameters, were fitted well with the open hole ratios-u(C = 0. 0101 u(0. 1019) + 0. 0075). On this basis, mathematical relations of <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> and evaporation based on hole areas of perforated plastic mulches were analyzed and discussed. These results extend the Gardner evaporation equation to bare soils to include water evaporation from soils covered by various perforated plastic mulches. The resulting equations presented in this paper provide an approach for describing evaporation from plastic mulch-covered soil...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Chlorpyrifos-methyl, an {{organophosphate}} insecticide, and propoxur, a carbamate insecticide both {{widely used}} in Thailand, were studied in the laboratory for degradation and behavior in two Thai and two Oregon soils. The {{purpose of the study}} was to ascertain the comparative persistence and to measure behavior such as adsorption, evaporation and leaching in the soil environment as a background for predicting or estimating the hazard that may be presented by these two chemicals. The degradation studies of chlorpyrifos-methyl were conducted on four different soils; clay and loamy sand from Thailand, and silt loam and loam soil from Oregon. The variables used included three different temperatures: 1. 7 C (35 F), 23 C (70 F), and 32 C (89. 6 F); three moisture contents: saturation, field capacity, and midway between field capacity and wilting point at a temperature of 30 C; and pH of 6. 5 and 7. 3 for the loamy sand at moisture content midway between field capacity and wilting point at 30 C temperature. The effect of the two chemicals on microorganismal activity was studied using [superscript 14]C-glucose as an indicator in clay and silt loam soils at 30 C at saturated moisture content. The adsorption of chlorpyrifos-methyl on clay and silt loam soils was determined at 23 C. The vapor pressure of propoxur at 23 C and 32 C was determined. The evaporation rate of chlorpyrifos-methyl and propoxur from clay and silt loam soils at 32 C was measured. Leaching of the two chemicals in clay and silt loam was measured in soil columns to compare their mobility. Considerable variation at different sampling intervals in the degradation study made precise calculation of half-life and rate impossible. However, a consistent trend in degradation as affected by each environmental factor was apparent. The chlorpyrifos-methyl degradation rate responded to temperature: 32 C > 23 C > 1. 7 C; and moisture: midway between field capacity and wilting point > field capacity > saturation; soils: loamy sand > clay > silt loam > loam. Both chlorpyrifos-methyl and propoxur showed degradation in loamy sand at pH 7. 3 > pH 6. 5. The effect on microbial activity as evidenced by [superscript 14]C- glucose metabolism was chlorpyrifos-methyl > propoxur on silt loam and propoxur > chlorpyrifos-methyl on clay soil. The microbial activity depended on the concentration of these two chemicals, and was 100 ppm > 500 ppm > 1000 ppm for a 1 - 3 hours incubation period. Metabolism with the chemicals was higher than the control after 4 hours. The distribution coefficient (Kd) of chlorpyrifos-methyl was 93. 1 on clay and 76. 9 on silt loam. The <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> of chlorpyrifos-methyl was field capacity > air dry soil and silt loam > clay soil. The vapor pressure of pure propoxur determined at 23 C was 3. 5 x 10 ⁻⁶ mm Hg and 1. 5 x 10 ⁻⁵ mm Hg at 32 C. The calculated latent heat of evaporation was 29 Kcal/mole. Chlorpyrifos-methyl was less mobile than propoxur. The leachate of chlorpyrifos-methyl contained less than 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % of the initial concentration for the clay and silt loam soils respectively, but 56 % and 60 % of propoxur was found leached from the clay and silt loam soils...|$|E

40|$|A {{sediment}} core from Lake Butrint {{in southwestern}} Albania contains an annually-layered sequence coveringthe last ∼ 300 years. It provides thus an exceptionally well-dated time series to study past climate-drivenenvironmental changes, {{as well as}} anthropogenic perturbations {{along the coast of}} the Ionian Sea. The varvesare composed of organic-rich carbonate couplets and detritus-dominated clay layers. The first are depositedduring spring-to-fall, and reflect the chemistry of the lake, which, in turn, is sensitive to 1) the relativeimportance of marine versus freshwater inputs, 2) <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates,</b> and 3) the productivity cyclewithin the lake. The detrital laminae are deposited during winter, reflecting precipitation and runoffconditions during the wet season. A 2 – 3 ‰ stable carbon isotope ratio shift in both bulk organics andauthigenic carbonates was attributed to increasing eutrophication {{towards the end of the}} 20 th century, andvalidated by historical and instrumental data. An increase in the δ 18 O of authigenic carbonates by more than 8 ‰ indicates the progressive salinization of the lake, which can primarily be attributed to man-madeperturbations that reduced the freshwater input to the lake and/or enhanced the exchange with seawaterfrom the nearby Ionian Sea. A recent increase in the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> versus precipitation <b>rates</b> may haveadditionally contributed to the observed 18 O enrichment in the Lake Butrint carbonates. The interdecadalcyclicity in the thickness of the detrital laminae seems to be at least partially controlled by NAO and/orENSO-like phenomena that modulate precipitation patterns in the eastern Mediterranean. Thus, this studydemonstrates the potential of combining microstratigraphic and stable isotopic tools to disentangleanthropogenic and natural environmental changes in Lake Butrint, validated by historical records...|$|R

Evaporation from protonated and negatively charged water cluster have yielded size dependent heat capacities, where the smallest sizes {{with fewer than}} 21 molecules show a heat capacity similar to bulk ice whereas clusters with molecules between 21 and 300 have a heat capacity in between that of ice and liquid water. The increase in heat capacity per added molecule in the cluster indicates that the intramolecular degrees of freedom are frozen at the temperatures in the experiment (T≈ 160 K). Experiments on small mixed water-ammonia clusters resulted in <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> fractions for sizes between {{a total of three}} to eleven molecules, and 16 molecules.

The cooling of the molecule could be divided into a thermionic emission part and a radiative part, where the crossover between the two occurred at 5 ms, after which radiation was shown to be the dominant cooling channel. The spontaneous decay profiles were used to extract decay parameters of the large organic anion zink phthalocyanine (ZnPc). Numerical simulations of the decay process show good agreement with measurements, using parameters derived from an analytical approximation also used for fullerenes.

Accurate predictions of bare soil evaporation can {{serve as the basis}} for decisions to increase the acreage planted with a given crop. An alternative is presented to previous approaches to bare soil evaporation estimation by empirically correlating the ratio of daily totals of actual to potential evaporation and the amplitude of the diurnal surface soil temperature wave.

40|$|The <b>rate</b> of <b>evaporation</b> {{from the}} Great Salt Lake (GSL) water surface is a {{function}} of local meteorological conditions, the temperature, and the salinity of the water surface. Several factors affect evaporation from free water surfaces. One of these factors is the salinity of the evaporating surface. Previous work studied the hydrology of salt flats and established <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates,</b> under natural field conditions, for brines from Bonneville (GSL) containing various amounts of dissolved solids. Other approaches used pan evaporation data to evaluate and quantify the effect of salinity and water chemistry on evaporation. The effect of salinity on evaporation is important for water balance computations and other engineering studies related to terminal lakes of which the GSL is one. The molecular activity of water is reduced as its salinity increases because molecules of dissolved solids interfere with the motion of water molecules. This has the effect of reducing the saturation vapor pressure over a saline water surface. This paper examines the role played by this effect on the GSL evaporation. Analysis of the GSL’s salinity and volume revealed that to a reasonable approximation the total salt load (3, 500 M ton) may be taken as constant. We showed that salinity of the GSL reduces the amount of the saturation vapor pressure of the GSL surface by representing the saturation vapor pressure contours of the north and south arms. The results of this study show that salinity has an impact on the evaporation which is controlled by area and affects the GSL level/volume. As the level of the GSL increases, salinity decreases which directly affects the evaporation by increasing the tendency of the water vapor to escape the water surface to the air. This contribution of salinity towards evaporation will be useful in modeling the Great Salt Lake and thereby contributing to understanding of surface hydrology of the whole system that drains to the GSL. Moreover, adding the lake salinity effect in the modeling of the Great Salt Lake system hydrology would improve, and enhance knowledge of interactions between hydrologic processes...|$|R

40|$|Evaporation from nonsaturated {{surfaces}} is investigated. The {{concept of}} potential evaporation is first examined; {{a series of}} definitions are developed and classified, and it is shown {{that the relationship between}} potential and actual <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> depends on the controlling variables in the chosen definition for potential evaporation. Extending the work of Penman (1948) to the unsaturated case, a general equation is derived to describe evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces. Applying Bouchet's (1963) hypothesis with a consistent set of definitions also leads to the same general equation. To account for departures from the saturated condition, the equation makes use of the concept of <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation,</b> the ratio of the actual <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> to the rate which would occur under the prevailing atmospheric conditions if the surface was saturated at the actual surface temperature. A relationship is established between the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation,</b> G, and a dimensionless parameter called the relative drying power, D, the ratio of the drying power (the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> which would occur if the surface was saturated at the actual air temperature) to the sum of the drying power and the net available energy. The relationship is non-dimensional and appears to be single-valued. An experimental investigation of evaporation from bare soil and growing wheat is carried out; data from an energy balance installation show that the G-D estimates of evaporation are in close agreement with calculations obtained using the Bowen ratio approach. The data are also used to refine the relationship between <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> and <b>relative</b> drying power. The G-D estimates of evaporation also agree closely with independent estimates obtained from the soil water balance at three sites during the growing season. The combination of this G-D relationship with the derived general evaporation equation constitutes a simple model for obtaining estimates of evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces; no prior estimate of the potential evaporation is required, and the surface conditions of temperature and humidity need not be known. A preliminary relationship is found for the vapour transfer coefficient (used in a Dalton type transfer equation) for daily time periods. Algorithms are presented for the estimation of daily net radiation and for soil heat flux. A new approach is proposed for the application of remotely-sensed surface temperature data to the estimate of regional evaporation. A relationship is derived between the surface temperature and the vapour pressure deficit in the air. The relationship allows for the use of remotely-sensed data in evaporation models such as that presented above. The method is shown to provide superior results to the simplified energy balance approach currently being applied...|$|R

Transpiration from one surface of field leaves gave the rate of transpiration in the same range. These data require the maximum RE for each vapour pressure deficit as the value identifying the onset of mesophyll regulation (possibly by aquaporins),which produces cyclic changes in the rates ofwater loss and transpiration.

We discuss the findings of this work in relation to the formation of nuclear star clusters by inspiraling globular clusters. Comment: MNRAS in pres...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} developed ultrahigh-vacuum quartz spring mass sorption microbalance has been utilized {{to measure the}} <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> of several low-volatility polymeric lubricating oils at various temperatures. The <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> are {{used to calculate the}} vapor pressures by the Langmuir equation. A method is presented to accurately estimate extended temperature range <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> and vapor pressure data for polymeric oils, incorporating appropriate corrections for the increases in molecular weight and the change in volatility of the progressively evaporating polymer fractions. The logarithms of the calculated data appear to follow linear relationships within the test temperature ranges, when plotted versus 1000 /T. These functions and the observed effusion characteristics of the fluids on progressive volatilization are useful in estimating <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> and vapor pressure changes on evaporative depletion...|$|R

Dependences {{of the mass}} <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> on the gas velocity, temperature difference between gas and liquid layer, and liquid layer thickness were obtained. The assumption about {{the formation of the}} concentration boundary layer at the interface was made. It is found that with increasing the gas flow velocity the gradient of vapor concentration in the gas phase increases; as a result the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> rises. When changing the liquid layer thickness, the local maximum of <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> was observed, but for 2 mm thickness layer two maxima were found. Probably, it is due the appearance of unstable structures on the liquid surface...|$|R

The results clearly evidenced the possibility to relate the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> of a wine with some dimensionless parameters deriving from the linear combination of the geometrical characteristics of the glasses. Moreover, {{it was possible to}} individuate a mathematical model relating the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> with the dimensionless parameters which could be usefully utilized to design new glasses able to enhance the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> of wines. This may enable consumers to fully perceive the "bouquet" of a wine, which represents a key component of its organoleptic qualities...|$|R

All the constructions {{we used to}} find <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> were dased {{on the fact that}} no fermions would move towards the Q ball. All these constructions left an opened question that is : what happens when a fermion interacts with a Q ball. We shall answer this question in this work by using the constructions done to compute <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates.</b> We shall also obtain a new approach to compute <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

The impact of furnace atmosphere composition and glass melt composition on the temperature dependent boron <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> has been investigated experimentally.

40|$|This {{work has}} the {{objective}} of estimate the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> from Itumbiara Reservoir, a tropical reservoir located in Brazil, using MODIS-derived water surface temperature (product MOD 11 A 1) and meteorological data acquired over water surface. The <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> was derived from latent heat flux, estimated through a mass transfer model. The estimates were carried out for the period between 1 / 1 / 2010 and 31 / 12 / 2010. The results showed that <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> tends to increase from January to September and then decrease from September to December. The <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> can reach values near 20 mm day- 1 in Itumbiara Reservoir during the dry season. The mean <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> for wet season was 3. 66 mm day- 1 and 8. 25 mm day- 1 during the dry season. The total water volume evaporated from Itumbiara Reservoir during 2010 was estimated at about 1. 7 billion of m³ (2, 300 mm) which represents 10 % of total reservoir volume. The advection {{seems to be the}} main transport mechanism which drives the evaporation in Itumbiara. Pages: 5808 - 581...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} polymer {{mixtures}} made by spin-coating can phase separate {{in two ways}} - by forming lateral domains, or by separating into two distinct layers. The latter situation - self-stratification or vertical phase separation - could be advantageous {{in a number of}} practical applications, such as polymer photovoltaics. In our experiments, we have used time-resolved small-angle light scattering and light reflectivity during spin coating to study the structure development in PS/PMMA and PFB/F 8 BT blends, solution cast in toluene. A sample cell was designed, made and mounted on the apparatus to manipulate the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate.</b> Having solved the Meyerhofer equation for thinning rate and by fitting the model to the experimental data, we are able to extract the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> of toluene during spin coating. We demonstrate that, by controlling the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> during the spin-coating process, we can obtain either selfstratification or lateral phase separation in the same system. We relate this to a previously hypothesised mechanism for phase separation during spin coating in thin films, according to which a transient wetting layer breaks up due to a Marangoni-type instability driven by a concentration gradient of solvent within the drying film. Our results show that a high <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> leads to a laterally phase separated structure, while reducing the <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate</b> suppresses the interfacial instability and leads to a self-stratified final film. Using the set up we developed to control the morphology through <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate,</b> we made preliminary photovoltaic devices. It is possible to control the efficiency of the polymer photovoltaics by means of process parameters such as <b>evaporation</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
