5|$|Moxon {{represented}} manager Ken Hoden of the Church of Scientology's Golden Era Productions in February 1998 when {{he filed}} a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against Keith Henson after Henson protested against Scientology in May 1997 and January 1998 outside the Golden Era film studios in Gilman Hot Springs, California. Moxon {{had argued that}} Henson was dangerous based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted on the Internet, and his knowledge {{in the fields of}} cryonics and explosives. Hoden received a temporary <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge refused to make the <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> permanent.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous. Both the injunction and the <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who {{was charged with}} disturbing an assembly of worship, disturbing the peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E

50|$|Another {{criticism}} is that <b>restraining</b> <b>orders</b> are sometimes used in divorce cases for tactical advantage. Joseph E.

Some attorneys offer to have <b>restraining</b> <b>orders</b> dropped in exchange for financial concessions in such proceedings.|$|R

5|$|The King County {{government}} {{entered into}} {{an agreement with}} the Dincov family in 1954 to operate a gravel mine on their East Redmond property. The Dincovs' neighbors, in opposition to the gravel mine, proposed to form an incorporated town in order to halt operations. A special election was held on August 14, 1956, and 108 residents voted in favor of incorporating East Redmond as a fourth-class town, while 67 opposed. The town's government passed an ordinance that prohibited the county's gravel mine operations, leading King County to seek a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against the town. East Redmond officials threatened to arrest county employees violating the ordinance, and the requested temporary <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> was denied by a Superior Court judge. The county was eventually denied an injunction that removed the town from interfering with the mine, due to expired and lapsed permits.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E
5|$|When The Daily Californian {{published}} {{excerpts from}} the Argonne letter on June 11, the DOE obtained {{a court order to}} prevent further publication. Undeterred, The Daily Californian published the letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, the DOE declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained a temporary <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> prohibiting The Daily Californian from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the Madison Press Connection on September 16. The government then moved to dismiss their cases against both The Progressive and The Daily Californian as moot.|$|E

5|$|Between the {{releases}} of Hilary Duff and Dignity, Duff's personal life was eventful. In October 2006, {{she and her}} boyfriend at the time, Joel Madden of punk rock band Good Charlotte, claimed {{that they were being}} stalked by Russian emigre Maksim Miakovsky and his roommate, paparazzo David Joseph Klein. According to a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> filed by Duff, Miakovsky came to the United States solely to pursue a relationship with her. He was later arrested after threatening to kill her. In November, she ended her two-year relationship with Madden. Around the same time, her parents Robert and Susan separated after 22 years of marriage following an affair between Robert and another woman.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{nevertheless}} obtained {{an injunction}} from a Virginia court {{to allow him}} to participate in the game, which was being held in Louisiana. In response, the NCAA threatened to remove the Independence Bowl's certification if Smith was allowed to play. When the bowl forbade Smith from participating, he obtained a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> from a Louisiana court to force the Independence Bowl {{to allow him to}} play. On the day of the game, the NCAA attempted to appeal the decision to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals, but a three-judge panel denied the appeal. By this time, the game was about to begin, and Smith was allowed to play.|$|E
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping a temporary <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for {{a hearing on the}} government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E

5|$|After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E
5|$|Before Hope and Liam's {{official}} legal {{wedding in}} the United States, Steffy spends {{a night on}} the town with Liam. Hope finds out and leaves Liam. Steffy and Liam are reunited, and she soon finds she is pregnant in early 2013. However, she keeps it to herself when she sees Hope and Liam kissing. Liam finds out about the pregnancy and recommits himself to Steffy, but shortly after their wedding she who loses the baby in a motorbike accident. Steffy then learns that her accident has left her infertile. Devastated, Steffy decides to divorce Liam and relocate to Paris. She returns to Los Angeles several months later for a brief visit, informing Liam that her infertility issues have been corrected, hoping that it could mean a second chance for them. Despite this, Liam insists that he is obligated to Hope, and Steffy leaves town again. After another short visit to Los Angeles in February 2015, Steffy returns months later to help Ridge take over Forrester Creations by overthrowing Rick. She becomes president of the company and rekindles her romance with Liam, ending his relationship with her cousin, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer). Steffy's cousin, Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), resents Steffy, attributed to the fact that Taylor had accidentally killed her mother, Darla (Schae Harrison), years ago in car accident. An unstable Aly attempts to kill Steffy on PCH, resulting in Steffy killing Aly with a tire iron in self-defense. However, Ivy recorded a video of the accident on her phone, not seeing the rock Steffy killed Aly with. Ivy gets involved with Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) and Ivy blackmails Steffy with the video, calling the accident a murder. Ivy decides to delete the video after Steffy tries to convince Wyatt to delete it. Thomas tells Steffy that he made out with Ivy while Wyatt was on a business trip. Steffy confronts Ivy and convinces her to tell Wyatt but tells Wyatt before Ivy has a chance. Wyatt breaks up with her and Ivy is angry at Steffy and confronts her in front of a broken electrical panel, resulting in an altercation in which Ivy gets electrocuted. Ivy survives and files a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against Steffy while Wyatt resumes his relationship with Ivy. Ivy realized she never got over Liam and convinces Liam to give them another chance if she drops the <b>restraining</b> <b>order.</b> Quinn overhears Ivy telling Liam she loves him and exposes this in front of Steffy and Liam while Wyatt is proposing to Ivy. Wyatt breaks up with Ivy and she packs her bags for Australia. On top of the staircase, Steffy confronts Ivy and she tumbles down. Liam is angry at Steffy and breaks up with her. Liam hits his head on the plane with Ivy, while Wyatt comforts Steffy. Liam disappears (he was really kidnapped by Quinn after having passed out due to concussion symptoms he acquired by hitting his head while on a plane and passing out in the parking lot of Forrester Creations and losing his memory as a result) and Wyatt tells her that Liam must have once again let her down. He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach. Steffy's marriage to Wyatt eventually breaks down due to their differing opinions about Quinn and they separate while Steffy contemplates divorcing Wyatt. She eventually rekindles her love and relationship with Liam, Liam proposes to Steffy and she accepts, and after Steffy's divorce from Wyatt was finalized, Steffy & Liam got married in Sydney; Australia.|$|E
5|$|Following Connor {{receiving}} Delia's corneas, Chloe {{began to}} become more attached to him. Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby scrapbook. While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and {{goes so far as}} blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment. Wanting outpatient treatment, she has to be placed under a conservatorship, and not wanting it to be under Esther, Kevin proposes to her and they abruptly marry again. Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a <b>restraining</b> <b>order</b> against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her and tears up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated when {{he was trying to get}} pregnant with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility. Kevin also accepted that he can't give Chloe the help she needs and Chloe accepts that she needs help. She chooses a facility in California, the night before leaving, she and Kevin make love one last time. She leaves town soon after, having had heartfelt goodbyes with her friends and family.
