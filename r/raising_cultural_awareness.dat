40|$|Prior {{research}} in the field of culture and language education depicts the close relation between language and culture. Furthermore, such research emphasises that in order to understand {{and to be able to}} use a language properly, one needs to acknowledge that language is culture. Today English is a global language and a tool for communication in working life, in studies and when travelling. Hence, to be able to communicate in English one needs to know the cultural codes in these specific settings. Moreover, language teaching has many dimensions and according to the curriculum, teachers have an obligation to <b>raise</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> amongst pupils as well as teach fundamental values. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate how secondary teachers and pupils view and work with culture and how these views can be connected to the curriculum and to the syllabus of English Lgr. 11. Through interviews with secondary pupils we found that their view of culture to an extent connects to the cultural content of the curriculum for Swedish compulsory school, Lgr. 11.

Methods: In a cross sectional ethnographical telephone survey, 400 adults were interviewed about 16 traditional physiognomy concerning teeth (in consultation with a Feng Shui specialist) Results: Most completed the interview (93 %, 373) Over half the study group (63 %, 234) claimed they had heard of aspects of physiognomy concerning teeth, and a quarter (24 %, 88) believed in such ideologies. Variations in knowledge and beliefs were apparent among people of different age (P< 0. 01), gender (P< 0. 05), educational attainment (P< 0. 01), economic status (P< 0. 01), place of birth (P< 0. 01) and religion (P< 0. 01). Their knowledge and belief in aspects of physiognomy concerning teeth was also associated with reported use of dental services (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Our {{multicultural}} world increasingly {{demands that}} we learn foreign languages {{to be able to}} interact effectively and appropriately with members of other cultures. This is of particular importance in fields such as government, education, and commerce. Effective intercultural interaction entails developed intercultural sensitivity, knowledge of cultural aspects as well as the ability to communicate in the language. This is known as Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC). The study of effective intercultural communication should be taught alongside the linguistic aspect of language. Yet, the teaching of culture in foreign language classes is often superficial. There is no consensus with regard to how develop and assess intercultural sensitivity and ICC and in the foreign language classroom. This study hypothesizes that an intercultural approach to teaching foreign languages facilitates the development of the learners’ intercultural communicative skills and linguistic proficiency while <b>raising</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness,</b> developing contextualized cultural knowledge, and fostering intercultural attitudes of respect and understanding for one’s own culture and the cultures of others. The study analyzes and assesses the development of intercultural sensitivity and ICC in a university advanced conversation and composition Spanish course called here the Intercultural Spanish Course. The curriculum for this course was designed specifically for this study and integrates linguistic and intercultural communication skills and knowledge. A mixed methods design was used: A) Quantitative instruments: 1. Hammer & Bennett’s (2001) Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) B) Qualitative instruments: 1. Pre/ post learners’ questionnaires 2. Pre/ post learners’ journals Bennett‘ s (1993) Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) was used to analyze the IDI pre/ post results. For the qualitative data analysis themes were categorized following Byram’s (1997) Model of Intercultural Communicative Competence (MICC). The results of the study show that 50 % of the learners developed their intercultural sensitivity toward an ethnorelative orientation whereas 50 % moved toward an ethnocentric orientation. Learners developed their ICC as they (1) gained deeper cultural knowledge of Spanish- speaking countries; (2) developed critical thinking skills and skills to interpret cultural differences in a more ethnorelative perspective; (3) showed intercultural attitudes of understanding other perspectives, interest in engaging in conversation with Spanish speakers and willingness to question their worldviews; (4) raised self- cultural- awareness; and (5) improved their language proficiency...|$|E

Intercultural {{communication}} and cultural awareness [...] Teachers roles and perspectives in <b>raising</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> [...] A {{critical analysis of}} cultural content in EFL materials [...] Cultural awareness raising through learner ethnographies [...] Synthesis. The complex, cause and effect relationship between language and culture {{has been an important}} area of inquiry in Applied and Socio Linguistics, ever since it was originally proposed within the theory of Linguistic Relativity (1929) and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (1940), These theories stated that the basic components of any language are indivisible from the perspectives of the users and therefore affect the way a certain language group views the world. Present research investigating this relationship is more concerned with how cultural differences influence the language learning process. Considering recent trends focusing on English as a Global Language and the diversity of learners and contexts, attention has shifted to developing cultural awareness and competence as an essential component of second language acquisition. With the steady increase of international travel, global economy, communication technology and the prospect that most people will have frequent and sustained contact and experience with other cultures in the future, it is no longer adequate that language learners merely have a command or a level of competence in a language. What is required, for full participation in an increasingly integrated world, is a deeper understanding and a comprehensive arsenal of meta-skills which will assist learners with acquisition and navigation of the finer nuances and sub levels of {{communication and}} interaction. Apart from language, what other skills do learners require? What are common problems that all people have when engaging with a new culture or in a new environment? How can these be taught or acquired out of context? What {{is the role of the}} teacher in facilitating cultural awareness? In seeking answers to these questions, this dissertation will critically review relevant research, analyze various contexts and methodologies and attempt to determine what type of approach is best suited to the needs and environments of today's EFL learners in Japan.

Demographic changes within the US are bringing {{significant changes in}} the cultural make-up of the classrooms in our schools. Results from national and state assessments indicate a growing achievement gap between the science scores of white students and students from minority communities. This gap indicates a disconnect somewhere in the science classrooms. This study examines the teacher's perspective of the changing learning environment. The study focuses on senior teachers with traditional Midwestern backgrounds and little multicultural experience assuming these teachers had little or no education in multicultural education. Senior teachers {{are also more likely to}} have completed their science education within a traditional Universalist perspective of science and likewise have little or no education in multicultural science. The research method was comparative case studies of a purposeful sample of nine science teachers within a community experiencing significant demographic change, seven core senior teachers and two frame of reference teachers. The interviews examined the teachers' awareness of their own cultural beliefs and the impact of those beliefs on classroom practices, the teachers' understanding of cultural influences on the students' academic performance, and the relationships between the teachers' understanding of the cultural aspects of the nature of science and their classroom practices. Analysis of the interview data revealed that the teachers maintain a strong, traditional Midwestern worldview for classroom expectations and they are generally unaware of the impact of those standards on the classroom environment. The teachers were supportive of minority students within their classroom, changing several practices to accommodate student needs, but they were unaware of the broader cultural influences on student learning. The teachers had a poor understanding of the nature of science and none of them recognized a cultural element of NOS. They maintained a Universalist perspective of science with a strong commitment to the philosophy of scientism which left no room for a multicultural view of science. These results have implications for the broad science community with respect to the philosophy and nature of science. There are also implications in pre- and in-service teacher education and professional development aimed at <b>raising</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> of science teachers and providing a broader understanding of NOS.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The Coach and Mentors of South Africa (COMENSA) coach/mentor {{supervision}} {{policy of}} 2010, which was updated in 2013, aims to convey COMENSA’s official position on coaching supervision {{as well as}} inform members about this practice. The policy offers a framework for best practice for coaching supervision {{and serves as a}} benchmark against which to compare the goals and competencies of coach supervisors in South Africa. COMENSA’s policy on supervision includes a list of seven goals. The policy further recommends that, throughout the supervisory relationship, the supervisor must be able to demonstrate a range of behaviours and competencies, as well as be able “to pay attention to, work with and balance” the three functions of supervision, namely: developmental, resourcing, and qualitative. Currently it is unknown whether the coach supervisors offering supervision in South Africa actually meet these behaviours, competencies and goals. In addition, it is unknown what qualifications and experience the coach supervisors have and whether their supervision meets the supervisees’ expectations. This study assessed whether coach supervisors in South Africa actually meet the COMENSA supervision policies’ competency requirements and supervision goals and whether these goals and requirements are necessary and sufficient for quality coaching supervision sessions. The study also explored whether coaching supervision met the supervisees’ expectations. The research design was an empirical qualitative study using a multi-method approach involving interviews and documents. The study was interpretive and exploratory in nature. Primary data was sourced through semi-structured interviews with 23 participants comprising five supervisors and 18 supervisees from three regions in South Africa. Secondary data came from the two COMENSA coach/mentor supervision policies (2010 and 2013). The data was analysed using ATLAS. ti. It was found that supervisors focused their goals on learning and support first, then relational dynamics and professional practice issues. In the COMENSA coach/mentor supervision policy the emphasis differs. The policy focuses predominantly on relational dynamics, then learning and professional practice. Supervision as support was mentioned only briefly in two goals. According to the perspective of their supervisees, supervisors were competent in terms of the requirements set out in the COMENSA coach/mentor policies (2010 and 2013) and supervision largely met their expectations. Supervisees identified areas for improvement in supervisor facilitation skills, providing a safe space and stronger contracting. A surprising result emerged with 11 of the 18 supervisees either already using supervision to discuss the business of coaching or wanting this to be an added element of the process. The business of coaching covers topics such as marketing and how to run a practice and is not typically included in coaching supervision. The competency of <b>raising</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> and respecting diversity and difference was not mentioned by any of the participants, a surprising omission given the diverse socio-political environment of South Africa...|$|E

Part 1; Methods: Two group interviews with South Asian participants were used to inform an interview schedule. Using this schedule, 23 individual interviews were performed with South Asian participants, some of whom had experienced a stroke and some who had not. Part 1; Findings: Participants who had not used stroke services held positive expectations about those services. Participants who had used stroke services were negative about their overall experience. Attitudes and behaviour of service providers were seen as poor, and that they lacked an understanding of culturally specific issues. Participants expressed a need to be treated as an individual, to feel cared for and respected, and suggested that staff receive training to address this. Further research was needed to explore the efficacy of training service providers to be culturally competent. Part 2; Methods: Online databases were systematically searched for interventions evaluating service provider cultural competence training, and papers on theoretical frameworks of cultural competence. Components of theoretical frameworks were compared and evaluated. The training literature was evaluated and synthesised using realist methods. A stakeholder group reviewed the findings and made recommendations for practice. Part 2; Findings: Three overarching components reflected these theoretical frameworks, which were; cultural awareness, knowledge and skills. The success of training interventions, underpinned by these components, varied by the type of outcome measured. Where intervention outcomes were based on service providers’ self-reports they were perceived to be effective; where outcomes were based on service-user ratings they were perceived to be moderately effective, and where outcomes were based on clinical assessments they were perceived to be ineffective. The few studies with service-users rating their experiences indicated that a more detailed awareness of cultural issues coupled with practice improved ratings. Other studies have demonstrated that service-user ratings and outcomes can be improved by individuals, or teams, with effective levels of cultural skills implementing subject-specific health interventions. Underpinning these interventions were the understanding of service-users’ cultural needs, matched with appropriate skill-sets of teams or individuals. A stakeholder review of these findings confirmed that <b>raising</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> is an important first step in improving staff cultural competence. In addition, translating training into practice and matching the expectations of minority group stroke service-users, requires on-going support at an organisational and leadership level, with which confidence can develop through mentorship and shaping. Conclusion: The available evidence has shown how to provide cultural awareness knowledge and skills training, but not how to translate this into practical cultural competence. This thesis explores further exiting evidence to draw out components and mechanisms that seem to truly deliver cultural competence. Based on a systematic literature search and a realist review, this thesis proposes a model to suggest how true cultural competence can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} effects of an {{immersion}} programme to Australia on pre-service English teachers who are from the Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong. The experience of the pre-service teachers was examined in three aspects – language enhancement, cross-cultural awareness and pedagogical understanding. The sample was drawn from 10 participants and their experience reflected the benefits and drawbacks of the immersion programme. The immersion programme generally had positive effects on participants’ language enhancement and pedagogical understanding. It was most effective in <b>raising</b> students’ <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness.</b> But the programme also had limitations in terms of placement opportunities, class organizations and homestay arrangements. These findings will inform the improvement of immersion programmes as meaningful and significant experience for pre-service teachers’ professional development. published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor of Education in Language Educatio...|$|R

When The Dominican Republic promoted tourism it tried {{to appeal to a}} broader audience by describing its government as a “democratic representative regime, like that of the United States.” However, during this time, the Dominican Republic was under the control of Rafael Trujillo, who was the President from 1930-1938, and again from 1942-1952. Despite the term President, he remained a dictator and even during the inter-presidency years, he remained the de facto leader {{under the auspices of the}} Dominican military. [...] Hence, the Dominican Republic’s characterization of its government as being democratic during the World’s Fair provides a unique entre into the different ways in which countries attempted to promote tourism. Further, the Dominican Republic played to American sentiments by showing the “Avenue of George Washington,” a prominent street in the Dominican Republic that was renamed after Trujillo came to power. More importantly, however, it tried to appeal to Americans by saying it was the “land Christopher Columbus loved most.” The pamphlet also boasted high praise from American diplomats. Senator of Rhode Island, Theodore Francis Green wished more people would visit the island and exclaimed how he would soon return to the “beautiful island.” By trying to associate and compare itself to the United States, Latin American countries did not only <b>raise</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness</b> but also showed Americans how visiting Latin America could be a positive experience for them.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the problem of {{cultural}} films. Screening cultural films was made compulsory by the Film Law (1939), the first cultural law in Japan, and these films were put on the screen for only 10 minutes. Through cultural media policies, the government intended to use films as entertainment media to easily and unpainfully <b>raise</b> public <b>cultural</b> <b>awareness.</b> In other words, films were expected {{to take the place of}} print media. It is no exaggeration, therefore, to say that the government's intention was to initiate an educational revolution from print media to visual media. However, the effect was contrary to their intention. Cultural films produced then were boring, perhaps an inevitability considering their short length of only 10 minutes As a result, audience response was cold. Having willingly gone to the theater for fun, the audience was turned off by the boring films and would vacate the theater when their screening began. Suffice it to say that the government learned that the aim of integrating enlightenment and entertainment was not easily achievable...|$|R
