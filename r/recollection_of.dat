5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> it and the dying to sin it signified.|$|E
5|$|President Reagan {{appeared}} before the Tower Commission on December 2, 1986, to answer questions regarding {{his involvement in the}} affair.

In his 1990 autobiography, An American Life, Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E

5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} whether self-criticism and depressive symptoms mediate {{the relationship between}} <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> parental rejection and suicidality. A community sample of 200 Portuguese adults completed, in counterbalanced order, a socio-demographic questionnaire, the short form of the Inventory for Assessing Memories of Parental Rearing Behaviour (EMBU), the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and reports of any suicide intention and=or ideation and suicide attempts. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> parental rejection are significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. <b>Recollections</b> <b>of</b> parental rejection are indirectly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality through self-criticism. The association between self-criticism and suicidality is mediated by depressive symptoms. In addition to a significant direct association between <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> parental rejection and suicidality, the final model indicated that <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> parental rejection are significantly associated with self-criticism. That same self-criticism is significantly associated with depressive symptoms which, in turn, are significantly associated with suicidality. Individuals with <b>recollections</b> <b>of</b> parental rejection {{are at greater risk}} for suicide ideation and behavior, possibly because such experiences predispose them to intense self-criticism which is a risk factor for depression associated with suicidal ideation and behavior...|$|R

After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because {{of the severity of}} this news, Harrison would later have no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E

5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca). Katherine had known Susan before moving away under mysterious circumstances. Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane.

5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E
5|$|Remember Me {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{was born}} on August21, 1961, at Fort Sill, a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, KellyN.

When he was a year old, the family moved to Orange County, California where his father began a career as a {{draftsman}} and designer in the aerospace industry. His younger brother, Bryan, followed in their father's footsteps, becoming a draftsman and designer. Hillenburg has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> life in Oklahoma, having grown up in Anaheim, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E
