50|$|The path {{of least}} {{resistance}} is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> by a given object or entity, among a set of alternative paths. The concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path. The way in which water flows is often given as an example for the idea.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{waves are}} the source of a curious {{phenomenon}} called dead water, first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen, in which a boat may experience strong <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship's draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy.|$|E
50|$|Tunnel {{thrusters}} {{increase the}} vessel's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> through the water, but {{this can be}} mitigated through proper fairing aft of the tunnel aperture. Ship operators should take care to prevent fouling of the tunnel and impeller, either through use of a protective grate or by cleaning. During vessel design, {{it is important to}} determine whether tunnel emergence above the water surface is commonplace in heavy seas. Tunnel emergence hurts thruster performance, and may damage the thruster and the hull around it.|$|E
50|$|An {{extendable}} vertical-axis windmill {{emerges from}} one side of the container. A vertical-axis windmill is preferred as it introduces less <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of the ship and disturbs ship stability less than horizontal-axis windmills.|$|R
40|$|New {{supplementary}} {{conditions are}} {{proposed for the}} two-dimensional Neumann-Kelvin problem describing the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of a surface-piercing body. They lead {{to the absence of}} waves behind the body and, hence, <b>to</b> the wave <b>resistance</b> being equal <b>to</b> zero. Moreover, for the body with symmetry about the vertical axis the total <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> (the sum of wave and spray resistance) also vanishes when these conditions are imposed. The behaviour of spray resistance is investigated numerically for a family of asymmetric contours. 1...|$|R
50|$|Vaughan {{states that}} the GWR {{investigated}} the effectiveness of varying train speed, and found that 45 mph was the optimum speed; but water could be picked up successfully as low as 15 mph. At that speed 944 gallons could be picked up in 440 yards, but Vaughan suggests {{that this is a}} low theoretical figure, and that it overlooks the bow wave effect which enables a greater take-up rate. There was a significant <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of the engine during the process, enough to require special care by the driver to avoid problems on unfitted freight trains.|$|R
50|$|Lift {{and drag}} are {{components}} of the total aerodynamic force on sail (FT). Since the forces on the sail are resisted by forces in the water (for a boat) or on the traveled surface (for an ice boat or land sailing craft), their corresponding forces can also be decomposed from total aerodynamic force into driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT). Driving force overcomes <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b> Lateral force is met by lateral resistance from a keel, blade or wheel, but also creates a heeling force.|$|E
5000|$|Generally the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> {{is roughly}} linear until it {{suddenly}} stops, or the foot section deforms sideways. When travelling over small bumps, full force is immediately {{applied to the}} shin, {{at the point where}} the cuff meets the calf at the top of the boot. This can lead to bruising known as [...] "Lange-bang" [...] or [...] "boot bite". When the force is released, friction tends to hold the boot in that position, requiring further force to return it to its neutral position.|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} sailboats {{through the water}} {{is limited by the}} {{resistance}} that results from hull drag in the water. Ice boats typically have the least <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of any sailing craft. Consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where its possible to align {{the leading edge of the}} sail with the apparent wind.|$|E

50|$|A sailboats speed {{through the}} water {{is limited by the}} {{resistance}} that results from hull drag in the water. Sail boats on foils are much less limited. Ice boats typically have the least <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of any sailing craft. Craft with the higher forward resistance achieve lower forward velocities for a given wind velocity than ice boats, which can travel at speeds several multiples of the true wind speed. Consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where its possible to align {{the leading edge of the}} sail with the apparent wind.|$|E
50|$|This {{was another}} concept {{introduced}} by Frahm {{and used in}} several ships in the early 1900s. In this concept the two wing tanks are connected only by an air duct at the top. Water flows {{in and out of}} each tank via an opening in the hull to the sea. This eliminates the need for a crossover duct as in the other designs, but has its own set of disadvantages. This design promoted corrosion of the tanks due to the explicit interaction with sea water. The holes on the hull cause <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b> The force required to accelerate sea water outside the ship (which is initially at rest) to the speed of the ship as it enters the ship is a substantial drag component (momentum drag) as its magnitude increases with the square of ship speed. More recently, a variation of these tanks has been used in oil drilling rig applications where forward motion is of little relevance.|$|E

5000|$|The Revetec engine [...] design {{consists}} of two counter-rotating [...] "trilobate" [...] (three lobed) cams geared together, so both cams contribute <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b> Two bearings run along the profile of both cams (four bearings in all) and stay {{in contact with the}} cams at all times. The bearings are mounted {{on the underside of the}} two inter-connected pistons, which maintain the desired clearance throughout the stroke.|$|R
50|$|Snowboard boot {{bindings}} {{are normally}} screwed onto the snowboard in a permanent orientation {{which is almost}} perpendicular to the direction of travel of the snowboard. When a snowboarder reaches {{the bottom of a}} run, the rear boot is typically released from its binding to allow the snowboarder <b>to</b> propel himself <b>forward</b> across relatively flat snow. Because the front foot in the snowboard binding is at an angle <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion,</b> the snowboarder experiences discomfort and tension on his leg, knee and foot joint.|$|R
50|$|The normal gluteus maximus gait is {{when the}} gluteus maxims begins to {{contract}} at moment of heel-strike, slowing <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of trunk by arresting flexion of hip and initiating extension. When gluteus maximus is weak, trunk lurches backward (gluteus maximus lurch) at heel-strike on weakened side <b>to</b> interrupt <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of the trunk.|$|R
40|$|Essential performance-determining {{factors in}} {{swimming}} {{can be analyzed}} within a hydrodynamical framework. These factors include active drag, propulsive force and propelling efficiency. The success of a swimmer {{is determined by the}} ability to generate propulsive force, while reducing the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b> For evaluating the propulsive and resistive force, several researchers have been attempting to measure them. There is, however, no established method for measuring the active drag and propulsive force correctly. Based on the research available at present it is concluded that(a) passive drag is strongly influenced by the angle of attack of whole body and water depth;(b) coefficient of active drag is greater than coefficient of passive drag;(c) coefficient of active drag tends to decrease relate to swimming velocity;(d) propelling efficiency seems to be important since it is higher in elite swimmer(61 %) than triathletes(44 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Operational {{experience}} in Canada {{during the early}} seventies showed that hovercraft can make very effective icebreakers. In a low speed mode, the hovercraft causes an air cavity to form under the sheet as it rides onto it. This causes {{a section of the}} sheet to become unsupported and fail in bending under the action of its own weight. In a high speed mode, the motion of the craft over the sheet sets up large amplitude flexural gravity waves in the sheet-water system. Research into both modes of operation has been going on at MUN and IMD since the mid-eighties. The paper summarizes this work. For the low speed case, scaling laws for the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of two new geometries were developed and confirmed with IMD ice tank data. For the high speed case, measurements of sheet deflections in the MUN wave tank and the IMD ice tank showed that a critical speed exists for motion over a sheet.

40|$|AbstractMissing-fundamental gratings, {{generated}} by subtracting the fundamental Fourier components from square-wave gratings, appear to move backward when presented in quarter-cycle jumps, {{even though their}} edges and features all move forward.

In-phase and antiphase addition of the fundamental had similar effects on the perceived motion, despite having markedly different effects on the features, appearances and zero-crossings of the stimuli. The critical amplitude of fundamental needed <b>to</b> restore <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> plaids {{was the same as}} that needed <b>to</b> restore <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> their isolated component gratings, indicating that the plaids’ emergent features, such as edge intersections and ‘blobs’, made little or no contribution to the perceived direction of motion in these stimuli. In two derivative experiments, missing-fundamental chromatic gratings and plaids, at approximate isoluminance, and missing-fundamental luminance barberpoles, also generated backward perceived motions, and these were also reversed by in-phase or antiphase addition of small amounts of fundamental...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{of small}} models of hulls are of major impor-tance. Indeed, {{empiricism}} {{can be considered}} to be almost the only guide for the hull designer and, on the other hand, tests in full size can be considered only as altp-. gether exceptional because of the difficulties they in-volve and above all because of the capital risk involved.

50|$|The {{basic problem}} {{inherent}} in rotor design {{is the difference}} in airspeed for the advancing and retreating blades. Among the many effects this causes is one of interest; the blades rotate forward and backward around the hub as drag increases and decreases. Consider a blade as it reaches {{the rear of the}} aircraft and starts to rotate forward; during this time the relative airspeed starts increasing rapidly, and the blade is pushed further and further back by the increasing drag. This force is absorbed in a drag bearing. During the brief period while it rotates around this bearing, the overall speed of the blade is decreased, slightly offsetting the speed due <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{non-traditional}} rigs capture {{energy from}} the wind in a different fashion and are capable of feats that traditional rigs are not, such as sailing directly into the wind.

A similar design, called the autogyro boat, uses a wind turbine without the propellor, and functions {{in a manner similar}} to a normal sail.

Once the charge has expanded and mostly left the engine, pressure inside drops again to below-atmospheric values and the reed valve allows fresh air to enter and the cycle be repeated. Some ram-air pressure due <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> helps scavenging and filling the combustion chamber with the new, fresh air charge, thus improving the power of the engine at higher speeds.|$|R
