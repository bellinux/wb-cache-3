2500|$|The {{behavioral}} {{assumption of}} the consumer theory proposed herein is that all consumers seek to maximize utility. In the mainstream economics tradition, this activity of maximizing utility has been deemed as the [...] "rational" [...] behavior of decision makers. More specifically, {{in the eyes of}} economists, all consumers seek to maximize a utility function subject to a budgetary constraint. In other words, economists assume that consumers will always choose the [...] "best" [...] bundle of goods they can afford. Consumer theory is therefore based around the problem of generate <b>refutable</b> hypotheses about the nature of consumer demand from this behavioral postulate.|$|E
2500|$|The reals are uncountable; that is: {{while both}} {{the set of}} all natural numbers and the set of all real numbers are {{infinite}} sets, {{there can be no}} one-to-one function from the real numbers to the natural numbers: the cardinality of the set of all real numbers (denoted [...] and called cardinality of the continuum) is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers (denoted [...] 'aleph-naught'). The statement that there is no subset of the reals with cardinality strictly greater than [...] and strictly smaller than [...] is known as the continuum hypothesis (CH). It is known to be neither provable nor <b>refutable</b> using the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory including the axiom of choice (ZFC), the standard foundation of modern mathematics, in the sense that some models of ZFC satisfy CH, while others violate it.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter VIII {{on welfare}} {{economics}} {{is described as}} an attempt [...] "to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics" [...] (p.252). This Samuelson does in 51 pages, including his exposition of {{what became known as}} the Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function. [...] Theorems derived in welfare economics, he notes, are deductive implications of assumptions that are not <b>refutable,</b> thus not meaningful in a certain sense. [...] Still, the social welfare function can represent any index (cardinal or not) of the economic measures of any logically possible ethical belief system that is required to order any (hypothetically) feasible social configurations as [...] "better than", [...] "worse than", [...] or [...] "indifferent to" [...] each other (p.221). [...] It also definitively elucidates the notion of Pareto optimality and the [...] "germ of truth in Adam Smith's doctrine of the invisible hand" [...] (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxiv; Fischer, 1987, p.236).|$|E

60|$|The {{relation}} {{involved in}} judging or believing must, if falsehood {{is to be}} duly allowed for, be taken to be a relation between several terms, not between two. When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, he must not have before his mind a single object, 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', or 'that Desdemona loves Cassio ', for that would require {{that there should be}} objective falsehoods, which subsist independently of any minds; and this, though not logically <b>refutable,</b> is a theory to be avoided if possible. Thus it is easier to account for falsehood if we take judgement to be a relation in which the mind and the various objects concerned all occur severally; that is to say, Desdemona and loving and Cassio must all be terms in the relation which subsists when Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio. This relation, therefore, is a relation of four terms, since Othello also is one of the terms of the relation. When we say that it is a relation of four terms, we do not mean that Othello has a certain relation to Desdemona, and has the same relation to loving and also to Cassio. This may be true of some other relation than believing; but believing, plainly, is not a relation which Othello has to each of the three terms concerned, but to all of them together: there is only one example of the relation of believing involved, but this one example knits together four terms. Thus the actual occurrence, at the moment when Othello is entertaining his belief, is that the relation called 'believing' is knitting together into one complex whole the four terms Othello, Desdemona, loving, and Cassio. What is called belief or judgement is nothing but this relation of believing or judging, which relates a mind to several things other than itself. An act of belief or of judgement is the occurrence between certain terms at some particular time, of the relation of believing or judging.|$|E
5000|$|We {{approach}} {{the proof of}} Theorem 2 by successively restricting the class of all formulas φ for which we need to prove [...] "&phi; is either <b>refutable</b> or satisfiable". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas φ in our language. However, suppose that for every formula φ there is some formula ψ taken from a more restricted class of formulas C, such that [...] "&psi; is either <b>refutable</b> or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; is either <b>refutable</b> or satisfiable". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove [...] "&phi; is either <b>refutable</b> or satisfiable" [...] only for φ's belonging to the class C. Note also that if φ is provably equivalent to ψ (i.e., (φ≡ψ) is provable), then it is indeed the case that [...] "&psi; is either <b>refutable</b> or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; is either <b>refutable</b> or satisfiable" [...] (the soundness theorem is needed to show this).|$|E
5000|$|We {{extend this}} result to {{more and more}} complex and lengthy sentences, Dn (n=1,2...), built out from B, so that either any of them is <b>refutable</b> and {{therefore}} so is φ, or all of them are not <b>refutable</b> and therefore each holds in some model.|$|E
5000|$|Now if [...] is <b>refutable</b> {{for some}} n, {{it follows that}} φ is <b>refutable.</b> On the other hand, suppose that [...] is not <b>refutable</b> for any n. Then for each n there is some way of {{assigning}} truth values to the distinct subpropositions [...] (ordered by their first appearance in [...] "distinct" [...] here means either distinct predicates, or distinct bound variables) in , such that [...] will be true when each proposition is evaluated in this fashion.
