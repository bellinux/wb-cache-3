50|$|More rarely, <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{may also}} eat bird eggs or nestlings. A Swedish {{study shows that}} out of 600 stomach {{contents}} of <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> examined, only 4 contained remnants of birds or eggs. Thus, <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> may occasionally exhibit opportunistic omnivory, similarly to other rodents.|$|R
50|$|The park {{also has}} red pandas, otters, various farm animals and <b>red</b> <b>{{squirrels}}.</b> The squirrels {{are part of}} a captive breeding program to reintroduce <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> to Cornwall.|$|R
50|$|American <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} across the North American continent. Their range includes most of Canada, {{the southern part}} of Alaska, coastal British Columbia, and the Rocky Mountains and boreal forests east to the Atlantic coast. American <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> are abundant and not of conservation concern throughout much of their range. However, an isolated population of <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> in Arizona has experienced considerable declines in population size. In 1987, this portion of the population was listed as an endangered species.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce grouse, and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} used as a primary food source by the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> Sciurus vulgaris, and have a higher protein content than the other {{mushrooms}} typically consumed by this species. Decaying fruit bodies are also used as a food source by fruit flies belonging to the genus Drosophila.|$|E
5|$|Common mammals {{found here}} include the red fox, <b>red</b> <b>squirrel,</b> hare and rabbit, mole, wood mouse, bank vole and field vole. Two species of bats {{frequent}} the site regularly to hunt: the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). They cannot, however, establish their habitat {{due to the}} lack of roosting sites in the reserve's young trees.|$|E
40|$|Biological invasions {{are among}} the major causes of {{biodiversity}} loss worldwide, and parasites carried or acquired by invaders may represent an added threat to native species. We compared gastrointestinal helminth communities of native Eurasian <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus vulgaris) in the presence and absence of introduced Eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) to detect alterations induced by the alien species. In particular, we investigated whether spillover of a North American nematode Strongyloides robustus occurs and whether prevalence of a local parasite Trypanoxyuris sciuri in <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> is affected by grey squirrel presence. The probability of being infected by both parasites was significantly higher in areas co-inhabited by the alien species, where 61 % of examined <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> (n= 49) were infected by S. robustus and 90 % by T. sciuri. Conversely, in red-only areas, the two parasites infected only 5 and 70 % of individuals (n= 60). Overall, our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> acquire S. robustus via spillover from the alien congener and suggest that invaders' presence may also indirectly affect infection by local parasites through mechanisms diverse than spill-back and linked to the increased competitive pressure to which <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> are subjected. These results indicate that the impact of grey <b>squirrel</b> on <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> may have been underestimated and highlight the importance of investigating variation in macroparasite communities of native species threatened by alien competitors...|$|R

50|$|A three-year {{study of}} a {{population}} of <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> in southwest Yukon reported female <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> showed high levels of multiple-male mating and would even mate with males with similar genetic relatedness. While males mating with multiple females is quite common in the animal kingdom, females that mate with multiple males is rarer. When female <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> chose a mate, genetic relatedness did not play a factor. The relatedness of parents {{had no effect on}} the neonatal mass and growth rate of their offspring, nor did it affect the survival rate of offspring to one year of age.|$|R
5|$|Hydnum repandum is {{frequently}} sold with chanterelles in Italy, and in France, {{it is one}} of the officially recognized edible species sold in markets. In Europe, it is usually sold under its French name Pied-de-Mouton (Sheep's Foot). It is also collected and sold in local markets of Mexico, Spain and British Columbia, Canada. H.repandum mushrooms are also used as a food source by the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Sciurus vulgaris).|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2001. As {{part of the}} Conker video game series, the game follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a greedy, heavy-drinking <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} small mammal are {{considered}} native: the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), the Jersey bank vole (Myodes glareolus caesarius), the Lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) and the French shrew (Sorex coronatus). Three wild mammals are well-established introductions: the rabbit ({{introduced in the}} mediaeval period), the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and the hedgehog (both introduced in the 19th century). The stoat (Mustela erminea) became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000. The Green lizard (Lacerta bilineata) is a protected species of reptile; Jersey is its only habitat in the British Isles.|$|E
5000|$|American <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Eurasian <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus vulgaris); since the ranges of these species do not overlap, they are both commonly referred to as [...] "red squirrels" [...] in the areas where they are native. The specific epithet hudsonicus refers to Hudson Bay, Canada, where the species was first catalogued by Erxleben in 1771. A recent phylogeny suggests the squirrels as a family can be divided into five major lineages. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus) fall within the clade that includes flying squirrels and other tree squirrels (e.g., Sciurus). There are 25 recognized subspecies of <b>red</b> <b>squirrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} dormice, <b>red</b> <b>squirrels,</b> a {{wide range}} of bats, and many invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Anthropomorphic <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{were used}} in UK road safety campaigns between the 1950s and 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, <b>red</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American <b>red</b> <b>squirrel,</b> eastern chipmunk, and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant ungulate on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a very recent addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E
50|$|No territories are claimed {{between the}} <b>red</b> <b>squirrels,</b> and the feeding areas of {{individuals}} overlap considerably.|$|R

5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above the forest floor.|$|E
25|$|Although {{complex and}} controversial, the main {{factor in the}} eastern gray squirrel's {{displacement}} of the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> {{is thought to be}} its greater fitness, hence a competitive advantage over the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> on all measures. The eastern gray squirrel tends to be larger and stronger than the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and has been shown to have a greater ability to store fat for winter. The squirrel can, therefore, compete more effectively for a larger share of the available food, resulting in relatively lower survival and breeding rates among the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel.</b> Parapoxvirus may also be a strongly contributing factor; red squirrels have long been fatally affected by the disease, while the eastern gray squirrels are unaffected, but thought to be carriers – although how the virus is transmitted has yet to be determined. However, several cases of red squirrels surviving have been reported, as they have developed an immunity – although their population is still being massively affected. The <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> is also less tolerant of habitat destruction and fragmentation, which has led to its population decline, while the more adaptable eastern gray squirrel has taken advantage and expanded.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{were once}} {{prevalent}} throughout the British Isles, {{there are now}} only about 140,000. Most of these are in Scotland. The decline of <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> is blamed mostly on disease, the loss of woodlands, and competition by grey squirrels. There are over 2.5 million grey squirrels in the British Isles. Red squirrels' survival chances in conifer woods are much higher than in deciduous woods.|$|R

25|$|The Lake District {{is home to}} a {{great variety}} of wildlife, due to its range of varied topography, lakes and forests. It {{provides}} a home for the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and colonies of sundew and butterwort, two of the few carnivorous plants native to Britain. The Lake District is a major sanctuary for the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> and has the largest population in England (out of the estimated 140,000 red squirrels in the United Kingdom, compared with about 2.5million grey squirrels).|$|E
25|$|A {{prolific}} and adaptable species, {{the eastern}} gray squirrel {{has been introduced}} to, and thrives in, several regions of the western United States. The gray squirrel is an invasive species in Britain; it has spread {{across the country and}} has largely displaced the native <b>red</b> <b>squirrel,</b> S. vulgaris. In Ireland, the <b>red</b> <b>squirrel</b> has been displaced in several eastern counties, though it still remains common in the south and west of the country. That such displacement might happen in Italy is of concern, and gray squirrels might spread from Italy to other parts of mainland Europe.|$|E

40|$|Background: Squirrel {{poxvirus}} (SQPV) {{is highly}} pathogenic to <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus vulgaris), {{and is a}} significant contributing factor to the local extinction of the species {{in most parts of}} England and Wales, where infection is endemic in Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) populations. Conclusions: The real-time PCR has been used to quantify viral genome load in tissues from diseased and apparently healthy <b>red</b> and grey <b>squirrels,</b> and suggests that the titre of virus in tissues from diseased <b>red</b> <b>squirrels</b> is considerably higher than that found even in a grey squirrel with cutaneous lesions...|$|R
