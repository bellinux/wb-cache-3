40|$|Purpose: LibQUAL+® has {{provided}} libraries with a customer satisfaction benchmarking tool which {{is easy to}} administer and cost effective. The questionnaire was initially developed following {{a series of interviews}} conducted in late 1999 - early 2000 with academic library customers on what constitutes a quality library service. In order to remain current, LibQUAL+® must review the questions asked of the library customers to ensure that it remains relevant as user expectations alter over time (McKnight, 2008). Do the needs of the academic library customer still align to the views held over a decade ago? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the findings of a Cranfield University research project into the current needs of its academic library customers, and to gauge if the LibQUAL+® questions are still assessing these needs. Methodology: A series of focus groups were held at Cranfield University during 2011 capturing what academic library customers expect from their library service. Separate focus groups were conducted consisting of customers from four key stakeholder groups; full-time taught postgraduate students, part-time taught postgraduate students, doctoral research students and academic teaching staff. The semi-structured discussions covered the needs of the customers in four main areas; information provision, access to information resources, support from library staff and the physical library environment. The focus groups were transcribed then coded using Atlas. TI to identify common themes of service provision requirements across all user types. These common themes were then compared to the core LibQUAL+® questions to identify the differences and similarities between the two data sets. Findings: The findings at Cranfield University show that LibQUAL+® is still addressing the issues that matter the most to our customers. As it stands, LibQUAL+® still provides Cranfield University with a cost effective and easy to administer survey tool which measures the areas of service provision that our customers expect from their academic library. Research limitations and implications: Whist the discussions aimed to be as broad as possible, at this stage the research is restricted to Cranfield University customers only. Views from undergraduate students were not captured during this research project as Cranfield University is the UK’s only wholly postgraduate university. For these reasons implications for the overall qualitative <b>regrounding</b> of LibQUAL+® are limited. Wide research into the qualitative <b>regrounding</b> of the LibQUAL+® survey should be considered. Originality and value of the proposal: Customer Value Discovery research conducted by McKnight (2008) in a UK academic library in 2005 concluded that the LibQUAL+® core questions met most of the customer needs. Outside of the UK, the reforming and <b>regrounding</b> of the LibQUAL+® survey within the digital library environment has been developed through the DigiQUAL+ project based on qualitative research conducted in 2003 (Kyrillidou, et al, 2009 a). No recent studies into the qualitative <b>regrounded</b> of LibQUAL+® have been identified. ...|$|R

40|$|From Alfred Stieglitz to Trevor Paglen, {{photographs}} of the sky have engaged with the relationship between abstraction and representation. This article argues that Stieglitz’s attempt to convert the ‘natural’ abstraction of the sky into the ‘cultural’ abstraction of the modernist image opens a space through which recent photographers have moved to use the sky photograph {{as a means of}} interrogating issues of openness and concealment that are at once aesthetic and political.

What is shown in these images, how- ever, is the condition of hiddenness itself, which is encountered by Misrach and Paglen not only through the abstraction of the sky photographs but by situating those images within a discursive field – through the use of titles, captions and an explication of working methods – that <b>regrounds</b> the atmospheric as a spectacular function of power’s open secret...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of the}} ice-sheet / ice-shelf transformation was used to investigate ice-sheet dynamics across the large subglacial lake beneath Vostok station, central East Antarctica. European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS- 1) altimetry of the ice surface and 60 MHz radio-echo sounding (RES) of the ice-sheet base and internal ice-sheet layering were used to develop a conceptual flowline across the ice sheet, which the model used as input. The model calculates horizontal and vertical velocities and stresses, from which particle flow paths can be obtained, and the ice-sheet temperature distribution. An inverse approach to modelling was adopted, where particle flow paths were forced to match those identified from internal RES layering. Results show that ice dynamics across the inflow grounding line are similar to an ice-sheet / ice-shelf transition. Model particle flow paths match internal RES layering when ice is (a) taken away from the ice base across the first 2 km of the flowline over the lake and (b) added to the base across {{the remainder of the}} lake. We contend that the process causing this transfer of ice is likely to be melting of ice and freezing of water at the ice-water interface. Other explanations, such as enhanced rates of accumulation over the grounding line, of three-dimensional convergent / divergent flow of ice are inconsistent with available measurements. Such melting and refreezing would be responsible for circulation and mixing of at least the surface layers of the lake water. Our model suggests that several tens of metres of refrozen "basal ice" would accrete from lake water to the ice sheet before the ice <b>regrounds...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{concern in}} recent South African poetry with landscape {{and the question}} of what place the poet occupies in that landscape arises less {{as a response to the}} turn of the millennium than to the historical end of formal apartheid, but nonetheless marks an epochal shift in sensibility. Whereas much poetry of the 1980 s evoked a sense of extreme dislocation in recent time and local space (marked by references to a precarious present of forced removal and migrancy, and unspecified, unsettled futures), some significant recent work has been marked by a desire to relocate the human presence in South Africa in terms of geological time and continental space. This generalization needs to be qualified by reference to racial and political positioning within South Africa, and in this paper I distinguish between the work of committed white writers such as ex-political-prisoner Jeremy Cronin (now Secretary of the South African Communist Party) and Barry Feinberg (now curator of the Mayibuye Centre), and the work of black writers such as Don Mattera, Seitlhamo Motsapi, Lesego Rampolokeng, and Daniel P Kunene. The <b>regrounding</b> of the human presence in South Africa by white writers such as Cronin and Feinberg attempts a radical remapping of South African cultural identity in utopianly unraced terms, while the reclamation of continental African and local South African place names by black writers such as Mattera, Motsapi, Rampolokeng, and Kunene draws attention to the material reality of a postapartheid heterotopia in which South Africa's postmodern landscape is being divided up and sold off in ways that combine a very old-fashioned rhetoric of class and space with a new/old racial coding. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Urbanisation is {{occurring}} most {{rapidly in the}} global South, where cities are characterised by increasing levels of poverty, socio-spatial inequality, and informality. Mainstream planning theories have tended to originate from the North, responding to a context that differs greatly from that of cities of the South where theories have been uncritically adopted and imposed. State planning systems in developing countries often reflect traditional technocratic approaches and have become increasingly disengaged from rapidly changing urban conditions. In {{a context in which}} neoliberalism is becoming increasingly hegemonic, such planning systems may serve the interests of capital over the needs of the poor. There has therefore been a call to focus on developing descriptive and explanatory theories through case research from which new and more contextually appropriate approaches to planning might emerge. I offer the case of Vrygrond as a contribution to this ongoing endeavour to ‘theorize from the South’, <b>regrounding</b> planning theory and practice in the realities and complexities of global South contexts. The case study explores the nature of development in the densely populated, low-income settlement in Cape Town, from 1997 to 2014. The main research question asks how services, public facilities and amenities have been secured in Vrygrond, and how planning theory and practice might learn from this experience. The dissertation therefore draws on semi-structured interviews to understand the interaction between development processes adopted by key actors and contextual factors which include racial and ethnic diversity, power struggles, oppositional forms of citizenship, mistrust, and pervasive crime. The findings are then interpreted through the application of three contrasting theoretical frameworks of technocratic planning, communicative and collaborative planning, and co-production. I argue that the assumptions underlying technocratic and communicative planning are problematic in the context of Vrygrond, and that co-production might be better placed to respond to a lack of access to public facilities as well as a broader sense of disempowerment and marginalization. Recommendations include institutional rearrangements that might foster a social context that would be more receptive to co-production. I call attention to the nature of citizenship in postapartheid communities, to social difference and power relations, and to the impact of crime and gangsterism on local governance, as important considerations for participatory planning approaches such as co-production...|$|R
40|$|Inside its cocoon, a {{caterpillar}} changes slowly, transforming from one {{state of being}} to another over time, but always maintaining its fundamental essence and its origins. Similarly, a move {{from one place to}} another- whether by force or by choice, whether between nation-states or between cities-is a process of metamorphosis that happens individually for people with distinct and continuous identities. When they migrate, newcomers must learn the rules, both spoken and unspoken, that define and delineate the unfamiliar society; for refugees, any period of assimilation is also likely to include the need for recovery from involuntary losses and psychological traumas that may have been both the motivation for leaving and part of the journey. This is a process that takes emotion, energy, and, of course, time. This thesis understands this moment {{in the life of a}} migrant as one of extreme tension, and the cocoon's analogue- the physical space in which the transformation takes place- as the vessel in which it occurs. Through an examination of the government-distributed, transitional housing (genomgångsbostäder) for refugees living in Stockholm, Sweden, the thesis will clarify the psychological and social roles of this housing in the process of integration and illustrate the importance of its physical form to its successes and failures. The proposed strategy engages these questions and offers an alternative approach to their solution. The centerpoint of the proposal is the kitchen, where food, a vehicle for reproducing cultural memories, is prepared and initial social contacts are made. The project also seeks to activate its users- from the initial moment of moving in to the memories left behind when moving out-empowering them instead of creating dependencies. Finally, it attempts to establish ties between residents and outsiders by creating points of both concentrated and random interaction in semi-public and public spaces. As a transitional space, a rite of passage, and a place where <b>regrounding</b> can occur, the housing provides a temporary shelter and point of recovery from the vertigo of forced migration.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I argue that 'critical theorists', {{and the left}} in general, have paid {{insufficient}} attention to the psychological and pathological dimensions {{of the problems of}} modernity, including its environmental predicaments. To address this theoretical lacuna, I critically examine the conceptions of 'collective pathology' and 'higher sanity' as articulated in the relatively neglected work of Theodore Roszak and Ken Wilber, my position being that these two thinkers offer the most sophisticated readings of modernity and its 'ecological crises' in terms of pathology currently available. I also demonstrate a number of crucially significant implications of their work for contemporary critical theory. Consequently, the thesis is organized in two parts: in Part One I examine the work of Roszak and Wilber; in Part Two I explore major, critical implications of their work. The thesis begins with a critical examination of the concepts of 'pathology' and 'higher sanity' in Roszak and Wilber. I subsequently show how a critique in terms of these concepts alerts us to specific legimating tropes in ecocritical theory which have deligitimized competing discursive practices, and how such conceptions address and illuminate an ecological 'blind spot' in contemporary historical theorizing: no such study has been previously attempted. I then argue that conceptions of 'pathology' and 'higher sanity' indicate that debates between eco-centric notions of nature as 'real' and postmodernist notions of nature as a 'social construction' represent a double-bind; a false problem caused by specific unconscious and/or unacknowledged presuppositions. I go on to demonstrate how this double-bind can be overcome by, for example, exploring the psychology of Derridean deconstruction. In its examination of the critical implications of 'pathology' and 'higher sanity', this thesis can be read overall as a way of <b>regrounding</b> a radical ecological critique that is fully 'postmodem' - in the sense of aporetic - yet 'transcendent' at the same time. Consequently, this study is offered as an original resource for radical environmental activists who consider that the 'grounding' of their critique is undermined by postmodern and/or deconstructionist anti-foundationalism; I argue that such fears are 'groundless'.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This {{dissertation}} describes {{methods to}} generate high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Earth's ice sheets, and combines these observations with in situ GPS measurements to study basal melting beneath the Pine Island Glacier ice shelf, Antarctica. Pine Island Glacier (PIG) is currently losing mass {{at a rate}} of ~ 40 Gt/yr and contributing ~ 0. 1 mm/yr to global sea level rise. This mass loss has been attributed to rapid retreat, speedup, thinning, and increased discharge in recent decades, due to ocean forcing and/or internal instability. The automated, open source NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) was adapted to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthoimages from very-high-resolution (VHR) commercial imagery. I outline a processing workflow for ~ 0. 5 m ground sample distance (GSD) DigitalGlobe WorldView- 1 / 2 / 3 stereo image data. Output DEM products are posted at ~ 2 m with direct geolocation accuracy of < 5. 0 m CE 90 /LE 90. An automated co-registration workflow reduces absolute vertical and horizontal error to < 0. 5 m, with observed standard deviation of ~ 0. 1 - 0. 5 m for overlapping, co-registered DEMs. I processed all available 2010 - 2015 WorldView/GeoEye DEMs over the PIG ice shelf, and integrated with other available 2002 - 2015 DEM/altimetry data. I analyzed Eulerian elevation change (dh/dt) over grounding zones and upstream ice, and developed novel Lagrangian elevation change (Dh/Dt) methodology for elevation measurements over floating ice. I combined these results with an annual mass budget analysis to quantify the spatial and temporal evolution of ice shelf baasal melt. This analysis reveals the complex spatial/temporal evolution and interconnection of grounding zones, sub-shelf cavity geometry, basal melt rates, and upstream dynamics over grounded ice. Rapid PIG grounding line retreat ended between ~ 2008 - 2009, followed by the ephemeral <b>regrounding</b> of ~ 2 - 3 deep keels as a positive ice shelf thickness anomaly advected over a seabed ridge. Thinning upstream of the grounding line decreased from ~ 5 - 10 m/yr in 2008 - 2010 to ~ 0 m/yr by 2012 - 2014, with a small grounding line advance from 2012 - 2015. Mean 2008 - 2015 basal melt rates were ~ 80 - 90 Gt/yr for the full shelf, with ~ 200 - 250 m/yr melt rates within large channels near the grounding line, ~ 10 - 30 m/yr over the main shelf, and ~ 0 - 10 m/yr over the North and South shelves, with the notable exception of ~ 50 - 100 m/yr near the grounding line of a fast-flowing tributary on the South shelf. I processed 2008 - 2010 and 2012 - 2014 GPS records for the PIG shelf and analyzed multi-path antenna heights, horizontal velocities, strain rates, cm-accuracy surface elevation and Lagrangian Dh/Dt elevation change. These data provide validation for the corrected stereo DEMs, with sampled DEM error of ~ 0. 7 m. The GPS antenna height records document a relative surface increase of ~ 0. 7 - 1. 0 m/yr, which is consistent with estimated RACMO 2. 3 surface mass balance (SMB) and firn compaction rates from the IMAU-FDM dynamic firn model over the PIG shelf. Observed surface Dh/Dt is highly linear for all GPS records, with trends of - 1 to - 4 m/yr and < 0. 4 m residuals. Similar Dh/Dt estimates with reduced variability are obtained after removing expected downward GPS pole base velocity from GPS antenna Dh/Dt. Basal melt rates derived from GPS Dh/Dt are ~ 10 to 40 m/yr for the outer PIG shelf and ~ 4 m/yr for the South shelf. These estimates show good agreement with contemporaneous in situ measurements and stereo DEM records. Melt rates were highest for the 2008 - 2010 period, with a ~ 20 - 30 % decrease by 2010 - 2012, followed by a gradual increase from 2010 - 2012 to 2013 - 2015. Melt rates vary significantly across ~km-scale ice shelf thickness variations, with focused melting in basal channels near the grounding line and keels over the outer shelf. The DEM and GPS records also document higher melt rates within and near transverse surface depressions/rifts associated with longitudinal extension. I suggest that these ~km-scale features alter sub-shelf circulation, leading to positive feedbacks that can influence <b>regrounding</b> and upstream ice dynamics. A positive linear relationship between melt rate and depth is observed, with increasing melt rate magnitude and increasing variability at depth. The slope and spread of this linear relationship varies over time. Existing piecewise melt rate parameterizations in prognostic ice flow models provide reasonable approximations for this relationship, but fail to capture km-scale variability. The DEM and GPS Dh/Dt melt products do not show the ~ 50 % decrease in melt rates between 2010 and 2012 inferred from hydrographic observations in Pine Island Bay, with no significant melt rate variability associated with observed ~ 2012 ocean cooling in mooring records. This suggests that PIG melt rates are not directly correlated with observed ocean heat content near the shelf front, and that during the 2008 - 2015 period, observed ice shelf melt and upstream dynamics were more sensitive to grounding evolution, channel-scale circulation, and internal instability than oceanographic forcing. These findings have important implications for flow modeling efforts used for projections of 21 st-century sea level rise...|$|R

He had won in these early times more than 25 national and international awards, that can be proved by press and certificates. The historic material of these years is not even <b>regrounded.</b> But as you can see, the most of all the procedures Helmut Tollmann is using until today in his artistic work, posterisation, lithographic films and developers, solarisation and reprographic use of photographic techniques {{can be found in}} his works until now, especially in his multi-layer-technique. [...] 2. new ways and techniques 1970-1974 Beginning in the early seventies Helmut Tollmann was principally involved in paintings of architecture and landscapes, deeply impressed by the work of Max Ernst. The proximity of Helmut Tollmann’s early paintings to Max Ernst is no coincidence. Max Ernst invented a lot of procedures and techniques in modern painting (the frottage, for example) and so did Helmut Tollmann. Always looking for new media and procedures useful for artistic utilization. In this period he painted his so-called “soft landscapes”. They look like silk paintings. Helmut Tollmann’s artistic expression based on the study of Max Ernst. And so did the architectural paintings too. [...] 3. Bringing painting, reprography and printing technique together 1974-1985 In these days Helmut Tollmann and a lot his friends (for example Andy Warhol) and colleagues were using reprographic and photographic techniques, especially in Pop-Art. But Helmut Tollmann tried something one can estimate maybe not before today. He brought the squeegee from silk screen printing into painting years before others. In these paintings you can also find elements of technical and electronic processes, which go together more and more with his art the coming years. [...] 4. Technology and the soul in world and mankind - “Soul of Chip” 1985-1997 The painting media were changing more and more. Using new colors and the canvas of his work is changing to copper plates, printed circuit boards and so on. All corresponding to the main theme in Helmut Tollmann’s works of that time “soul of chip”, a registered trade mark of Helmut Tollmann until today. How does the world of information and the men in it rock? Portraits of local, national and international status such as Trude Herr a local hero of Cologne theater or Albert Einstein join in Helmut Tollmann’s artistic work of these days. Multimedia, illumination and information technology mixed in multi-layer artwork. [...] 5. Links - the connecting aspect between technology and mankind 1998-2007 In this shift of emphasis from searching for the “soul of chip” to the use of media the new theme in Helmut Tollmann’s work was showing up: Links. The chance to join apparently disparate projects like: Wirkbetrieb 1, a projects of T-Systems and “Together” a project of the initiative tolerance under the patronage of Joschka Fischer former minister of foreign affairs. In this time new portraits of people from the music history (Beethoven-Superstar, Wagner, Berlioz…) and the social, political and economical life were painted. [...] 6. Cosmic elements and cosmic prayer- 2008-today Helmut Tollmann is reprocessing the globalized world in its elements. multiple layers in the projection on and in buildings or on a water shield.

With extremely high powered projectors Helmut Tollmann showed just one long time running artwork, that surrounded the people in the church of the lords heart at Singen/Bodensee und two years later on the Hegau-Tower.

It was then ground in the United States at the John A. Brashear company in Pittsburgh. The mirror had to be <b>reground</b> twice, once due to a mysterious scratch and the 2nd time due to a flaw in the grinding. This added 2 years to the completion time of the telescope, pushing the date back to 1918. The completed mirror was hauled up Little Saanich Mountain by horse and wagon.|$|E

The height of the work rest blade perfectly aligns the bearing casing with the horizontal centreline of the grinding wheel creating a flawless ground finish, the work rest blade height can be altered using packing bars placed underneath the blade, height adjustments must be made depending on the diameter of the casings being ground.|$|E

Its meaning is limited to the " transferring the speaker from the absence to the audience and vice versa ". In rhetorical texts apostrophe is attributed to the three areas of semantics, eloquence and rhetoric. Such triple attribution is due to two factors : the mixing of rhetoric areas in previous periods and the extension of apostrophe &# 39 s meaning in rhetorical books. But it seems that a variety of notions which are raised in traditional rhetorical books should be examined in the field of semantics. The only type of apostrophe which can be analyzed in rhetoric is the one proposed in some contemporary books as the result of semantic extension and is used in the vertical axis of poem. Therefore, regarding semantic extension, we consider apostrophe as any change in semantic structure, narrative, texture, etc which occurs without any background and surprises the reader. The presence of different types of apostrophe in various branches of rhetoric and literature lead to the creation of many names for this literary technique. This technique was not called apostrophe in the first period of the Arab rhetoric which coincided with the rise of Islam in Ibn Motaz period. It was always called âmetonymyâ. Then Asmaee used apostrophe in its technical sense in the second century (A. H) and Ibn Motaz presented it in Albadi. Gradually and in later periods rhetoricians such as Qodame Ibn Jafar, Ibn Rashigh Ghiravani, Abu Halal Asgari etc. gave other names to this technique such as inflection and dissuasion, completion, objection, Estetrad, Talvin, Shojaol Arabiyat and so on. Apostrophe has the same meaning in Persian rhetorical books. The first rhetorical book is Tarjomanol Balaghat written by Radviyni which is an imitation of Mahasenol Kalam by Marghinani. After that other rhetorical books were written to imitate it. Fortunately, contemporaries present apostrophe in their books such as The Art of eloquence by Mohammad Rastgoo and the works of Poor Namdariyan such as Journey in the Mist, Missing at the Beach and It the Shadow of the Sun. Â  Types of apostrophe are not directly presented in rhetorical books. In the following section, some definitions of apostrophe are presented. We study each of them in terms of new meanings and add a number of new types. Â  1. Change of register in language: change of context and structure of a literary language to a slang language and vice versa. Â  2. Colloquial change : successive changes to address several audiences. Â  3. Grammatical change : changing pronouns, verbs and so on Â  4. Semantic change : it can be recognized only through semantic analysis. It includes varieties such as mentioning individual words in a speech or prayer after the speech, semantic change in poetry and hidden meanings. Â  5. Apostrophe Â  5. 1. Appealing technique which means that the poet asks for an invisible power. Â  5. 2. Rhythmical change: a sudden change in rhythm during the speech such as the poem of Jamshid, the sun and some of Molanaâs sonnets. Â  5. 3. Narrative change : (story in story mode) : consecutive stories which are not related to each other such as Baha Valad âs Maaref and Molanaâs Masnavi. Each technique has rhetorical and literary functions which are its aesthetic criteria. Zemakhshari was the first person who presented the technical and aesthetic values of apostrophe. He considered apostrophe as the criterion for consciousness of the reader which brings him joy and happiness. Other rhetoricians followed Zemakhshari and mentioned this advantage for apostrophe. Here we mention other rhetorical functions for apostrophe which are associated with linguistic concepts: Â  1. Norm-breaking, defamiliarizing, foregrounding: apostrophe destroys the familiar and common processes of words and sentences and hence creates pleasure and surprises the reader. Thus, words become foregrounded and more pleasant and tasteful. Â  2. Art ambiguity : apostrophe creates the sense of defamiliarization a nd unexpected changes and makes the text ambiguous. it makes the reader to explore and understand the ambiguity and the result would be the reader&# 39 s enjoyment. Â  3. Increasing text coherence : apostrophe in its broad sense is based on the collocation axis. Semantic cohesion and coherence can be achieved by the collocation of couplets and hemistiches. Although using apostrophe destroys the form and body of the language, it makes more motivation and tension in text and strengthens the vertical axis of the language and finally increases the coherence.

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{requirement}} of end product, various processing techniques are used. The commercial production of guar gum normally uses roasting, differential attrition, sieving, and polishing. Food-grade guar gum is manufactured in stages. Guar split selection is important in this process. The split is screened to clean it and then soaked to prehydrate it in a double-cone mixer. The prehydrating stage is very important because it determines the rate of hydration of the final product. The soaked splits, which have reasonably high moisture content, are passed through a flaker. The flaked guar split is ground and then dried. The powder is screened through rotary screens to deliver the required particle size. Oversize particles are either recycled to main ultra fine or <b>reground</b> in a separate regrind plant, according to the viscosity requirement.|$|E
