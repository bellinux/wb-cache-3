40|$|Purpose: To prepare carbamazepine-loaded solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} (CBZ-SLN) for prolonged {{release of}} CBZ in oral drug delivery. Methods: CBZ-loaded SLNs were prepared by {{rapid expansion of}} supercritical solution (<b>RESS).</b> SLNs were formulated using stearic acid as the lipid component. Initially, lipid and drug were separately micronized by <b>RESS</b> process separately. This was followed by co-precipitation of the components with the two solutes using <b>RESS</b> to produce drug-loaded SLNs. The formulations were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV). Results: Application of <b>RESS</b> to pure stearic acid yielded spherical particles in the range 40 to 200 nm which was about 600 times smaller than the unprocessed powder based on SEM observation. Similarly, <b>RESS</b> processing of carbamazepine produced nanoparticles with rod shape. FT-IR analysis showed that no chemical structure change occurred during <b>RESS</b> processing of both components. Co-precipitation of drug and lipid using <b>RESS</b> produced SLNs with drug loading capacity of 2. 2 %. <b>RESS</b> yielded ultrafine spherical particles (100 nm) of CBZ-SLNs.

40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} patient with lagophtalmos, {{shortening}} of the eyelids and blinking reflex disorders caused by birth trauma. Methods: A case report of a two-months-old baby girl was referred to our outpatient department with the main complain of blinking disorders since she was born. From heteroanamnesis {{the baby was born}} aterm, helped by midwife with forceps extraction technique. After birth baby was referred to the hospital due to severe asphyxia. Two weeks after the baby discharged from the hospital, her parents realized that there was abnormality in the baby ‘s eyelids such as shortening of the eyelids, blinking reflex disorders, the eyelids cannot be closed properly and there is no tears when the baby cries. The suckling reflex was good, but the baby showed typical mask like face. From the physical examination revealed poor visual acuity, but light reflex and ocular motility were normal. There were lagophtalmos, exposure keratitis, nebula cornea and negative Schirmer test in both eyes. Direct ophtalmoscope examination was normal in both eyes. EEG and MRI were normal but EMG revealed negative blinking reflex in both eyes. The baby is treated with artificial tears eye ointment and underwent surgery procedure (ANTERIOR LAMELLA REPOSITION and LEVATOR <b>RESSES)</b> to protect the cornea. Results: Although the exposure keratitis has disappeared with the treatment, unfortunately negative blinking reflex and other sequale caused by facial nerve paralysis remains occurred. Conclusion: A rare and difficult case of facial nerve paralysis caused by birth trauma has been reported. The treatment has successfully decreased the exposure keratitis. But the treatment of facial nerve paralysis is not in the realm of any one specialty.

Study Design: All triplet pregnancies that progressed beyond 22 weeks of gestation during the period 1988 to 1995 at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were included. The data was analyzed using Chisquare and student paired two-tailed T-test. R e s u l t s : The incidence of triplet pregnancy {{in the present study}} is 0. 8 per 1000 deliveries. The mean gestational age at delivery was 33 ± 4 weeks (range 23 - 38 weeks), 50 % of deliveries occurred between 34 and 38 weeks. The mean birth weight was 1766 ± 644 grams. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean gestational age and birth weight between triplet p regnancies that were managed with pro p h y l a c t i c cervical cerclage, hospitalization and tocolysis and those who were not. Six patients had pre-term labor (27. 2 %) < 37 weeks of gestation. Three had pregnancy-induced hypertension (13. 6 %). Otherwise no significant antenatal complications were noted. Nineteen sets of triplet pregnancies (86. 4 %) were delivered by lower segment cesarean section (LSCS); 15 were emergency and four were elective. There were seven perinatal deaths (12. 3 %) among the triplets who were delivered by C. S. compared to none in the vaginally delivered group. C o n c l u s i o n : Our study, though small, showed no significant difference in obstetric and neonatal outcomes among those triplet pregnancies managed with tocolysis and those who were not. Triplet pregnancies delivered by LSCS, whether elective or emergency, had higher neonatal mortality than those delivered vaginally, though the number was only three. This is due to the rarity of triplets and higher multiple pregnancies. We feel that future prospective multi-center studies are needed to answer the questions of the optimal antenatal management as well as the best and safest mode of delivery for triplet pregnancies and higher multi-fetal pregnancies...|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, some genes {{associated}} with CA production have no obvious differences or have low transcriptional {{expression in the}} three strains at the stage of 40  h. Filamentous fungi utilize a feedback mechanism termed repression under secretion stress (<b>RESS),</b> which selectively downregulates the transcription of genes encoding extracellular enzymes upon ER stress and thus helps to reduce the ER load (Fan et al. 2015). <b>RESS</b> represses the transcription of secretory protein genes under ER stress conditions in T. reesei, A. niger, and A. nidulans (Wang et al. 2010). In A. niger, <b>RESS</b> leads to the selective transcriptional downregulation of the glucoamylase gene (Alsheikh et al. 2004). Transcriptome profiling of N. crassa has revealed that the expression of most lignocellulase genes are significantly induced at early time points (16  h), but rapidly declines thereafter, implying that <b>RESS</b> exists in N. crassa and might be a limiting step of lignocellulase synthesis (Wang et al. 2010), which agrees with our findings.
