40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices for longterm investors such as pension funds. We start with a general definition of a meanreverting price process and explain how mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices is related to mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock returns. Subsequently, we show that mean reversion makes stocks less risky for investors with long investment horizons. Next, we consider a mean-variance efficient investor and show how mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices affects such an investor’s optimal portfolio weights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the investment decisions of long-term investors...|$|R

40|$|Angiosperm {{flowers are}} usually {{determinate}} structures that may produce seeds.

The allopolyploid Arabidopsis suecica displays photoperiod-dependent floral <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> a subset of its flowers, yet {{little is known about}} the environmental conditions enhancing this phenotype, or the morphological processes leading to reversion. We have used light and electron microscopy to further describe this phenomenon. Additionally, we have further studied the phenology of flowering and floral <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> A. suecica. In this study we confirm and expand upon our previous findings that floral <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> the allopolyploid A. suecica is photoperiod-dependent, and show that its frequency is correlated with the timing for the onset of flowering.

40|$|Mean {{reversion}} {{refers to}} the tendency of asset prices {{to return to a}} long term trend. The existence of mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> indexes implies predictability and predictability can be exploited by constructing investment strategies that may have the potential to outperform benchmarks. Mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices in the U. S. has been a subject to much controversy and there is no strong evidence in favor for or against it. However, evidence of mean <b>reversion</b> exists <b>in</b> certain stock fundamentals, such as the Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E). That is, the stock prices may or may not mean revert, but the relative stock prices (relative to companies’ earnings) do exhibit mean <b>reversion.</b> <b>In</b> our research we worked {{to see if we could}} capitalize on this mean reversion. We analyzed well-diversified data, including indexes with stocks from all over the globe, comparing an investment strategy based on assumed predictability to the standard buy-and-hold approach. Our findings suggest that investing under the assumption of mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> Price-to-Earnings ratios does in fact, on average, outperform the benchmark—increasingly so as you move into the long run...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of short-term interest rates in several countries. We examine the importance of nonlinearities <b>in</b> the mean <b>reversion</b> and volatility of short-term interest rates. We examine various models that allow the conditional mean (drift) and conditional variance (diffusion) to be functions of the current short rate. We find that different markets require different models. In particular, we find evidence of nonlinear mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> some of the countries that we examine, linear mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> others and no mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> some countries. For all countries we examine, there is strong evidence {{of the need for}} the volatility of interest rate changes to be highly sensitive {{to the level of the}} short-term interest rate. Out-of-sample forecasting performance of one-factor short rate models is poor, stemming from the inability of the models to accommodate jumps and discontinuities in the time series data.

50|$|The study accepts that VA {{will tend}} to {{outperform}} when there is mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> market returns (e.g. a high return one month tends {{to be followed by}} a low return the following month), but even if an investor identifies a market which mean-reverts VA is unlikely to be the best strategy to use. Consistent mean reversion would mean that market returns are easy to forecast, so {{it would be easy to}} construct other strategies which would take advantage of this predictability more effectively than VA. Mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> the market is not the same concept as regression to the mean as used by statisticians where retesting a non-random sample of a population tends to produce results that are closer to the mean than the original test. The existence of mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> financial markets is controversial and is a subject of active research. If it exists, then it is almost certainly very slight.|$|R

Standard option pricing models assume proportionality between price variance and time to maturity. This proportionality is not a valid assumption for commodities whose supply response brings prices back to production costs.

40|$|We {{characterize}} a three-factor {{model of}} commodity spot prices, convenience yields, and interest rates, which nests many existing specifications.

Empirical results show strong evidence for spot-price level dependence in convenience yields for crude oil and copper, which implies mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> prices under the risk-neutral measure.
