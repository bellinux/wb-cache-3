40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} a {{new data}} set, compiled by Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Revenue Canada and Statistics Canada, {{to examine the}} unemployment experience of Canadian immigrant cohorts over the time period 1980 to 1988. Using the records of unemployment insurance benefits of persons who immigrated to Canada in those years and who filed income tax returns, the unemployment experiences {{of those people are}} compared by landing year, gender, level of education, language ability, and country of last permanent residence. The determinants of the proportion of each immigrant cohort that received unemployment insurance benefits are estimated by relating the proportions to landing year, duration of time in Canada, and labour market conditions. Briefly, we find no obvious influences on UI receipt behaviour following the immigration reforms of 1982. However, the recession of 1981 - 82 had a major impact on incomes which did not recover until 5 or 6 years later. Nevertheless, more generous UI benefits did <b>raise</b> <b>slightly</b> the likelihood of UI receipts. Unemployment insurance · immigration policy in Canada...|$|E
40|$|We present {{simulations}} of a cosmic shear survey and {{show how the}} survey geometry influences the accuracy of determination of cosmological parameters. We numerically calculate the full covariance matrices Cov of two-point statistics of cosmic shear, based on the expressions derived in the first paper of this series. The individual terms are compared for two survey geometries with large and small cosmic variance. We use analyses based on maximum likelihood of Cov and the Fisher information matrix in order to derive expected constraints on cosmological parameters. As an illustrative example, we simulate various survey geometries consisting of 300 individual fields of 13 'x 13 ' size, placed (semi-) randomly into patches which {{are assumed to be}} widely separated on the sky and therefore uncorrelated. Using the aperture mass statistics, the optimum survey consists of 10 patches with 30 images in each patch. If Ω_m, σ_ 8 and Γ are supposed to be extracted from the data, the minimum variance bounds on these three parameters are 0. 17, 0. 25 and 0. 04 respectively. These variances <b>raise</b> <b>slightly</b> when the initial power spectrum index n_s is also to be determined from the data. The cosmological constant is only poorly constrained.
