50|$|Made between 1932 and 1936, the {{original}} Contax, known as Contax I after later models were introduced, was markedly {{different from the}} corresponding Leica. Using a die-cast alloy body it housed a vertically travelling metal focal-plane shutter reminiscent of the one used in Contessa-Nettel cameras, made out of interlocking blackened brass slats somewhat like a roll-up garage door. This complex shutter became the characteristic of the Contax camera and its Super-Nettel derivative. By contrast, the competitive Leica followed the established design of using rubberized fabric shutter curtains wound around rollers, moving horizontally. The Contax design allowed a higher maximum shutter speed: the top speed was 1/1000s, then increased to 1/1250s in the Contax II. The fact the shutter ran across the shorter dimension of the format area was a significant factor for achieving this technical feat. The interlocking slats were aligned by specially woven silk ribbons, which were very strong but subject to wear. Replacing these ribbons was difficult but, contrary to modern cameras, made for a 400,000-cycle life.Zeiss also invented the System Camera, {{with all sorts of}} near-photo, wide-angle, mirror-house, long-focal-length lenses for specific situations. However Zeiss called it Universalkamera.One of the key design features was a coupled rangefinder with a very long baseline, with its own eyepiece next to that of the viewfinder. To enhance accuracy, a novel <b>rotating</b> <b>wedge</b> system was employed in lieu of the common swinging mirror mechanism.

40|$|Early visual {{areas can}} be defined using fMRI {{on the basis of}} their retinotopic organisation. Recently, very {{high-resolution}} images of the human brain in vivo have identified areas of myelination within the grey matter, corresponding to the striate cortex (Barbier et al. 2002; Clare et al. 2002). This myelination has traditionally been understood to correspond to the human primary visual cortex (V 1). To test this correspondence, we compared the location of visually identified striate in high resolution images with the location of functionally defined V 1. For imaging the myeloarchitecture, a magnetisation prepared 3 D FLASH sequence was used as described in Clare et al. (2002). The resulting images had a resolution of 0. 3 × 0. 3 × 1. 5 mm. Functional MRI was performed at a lower resolution of 3 × 3 × 1. 5 mm using single shot EPI at the same 16 slice locations as the structural scan. Retinotopy data were collected using expanding ring and <b>rotating</b> <b>wedge</b> stimuli. The data were transformed onto a segmented (mrGray) and flattened (mrFlatMesh) T 1 -weighted scan (1 × 1 × 1 mm).

From the high-resolution myeloarchitecture images, striate cortex was conservatively determined as those regions where a stripe was identified within the grey matter. These observer drawn maps of striate cortex were then transformed into flattened space to allow comparison with the functional data. A good level of correspondence was found between the striate cortex determined in the structural MRI and V 1 determined by fMRI. While the striate cortex was not identified as a continuous band, it is hoped that more striate will be revealed by using multiple slice orientations in the same subjects. In the future these very high-resolution structural images will offer the opportunity to combine the study of myeloarchitecture with functional architecture in the living human cortex...|$|E

The experiment was conducted in the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) facility located at Penn State University. The wedge was placed at the tip of a rotating blade. Ice particles shot from a pressure gun intercepted the moving wedge and impacted it at a location along its circular path. The upward velocity of the ice particles varied from 7 to 12 meters per second. Wedge velocities were varied from 0 to 120 meters per second. Wedge angles tested were 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction. We used high-field (3 T) {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) to map the retinotopic organization of human cortical areas. Methods. Retinotopic maps were reconstructed using existing mapping techniques. Stimuli were made of a <b>rotating</b> <b>wedge</b> stimulus, which provided angular coordinate maps, and an expanding or contracting ring, which provided eccentricity coordinate maps. Stimuli consisted of a grey background alternating with a flickering checkerboard. A Brucker 3 T scanner equipped with a head coil and a custom optical system was used to acquire sets of echoplanar images of 20 occipital coronal slices within a RT of 2. 111 ms and an 8 mm(3) voxel resolution. Surface models of each subject's occipital lobes were constructed using the Brainvisa software from a sagittal T 1 -weighted image with a 1 mm(3) voxel resolution. The cortical models were then inflated to obtain unfolded surfaces. Statistical analyses of the functional data were made under SPM 99, and the response amplitudes were finally assigned to the cortical reconstructed surfaces. Results. We identified boundaries between different early visual areas (V 1, V 2, V 3) using eccentricity and polar angle retinotopic maps and detection of reversals in the representation of the polar angle. Both complete maps and reversals corresponding to the V 1 /V 2 borders were clearly visible with a single recording session. Also, we were able to compare data from subjects across various fMRI acquisitions and found that there was a strong correlation between maps acquired at different sessions for the same subject.

Confirming existing literature with discrete object classes, activity in FFA and PPA was time-locked to the presentation of foveal and eccentric rings, respectively.

40|$|International audienceWe {{are usually}} {{unaware of the}} brief but large {{illumination}} changes caused by blinks, presumably because of blink suppression mechanisms. In fMRI however, increase of the BOLD signal {{was reported in the}} visual cortex, e. g. during blocks of voluntary blinks (Bristow, Frith and Rees, 2005) or after spontaneous blinks recorded during the prolonged fixation of a static stimulus (Tse, Baumgartner and Greenlee, 2010). We tested whether such activation, possibly related to illumination changes, was also present during standard fMRI retinotopic and visual experiments and was large enough to contaminate the BOLD signal we are interested in. We monitored in a 3 T scanner the eyeblinks of 14 subjects who observed three different types of visual stimuli, including periodic <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges</b> and contracting/expanding rings, event-related Mondrians and graphemes, while fixating. We performed event-related analyses on the set of detected spontaneous blinks. We observed large and widespread BOLD responses related to blinks in the visual cortex of every subject and whatever the visual stimulus. The magnitude of the modulation was comparable to visual stimulation. However, blink-related activations lay mostly in the anterior parts of retinotopic visual areas, coding the periphery of the visual field well beyond the extent of our stimuli. Blinks therefore represent an important source of BOLD variations in the visual cortex and a troublesome source of noise since any correlation, even weak, between the distribution of blinks and a tested protocol could trigger artifactual activities. However, the typical signature of blinks along the anterior calcarine and the parieto-occipital sulcus allows identifying, {{even in the absence of}} eyetracking, fMRI protocols possibly contaminated by a heterogeneous distribution of blinks...|$|R
40|$|Current fMRI retinotopic mapping {{procedures}} {{often use}} checkerboard stimuli consisting of expanding rings and <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges</b> {{to measure the}} topography within human visual areas. Efficient procedures are well described in the literature. For many experimental paradigms, e. g., visuo-spatial attention paradigms, the identification of task-relevant positions is the only mandatory prerequisite. To define these specific “regions-of-interest” (ROIs), spatially defined localizers are used. A precise evaluation of localizer techniques in regard to efficient scanning time, optimal BOLD (blood oxygenic level dependent) response, as well as quantification of the resulting ROIs within each visual area (size, overlap, surround effects) has not been studied to date. Here, we suggest a mapping procedure designed to quantify spatial and functional properties of single positions at close proximity in multiple human visual areas. During a passive viewing task, various stimuli (e. g., checkerboards or colored objects) subtending 1. 4 ° of visual angle were presented at {{one out of four}} positions in a randomized block design. We measured the degree of overlap between positions at different hierarchical levels of the visual system (V 1 –V 4 v) and quantified modulatory effects on a specific position by stimulation at neighboring (1. 7 ° spacing) or distant positions (5. 1 ° or 8. 5 ° spacing). Within each visual area, “mexican-hat” distributions of local signal intensity changes, which describe a particular combination of facilitatory and suppressive effects, were found. Cubic fitting revealed the most localized tuning effect in V 1, which gradually decreased throughout the higher visual areas.

In this study, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the retinotopic organization of areas throughout macaque occipital, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex. fMRI data was collected in three rhesus monkeys. During all session, we acquired 50 horizontal slices with an 84 x 84 matrix at 1 mm isotropic spatial resolution, TR/TE of 2000 / 19 ms. The stimuli consisted of alternating <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges</b> and expanding/contracting rings to obtain information about both polar angle and eccentricity organization. Animated movies of Macaque faces and walking human persons were confined to the retinotopically-specific apertures, during continuous central fixation. The data were analyzed using Freesurfer, JIP, and Matlab. In all subjects a clear retinotopic organization was found in the occipital cortex (V 1, V 2, V 3, V 3 A, V 4, and V 4 A).

In addition, in parietal cortex as well as IT cortex the data indicate multiple areas containing biases for either foveal or peripheral stimuli.

It was {{toward the end of}} his graduate-student days at Harvard and during his postdoctoral stay at UCSD, Dale later said, that he began working with MRI and fMRI. “The field had just gotten started,” he explained. “We tried to use cortical surface reconstruction from MRI to constrain the localization of EEG and MEG signals.

Steve Engel at Stanford had just developed the phase-encoded stimulus paradigm. He showed that if you present subjects with expanding annulus and <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges,</b> you can apply Fourier analysis to fMRI signals on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and obtain a delay map, or an estimate of the retinotopic representation. We thought up the idea of looking at these maps on the cortical surface, because the maps are actually two-dimensional. Although the topology of these maps is simple, their folding makes them complex in volume. In order to visualize and analyze the patterns of brain activity, you really need to take into account the individual geometry of the cortex. So we decided to do an experiment.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem of neuroscience {{is being able}} to understand the input-output relationship of early sensory areas. Central to this understanding is the notion of the receptive field (RF). Previous electrophysiological studies in the visual system of primates have demonstrated that receptive fields do not have fixed properties but are dynamically changing {{as a function of the}} stimulation conditions or behavioral tasks. In the human, aggregate (voxel-based) receptive field sizes (pRF) of early visual cortex were estimated by fMRI using standard retinotopic stimuli (Dumoulin SO, Wandell BA, Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex, Neuroimage 39, 2008) but it would be desirable to obtain more detailed estimates of RF spatio-temporal properties. In this study, we have used flickering checkerboard stimuli (white noise) in order to measure the spatio-temporal response properties of population RFs by fMRI. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) measurements were performed both in anesthetized macaques (4. 7 Tesla vertical scanner) and awake-fixating human subjects (3 Tesla Siemens Trio). We found that the BOLD-signal amplitude in early visual cortex changes as a function of the checker-size of the stimulus and this can provide estimates of the central excitatory integration area as well as the surround suppression of the aggregate RFs. The estimates of the size of the central portion of the RFs were found to increase with eccentricity within each visual area as well as from lower to higher visual areas. The results were comparable to pRF-size estimates derived from additional experiments with classical retinotopic stimuli (expanding rings, <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges,</b> moving horizontal and vertical bars). Current work focuses on evaluating how RF parameter estimates change as a function of the temporal frequency and contrast of the stimuli. We believe that this method can provide robust estimates of RF parameters which can be used in longitudinal studies for the assessment of cortical reorganization and plasticity in patients suffering from retinal and cortical lesions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. We are {{developing}} a method for retinotopic mapping of the visual cortex in people with central field loss. Retinotopic mapping based on polar coordinates uses <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges</b> and expanding rings, which assume stable foveal fixation. However, people with central field loss usually adopt a non-foveal retinal location for fixation and that location is typically unknown. Therefore, instead of using the polar-coordinate based mapping method, which requires a known origin, we developed a set of phase-coded mapping stimuli in Cartesian coordinates that will also allow us to estimate the fixation locations relative to the unknown fovea location. The current study aims to validate this new mapping procedure in observers with normal vision. Method. High-resolution structural and functional MR images were acquired on a Siemens 3 T system. Two mapping stimuli were used. Both were 2 deg wide checkered bars, which extended across the full-display. One was a vertical bar moving across the screen from left to right. The other was a horizontal bar that moved from top to bottom. In both cases, the bar traversed the display 4 times, each pass taking 72 s. Since the subjects fixated on a dot {{at the center of the}} display, the bars should cross the fixation at the mid-point of the 72 -second period. This time point was compared with the time point when the bars cross the fovea, which was estimated by deriving the switch of V 1 activation from one hemisphere to the other hemisphere produced by the vertical bar, and from the lower bank to the upper bank of the calcarine sulcus produced by the horizontal bar. Results. With this new method, the estimated fovea locations were within 2 deg from the actual locations. Conclusions. Our new stimuli allow us to estimate the fixation location with acceptable precision. This new procedure may be useful for retinotopic mapping on people with central field loss. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{the primary}} visual cortex (V 1) {{as a result of}} stroke or other brain {{diseases}} can lead to a loss of conscious vision in the contralateral visual hemifield. Cortical blindness affects many activities on a patient's daily life and {{is considered to be a}} heavy burden while there are few, if any, options for rehabilitation and recovery. A much debated issue is whether the visual cortex is able to reorganize after injury in adult human subjects, and if so, what may be the mechanism of reorganization. Here we apply an important new approach introduced by Dumoulin and Wandell (Doumoulin SO, Wandell BA, Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex, Neuroimage 39, 2008), which uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the aggregate receptive field properties of neuronal populations voxel by voxel in the visual cortex. The purpose of this study is to compare receptive field measurements in patients with cortical lesions with controls and to investigate whether these measurements change following injury. Patients were fixating in the magnet and fMRI measurements were obtained during the presentation of standard visual stimuli used in retinotopic mapping (<b>rotating</b> <b>wedges,</b> expanding rings, horizontally and vertically moving bars). The patient’s intact hemisphere, as well as normal subjects were used as controls. In some controls an area of the stimulus was obscured (“artificial scotoma”) to simulate as much as possible the real scotoma of the patients. Preliminary results suggest that receptive field measurements obtained in patients and in subjects examined under the artificial scotoma condition differ from measurements obtained in controls under the normal visual stimulation condition. We are in the process of obtaining further control tests and measurements to confirm these findings and to assess to what degree they correspond to cortical reorganization. Future research will focus on using these methods to study the capacity of various visual rehabilitation training methods to induce visual cortex reorganization...|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} {{organization}} of high-level visual cortex has mainly focused on using discrete object classes like faces and buildings. In contrast, the large-scale retinotopic organization in lower levels of the visual cortex has been studied with techniques that allow continuous mapping, termed phase-encoding techniques. In this procedure, the stimuli typically consist of gradually changing <b>rotating</b> <b>wedges</b> and contracting/expanding rings. These traveling waves in retinal space produce traveling waves {{on the surface of}} the brain, and the time delay or phase of the response of each cortical location defines the most effective stimulus position. Here, we propose the extension of this method to higher-order properties of visual objects. We used continuously changing stimuli, forming a continuum between a face and a house. Both stimuli were constructed using a 3 D program, and the subsequent morphs were created using clearly defined corresponding features and a point per point transformation. The resulting morphs were ambiguous stimuli with both house- and face-like features. The stimuli were shown from three possible angles (front, 45 ° left and 45 ° right orientation). In a separate experiment, we used contracting and expanding rings cut out from natural scenes. To validate the method, we focused initially on face-selective voxels (the fusiform face area or FFA) and building-selective voxels (the parahippocampal place area or PPA), as defined from localizer scans with face and building images presented in separate blocks. We found that the method does indeed work as intended. Activity in FFA was locked to the presentation of face or face-like images, while activity in PPA was locked to the presentation of building or building-like images. In addition, and again confirming the existing literature based on traditional blocked stimulus presentation, the activity of voxels in FFA and PPA was locked to the presentation of foveal and eccentric rings, respectively. These results indicate that the phase-encoding techniques used in retinotopic mapping can also be applied to stimuli with feature variations that are more suited to investigate {{the organization of}} high-level visual regions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Version 3. 1 of the NPARC {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} flow solver introduces a capability to solve unsteady flow on moving multi-block, structured grids with nominally second-order time accuracy. The grid motion is due to segments of the boundary grid that translate and rotate in a rigid-body manner or deform. The grid is regenerated at each time step to accommodate the boundary grid motion. The flow equations and computational models sense the moving grid through the grid velocities, which are computed from a time-difference of the grids at two consecutive time levels. For three-dimensional flow domains, {{it is assumed that}} the grid retains a planar character with respect to one coordinate. The application and accuracy of NPARC v 3. 1 is demonstrated for flow about a flying <b>wedge,</b> <b>rotating</b> flap, a collapsing bump in a duct, and the upstart / restart flow in a variable-geometry inlet. The results compare well with analytic and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} debate {{as to whether}} visual mental imagery relies entirely on {{symbolic}} (language-like) representations or also relies on depictive (picture-like) representations. We sought to discover whether visual mental imagery could evoke cortical activity with precise visual field topography (retinotopy). Participants received three conditions: the perception condition consisted of a standard retinotopic mapping procedure, where two flickering checkerboard <b>wedges</b> <b>rotated</b> around a central fixation point. The imagery and attention conditions consisted of the same stimulus, but only the outer arcs of the wedges were visible. During imagery, participants mentally reproduced the stimulus wedges, using the stimulus arcs as a guide. The attention condition required either distributed attention or focused attention to where the stimulus wedges would have been. Event-related analysis revealed that the imagery (greater than either form of attention) retinotopic maps were similar to the perception maps. Moreover, blocked analysis revealed similar perception and imagery effects in human motion processing region MT 1. These results support the depictive view of visual mental imagery...|$|R
40|$|Image blur dues to the {{relative}} motion with the target in the camera exposure time, it would be worse while the ratio of speed and height (or speed and distance) increased. At present, the optical image motion compensation method bases mainly on the reflective element. In order to overcome the disadvantages of complicated image rotation corrected mechanism, difficult position location and optical vibration occurred by the swing scanning, a new method based on <b>rotating</b> double optical <b>wedge</b> was proposed, the dynamic working matrix was built, the emergent light vector's trajectory was analyzed and simulated. According to the actual image motion compensation demand, the double optical wedge designing result and controlling method were presented. Through analysis and simulation, {{the results show that}} this method has significant advantages such as compact structure, easy controlling method, stable motion state, high compensation capacity, etc. It has very important practical value for the occasions of the greater ratio of speed and height (or speed and distance). ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Astronautics.

40|$|Even {{though the}} eyes {{constantly}} change position, {{the location of}} a stimulus can be accurately represented by a population of neurons with retinotopic receptive fields modulated by eye position gain fields. Recent electrophysiological studies, however, indicate that eye position gain fields may serve an additional function since they have a non-uniform spatial distribution that increases the neural response to stimuli in the straight-ahead direction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a wide-field stimulus display to determine whether gaze modulations in early human visual cortex enhance the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) response to stimuli that are straight-ahead. Subjects viewed <b>rotating</b> polar angle <b>wedge</b> stimuli centered straight-ahead or vertically displaced by +/- 20 A degrees eccentricity. Gaze position did not affect the topography of polar phase-angle maps, confirming that coding was retinotopic, but did affect the amplitude of the BOLD response, consistent with a gain field. In agreement with recent electrophysiological studies, BOLD responses in V 1 and V 2 to a wedge stimulus at a fixed retinal locus decreased when the wedge location in head-centered coordinates was farther from the straight-ahead direction. We conclude that stimulus-evoked BOLD signals are modulated by a systematic, non-uniform distribution of eye-position gain fields...|$|R
40|$|Context. Stellar {{convection}} {{zones are}} characterized by vigorous high-Reynolds number turbulence at low Prandtl numbers. Aims. We study the dynamo and differential rotation regimes at varying levels of viscous, thermal, and magnetic diffusion. Methods. We perform three-dimensional simulations of stratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in <b>rotating</b> spherical <b>wedges</b> at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0. 25 to 2 and from 0. 25 to 5, respectively). Differential rotation and large-scale magnetic fields are produced self-consistently. Results. We find that for high thermal diffusivity, the rotation profiles show a monotonically increasing angular velocity {{from the bottom of}} the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator. For sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at mid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased, corresponding to an increase of the Prandtl number. This coincides with and results in a change of the dynamo mode from poleward propagating activity belts to equatorward propagating ones. Furthermore, the clearly cyclic solutions disappear at the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers and give way to irregular sign changes or quasi-stationary states. The total (mean and fluctuating) magnetic energy increases as a function of the magnetic Reynolds number in the range studied here (5 – 151), but the energies of the mean magnetic fields level off at high magnetic Reynolds numbers. The differential rotation is strongly affected by the magnetic fields and almost vanishes at the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. In some of our most turbulent cases, however, we find that two regimes are possible, where either differential rotation is strong and mean magnetic fields are relatively weak, or vice versa. Conclusions. Our simulations indicate a strong nonlinear feedback of magnetic fields on differential rotation, leading to qualitative changes in the behaviors of large-scale dynamos at high magnetic Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we do not find indications of the simulations approaching an asymptotic regime where the results would be independent of diffusion coefficients in the parameter range studied here...|$|R
40|$|The {{patterns}} of functional organization occurring within the macaque brain {{can be too}} small to be resolved with conventional monkey fMRI paradigms. Hence, resolving the functional architecture of such structures requires higher spatial resolution then currently achievable with ‘conventional’ field MRI scanners and receive coil designs. Importantly, an increase in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) within the tissue of interest is required for higher spatial resolution imaging due to the inverse relationship between voxel size and SNR. While previous studies have employed higher field strengths to achieve the required increases in SNR, higher field fMRI is expensive and can cause increased susceptibility artifacts rendering reliable high-resolution functional imaging throughout the brain more difficult. Implanting receive coils in close proximity to the monkey brain (Logothetis 2002) is an alternative and economically more efficient approach to improve image SNR. However, the use of single coils precludes acquiring high resolution images of the whole brain. We here attempted to improve the spatial resolution of fMRI measurements without SNR-loss in awake behaving monkeys at 3 Tesla by permanently embedding an 8 -channel phased-array receive coils in the headpost of monkeys (Janssens et al. 2012). The close proximity of the coil array relative to the brain allowed for increased SNR throughout the brain. In addition, the fixed position of these coils offered increased consistency of the SNR profiles across the brain during fMRI experiments. As proof-of-principle for ultra-high resolution fMRI in awake monkeys, we conducted phase-encoded retinotopic mapping experiments with complex natural and moving shapes (dynamic faces and walking persons). During fMRI acquisition (with ~ brain-wide coverage and 0. 125 mm 3 isotropic voxels) monkeys performed a passive fixation task while either <b>rotating</b> clockwise/counterclockwise <b>wedges</b> or expanding/contracting rings (24 degrees in diameter) where presented in the background. This approach confirmed the retinopic organization of early visual areas and significantly expanded retinotopic descriptions of small regions within the IPS, STS and arcuate sulcus. In addition, by reliably measuring functional activity at such a high spatial resolution in the awake-behaving primate these studies pave the way for further experiments probing the function of increasingly smaller functional units in the monkey brain. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an electronic aircraft taxi navigation display as part of NASA's Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) Program. The impetus for the development of this specific display, and the TAP program as a whole, is the current bottleneck in surface operations experienced during low-visibility operations. Simply stated, while modern aircraft are equipped to fly and land in low-visibility conditions, they lack the related technology required to allow them to efficiently and safely navigation from the runway to the gate. Pilots under such conditions consequently taxi slower, sometimes get lost and have to stop, and occasionally collide with other aircraft. Based on a review of available display and navigation sensor technologies, and a one-year information requirements study conducted aboard several commercial aircraft flights, it was determined that an electronic aircraft taxi navigation display was the most viable option for improving the efficiency of low-visibility taxi operations. Based on flight deck observations and pilot interviews, previous map display research, other taxi map display efforts, and part-task taxi map research, an advanced taxi navigation display has been developed and is currently being tested. The taxi navigation display is presented as a head-down cockpit display and includes a track-up perspective airport surface view, taxiway, gate and runway labels, ownship position, traffic icons and collision annunciation, graphical route guidance, heading indicator, <b>rotating</b> compass, RVR <b>wedge,</b> stop bars, zoom control, and datalink message window. The development and support for each of the features will be discussed in detail. Additional information is contained in the original extended abstract...|$|R
40|$|The Wyoming {{foreland}} {{is composed}} of basement-involved structures and intermontane basins formed during the Laramide Orogeny. Based on their sizes, structures in this area can be categorized into primary uplifts and secondary folds. Tectonic models suggest the primary uplifts form by sliding the crustal slabs along a deep-seated, large-scale regional detachment in the lower crust, and <b>rotating</b> the basement <b>wedges</b> along listric primary faults. The secondary folds are located close to and trend sub-parallel to the adjacent primary structures, suggesting a causative or correlative relationship between the two, although this connection has not been firmly established through field and seismic investigations. I carry out numerical simulations using both the finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM) to explore the structural evolution of these secondary basement-involved structures. The first study investigates the Laramide-age Sheep Mountain anticline, located in the eastern Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, using comparative FEM and DEM simulations. The kinematic and mechanical results of the two simulations are similar, thus verifying the methodological comparison. Differences in the geometric details, however, provide important perspectives on {{the capabilities of the}} two methods. The mechanical properties defined through this comparative study are then employed in DEM simulations that investigate the relationships between primary and secondary structures during the displacement of large crustal slabs along primary thrust faults. My results show that the displacements and geometries of the primary faults have great impact on the distributions and throw values of the secondary faults. For shallow primary faults with limited regional shortening, the numbers and the displacements of secondary faults are evenly distributed across the basin, with no preference in dip direction. For steep primary faults with significant regional shortening, conjugate faults form early and subsequently cluster into groups. I also explore the influences of initial sedimentary thickness, sedimentary mechanical stratigraphy, and syn-tectonic sedimentation on the distribution of secondary faults. Thicker Pre-Laramide deposits allow more secondary faults to form early during deformation, absorbing the horizontal shortening within the sedimentary layer. The presence of weak shale layers in the sedimentary section allows numerous small faults to form, and limits the depth of all the faults. Syn-tectonic sedimentation reduces the number of secondary faults that form in the basinal area, and displacements along those faults are very small. In this case, most of the deformation is accommodated by the faults located above the ramp take-off location, {{at the edge of the}} syn-tectonic deposits...|$|R
