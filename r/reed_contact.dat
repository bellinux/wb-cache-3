50|$|In {{mechanical}} operation using a SAM with a drawknob attached, a player will either pull the drawknob towards themselves to select an 'on' state, or push the drawknob away to select an 'off' state. The {{movement of the}} drawknob affects {{the state of the}} switch or <b>reed</b> <b>contact.</b> Similarly, with a SAM that utilises a tilting tablet, the player will tilt the tablet up or down by hand to operate it. With a theatre organ the tab attached to each SAM is raised or lowered by the player to operate the switch contact/s.|$|E
50|$|A reed's {{resonant}} frequency is a mid-range audible frequency of perhaps 300 Hz. The solenoid {{is driven by}} the output of the radio control receiver, which is an audio tone or tones. If the receiver output contains the appropriate tone for the {{resonant frequency}} of a reed, that reed would be made to vibrate. As the reed vibrates, it touches a contact screw above its free end. These contacts form the output of the decoder. Decoder outputs are generally fed to small relays. These allow a high current load to be controlled, such as the model's propulsion motor. Using a relay also adds a damping time constant to the output, so that the intermittent contact with the <b>reed</b> <b>contact</b> (which is vibrating at the transmitter audible tone frequency) becomes a continuous output signal.|$|E

50|$|One or more reed {{switches}} {{inside a}} coil is a reed relay. Reed relays are used when operating currents are relatively low, and offer high operating speed, good performance with very small currents {{which are not}} reliably switched by conventional contacts, high reliability and long life. Millions of reed relays were used in telephone exchanges in the 1970s and 80s. In particular they were used for switching in the British TXE family of telephone exchanges. The inert atmosphere around the <b>reed</b> <b>contacts</b> ensures that oxidation will not affect the <b>contact</b> resistance. Mercury-wetted <b>reed</b> relays are sometimes used, especially in high-speed counting circuits. Reliability is compromised by contacts sticking closed either from residual magnetism or welding.|$|R
5000|$|Tucker's crewmate, Malcolm Reed, {{puts him}} in touch with Harris, <b>Reed's</b> <b>contact</b> within Section 31. Tucker agrees to an {{undercover}} mission into Romulan territory to find and neutralize the Romulans' new warp 7 engine program, which will be faster than almost all other warp drives in existence (at this time the Vulcans had warp 7 capability) and would undoubtedly endanger the Coalition. He is successful, but in the process, he learns that Vulcans and Romulans were once one species. Tucker reluctantly agrees to remain officially [...] "dead", lest this secret become public and thereby endanger the newly formed coalition. Also, the novel suggests that Tucker's extended lifespan {{is partly due to}} the genetic engineering he receives to pass as a Romulan.|$|R
50|$|In this {{alternative}} universe crazed Reed Richards recently infects Johnny Storm, Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm with the zombie virus. The three then turn Reed into a zombie {{and the four}} of them go on a rampage with the other zombies. Eventually <b>Reed</b> <b>contacts</b> the Ultimate <b>Reed</b> and gets him to come to the infected universe. Johnny travels with the three others to the Ultimate Universe. They attack the Fantastic Four there but are thwarted, and are locked up in a containment cell. Johnny eats live animals and loathes the Ultimate version of himself, remarking that he especially hates his hair. When they escape the four attack the Baxter Building, Ultimate Reed switches bodies with Ultimate Doom and takes on all four zombies. Johnny is last seen being torn apart and extinguished by Reed in Dr. Doom's body.|$|R

5000|$|A {{magnetic}} field (from an electromagnet or a permanent magnet) {{will cause the}} reeds to attract each other, thus completing an electrical circuit. The spring force of the reeds causes them to separate, and open the circuit, when the {{magnetic field}} ceases. Another configuration contains a non-ferromagnetic normally-closed contact that opens when the ferromagnetic normally-open contact closes. A thin layer of non-ferromagnetic material {{is applied to the}} <b>reed</b> switch <b>contact</b> area to serve as an electrical contact switching (wear) surface and, for normally-open contacts, as a magnetic spacer whose thickness is important in controlling the magnetic field level at which the contact opens (the drop-out). <b>Reed</b> switch <b>contacts</b> are typically Rh, Ru, Ir, or W. There are also versions of reed switches with mercury [...] "wetted" [...] contacts. Such switches must be mounted in a particular orientation. Otherwise drops of mercury may bridge the contacts even when not activated.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} {{electronic}} keyboards {{in the early}} 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in metal frames. These keyboards cost from 80 to 120USD and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were <b>reed</b> switches (<b>contacts</b> enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the switch plunger).|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{electromechanical}} characteristics, electrostatic characteristics and coil eddy current losses of a reed relay was developed. These characteristics were returned from reed and coil dimensions. The model was intended {{as an aid to}} the design of reed relays for Radio Frequency (RF) and high voltage applications. An electromechanical model of a reed switch and coil was developed using a combination of an axisymmetric finite element model and analytical methods. The characteristics returned from this model were operate, release and differential amp turns, contact gap and contact force. Inclusion of results for contact resistance against contact force yielded the contact resistance characteristics. Electrostatic force between <b>reed</b> <b>contacts</b> was calculated and a criteria for contact arcing in a vacuum applied to allow prediction of breakdown voltage in an evacuated reed switch. The above elements were incorporated in a "Reed Switch Design Program" in which operating, contact resistance and breakdown voltage characteristics were calculated from reed and coil dimensions. Results were found to be in agreement with measured values for three reed switch types. Eddy current losses in relay coils were investigated through experimental measurement of losses occurring in coils mounted around a copper conductor carrying a high frequency current. The losses occurring in the coil were found to present an effective resistance to the current in the conductor. The influence of coil dimensions and the magnetic properties of the conductor on losses were observed. An analytical model of eddy current losses was derived from first principals results and were found concordant with those measured. An "RF Reed Relay Design Program" embodying the eddy current loss model and preceding work was created to demonstrate how relay performance (and efficiency) can be enhanced by tuning reed and coil dimensions. An example of its successful application to product development at Crydom Magnetics Ltd is presented. Proposals for future work are included. Crydom Magnetics Limite...|$|R

50|$|Williams' father, Charles Anthony Williams, Sr., was a {{musician}} who played bass, drums, and piano, and had band rehearsals {{in the family}} home in Camden, New Jersey, exposing Williams to jazz at an early age. Williams was particularly inspired to focus on bass after hearing his father's record of Star Dust, performed by Oscar Pettiford, and started playing in his early teens. He had his first professional gig {{while he was still}} a junior high school student, filling in for Charles, Sr., who had double booked himself one evening. Williams later spent his days practicing with Sam Dockery, who was playing in Jimmy Heath's band in Philadelphia on a regular double bill with Sam Reed. Charles, Sr. hosted a jam session at a club called Rip's and gave Williams the opportunity to put his own group together for a Monday night show in 1959, and in an effort to work his way into Heath's band, Williams hired Sam Reed. The plan worked, as two days later <b>Reed</b> <b>contacted</b> Williams about playing in his band that coming Saturday, which demonstrated Williams' talent to Heath, who in turn hired Williams the following week. Just after graduating high school in 1960, Williams had the opportunity to play with Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt when Nelson Boyd reached out to Charles, Sr. to cover for him. Charles, Sr. was also unable to make the gig, and sent Buster in his stead. After the first set on a Friday night, Ammons and Stitt asked Williams to join the band on tour, starting in Chicago, after playing through the weekend in Philadelphia. Williams toured with them for about a year, from 1960 into 1961, until the group got stranded in Kansas City and was abandoned by Ammons, who fled without paying the band. The rhythm section managed to work with Al Hibbler for one week in order to earn enough for train fare to return home. Williams made his first two recordings with the Ammons/Stitt group in August 1961, Dig Him! for Argo Records and Boss Tenors for Verve, both recorded in Chicago.|$|R

On Reed's first night, Higgins heads for a meeting at a warehouse, telling Reed he doesn't need to know the details. Moments after Higgins enters the building, it explodes, killing Higgins. In the aftermath, Navarro returns Reed to Dixon's command. She tells him he can keep his recently earned promotion and work plainclothes, but is not to investigate Higgins' death, as Navarro wants the investigation to remain internal to OCU. Shortly thereafter, <b>Reed</b> is <b>contacted</b> by FBI Special Agent Gabriel Whitting (Christopher Walken), who informs him there is a mole in the OCU. Whitting believes Higgins was about to reveal the identity of the mole, which is why he was killed.

All Whitting knows about the mole is that they are in contact with four major crime organizations in Manhattan.|$|R
50|$|A {{reed relay}} (sometimes {{also known as}} Herkon relay) {{is a type of}} relay that uses an {{electromagnet}} to control one or more <b>reed</b> switches. The <b>contacts</b> are of magnetic material and the electromagnet acts directly on them without requiring an armature to move them. Sealed in a long, narrow glass tube, the contacts are protected from corrosion, and are usually plated with silver, which has very low resistivity but is prone to corrosion when exposed, rather than corrosion-resistant but more resistive gold as used in the exposed contacts of high quality relays. The glass envelope may contain multiple reed switches or multiple reed switches can be inserted into a single bobbin and actuate simultaneously. Reed switches have been manufactured since the 1930s.|$|R

5000|$|This {{version of}} Reed Richards {{deliberately}} infects his team and {{himself with the}} zombie virus after suffering a mental breakdown due {{to the murder of}} his children {{at the hands of a}} zombified She-Hulk. Regarding the zombies as a superior form of life, Reed sets out [...] "to spread the Gospel", a twisted plan to start turning the survivors of the Marvel Universe into zombies. Reed later assists his fellow zombies in tracking down several Latverian human survivors; they escape to alternate dimensions but Doctor Doom does not. Using a dimensional crossing device created by Tony before his infection, <b>Reed</b> makes <b>contact</b> with his Ultimate counterpart. The Zombie FF attempts to escape into the Ultimate Marvel universe, but the zombie Reed is neutralized when the Ultimate Invisible Girl destroys a chunk of his brain, allowing the Ultimate team to contain their counterparts. When the Zombie FF try to escape after a brief period of imprisonment, Ultimate Reed Richards (in Doctor Doom's body) destroys them by covering him with maggots, and their corpses returned to their universe. It is suggested in Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution that Richards was inadvertently responsible for allowing the zombie virus to infect this reality through the construction of a device allowing access to alternate dimensions, namely he was responsible for bringing in the zombie Sentry, the only zombie left.|$|R
5000|$|During Civil War, <b>Reed</b> is <b>contacted</b> by Amadeus Cho, who informs {{him that}} Hulk did not {{land on the}} {{intended}} planet. When the Hulk ultimately returns to Earth, he seeks revenge on the Illuminati as Namor had warned. He became King of the planet he landed on, before the ship self-destructs and destroyed millions of the inhabitants, along with the Hulk's wife and unborn child. His first act is to attack and defeat Black Bolt at the Inhuman settlement on the moon. After providing New York with a twenty-four-hour time limit to hand the other three Illuminati over to him, the Hulk approaches Xavier at his mansion to determine whether he would have supported the Illuminati plan had he been present; Xavier confirms {{that he would have}} agreed with the plan, but only until a method could be found to prevent the Hulk endangering others. He battles the X-Men, but after learning of the mutant population's recent severe losses as a result of [...] "M-Day", the Hulk decides that the X-Men have suffered enough and departs. Having then taken over Manhattan Island, the Hulk is attacked by Iron Man in a new 'Hulkbuster' armor, only for him to be defeated and Stark Tower to be destroyed. Despite the aid of {{the other members of the}} Fantastic Four, including temporary members the Black Panther and Storm, the same fate befalls Mr. Fantastic. Dr. Strange tries to enter the Hulk’s mind, but Hulk tricks Strange into presenting himself in a physical form that he attacks upon appearance. Strange later invokes and is possessed by the demon spirit of Zom, hoping that he could stop the Hulk before it was too late. However, he loses control of his newfound power, and he almost caused some civilians to die during his battle with the Hulk. Although the Hulk saves them, this action makes Strange lose his confidence in his powers and makes him vulnerable for the Hulk to defeat him.|$|R
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 <b>reed</b> relay <b>contact</b> closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|R
