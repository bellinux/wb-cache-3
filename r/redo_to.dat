500|$|Arkham Asylum and Arkham City {{composer}} Nick Arundel {{returned to}} score Arkham Knight, while his partner on those games, Ron Fish, {{was replaced by}} composer David Buckley. On his continued involvement in the series, Arundel said [...] "One {{of the good things}} about doing a sequel, is you get the opportunity to <b>redo</b> , <b>to</b> revisit things... We have a set of material that we want to keep consistent, like the Batman theme ... We wanted to keep [...] theme and tailor it more to the story for this game. How can we get the Scarecrow element out of that one theme." [...] Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created, as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it. Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel. Singer and record producer Trent Reznor served as a music consultant on Arkham Knights [...] "Be the Batman" [...] trailer.|$|E
40|$|Each year {{corporations}} {{are faced with}} the challenge of trying to meet increasingly stringent service level agreements with their internal and external customers. Availability, performance and capacity planning are the cornerstones upon which successful companies position their IT infrastructure to remain competitive. The Oracle redo construct plays a pivotal role in achieving these goals for those companies running mission-critical Oracle databases. Oracle redo minimization and proper redo archival management are paramount given the emergence of warm disaster recovery sites using Oracle Data Guard technology and the continuously increasing transaction volumes databases are required to support. In this era of corporate merging and application consolidation companies using Oracle databases consider it imperative to properly manage the increased redo generation rates. Today Oracle databases can generate redo volumes, in short periods, with magnitudes that exceed the size of the database from which it was generated. Consequently, Oracle scientists and their IT colleagues are tasked with minimizing unnecessary <b>redo</b> <b>to</b> meet the goals of the organization. In Oracle parlance redo data is the mechanism by which changes can be reconstructed to satisfy recovery. The generation of <b>redo</b> <b>to</b> satisfy many recovery scenarios does not come without a cost or without potentially far reaching implications to the success of an organization. Very high redo generation rates can contribute to difficulties in meeting the recovery point objective (RPO), recovery time objective (RTO) and service level agreement (SLA) ...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate {{the design of}} history mechanisms for information visualization. We present a design space analysis of both architectural and interface issues, identifying design decisions and associated trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we contribute a design study of graphical history tools for Tableau, a database visualization system. These tools record and visualize interaction histories, support data analysis and communication of findings, and contribute novel mechanisms for presenting, managing, and exporting histories. Furthermore, we have analyzed aggregated collections of history sessions to evaluate Tableau usage. We describe additional tools for analyzing users ’ history logs and how they have been applied to study usage patterns in Tableau.

The objectivesof this study, carried out within the EU MOLAR project, were tomeasure atmospheric fluxes of fallout 210 Pb, 137 Cs and 7 Be at <b>Redó,</b> <b>to</b> establish mass balances for theseradionuclides, and test and validate models of pollutant transport through the lake and its catchment. This was achieved by comparing measured fluxes and concentrations in the water column with theoretical estimates using simple compartment models. Several interesting points emerged. Differences betweensoil core and rainwater measurements suggest that Saharan dust may be an important source of fallout 210 Pb. Fluxes throughthe water column had a clear seasonal trend reflecting winter icecover. Significant concentrations of 137 Cs are still presentin the water column, due to continued inputs from the catchment and/or remobilisation from the bottom sediments. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{analytics}} tools provide powerful visual representations {{in order}} to support the sense-making process. In this process, analysts typically iterate through sequences of steps many times, varying parameters each time. Few visual analytics tools support this process well, nor do they provide support for visualizing and understanding the analysis process itself. To help analysts understand, explore, reference, and reuse their analysis process, we present a visual analytics system named CzSaw (See-Saw) that provides an editable and re-playable history navigation channel in addition to multiple visual representations of document collections and the entities within them (in a manner inspired by Jigsaw [24]). Conventional history navigation tools range from basic undo and <b>redo</b> <b>to</b> branching timelines of user actions. In CzSaw’s approach to this, first, user interactions are translated into a script language that drives the underlying scripting-driven propagation system. The latter allows analysts to edit analysis steps, and ultimately to program them. Second, on this base, we build both a history view showing progress and alternative paths, and a dependency graph showing the underlying logic of the analysis and dependency relations among the results of each step. These tools result in a visual model of the sense-making process, providing a way for analysts to visualize their analysis process, to reinterpret the problem, explore alternative paths, extract analysis patterns from existing history, and reuse them with other related analyses...|$|E

Ecotoxicological evaluations of four delta-endotoxins cry 1 Aa, cry 1 Ab, cry 1 Ac, and cry 2 A from B. thuringiensis were carried out on zebrafish Danio <b>redo</b> <b>to</b> explore the adverse effects on their genome and embryos. Cry 1 Aa increased the micronucleus (MN) frequency in peripheral erythrocytes of adult D. rerio, while cry I Ab, cry 1 Ac and cry 2 A did not show genotoxicity, after 96 -h of exposure at concentration of 100 mg/L Exposures to binary mixtures (cry 1 Aa + cry 1 Ac, 50 : 50 mg/L) and (cry 1 Aa + cry 2 A, 50 : 50 mg/L) for 96 -h showed also significant increased MN frequency. Other evaluated binary mixtures did not show genotoxicity. Activity of glutathione S-transferase measured in the gills {{did not seem to}} be altered after exposure to all tested toxins as well as to the six combinations of binary Mixtures. In the embryo-larval study, all tested 8 -endotoxins showed embryo toxicity and developmental delay after exposure to the concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/L for 96 -h. However, each toxin presented a different pattern of toxic response suggesting that a specific approach should be taken into account to its toxicological evaluations. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on August 23, 2016 Dissertation advisor: Vijay KumarVitaIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 122) Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 On conventional database systems, the recovery manager applies transaction Undo or Redo operation {{or a combination}} of them to recover the last consistent state of the database from a system failure. Transaction redo, compared to undo, helps to shorten the system downtime so the execution of transactions is managed {{in such a way that}} majority of transactions require <b>redo</b> <b>to</b> recover the database. To further reduce the recovery time, the recovery module uses “Checkpoint” operation. Even though it is possible to eliminate transaction redo altogether, the conventional system architecture, however, is not capable to deploy innovative approaches. The availability of “Virtual” machines on cloud has given us an architecture that makes it possible to completely do away with transaction redo which allows us to eliminate the effect of system or transaction failure by taking the database to the next consistent state. In this dissertation, we present a novel scheme of eliminating the effect of such failures by applying transaction “roll-forward. ” Our approach intelligently applies roll-forward from the point of failure which removes the effect of system failure on the database. We refer to our system as AAP (Always Ahead Processing). In AAP a transaction always executes to completion. We have made forward execution of transactions persistent by combining together transaction execution, transaction failure and its subsequent recovery as one seamless operation. Unlike legacy recovery scheme, in our approach transactions roll forward from the point of failure while concurrently executing other transactions. As a result, system downtime during recovery is eliminated. The end result is a database system with high availability and fault-tolerance. Our work enables cloud providers to offer transactional HA-DBMS (Highly Available – DataBase Management System) as an option that too with multiple data sources not necessarily only relational. AAP is independent of the underlying cloud architecture and therefore can be used in different type of cloud settings like public, private, hybrid or federated. In a federated cloud, the location of the physical host machine(s) is very important for fast and responsive HA (High Availability) service. We designed and developed a tool that will aid AAP to find the nearest physical host. We call this tool IGOD (Identification of Geolocation of clOud Datacenter). Apart from aiding AAP in a federated cloud, IGOD is an independent tool and can also be used for enforcing privacy and security in cloud datacenters; in particular for HIPAA compliant data storage. Our prototype demonstrates AAP’s HA, fault tolerance and the elimination of system downtime during recovery from a failure.
