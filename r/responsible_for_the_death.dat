5|$|Little {{is known}} about Macbeth's early life, {{although}} {{he was the son}} of Findláech of Moray and may have been a grandson of Malcolm II. He became Mormaer of Moray – a semi-autonomous lordship – in 1032, and was probably <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of the previous mormaer, Gille Coemgáin. He subsequently married Gille Coemgáin's widow, Gruoch, although they had no children together.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, his strongest supporter, and the {{adulthood}} of King Rajendra, weakened {{his hold on}} power. The conspiracies and infighting with rival courtiers (especially the Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment and death by suicide in 1839. However, the court infighting did not subside with his death, and the political instability eventually paved way {{for the establishment of}} the Rana dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{began to}} {{circulate}} among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife {{had spent the}} night prior to the body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's murder of the boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor, Jr. (1834–1900), arrived in Eastbourne from Send, Surrey, on 25April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock, an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Edward I's death, Arundel {{became part}} of the {{opposition}} to the new king Edward II, and his favourite Piers Gaveston. In 1311 {{he was one of the}} so-called Lords Ordainers who assumed control of government from the king. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, he was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Gaveston in 1312. From this point on, however, his relationship to the king became more friendly. This was to a large extent due to his association with the king's new favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, whose daughter was married to Arundel's son. Arundel supported the king in suppressing rebellions by Roger Mortimer and other Marcher Lords, and eventually also Thomas of Lancaster. For this he was awarded with land and offices.|$|E
5|$|Debby also dropped up to 12inches (30.5mm) of {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico {{in less than}} 48hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3inches (7.62mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63inches (32mm) in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16inches (31mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17inches (43mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5inches (127mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor car accidents. There were 406homes affected from the flooding, 5of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a satellite dish {{from the roof of}} his home.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear that she believed that he was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one else but them were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death,</b> the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents do not trust the police, who they feel are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E

5|$|The {{person is}} Captain John Hart (James Marsters), a fellow Time Agent and former lover of Jack. He is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death,</b> {{and a public}} {{disturbance}} at a nightclub. After a passionate kiss and brief fight at the nightclub, John tells Jack that the Time Agency was disbanded and he has since undergone several rehabilitation programmes, before the team catch up with Jack and are introduced to John. John accompanies the team back to the Hub, where he tells the team of three cylindrical devices scattered throughout Cardiff, which he explains are radioactive cluster bombs, and he requires help to defuse them. Thus, they split into three pairs: Jack and administrator Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) search an office block (during which Jack successfully asks Ianto out on a date), doctor Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) and technical expert Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) search a warehouse, and police liaison Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and John search the nearby docks.|$|E
5|$|Fatalities {{associated}} with Myrmecia stings are well known, {{and have been}} attested to by multiple sources. In 1931 two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from M. pilosula or M. pyriformis. Another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania. Between 1980 and 2000, there were six recorded deaths, five in Tasmania and one in New South Wales. Four of these deaths were due to M. pilosula, while the remaining two died from a M. pyriformis sting. Half of the victims had known ant-sting allergies, but {{only one of the}} victims was carrying adrenaline before being stung. Most victims died within 20 minutes of being stung, but one of the victims died in just five minutes from a M. pyriformis sting. No death has been officially recorded since 2003, but M. pilosula may have been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of a man from Bunbury in 2011. Prior to the establishment of a desensitisation program, Myrmecia stings caused one fatality every four years.|$|E
5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{broke down}} {{once more in}} 1067 with the {{ascension}} of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and in the 1070s the Song had considerable success in capturing Tangut territory. A mood of frontier adventurism permeated Shenzong's court, {{as well as a}} desire to reclaim territories he felt belonged to him as the rightful ruler of China; when a Song general led an unprovoked attack on a Western Xia border town, Shenzong appeared at the border to commend the general himself. To punish the Western Xia and damage their economy, Emperor Shenzong also shut down all commercial border markets along the Song-Western Xia border. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was sent to Yanzhou (now Yan'an, Shaanxi province) in 1080 to stave off Tangut military invasion. He successfully defended his fortified position, yet the new Grand Councillor Cai Que held him <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of a rival Song military officer and the decimation of that officer's forces; as a result, Shen Kuo was ousted from office and the state abandoned the projected land that Shen was able to defend.|$|E
5|$|The Outlaw Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, {{the leader of the}} ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E
