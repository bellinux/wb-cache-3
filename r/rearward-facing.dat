25|$|Director of {{photography}} was Ulf Brantås, who {{started his career}} as a cinematographer for Roy Andersson and had filmed both of Moodysson's previous feature films. Lilya 4-ever was shot with an Aaton XTR Prod on 16mm film which was later transferred to 35mm. Minimum lighting was used, mainly from practicals and whenever possible only sunlight. Locations were only sparsely rigged by the crew. A custom built rickshaw, made from the wheels of a mountain bike, was used for the long <b>rearward-facing</b> tracking shots. No correction filters were used though the stock was eventually graded in post-production in order to appear slightly warmer.|$|E
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the <b>rearward-facing</b> end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E
500|$|The Victor had a five-man crew, {{comprising}} the two pilots seated side-by-side and three <b>rearward-facing</b> crew, these being the navigator/plotter, the navigator/radar operator, {{and the air}} electronics officer (AEO). Unlike the Vulcan and Valiant, the Victor's pilots sat {{at the same level}} {{as the rest of the}} crew, thanks to a larger pressurised compartment that extended all the way to the nose. As with the other V-bombers, only the pilots were provided with ejection seats; the three systems operators relying on [...] "explosive cushions" [...] inflated by a CO2 bottle that would help them from their seats and towards a traditional bail out in the event of high g-loading, but despite this, escape for the three backseaters was extremely difficult.|$|E

2500|$|The prototype, {{known as}} the XFM-1, {{incorporated}} a tailwheel, side [...] "blister" [...] ports, and a smooth, rounded canopy. This is the best known, and most produced version. An updated version called the YFM-1A eliminated the side blisters and added externally mounted radiators and turbo-superchargers. Produced in 1940, the final version designated YFM-1B, was slightly larger, had slightly less powerful Allison engines and incorporated a tricycle landing gear. The canopy was redesigned, with a flat forward windshield. A <b>rearward-facing</b> belly gunner's position was also added. The resulting aircraft was {{roughly the size of}} a Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber. Three YFM-1Bs were produced in 1939 before production was finally terminated.|$|E
2500|$|The second batch were {{registered}} {{and used by}} the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the [...] "AXI cars". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. These three cars all had roof mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No catalytic converters or Lambda equipment were fitted as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example {{which would have been}} shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique <b>rearward-facing</b> twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.|$|E
2500|$|Very {{early in}} the Pacific War, a scheme was {{proposed}} to fit Lightnings with floats {{to allow them to}} make long-range ferry flights. The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E 41-1986 was modified with a tailplane raised some , booms lengthened by two feet and a <b>rearward-facing</b> second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length but the tail raised [...] All three tail modifications were designed by George H. [...] "Bert" [...] Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough sealift capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} some exceptions, most {{commercial}} aircraft seats are forward-facing and on military aircraft seats are frequently <b>rearward-facing.</b> Southwest Airlines previously offered a few rearward-facings seats on some aircraft but that scheme has now ended. <b>Rearward-facing</b> seats are also common on business jets, to provide a conference-type layout. British Airways, United Airlines and American Airlines also have <b>rearward-facing</b> seats in their Club World, (select) United BusinessFirst (Intercontinental Business Class) and (select) Business Class Cabins, respectively. It {{has been argued that}} <b>rearward-facing</b> seats are safer because {{in the event of a}} crash, the sudden deceleration will propel the passenger into a <b>rearward-facing</b> seat instead of out of it, meaning the force is distributed over the entire seat back, instead of the straps of the seat belt. The argument against such seats has been based on passenger comfort, safety and cost. It could be argued that passengers who desire the natural layout of forward-facing seats may be uncomfortable with a rearward layout. On the safety aspect, the argument has been that during a plane crash, debris, such as luggage, will fly forward in the cabin, quite possibly into the passengers in <b>rearward-facing</b> seats. On the cost aspect, <b>rearward-facing</b> seats need additional strengthening which adds extra weight and therefore higher fuel costs.|$|E

50|$|It entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force as the Percival Pembroke C.1 in 1953 {{to replace the}} Avro Anson for light {{transport}} duties. As with other RAF transports, the passenger seats are <b>rearward-facing</b> for improved safety.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Infant carrier' means a {{restraint}} system intended {{to accommodate the}} child in a <b>rearward-facing</b> semi- position. This design distributes the restraining forces over the child's head and body, excluding its limbs, {{in the event of}} the frontal collision.|$|E
50|$|These mirrors have forward- and <b>rearward-facing</b> {{sensors to}} measure the ambient light level and glare of {{approaching}} vehicles, respectively. An electrochromic gel is placed between two pieces of glass, which allows the mirror to dim {{in proportion to the}} glare level.|$|E
50|$|Becker's tally {{included}} three {{shot down by}} crewman Karl-Ludwig Johanssen with his MG-131 <b>rearward-facing</b> machine gun. This achievement earned both Becker and Johanssen a reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Martin Becker flew 110 wartime missions. As an observer he flew 27 operations and as a night fighter pilot he flew on 83 interceptions. He was officially credited with 58 aerial victories.|$|E
50|$|The gunner sits to the commander's {{left and}} has a smaller {{rectangular}} hatch with a <b>rearward-facing</b> day periscope, additionally there are three other day periscopes facing forward and left. The gunner has a BPK-1-42 binocular sight with a moon/starlight vision range of 650 metres, or 350 metres using the infra-red searchlight, and a TNPT-1 designator. An FG-126 infra-red searchlight is mounted coaxially to the 30 mm cannon.|$|E
5000|$|Formula One {{has also}} {{incorporates}} similar technology, with each car featuring a distinctive streamlined [...] "camera pod" [...] mounted above each car's airbox, giving video from a perspective {{similar to the}} driver's point of view, while also allowing a <b>rearward-facing</b> view for cars trailing behind. FIA regulations mandate that {{a total of five}} cameras (or dummy camera housings) must be mounted on the car, in a choice of several predetermined positions.|$|E
50|$|Bearing {{corrections}} {{are transmitted}} to the missile via the Agrion 15 radar and are {{picked up by the}} <b>rearward-facing</b> receiver units in two of the wing pods. The directional nature of the receivers makes jamming the command link difficult. On final approach to the target (about 1000 ft remaining to target), the missile descends to an altitude of around two meters. Its powerful warhead is able to perforate a 40 mm thick steel armoured hull.|$|E
50|$|The Y-8 {{equipped}} with four turboprop engines mounted under the leading edges of non-swept wings. The wings are attached {{high on the}} fuselage, and the tricycle landing gear is {{equipped with}} low pressure tires. The earliest versions used for the transportation of freight or troops had two side-hinged, inward-opening doors, while later variants used a <b>rearward-facing</b> ramp to facilitate loading and unloading of the payload. Some specialized versions omit the cargo ramp entirely.|$|E
5000|$|... 1975: Olympus OM-2 (Japan): first SLR with TTL, off-the-film (OTF) flash autoexposure. Had two <b>rearward-facing</b> silicon photodiodes in {{the mirror}} box to meter light {{reflecting}} off the film. Circuitry could detect when enough light was exposed and automatically quench a specially [...] "dedicated" [...] accessory Olympus Quick Auto 310 electronic flash. Manual flash exposure control for a natural look is complex and convenient TTL autoflash metering became standard in virtually all SLRs by the mid-1980s.|$|E
50|$|For 1955 and 1956, an Imperial Crown {{limousine}} {{model was}} also offered. With an extra 19.5 in and 16.5 in of wheelbase in 1955 and 1956 respectively, and seating eight (three {{in the front}} including the driver, three in the rear, and two on <b>rearward-facing</b> fold-down jump seats), these replaced the long-wheelbase offerings in all Chrysler marques. Only 172 were built for (model year) 1955 and 226 for 1956. They were the last Chrysler-branded limousines built entirely in Detroit.|$|E
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a <b>rearward-facing</b> opening that accepts removable ball mounts, hitch bike racks, cargo carriers, or other hitch mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|E
50|$|Several {{armament}} {{options were}} proposed, {{with the main}} armament clustered around the nose intake and comprising a mix of heavy 30 mm or cannon with or without rockets. An unusual feature was a further pair of 30 mm cannon set {{either side of the}} rear fuselage and pivoting more than 90° to fire either rearwards or upwards. Provision was also made behind the cockpit for a single <b>rearward-facing</b> 20 mm gun with up to 50° elevation, and for two 500 kg bombs beneath the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Directive 2003/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council has {{mandated}} {{the use of}} child-restraint {{systems in}} vehicles effective May 5, 2006. Children less than 135 cm tall in vehicles must be restrained by an approved child restraint system suitable for the child's size. In practice, child restraint systems {{must be able to}} be fitted to the front, or other rows of seats. Children may not be transported using a <b>rearward-facing</b> child restraint system in a passenger seat protected by a front air bag, unless the air bag has been deactivated.|$|E
50|$|Australosyodon was a {{medium-sized}} dinocephalian. The skull {{was high and}} narrow, with a length of 26 cm, indicating a total body length of approximately 1.8 m (6 ft). The top of the skull displayed the thickening typical of dinocephalians. Overall there are many similarities to the skull of Syodon, although some minor differences in shape and in the extent of pachyostosis are present. The fangs were laterally compressed and featured a <b>rearward-facing</b> central cutting edge. Shape, number and arrangement of teeth are among the characteristics that allow distinguishing Australosyodon from Syodon.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} other D3 sedans, the Ford Taurus is {{configured}} with four-wheel independent suspension, featuring MacPherson struts and <b>rearward-facing</b> lower L-arms with a stabilizer bar {{in the front and}} a multilink coilover shock setup with stamped steel lower control arms and cast upper control arms in the rear. As with the previous-generation Taurus (Five Hundred) and the Ford Crown Victoria, the sixth-generation Taurus features four-wheel antilock disc brakes. On all models, AdvanceTrac combines traction control and stability control. Torque Vectoring Control and Curve Control is an option for all-wheel drive models.|$|E

50|$|The {{technique}} {{described here}} {{is for the}} Monica tail warning radar:The technique developed was for the RAF nightfighters to fly slowly off the bomber stream, mimicking {{the characteristics of a}} heavy bomber, until the <b>rearward-facing</b> Serrate (Monica) detector picked up the emissions from a Luftwaffe night fighter approaching. The Radar Operator would then pass directions to the pilot until the fighter was 6,000 feet behind, at which point the Beaufighter would execute a swift turn onto the tail of the German night fighter, pick up the enemy aircraft on his forward radar and attempt to down it.|$|E
5000|$|The Gotha G.V pilot {{seat was}} offset to port with the fuel tanks {{immediately}} behind. This blocked the connecting walkway that previously on earlier machines allowed crew members to move {{between the three}} gun stations. All bombs were carried externally in this model. The Gotha included an important innovation {{in the form of}} a [...] "gun tunnel" [...] whereby the underside of the rear fuselage was arched, early versions allowing placement of a <b>rearward-facing</b> machine gun protecting from attack from below, removing the blind spot. Later versions expanded the tunnel to remove the lower gun, providing a slot in the upper fuselage that allowed the rear gunner to remain stationary.|$|E
5000|$|The holotype {{was found}} in the Yuanshan member of the Qiongzhusi Formation in the Eoredlichia Zone near Haikou at Ercaicun, Kunming City, Yunnan, China. The animal has a {{distinct}} head and trunk with a forward sail-like (1.5 mm) dorsal fin and a ventral finfold (probably paired) further back. The head has five or six gill pouches with hemibranchs. In the trunk there are 25 segments (myomeres) with <b>rearward-facing</b> chevrons. There is a notochord, a pharynx and a digestive tract that may run {{all the way to the}} rear tip of the animal. The mouth cannot be clearly identified. There may be a pericardial cavity. There are no fin radials.|$|E

50|$|Since its introduction, the Expedition's {{braked trailer}} towing {{capacity}} {{has grown from}} 8,100 lbs (3,674 kg or 4.05 tons) to a current rating of 9,200 lbs (4,173 kg or 4.6 tons) when properly equipped. The list of towing features is also ever growing. Towing features common to all generations of the Expedition include: smallest possible turning radius for increased trailer maneuverability, large side view mirrors to improve rearward visibility, <b>rearward-facing</b> lane departure indicators which are helpful to other motorist when the Expedition is towing a long trailer providing added visual safety, heavy-duty flashers, heavy-duty large disc brakes to withstand prolonged braking while towing, and an available heavy-duty trailer towing package which includes necessary additions for heavy-duty towing.|$|E
