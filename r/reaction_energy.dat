In this work, the difference between methanol and benzene solvents as well as the effect of alkyl (methyl) and aromatic (phenyl) thiols on the <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> and barrier heights is investigated theoretically.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> between solids using density functional theory (DFT) is of practical importance in many technological fields and paramount {{in the study}} of the phase stability of known and predicted compounds. In this work, we present a comparison between <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> provided by experiments and computed by DFT in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), using a Hubbard U parameter for some transition metal elements (GGA+U). We use a data set of 135 reactions involving the formation of ternary oxides from binary oxides in a broad range of chemistries and crystal structures. We find that the computational errors can be modeled by a normal distribution with a mean close to zero and a standard deviation of 24 meV/atom. The significantly smaller error compared to the more commonly reported errors in the formation energies from the elements is related to the larger cancellation of errors in <b>energies</b> when <b>reactions</b> involve chemically similar compounds. This result is of importance for phase diagram computations for which the relevant <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> are often not from the elements but from chemically close phases (e. g., ternary oxides versus binary oxides). In addition, we discuss the distribution of computational errors among chemistries and show that the use of a Hubbard U parameter is critical to the accuracy of <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> involving transition metals even when no major change in formal oxidation state is occurring.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using methylamines instead of ammonia as a nitrogen precursor for the CVD of nitrides is studied using quantum chemical computations of reaction energies: <b>reaction</b> electronic <b>energy</b> (Δ) <b>reaction</b> enthalpy (Δ) and <b>reaction</b> free <b>energy</b> (Δ). The <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> {{were calculated for}} three types of reactions: Uni- and bimolecular decomposition to more reactive nitrogen species, adduct forming with trimethylgallium (TMG) and trimethylaluminum (TMA) followed by a release of methane or ethane and surface adsorption to gallium nitride for both the unreacted ammonia or methylamines or the decomposition products.

40|$|We have {{assessed}} integration grid errors {{arising from}} the use of popular DFT quadrature schemes for a set of 34 organic <b>reaction</b> <b>energies.</b> The focus is primarily on M 05 - 2 X and the M 06 suite of functionals (M 06 -L, M 06, M 06 - 2 X, and M 06 -HF). M 05 - 2 X, M 06, and M 06 - 2 X outperform popular older DFT functionals for the <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> studied, and offer accuracies comparable to results from perturbative hybrid DFT functionals. However, these new functionals are more sensitive to the choice of quadrature grid than previous generations of DFT functionals. Errors in predicted <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> {{arising from the}} use of the popular SG- 1 grid, which is the default in the Q-Chem package, are significant. In particular, M 06 -HF <b>reaction</b> <b>energies</b> computed with the SG- 1 grid exhibit errors ranging from − 6. 7 to 3. 2 kcal mol− 1 relative to results computed with a very fine integration grid. This grid-sensitivity is not a problem for meta-GGA functionals in general, but is instead due to the specific functional forms used in these functionals. The large grid errors are traced to the kinetic energy density enhancement factor utilized in the exchange component of the M 05 - 2 X and M 06 functionals. This term contains empirically adjusted parameters that are of large magnitude for all of the M 06 functionals and for M 06 -HF in particular. The product of these large constants with modest integration errors for the kinetic energy density results in very large errors in individual contributions to the exchange energy. This gives rise to the troubling large errors exhibited by these functionals for certain integration grids. I...|$|R

Current systems operate at 60% efficiency. The system is especially advantageous for seasonal thermal energy storage, because the dried salt can be stored {{at room temperature for}} prolonged times, without energy loss.
