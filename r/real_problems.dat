25|$|Biafra (1970–1978) was a {{group of}} Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and {{cultural}} conventions of the day, and engaged with <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> through their art. Individual members ranged in style from pop-art and minimalism to new figuration. The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as polyester, plastic, jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. The content of their art was expressionist, clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors Branko Bunić, Stjepan Gračan, Ratko Petrić and Miro Vuco. Membership expanded over the years to include Ivan Lesiak, Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač, Rudolf Labaš, Vlado Jakelić, Stanko Jančić, Ratko Janjić-Jobo, Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin, Emil Robert Tanay.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a shared}} {{belief in the}} {{potential}} of IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users. “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have, we should fix <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> people struggle with every day.” Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters, yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives. “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set, {{we need to stop}} making toys no one cares about and instead work on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real people.” A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them”. A company must identify where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise non-action is the consequence. This indicates that a major roadblock to IoT adoption is not technical but analytical in nature.|$|E

Critics often call the ventures exploitative and [...] "superficial portrayals" [...] of aboriginal culture, which distract attention from the <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> of substandard education. Proponents of ethno-tourism suggest that such projects can positively impact the public image and economic prospects of the indigenous community.|$|E

The Germans {{outlined}} a plan to relocate the Duala people inland from the Wouri River to allow European-only settlement of the area. The expropriations affected all of the Duala lineages except Bonaberi, so Duala public opinion was strongly against it, {{and for the first}} time in their history, the Duala clans presented a united front. Manga Bell's position as leader of the dominant Bell clan, coupled with his character, education, and finances, made him a natural leader for this opposition. Manga Bell and other Duala rulers sent a letter to the Reichstag in November 1911 to protest the land seizures. The Germans were surprised at Manga Bell's involvement, but they ignored the complaint. The chiefs sent another letter in March 1912. Still, the Germans moved forward with their plan on 15 January 1913.

500|$|The first <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> with University Mall started {{appearing}} in the 1980s when tenants voiced concerns about remodeling and marketing efforts. Osco Drug began closing its stores everywhere, three in Little Rock alone in 1997. In 2001, Montgomery Ward went bankrupt and closed all of its stores leaving a two-story [...] vacant building on the University Mall site. Shopping traffic dropped dramatically afterward and {{a steady stream of}} tenants began leaving the property. In the beginning of 2001 Simon Property said the occupancy of University Mall was at 95 percent. In April 2001, after the departure of Montgomery Ward, a report by the Urban Land Institute of Washington, D.C., said 40 percent of the mall was vacant. In 2004 the William L. Patton [...] Jr. Family Limited Partnership of Arkansas and southern Real Estate and Financial Co. sued Simon Property Group Inc seeking an injunction forcing Simon to [...] "undertake any and all actions necessary" [...] to restore the mall to good conditions. The land owners said the entire mall {{was in a state of}} disrepair and neglect. They claimed that Simon's neglect to maintain the building had been driving away tenants for decades. A team of inspectors hired by the landowners to document the condition of the mall testified in 2005 that the vacant Montgomery Ward space was full of puddles, moldy ceiling tiles, and dead pigeons.|$|E
