40|$|If {{the ethnic}} {{makeup of the}} {{astronomy}} profession is to achieve parity with the general population within one generation (~ 30 years), the number of underrepresented minorities earning graduate degrees in astronomy and astrophysics must increase in the coming decade {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. To accomplish this, the profession must develop and invest in mechanisms to more effectively move individuals across critical educational junctures to the PhD and beyond. Early and continuous research engagement starting in the undergraduate years is critical to this vision, in which the federally funded <b>research</b> <b>internship</b> <b>programs</b> (e. g. NSF REU, NASA GSRP) and national centers/observatories play a vital role. Regionally based partnerships with minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are crucial for tapping extant pools of minority talent, as are post-baccalaurate and/or masters degree "bridging" programs that provide critical stepping stones to the PhD. Because of the strong undergraduate physics, engineering, and computer science backgrounds of many students from MSIs, we suggest that instrument development and large scale computing/data-mining are particularly promising avenues for engagement in the coming decade.

40|$|Objective: The study {{examined}} the clinical performance differences of novices before and after a critical care internship and compare their performance attributes to a reference group comprised of experienced critical care nurses. The extant <b>research</b> regarding clinical <b>internship</b> <b>programs</b> has focused on retention in practice, workforce issues and competence. While studies have shown a pattern of improved retention in practice settings, they have failed to objectively measure actual clinical performance. Methods: The study design was based on pre-post comparisons of novice nurses and a reference group comprised of experienced nurses {{who served as a}} benchmark. The novice group was required to respond to patient needs in high-fidelity clinical scenarios before and after an internship. The experienced nurses attended a single testing session. Results: Findings revealed statistically significant improvement in the performance of the novice group; however, they failed to perform {{at the level of the}} experienced nurses. Conclusions: The study is the first to detail the degree to which a structured internship can facilitate changes in selected aspects of clinical performance. The study establishes the effect associated with engagement in a structured internship. While novices improve significantly, they fail to achieve the level of clinical performance seen in experienced nurses.
