The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA {{will be used for}} the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v.

However, the ruling does not prohibit {{all forms of}} gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted <b>to</b> regain their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming.

5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms. The concept {{of such a}} right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

So they selected every third person by lot to leave, with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> take away with them everything they owned except for their land.

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction.

The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment {{to keep and bear}} arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E

25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control. On {{the subject of}} the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban on guns and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as gun control created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens so they might develop a better relationship with firearms. Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms, he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E
500|$|In District of Columbia v.

5000|$|In 2002, {{the state}} of New Jersey passed a Childproof Handgun Law {{intended}} to eventually mandate that all guns sold in the state be smart guns. The law will take effect [...] "three years after it is determined that personalized handguns are available for retail purposes"; as such, gun rights lobbyists have contended that attempts to market a smart gun in the country would trigger the law. In March 2014, the California-based Oak Tree Gun Club was criticized for making the iP1 available at its shop, with lobbyists citing the New Jersey law, and arguing that its owners were acting against U.S. citizens' Second Amendment <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms. Despite evidence to the contrary, the club denied that it had even offered the gun. Similar threats, including death threats, were received in May 2014 by an owner of Engage Armaments in Maryland. He too also backed down on selling the gun, arguing that the pro-gun lobby groups' actions were hypocritical, as they [...] "are not supposed to say a gun should be prohibited. Then you are being no different than the anti-gun people who say an AR-15 should be prohibited." ...|$|R
500|$|People v. Aguilar, 2 N.E.3d 321 (Ill. 2013), was an Illinois Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the Aggravated Unlawful Use of a Weapon (AUUF) statute {{violated}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment. The Court stated that this was because the statute amounted to a wholesale statutory ban on the exercise of a personal right that was specifically named in and guaranteed by the United States Constitution, as construed by the United States Supreme Court. [...] A conviction for Unlawful Possession of a Firearm (UPF) was proper because the possession of handguns by minors was conduct that fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment's protection.|$|E

The Supreme Court dismissed the case on technical grounds, holding that the case was not ripe for adjudication. Justice Harlan dissented from the dismissal, suggesting that the Court should have considered {{the merits of the}} case. Thereafter, he indicated his support for a broad view of the due process clause's reference to [...] "liberty". He wrote, [...] "This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints." [...] He suggested that the due process clause encompassed a right to privacy, and concluded that a prohibition on contraception violated this right.|$|E
