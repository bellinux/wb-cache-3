40|$|To {{build the}} sensor {{intensive}} system-on-a-chip {{for the next}} generation spacecrafts for deep space, Center for Integration of Space Microsystems at JPL (CISM) takes advantage of the lower power rating and inherent radiation resistance of Silicon on Insulator technology (SOI). We are developing a suite of mixed-voltage and mixed-signal building blocks in Honeywell's SOI process that can enable the rapid integration of the next generation avionics systems with lower power rating, higher reliability, longer life, and enhanced radiation tolerance for spacecrafts such as the Europa Orbiter and Europa Lander. The mixed-voltage building blocks are predominantly for design of adaptive power management systems. Their design centers around an LDMOS structure that is being developed by Honeywell, Boeing Corp, and the University of Idaho. The mixed-signal building blocks are designed to meet the low power, extreme <b>radiation</b> <b>requirement</b> of deep space applications. These building blocks are predominantly used to interface analog sensors to the digital CPU of the next generation avionics system on a chip.

40|$|Memory storage {{requirements}} in space systems have steadily increased, much like {{storage requirements}} in terrestrial systems. Large arrays of dynamic memories (DRAMs) {{have been used}} in solid-state recorders, relying on a combination of shielding and error-detection-and correction (EDAC) to overcome the extreme sensitivity of DRAMs to space radiation. For example, a 2 -Gbit memory (with 4 -Mb DRAMs) used on the Clementine mission functioned perfectly during its moon mapping mission, in spite of an average of 71 memory bit flips per day from heavy ions. Although EDAC worked well with older types of memory circuits, newer DRAMs use extremely complex internal architectures which has made it increasingly difficult to implement EDAC. Some newer DRAMs have also exhibited catastrophic latchup. Flash memories are an intriguing alternative to DRAMs because of their nonvolatile storage and extremely high storage density, particularly for applications where writing is done relatively infrequently. This paper discusses radiation effects in advanced flash memories, including general observations on scaling and architecture as well as the specific experience obtained at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in evaluating high-density flash memories for use on the NASA mission to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. This particular mission must pass through the Jovian radiation belts, which imposes a very demanding <b>radiation</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. Globally, {{the aim of}} {{requirements}} {{regarding the}} use and ownership of diagnostic medical X-ray equipment is to limit radiation by abiding by the ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ (ALARA) principle. The ignorance of radiographers with regard to <b>radiation</b> safety <b>requirements,</b> however, is currently a cause of concern. The enhancement of the 4 -year radiography curriculum leading to a Bachelor’s qualification provides an opportunity to explore the training and assessment to meet, among others, the ALARA principle, which addresses national and international concerns and criteria. Healthcare workers {{outside the scope of}} radiography, who are also considered radiation workers, may be even more ignorant and are therefore also implicated. The process of investigation included a contextualisation of the available regulation documents, the Delphi technique to determine the content of the training, and a questionnaire to test students’ knowledge before and after training. Objectives. To determine the content of the <b>radiation</b> safety <b>requirements</b> training and assessment to implement standardised teaching, learning activities and assessment to prepare radiographers as radiation workers well trained for practice.

Such capability also makes an FPGA a suitable platform for the digital implementation of closed loop controllers. Other researchers have implemented a variety of closed-loop digital controllers on FPGA’s. Some of these controllers include the widely used Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, state space controllers, neural network and fuzzy logic based controllers. There are myriad advantages to utilizing an FPGA for discrete-time control functions which include the capability for reconfiguration when SRAM-based FPGA's are employed, fast parallel implementation of multiple control loops and implementations that can meet space level <b>radiation</b> tolerance <b>requirements</b> in a compact form-factor. Generally, a software implementation on a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) device or microcontroller is used to implement digital controllers. At Marshall Space Flight Center, the Control Electronics Group has been studying adaptive discrete-time control of motor driven actuator systems using DSP devices. While small form factor, commercial DSP devices are now available with event capture, data conversion, Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) outputs and communication peripherals, these devices are not currently available in designs and packages which meet space level <b>radiation</b> <b>requirements.</b> In general, very few DSP devices are produced that are designed to meet any level of radiation tolerance or hardness.
