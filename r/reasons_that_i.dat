25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

2500|$|Huckabee said on May 16 that, if his {{campaign}} falters, {{he would have}} to think long and hard before agreeing to become a vice-presidential candidate on a ticket whose presidential candidate believes that abortion should remain legal. [...] "This is an issue to me that is very critical.

[...] On election night Manley appeared on CBC television's coverage of the election, and immediately after Prime Minister Paul Martin's announcement was asked whether he might seek the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. [...] Manley's response at that time was to poke fun at himself saying: [...] "Some may want a dynamic, charismatic leader. Some others may support me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2002, the band's first North American tour since 1993 was {{organized}} to support Chinese Democracy, with CKY and Mix Master Mike joining. However, the opening show in Vancouver was canceled by the venue when Rose failed to turn up. According to Guns' management, [...] "Axl's flight from L.A. had been delayed by mechanical troubles". A riot ensued. This tour {{was met with}} mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York City sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia when the band {{failed to show up}} again, tour promoter Clear Channel canceled the remainder of the tour. Rose later mentioned in 2006, [...] "There are <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not spoken more about [...] that have been extremely complicated and are not legally resolved behind the scenes to this day and could have possibly jeopardized the future of Guns N' Roses." [...] Rose then apologized to the city of Philadelphia when playing there in 2012, adding [...] "I'm not saying I'm innocent".|$|E
