5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid <b>registration</b> <b>certificate.</b> Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E

He was bought by George Ely, who already owned an 1882 colt out of Maggie Marshall, Elyria, whose record for trotting the mile was 2:25. Ely hoped Black Allan would compare to the older colt, but sold him in 1891 when he discovered that Black Allan was a 'pacer'. It is now known that Black Allan also performed the lateral ambling gait known as the running walk. He was lightly raced, but was unable to produce a burst of speed {{toward the end of his}} races and generally finished last. [...] Nonetheless, due to his looks, early speed and long stride, he was put to stud. [...] Allan was bought by John P. Mankin of Murfreesboro, Tennessee for , only to be sold again a few years later. [...] One owner, J.A. McCulloch, used Black Allan as a [...] "teaser" [...] to see if mares were in estrus before they were bred to jack donkeys to produce mules. Another owner traded him for a black filly, a milk cow and $20. When Black Allan was sold to his most famous owner, James Brantley, in 1903, his purchase price was $110. He was sold without papers, but Brantley eventually recovered his <b>registration</b> <b>certificate.</b> Brantley rode Black Allan himself, and his son French Brantley sometimes rode the horse to school. At the very end of Black Allan's life, [...] he was sold by James Brantley to Albert Dement of Wartrace, Tennessee, one of the earliest Tennessee Walking Horse breeders. The horse's price was $140, and he was sold with the guarantee that he would live through the breeding season. Dement stood Allan at stud for only a few months before Allan's death, during which the stallion was bred to 111 mares. He died at Dement's farm on September 16, 1910, due to having been fed green sorghum. Black Allan was 24 years old.|$|E
