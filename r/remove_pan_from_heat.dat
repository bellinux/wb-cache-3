5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is to bring {{water to a boil}} and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is to bring the water to a boil, but then <b>remove</b> the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heat</b> and allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|R

5000|$|Jared Diamond in The Third Chimpanzee (1991), and Morris Goodman (2003) [...] {{argued that}} Homo is not {{sufficiently}} <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> to warrant {{the definition of}} a separate genus.Based on the Principle of Priority, this would result in chimpanzees being reclassified as members of the Homo genus, e.g. Homo paniscus, Homo sylvestris, or Homo arboreus. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term Homo sapiens is the misnomer and that humans should be reclassified as Pan sapiens. In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the taxonomy of extinct species closely related to humans, including Australopithecus. A taxonomic name given to the species of the last common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees is Pan prior.|$|R
30|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) {{was performed}} on a PerkinElmer differential scanning calorimeter DSC 7 (Norwalk, CT, USA). Samples of 10 to 20 [*]mg at {{the middle of the}} second segment of the abdomen were sealed into an aluminum pan hermetically. The sample pan and reference pan (empty <b>pan)</b> were <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> 10 °C to 95 °C at 10 °C[*]min− 1. The temperature at each endothermic peak was recorded. Denaturation enthalpies were estimated by measuring the corresponding areas under the DSC transition curve. Triplicate samples were analyzed.|$|R

Thermal data were collected under a nitrogen flow of 10  mL min- 1. About 5  mg of melt-quenched PHA samples encapsulated in aluminum <b>pans</b> were <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> − 40 to 200  °C {{at a rate of}} 10  °C min− 1. The melting temperatures were determined from the position of the endothermic peaks. The apparent heat of fusion (ΔHm) was determined from the DSC endothermal peaks in the second scan. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was taken as the inflection point of the specific heat increment at the glass–rubber transition.|$|R

The chemical structure of nanofibers was conducted with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) reflection spectroscopy (NICOLET, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), and a X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) (D 8 Advance, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) operated in the reflection mode with Cu-Kα radiation in the 2 θ range of 10 ° to 80 ° with a rate of 4 °/min.
