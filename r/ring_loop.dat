The middle ring is passed through the large ring and looped upwards; the small ring is then passed through the middle ring and looped upwards. Continuing in the same manner, a cord loop is passed through the small <b>ring,</b> <b>loop</b> upwards, and finally passes through a grommet to the opposing side of the parachute riser. A semi-rigid cable attached to a release handle then passes through this loop, securing the loop. Releasing the cord loop by removing the cable with a tug causes the three-ring system to cascade free and quickly disconnect the riser from the harness.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{configuration}} for a dual-wavelength fiber ring laser {{with improved}} lasing stability realized {{through the use}} of an injection-coupled optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed and demonstrated, and its application to transverse load sensing is studied. The OEO-coupled dual-wavelength laser has two mutually coupled loops: the fiber <b>ring</b> <b>loop</b> and the OEO loop. In the fiber <b>ring</b> <b>loop,</b> a polarization-maintaining phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating is incorporated to generate two optical wavelengths with the wavelength spacing determined by the birefringence of the polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber. In the OEO loop, a microwave signal with its frequency also determined by the birefringence of the PM fiber is generated, which is fed into the fiber <b>ring</b> <b>loop</b> to injection lock the dual wavelengths. Due to the injection locking, a very stable dual-wavelength operation is established. The use of the dual wavelengths for high-resolution and high-speed transverse load sensing is then implemented. The sensitivity of the transverse load sensor is measured as high as + 9. 7573 and - 9. 7350 GHz/(N/mm), along the fast and slow axes, respectively. The high frequency purity and stability of the generated microwave signal permits very reliable and high accuracy measurement and the microwave frequency interrogation allows the system to operate at an ultra-high speed...|$|E

40|$|Percutaneous skin access devices {{include a}} {{plurality}} of locked connecting units mounted to the exterior surface of an implantable medical object which, in position, is configured to penetrate {{the skin of a}} subject. The locked connecting units may be mounted directly onto the desired surface of the exterior of the device or may be held on a substrate sheet, which is mounted to the exterior surface of the device. In position, the locked connecting units engage with soft tissue which can include the skin to form a bio-junction layer which includes mechanical and bio-sealing connection between the device body and the soft tissue. The configuration at the bio-junction layer secures the medical object in location in the subject even for long-term indwelling applications in a manner, which inhibits soft tissue infection. The locked connecting units may be rigid or semi-rigid for longer-term indwelling applications, and semi-rigid and/or resilient for shorter term indwelling applications. The locked connecting units may take on the form of <b>rings,</b> hooks, or <b>loops</b> having aperture or gap width/length sizes of from about 0. 2 4 mm. The <b>rings,</b> <b>loops,</b> or hooks may connect with any soft tissue including skin as well subcutaneous tissue.

Additionally, loop differential K-theory is shown to be strictly coarser than the Grothendieck group of bundles with connection up to gauge equivalence. Finally, we calculate loop differential K-theory of the circle. Comment: 30 pages; new last section, appendix. To appear in Annales Mathematiques Blaise Pasca...|$|E
