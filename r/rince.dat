40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{voluntary}} {{control of}} micturition {{is believed to}} be integrated by complex interactions among the brainstem, subcortical areas and cortical areas. Several brain imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) have demonstrated that frontal brain areas, the limbic system, the pons and the premotor cortical areas were involved. However, the cortical and subcortical brain areas have not yet been precisely identified and their exact function is not yet completely understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activity during passive filling and emptying of the bladder. A cathetherism of the bladder was performed in seven healthy subjects (one man and six right-handed women). During scanning, the bladder was alternatively filled and emptied at a constant rate with bladder <b>rincing</b> solution. RESULTS: Comparison between passive filling of the bladder and emptying of the bladder showed an increased brain activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, symmetrically in the operculum and mesial frontal. Subcortical areas were not evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several cortical brain areas are involved in the regulation of micturition...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{several aspects}} of therapeutic interventions for arthritis of the knee, especially arthroscopic lavage. Arthroscopic lavage is a technique in which the inflamed knee of the patient is <b>rinced</b> with saline. After the procedure corticosteroids can be administered to suppress inflammation. Arthroscopic lavage was superior in suppressing recurrence of arthritis compared to standard joint injections with corticosteroids. The occurence of fibrosis in the inflamed joint was predictive of an inferior response. During arthroscopic lavage synovial tissue samples can be obtained. These biopsies were studied before and after treatment with anti-TNF in longstanding and early (therapy-naieve) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. The clinical and synovial effect were comparable between both groups. In the latter part differences in synovial inflamation between RA patients with and without antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) are discussed {{in relation to the}} occurence of joint damage. In anti-CCP positive patients we found more infiltrating lymphocytes leading to progression of joint damage. Also, temporal changes in synovial inflammation differed between anti-CCP positive and anti_CCP negative RA, underlining the fenotypical differences betwen both disease entities. Promotores: T. W. J.

25|$|The {{early years}} of Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne saw little success from {{competitors}} outside Ireland, {{despite the presence of}} a large contingent of North American dancers. This was due to a number of factors including the overseas competitors' style of dance, which was viewed as by the Irish as outdated, and differences in competition protocol between North America and Ireland. However, Michael Flatley, the first North American winner of the World Championships, recalled that his preparation for Oireachtas <b>Rince</b> na Cruinne focused on adopting a more rigid and conservative dance style that would be accepted by Irish adjudicators. The perceived inferiority of overseas competitors persisted into the early 21st century. In 1971, the Irish Dancing Teachers' Association of North America chartered a Boeing 747 in an attempt {{to increase the number of}} North American competitors. In 1972, two entire Boeing 707s from Aer Lingus were booked to transport the North American contingent.|$|E

40|$|Nous avons voulu améliorer les {{connaissances}} actuelles des mécanismes entraînant la non-fonction des greffons pulmonaires après conservation hypothermique et transplantation, par l’étude de {{la fonction}} respiratoire mitochondriale après ischémie froide et reperfusion. Nous avons également voulu étudier les différences de conservation après rinçage avec les deux solutions de préservation les plus employées en tranplantation pulmonaire clinique, les solutions d’Euro-Collins et “University of Wisconsin”. Nous avons enfin voulu étudier la fonction respiratoire mitochondriale après ischémie normothermique, afin d’évaluer la possibilité de prélever des greffons pulmonaires chez des donneurs d’organes à coeur non battant. 	Nous avons donc développé un modèle porcin de prélèvement, d'ischémie froide et de reperfusion pulmonaire normothermique in vitro, modèle relativement simple et reproductible, et qui permet d'objectiver le développement d'une non-fonction du greffon pulmonaire. Dans ce modèle, nous avons pu montrer qu’après 24 heures d’ischémie froide, les mitochondries montrent une altération modérée des oxydoréductases mais sans atteinte de l’efficacité de la phosphorylation oxydative, atteinte qui a pu être démontrée après 48 heures d’ischémie froide. Après reperfusion, l’atteinte mitochondriale est plus profonde, avec diminution de l’efficacité de la phosphorylation oxydative. Dans ce modèle d’ischémie froide et de reperfusion normothermique, nous n'avons pas pu observer de différence significative entre les poumons <b>rincés</b> avec la solution d’Euro-Collins ou “University of Wisconsin”, et ce tant {{au niveau de}} paramètres physiologiques pulmonaires qu’au niveau de la fonction respiratoire mitochondriale. 	Nous avons développé un modèle d’ischémie normothermique dans lequel 30 minutes d'ischémie chaude n'altèrent pas la fonction respiratoire des mitochondries pulmonaires. Par contre 45 minutes semblent provoquer des lésions mitochondriales sévères. Cette tolérance de 30 minutes d'ischémie chaude pourrait permettre l'utilisation des greffons pulmonaires prélevés chez des donneurs d’organes à coeur non battant, du point de vue bioénergétique du moins. The lungs are organs whose sensitivity to ischaemia and reperfusion is well known. In a rabbit model of lung ischaemia, we showed that the cold ischaemia longer than 6 hours {{is accompanied by a}} significant reduction in tissue contents in vitamins E and C, two important protectors against the lesions appearing at the time of ischaemia and the reperfusion (Pincemail 1999). Moreover, lungs are different from the other transplanted organs by the importance of a fragile structure, the alveole, zone of exchange between the alveolar air and the capillary blood. It was shown that among the alveolar cells, the type II pneumatocytes, secreting the surfactant, is of primary importance for the post-transplant function. It was shown that the quality of surfactant decreases after conservation and reperfusion of the lungs, and that, in vitro, the effectiveness of surfactant continuously decreases with the prolongation of the duration of ischaemia (Erasmus 1994). Moreover the administration of surfactant before the pulmonary reperfusion improves the postoperative function of the grafts in the rat (Erasmus 1996). It is known that, if all the pulmonary cells contain mitochondria, more than 50 % of the mitochondria isolated from lungs come from type II pneumatocytes (Fisher, 1976). We chose to study the mitochondrial respiratory function of these important alveolar cells for the pulmonary function after ischaemia and reperfusion. 	In this work, we developed a porcine model of ischaemia (hypo- and/or normothermic) and of normothermic reperfusion. This reperfusion was accompanied by a postoperative non-function, objectified by aerodynamic and hemodynamic parameters, as by the appearance of pulmonary oedema. This non-function was observed after 24 hours a hypothermic ischaemia, which is incompatible with a normal function of the pulmonary grafts in clinical transplantation. The reperfusion with a solution of Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate remove any immunological artefact and any influence of the circulating blood cells in the pulmonary lesions appearing {{at the time of the}} reperfusion. On the other hand, this solution is different from blood to a significant degree, by not containing protectors against the production of free radicals at reperfusion. It is thus possible that our model exacerbates this production of free radicals, more especially as the lung is a tissue particularly rich in polymorphonuclear cells. In this model, we could show that after 24 hours of cold ischaemia the mitochondria underwent a moderate deterioration of the oxidoreductases but without decrease in the effectiveness of oxidative phosphorylation, decrease that could be demonstrated after 48 hours of cold ischaemia. These lesions are comparable to the mitochondrial lesions that we had observed after cold ischaemia of rabbit kidney (Willet 1995). After reperfusion, the mitochondrial lesions are more severe, with a decrease in the effectiveness of oxidative phosphorylation. Concerning normothermic ischaemia, the first 30 minutes did not cause significant mitochondrial lesions. These results at least corroborate the literature data on the relative good pulmonary tolerance to normothermic ischaemia, explained in theory by the persistence of oxygen in the airways and thus of the persistence of aerobic metabolism in spite of the circulatory arrest. For the other organs, the circulatory arrest implies anoxia, that is not really the case of lung, as oxygen is present in airways. Pulmonary transplantation could thus profit from an increase in graft pool available by harvesting lung graft from non-heart beating donors. After 45 minutes of normothermic ischaemia, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction appears, related to a significant deterioration in the ATP synthase function. These results confirm that the cellular metabolism is then disturbed by the appearance of cellular anoxia because of the progressive consumption of oxygen present in the alveoles, or of the substrates necessary to the cellular metabolism. 	The description and the discussion of the importance of these mitochondrial alterations in the genesis of lung graft dysfunction after transplantation must be integrated with the very broad framework of the disturbances appearing at the time of tissue ischaemia and reperfusion. From our study it comes out that hypothermia at 4 °C protects effectively the pulmonary mitochondrial function since significant deteriorations do not appear before 24 hours of hypothermic ischaemia. To determine if mitochondrial deteriorations appearing after normothermic reperfusion are the cause or the consequence of the non-function of the lung appears difficult. On the other hand the lesions appearing after 45 minutes of normothermic ischaemia deserve in an unquestionable way a later study, with evaluation of the mitochondrial function after circulatory arrest in normothermy (30 and 45 minutes) and normothermic reperfusion, and with evaluation of the mitochondrial function after 30 and 45 minutes (or more) of circulatory arrest normothermic but continuation of pulmonary ventilation, or conservation of the lungs in inflation with air or pure oxygen. Our mitochondrial data should also be compared with a study of the pulmonary function by a model of transplantation with survival of the receiver pig...|$|R
40|$|Pour rechercher les virus dans les eaux usées traitées, une {{nouvelle}} méthode d'adsorption-élution sur laine de verre a été appliquée comparativement à la méthode d'adsorption-élution sur poudre de verre. Lorsque la technique de concentration sur laine de verre est utilisée, c'est dans les 25 premiers ml de l'éluat que la majorité des virus poliomyélitique est retrouvé (89 à 94 %). La comparaison des méthodes de concentration des virus indigènes à partir d'échantillons d'effluents provenant de deux stations d'épuration biologique de la Côte d'Azur (Cagnes-sur-Mer et Nice), a mis en évidence la supériorité de cette nouvelle méthode : les taux de positivité ont été respectivement de 85 % vs 38 % pour l'effluent de Cagnes-sur-Mer et 100 % vs 44 % pour l'effluent de Nice. De même, les titres en virus indigènes après concentration ont varié de 0 à 250 NPPUC/l pour la méthode sur laine de verre contre 0 à 25, 5 NPPUC/l pour la méthode sur poudre de verre. La différence constatée entre les méthodes est statistiquement significative après analyse de variance (p = 0, 0119 pour l'effluent de Cagnes-sur-mer et p < 0, 0001 pour l'effluent de Nice). De plus, la technique sur laine de verre ne nécessite ni l'abaissement du pH, ni le changement de la composition ionique de l'échantillon d'eau à analyser. Biological {{treatment of}} sewage in waste water plants does not allow elimination of {{the whole of the}} microbial load. Discharge of the treated sewage results in viral pollution of river, lakes and seas, a potential hazard for the health that has to be monitored. The amont of virus in waste water beeing low, concentration from the samples brought to the laboratory is rendered necessary. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of a new adsorption-elution method on glass wool to recover indigenous viruses from effluents of the cities of Cagnes and Nice (Alpes-Maritimes, France). In order to evaluate its efficiency we compared it to the regular adsorption-elution method on glass powder. As a preliminary we determined upon artificially contaminated 5 liter waste waters samples what detection of virus could be performed only in the first 25 ml of the 100 ml eluate, as in the glass powder concentration method. Results show chat virus titers found in that first fraction of eluate were close to those in the total sample. Thus from 3 samples containing 1. 60 108 MPNCU/ 5 l, 1. 96 107 MPNCU/ 5 l and 4. 32 104 MPNCU/ 5 l we found in that first fraction respectively 1. 50 104 MPNCU/ 5 l (94 %), 1. 80 107 MPNCU/ 5 l (92 %) and 3. 85 104 MPNCU/ 5 l (89 %); these recovery rates are not significantly different by comparison of confidence limits. The glass powder method, necessitates preliminary treatment of the sample : acidification to pH 3. 5 and adjunction of AICI 3 at a final concentration of 5. 10 - 4 M. After flowing the acidified sample through 100 g of borosilicated glass powder at a rate of 10 l/ 10 min inside a decantation ampulla. Then adsorbed virus may be eluted from the sedimentated glass powder with 100 ml of borate buffer containing 3 % beet extract, pH 9  : the first 25 ml were collected into a flask containing 2. 5 ml of a mixture of antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics. For the glass wool adsorption method, a 19 cm 3 cartridge was packed with 5 g sodocalcic glass wool at a 0. 4 g/cm 3 density and <b>rinced</b> sequentially with : 10 ml 1 N HCl, 10 ml deionised water, 10 ml 1 N NaOH and lastly 40 ml deionised water. It was balanced with 200 ml deionised water. The sample, was pumped at a flow rate ca 10 l/h. Enumeration of viruses was performed by inoculating 40 microplate wells containing KB cells, and performing 3 passages 5 days each, after which the number of wells presenting with CPE was determined. This characteristic number allowed calculation of the most probable number of cytopathic units (MPNCU) with the 95 % confidence limit. The Box and Cox analysis of transformation was applied to the data. Since the calculated value of λ approximated zero (λ = - 0. 29 for the Cagnes effluent and λ = - 0, 062 for the Nice effluent), transformation of the gross data into logarithm was justified. To allow this transformation, the zero had to be substituted for by a value equal to half the limit sensitivity of the method (I well out of 40), i. e. 0. 5. Distribution of the data being roughly log-normal, it was then possible to compare the results of the two methods by two-way analysis of variance, cross classification, without replica. The test for factor method was calculated according to the interaction since this factor is fixed. Overall it appeared that all 31 10 -liter samples analysed contained viruses when results from bath methods were combined. Still no single method allowed virus recovery in a 100 % of cases, however the glass wool adsorption method found viruses in 29 / 31 vs 13 / 31 with the glass powder method. The new method detected virus in 11 / 13 (85 %) samples from Cagnes waste waters as well as in 18 / 18 (100 %) from Nice. Quantitative analysis of the viral titers indicates that, titers were higher following the glass wool adsorption method than following the glass powder adsorption method in 11 / 13 samples from Cagnes treatment plant and in 17 / 18 from Nice. Thus virus concentrations varied between 0 and 250 MPNCU/l (MGT= 4. 6 MPNCU/l) for the Cagnes effluent and between 2 and 60 MPNCU/l (MGT= 7. 5 MPNCU/I) for the Nice effluent. For the same samples virus concentrations obtained following glass powder adsorption method varied between 0 and 8. 5 MPNCU/l (MGT 0. 9 MPNCU/l) for the Cagnes effluent and between 0 and 25. 5 MPNCU/l (MOT= 1. 3 MPNCU/l 1) for the Nice effluent. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0. 0119 for the Cagnes effluent and p < 0. 0001 for the Nice effluent). Furthermore, when taking into account the origin of the waters analysed, comparison between observed F 0. 95 (7. 94 for the Cagnes waters and 45. 78 for the Nice waters) and theoretical F 0. 95 (4. 75 for the Cagnes waters and 4. 45 for the Nice waters) leads to the rejection of the hypothesis of identity of the two methods. The discordances observed are an illustration of the fact that concluding to the absence of viruses in a given sample is a matter of method and should be interpreted with prudence. A few drawbacks inherent to the glass powder adsorption method may explain its poorer efficiency : the necessary acidification of the sample to pH 3. 5 may be fatal to a proportion of virions; also the flow rate necessary to maintain the fluid layer of glass powder in suspension during the adsorption step is 6 fold higher than that required in the glass wool method (60 l/h vs 10 l/h). Finally the nature of the adsorbing material, sodocalcic vs borosilicated, may be determinent. We can conclude from the present comparative study, to the statistically significant superiority of the glass wool method for virus concentration from treated waste waters...|$|R
