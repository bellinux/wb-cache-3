2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Le Bourget, Paris, France to Croydon, Surrey, United Kingdom. It was carrying three crew and three passengers. The aircraft {{had taken off}} from Le Bourget at 11:15 local time (10:15 GMT) and passed over Le Tréport, Seine-Maritime at 12:10. At 12:19, a <b>radio</b> <b>fix</b> obtained from Croydon established that the {{aircraft was}} [...] west by south of Boulogne, Pas-de-Calais. There were no further messages received from the aircraft. The weather at the time included low clouds.|$|E

50|$|These systems {{used some}} form of {{directional}} radio antenna to determine {{the location of a}} broadcast station on the ground. Conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a <b>radio</b> <b>fix.</b> These were introduced prior to World War I, and remain in use today.|$|E
5000|$|Aircraft {{arriving}} {{at the edge of}} the player's TRACON will call. [...] "AA34 with you at one one thousand," [...] the status line will display this in text, voice of the calling pilot will play, and the icon will persistently flash. If ignored, the aircraft will circle and hold at the <b>radio</b> <b>fix</b> identified as the beginning-point in the player's sector.|$|E
50|$|From the {{earliest}} days of radio technology, signals had been used for navigation using the radio direction finding (RDF) technique. RDF can determine the bearing to a radio transmitter, and several such measurements can be combined to produce a <b>radio</b> <b>fix,</b> allowing the receiver's position to be calculated. Given some basic changes to the broadcast signal, it was possible for the receiver to determine its location using a single station. The UK pioneered one such service {{in the form of the}} Orfordness Beacon.|$|E
50|$|With the <b>radio</b> <b>fixed,</b> the Hardys {{attempt to}} summon help, but a storm arises and the static makes it {{impossible}} to know if their messages are getting through. After repeated attempts to relay a message, the radio gives out without receiving any reply.|$|R
50|$|In October 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lord would be appointed president and CEO of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, a lobbyist group that represents cellular, messaging, mobile <b>radio,</b> <b>fixed</b> wireless and mobile satellite carriers as well as companies that develop and produce products and services for the industry.|$|R
50|$|Rooftops are leased {{for many}} {{different}} communication purposes, including {{many different types}} of antennas. Panel antennas are commonly placed on rooftops in urban and densely populated residential areas. These antennas typically range from 1-10 feet in height and have the ability to service multiple technologies, including: cellular antennas, PCS antennas, specialized mobile <b>radios,</b> <b>fixed</b> wireless services, and paging services.|$|R
50|$|Elektra was {{updated version}} of the beam-based low-frequency radio range (LFR) used in the United States during the 1930s. This was further {{modified}} to create Sonne by electronically rotating the signal to create a series of beams sweeping across the sky. Using simple timing of the signal, the navigator could determine the angle to the station. Two such measurements then provided a <b>radio</b> <b>fix.</b> Accuracy and range were excellent, with fixes around ¼ of a degree being possible at 1,000 miles range.|$|E

5000|$|Amateur <b>Radio</b> <b>Fixed</b> Repeaters - the {{pre-existing}} 'permanent' repeaters {{that cover}} much of New Zealand on both VHF (2m) and UHF (70 cm) frequencies often provide well known performance and coverage over an AREC event area. When AREC stations {{come up on}} a frequency, all other stations are required by good operating practise to give that station priority. The repeater would be left for AREC operation until the AREC event came to a close.|$|R

40|$|Video {{tracking}} is {{a powerful}} new tool for studying natural undisturbed behaviour {{in a wide range}} of birds, mammals and reptiles. Using integrated animal-borne video tags, video footage and positional data are recorded simultaneously from wild free-ranging animals. At the analysis stage, video scenes are linked to <b>radio</b> <b>fixes,</b> yielding an animal's eye view of resource use and social interactions along a known movement trajectory. Here, we provide a brief description of our basic equipment and field techniques to enable other researchers to start their own video-tracking studies...|$|R
50|$|Scanners {{developed}} from earlier tunable and fixed-frequency radios that received one frequency at a time. Non-broadcast radio systems, {{such as those}} used by public safety agencies, do not transmit continuously. With a <b>radio</b> <b>fixed</b> on a single frequency, much time could pass between transmissions, while other frequencies might be active. A scanning radio will sequentially monitor multiple programmed channels, or search between user defined frequency limits. The scanner will stop on an active frequency strong enough to break the radio's squelch setting and resume scanning other frequencies when that activity ceases.|$|R
