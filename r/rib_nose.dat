50|$|In November 1910 she {{travelled}} to Johannisthal, {{the first}} airfield {{to open in}} Berlin. Here she encountered early aviators {{from a variety of}} nations, and began to search for an instructor. In December of that year, Robert Thelens agreed to help her, but shortly thereafter he quit after Beese crashed a plane sustaining multiple injuries including broken <b>ribs,</b> <b>nose</b> and leg bones. In 1911, regulations pertaining to the flight test were made more stringent, and Beese, an inexperienced flier, found it increasingly difficult to persuade more experienced aviators to teach her.|$|R

5000|$|In September 1947 [...] "Zapora" [...] {{once again}} {{tried to escape}} to the West, but was caught in Nysa. Taken to the infamous Mokotów Prison in Warsaw, he was {{tortured}} horribly and beaten during the investigation. The sham trial of Dekutowski and his soldiers took place on November 3, 1948. To humiliate the accused, they were dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms. On November 15, the court presided over by Judge Jozef Badecki (who had previously sentenced Witold Pilecki to death) sentenced Dekutowski to seven deaths. [...] "Zapora", together with six other soldiers, was executed on March 7, 1949. According to witnesses, {{even though he was}} 30 at the moment of death, he looked like an elderly man, without teeth and nails, with grey hair, broken <b>ribs,</b> <b>nose</b> and hands. ‘We shall never surrender!’ he yelled sending his last message to his fellow prisoners.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many victims}} of the unpredictability of The Wedge, Terry Wade {{suffered}} disastrous consequences of his obsession. His health problems have ranged from a broken back, a broken <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs,</b> a torn rotator cuff, and skin cancer.|$|R
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Crack a Smile, which began in 1994, was brought {{to an abrupt halt}} in May 1994, when vocalist Bret Michaels lost control of his Ferrari. Michaels {{suffered}} a broken <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs,</b> jaw and fingers, and lost four teeth.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the C-Class was unsophisticated. The type was unstable, with poor control authority. The {{responsiveness}} in the controls was sluggish and often caused the crew to be airsick. However {{one of the main}} advances in airship technology was the very high rate of climb which the coastals managed to provide. It had a top speed of around 40 knots (75 km/h), making it vulnerable to enemy aircraft and even surface ships. Even at these modest speeds, and despite its strengthening <b>ribs,</b> the <b>nose</b> of the airship was prone to denting, further compromising handling.|$|R
50|$|On April 4, 2009, Mike Block {{was struck}} by a NYC taxi while walking at the corner of W85th St. and West End Ave, in Manhattan. Injuries {{included}} broken <b>rib,</b> jaw, cheek, <b>nose,</b> and he lost nine teeth. His reconstruction required multiple surgeries; his missing teeth were restored on February 15, 2012.|$|R
50|$|As a youth, Adkins {{was in an}} {{automobile}} accident in which his 1975 pickup truck rear ended a school bus. He broke some <b>ribs</b> and his <b>nose</b> was partially torn off. Adkins was forced to give up college football after a severe knee injury at Louisiana Tech. He has also experienced a number of serious injuries as an adult, including being shot by his second ex-wife in 1994. The bullet went through his heart and both lungs. He survived and chose not to press charges.|$|R
5000|$|The PA-24-400 Comanche 400, while {{identical}} in planform to other single-engined Comanches, is structurally strengthened, {{primarily in the}} tail. The aircraft has an extra <b>nose</b> <b>rib</b> in the stabilator and in the vertical fin. The stabilator, vertical fin, and rudder of the 400 share virtually no common parts with the 180, 250, or [...] Comanches. In addition, the 400's rudder is aerodynamically balanced {{in a manner similar}} to that of the Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche and does not have the lead external balance weights of the lower-powered single-engined Comanches.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is predominantly}} made from wood {{and covered in}} doped Ceconite. The wing leading edge is made from poplar plywood and supported by <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> made from marine-grade plywood. The wing spar cap strips and tail ribs are fashioned from spruce. The tailboom is an aluminium tube. Its wing is cantilevered and tapered from wing root to wing tip. The VJ-23 lands and takes off on foot, but the aircraft is equipped with small wheels {{to allow it to}} be pulled up a hill. The aircraft's rigid wing structure requires that it be transported in a trailer, rather than rolled up and carried on a roof rack like a hang glider.|$|R
50|$|The Banjo {{sailplane}} is {{of mixed}} construction. Its 13.3 m span wing is strut-braced with one lift strut per side {{and uses a}} plywood box spar and spruce wing ribs, with {{the leading edge of}} the wing covered in plywood and the rear portion covered in aircraft fabric covering. The <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> are expanded polystyrene while the ailerons are made of wood and covered in fabric. The wing airfoil is an SM701 at the wing root transitioning to a Wortmann FX-60-126 at the wing tip, while the tailplane uses a Wortmann FX-71-L-150/30 airfoil. The fuselage is of fibreglass monocoque construction, while its one-piece bubble canopy is made from polycarbonate. The aircraft has fixed monowheel landing gear with a wheel brake and upper wing surface air brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Late in {{the evening}} of 16 July 1992, under the {{influences}} of cider and drugs, Maria Rossi and her friend Christina Molloy, both 17, saw Phillips, who was then 70 and partially sighted, calling to Chum to come in; they forced her back into her house, where they strangled her with the dog's chain, slashed her 35 times {{in the face with}} a utility knife, scissors and a piece of broken glass, stabbed her 86 times and stamped on her chest, breaking five <b>ribs,</b> broke her <b>nose</b> and attempted to scalp her, and broke eggs over her body. They stole her vacuum cleaner and radio and her money. Next morning Maria was heard singing [...] "Ding, dong, Edna's dead" [...] or [...] "We've killed Edna".|$|R
5000|$|Poison began {{recording}} {{its sixth}} album, Crack a Smile, in early 1994. Recording {{was brought to}} an abrupt halt in May 1994, when Michaels was involved in a car accident where he lost control of his Ferrari. Michaels suffered a broken <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs,</b> jaw, and fingers and lost four teeth. After his recovery in 1995, the band continued recording the album. The album became shelved shortly after this, with no release date anywhere in sight. Instead, the label opted for a Greatest Hits compilation, which featured two new tracks with Saraceno on guitar, [...] "Sexual Thing" [...] and [...] "Lay Your Body Down". The first Greatest Hits album was released on November 26, 1996 and sold extremely well going on to reach double platinum status.|$|R
50|$|Dmitry Nagiyev's {{ancestors}} {{moved to}} Turkmenistan from Iran after World War I. On {{the way to}} a foreign country they were all starved, including Dmitry's grandfather, who was 9 years old. Dmitry often quotes his grandfather in his television programs and attributes to him funny quotes when he jokes. Dmitry engaged in Sambo and sport gymnastics in school. He received the title of Junior Champion of the USSR Championships in the 1980s. After graduating from the Electrotechnical Institute Im. Ulyanov in 1989, he served in the army (air defense forces). He returned from the army with a broken <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs</b> and a problem with a nerve. As a result, the upper right side of his face was paralyzed - an accident which has given Nagiyev squint of an eye. He uses it in comedic scenes.|$|R
5000|$|Castro met {{his future}} girlfriend, Grimilda Figueroa, when {{his family moved}} into a {{house across the street}} from hers in the 1980s. Castro and Figueroa lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992. Their home was a two-story, 1400 ft2 m2, four-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a 760 ft2 m2 {{unfinished}} basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956. According to Figueroa's sister, Elida Caraballo, when Figueroa and Castro moved into their new home, [...] "all hell started breaking loose". Caraballo and her husband Frank claim Castro beat Figueroa, breaking her <b>nose,</b> <b>ribs,</b> and arms. He also threw her down a flight of stairs, cracking her skull. In 1993, Castro was arrested for domestic violence but was not indicted by a grand jury.|$|R
40|$|FGFRL 1 {{is a novel}} {{member of}} the {{fibroblast}} growth factor receptor (FGFR) family. To investigate its expression during mammalian embryonic development, we have used the mouse system. Expression of Fgfrl 1 is very low in mouse embryos of day 6 but steadily increases until birth. As demonstrated by in situ hybridization of 16 -day-old embryos, the Fgfrl 1 mRNA occurs in cartilaginous structures such as the primordia of bones and the permanent cartilage of the trachea, the <b>ribs</b> and the <b>nose.</b> In addition, some muscle types, including {{the muscles of the}} tongue and the diaphragm, express Fgfrl 1 at relatively high level. In contrast, the heart and the skeletal muscles of the limbs, as well as many other organs (brain, lung, liver, kidney, gut) express Fgfrl 1 only at basal level. It is conceivable that Fgfrl 1 interacts with other Fgfrs, which are expressed in cartilage and muscle, to modulate FGF signaling...|$|R
50|$|The JDM-8 wing is {{constructed}} with an aluminum D-cell leading edge incorporating a 9 in high C-channel main spar made from 6061-T6 grade aluminum. The rear spar {{is a similar}} C-channel that is 5 in high {{and there is a}} third nose spar that is 3 in in height. The wing aft of the D-cell is covered in aircraft fabric and has a modified NACA 4415 airfoil with a drooped trailing edge. The 11 <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> and nine aft wing ribs are made from hydroformed aluminum. The ailerons were adapted from the Murphy Rebel design and are 69 in long with a 15 in chord. The ultralight version has a 4 ft greater wingspan to lower its stall speed to below the US ultralight category limit of 28 mph. With the wings folded the homebuilt version is 8.75 ft high and the ultralight version with its longer wings is 10.9 ft high.|$|R
5000|$|The Bagshot {{was built}} to Air Ministry Specification F.4/24 in December 1924. This called for a large twin-engined fighter {{aircraft}} with a crew of three (pilot and two gunners), a maximum speed of 125 mph and a landing speed of 50 mph. [...] Initially {{the details of the}} required armament were not specified. Frank Barnwell's design to meet this requirement, the Bagshot, was a high-wing all-metal monoplane with an unusual triangular-section fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage with two upper longerons and a single lower member. The pilot sat in line with the wing's leading edge, with one gun position in the nose and another just behind the wing. The two-spar wing had a steel primary structure and duralumin <b>nose</b> <b>ribs</b> and end-members, and was a semi-cantilever, being braced by a pair of diagonal struts on each side. The legs of the fixed undercarriage met the wing at the same place as the struts and had an axle fairing of airfoil section, contributing some lift. Power was provided by two wing-mounted [...] Bristol Jupiter VI engines.|$|R
50|$|Chris Lori is a Canadian bobsled {{driver who}} competed {{from the late}} 1980s to the late 1990s. Competing in four Winter Olympics, he earned his best finish of fourth in the four-man event at Albertville in 1992. Lori won the Bobsleigh Overall World Cup four-man {{championship}} in 1989-90. Chris won nine Crystal Globes for top three finishes in Overall World Cup final standings and totaled twenty two World Cup medals and fourteen Canadian Championship titles. Chris Lori was instrumental in establishing Canada as a world power in the sport of bobsledding. In 1987, Chris cheated death in a horrific crash in Cervinia, Italy, a track now closed due to its high rate of severe injuries, where he broke two <b>ribs,</b> clavicle and <b>nose,</b> suffered severe lacerations requiring skin grafting on his face, shoulder, hands and thigh. The following year, Chris recovered to qualify for his first Olympic games. In 1990, Chris and his team returned to Cervinia in the second to last World Cup race of the year where they set the track record, putting the team in position to win the Overall World cup, which they accomplished by winning the final race in Calgary and becoming the first non-Europeans to win the Overall World Cup in bobsleigh.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Poison {{became one of}} the biggest glam metal bands in the world, {{recording}} their second album, the multi-platinum selling Open Up and Say... Ahh!, and their third album, the multi-platinum selling Flesh & Blood. However, their lives were characterized by the escalating tension between Michaels and DeVille that derived from their mutual drug use, which came to a head during their 1990/91 [...] "Flesh and Blood" [...] world tour. Also cited is the spectacle of DeVille's behavior during the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. After getting into a fistfight with Michaels, DeVille left the band, and descended further into addiction. Poison went on with new guitarist Richie Kotzen recording the Gold album Native Tongue and then with guitarist Blues Saraceno recording the album Crack a Smile... and More!. In the mid-1990s, after a night of partying, Michaels came close to dying when he crashed his Ferrari into a telephone pole. He incurred serious injury, including broken <b>ribs,</b> a disfigured <b>nose</b> and lost teeth.In 1999, reunited with original guitarist C.C. Deville, Poison went on a successful greatest hits reunion tour. In the next decade, Bret Michaels would split his time between Poison and a successful solo career.|$|R
5000|$|During the autopsy, 29 pellets from an {{air rifle}} were found lodged in Jones's skin. Forensic {{pathologist}} Christopher Milroy {{testified that the}} gun must have been fired from the short distance of a few feet for the pellets to have penetrated the skin. Some pellets were in Jones's body {{for quite some time}} and he said Jones showed signs of lead poisoning, although the level was not high enough to poison her. She was likely shot with at least two of those pellets after the scalding. She also had nine fractured <b>ribs,</b> a broken <b>nose,</b> two black eyes and many cuts, bruises and scrapes on her head, knees and legs. Milroy said these injuries were caused after Jones was burned on November 24, 2009. Jones's body had other injuries including seven calloused ribs, which suggested an earlier fracture likely caused by kicks, as well as two recent rib fractures, a broken left finger, fractured right wrist and an earlier forearm break known as a [...] "nightstick fracture", caused by a blow to the arm raised in a defensive position. Joel Fish, medical director of the burn unit of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, testified as a burn expert. According to Fish, had Jones received proper medical treatment, she would have had a [...] "virtually 100 per cent" [...] chance of survival.|$|R
