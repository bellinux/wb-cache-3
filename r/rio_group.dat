25|$|Recognizing {{the drug}} trade {{as a threat to}} {{regional}} security, Toledo sought to create a common Andean approach to the drug war. He saw that revenue from drug trafficking funded terrorist activities, but also that U.S. insistence on the eradication of coca crops failed to address the problem. Alternative crop programs were also being resisted by coca farmers who depended on the coca trade for their livelihood. At a meeting of the 19-member <b>Rio</b> <b>group</b> in May 2003, Toledo proposed developing a joint strategy to deal with drug trafficking, but pressure from Washington, which preferred bilateral efforts, helped kill the notion.|$|E

25|$|Mexico {{is one of}} the {{founding}} members of several international organizations, most notably the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the OPANAL and the <b>Rio</b> <b>Group.</b> For a long time, Mexico {{has been one of the}} largest contributors to the United Nations regular budget, in 2008 over 40 million dollars were given to the organization. In addition, it was the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development since it joined in 1994 until the accession of Chile in 2010. Mexico is considered as a newly industrialized country, a regional power and an emerging market, hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20 major economies.|$|E
25|$|Many Latin Americans {{perceived}} that neo-liberalism reforms were failures in 1980s and the 1990s and intensified {{their opposition to}} the Washington consensus. This led to a resurgence in support for Pan-Americanism, support for popular movements in the region, the nationalisation of key industries and centralisation of government. America's tightening of the economic embargo on Cuba in 1996 and 2004 also caused resentment amongst Latin American leaders and prompted them to use the <b>Rio</b> <b>Group</b> and the Madrid-based Ibero-American Summits as meeting places rather than the United States-dominated OAS. This trend has been reinforced through the creation of a series of regional political bodies such as Unasur and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and a strong opposition to the materialisation of the Washington-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas at the 2005 4th Summit of the Americas.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 April, {{the strike}} was less effective, with many schools and {{businesses}} re-opening. As {{with the previous}} day, television provided continuous coverage, and the government intervened with cadenas – {{but this time the}} networks split the screen, showing the cadena on one side and their coverage of the strike on the other. On the evening of 10 April, Fedecámaras and CTV held televised news conference announcing that the strike would be extended indefinitely, unanimously voted for a [...] "coordinating committee for democracy and liberty" [...] in order to [...] "rescue" [...] Venezuela's freedom. The opposition then called for a march to the PDVSA headquarters the following day. In the National Assembly, those close to Chávez stated that Chávez wanted [...] "moderation" [...] though if an unlimited general strike were to occur from the opposition, an [...] "unspecified 'violence will occur'". Brigadier General Néstor González then appeared on television to demand Chávez's resignation and to issue an ultimatum. The statement had the desired effect of ensuring that Chávez cancelled his planned trip to a <b>Rio</b> <b>Group</b> summit in Costa Rica: the coup plans supposedly required Chávez to be in Venezuela. The message was recorded in the house of Napoleón Bravo, host of Venevisión's 24 Horas, as Bravo admitted on air on 12 April, in a discussion with Rear Admiral Molina Tamayo. Also on 10 April, a draft of what would become the Carmona Decree was allegedly shown to the leading intellectual Jorge Olavarría for comments. Olavarría warned that it violated democratic norms and would provoke an international reaction.|$|E
