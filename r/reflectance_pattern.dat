50|$|Due to the {{widespread}} cultivation of the alfalfa, the host plant for C. eurytheme and C. philodice, the species {{was able to}} expand their ranges across most of North America. These two species of sulphur butterflies have retained a large degree of genetic compatibility that allows them the produce viable and fertile offspring. As {{a result of the}} recent sympatry and possible hybridization between these two species of sulphur butterflies, numerous studies have been conducted on intraspecific and interspecific mating. In terms of mating under natural conditions, the males do not discriminate between the species, but females maintain nearly complete reproductive isolation. Studies suggest that the females do so by looking for the ultraviolet <b>reflectance</b> <b>pattern</b> on the dorsal wing surface of C. eurytheme males. Therefore, it was suggested that C. eurytheme and C. philodice do not randomly mate with each other. Instead, mating was found to be positively assortive and mostly conspecific.|$|E
50|$|Male C. eurytheme hindwings {{demonstrate}} an ultraviolet <b>reflectance</b> <b>pattern</b> while female C. eurytheme hindwings demonstrate ultraviolet absorbing patterns. According to studies, these ultraviolet reflecting wing scales {{found in}} males also contain pterin pigments that absorb wavelengths below 550 nm. Although {{this may seem}} paradoxical, the pterin pigments {{have been found to}} decrease the amount of diffuse ultraviolet reflectance that comes from the wing scales. By suppressing the diffuse ultraviolet reflectance, the directionality and spectral purity of the iridescence is heightened. In addition, the presence of the pterin pigments increases the signal's chromaticity and potential signal content, suggesting that these pigments are responsible for amplifying the contrast between ultraviolet reflectance and background colors as a male's wings move during flight. Further studies have found that the ultraviolet reflectance signal is brightest within a wing beat cycle when viewed from directly above the male. This supports the idea that male wing color should be able to be readily distinguished from that of females and the visual background that consists mostly of UV-absorbing vegetation.|$|E

Conventional video-imaging and Scanning Laser imaging are compared to each other.

The results showed that, when vegetation cover was low (below 600 grams of dry biomass per square meter), the near infrared (NIR) reflectances decreased very little with water depth. The same was true for red reflectances, but to a lesser degree. Overall the changes were not significant at 0. 05 level of significance when the water depth was increased from 2. 5 centimeters to 10 centimeters. When the vegetation cover became higher most NIR and red reflectances did not show a significant decrease with the increase of the water depth, and sometimes they even increased slightly up to a water depth of 6. 4 cm. Nevertheless both rice cover and water depth as well as soils {{played an important role in}} the <b>reflectance</b> <b>pattern</b> in red and NIR bands.

This study investigates the role of intrusions in generating methane from coal. Coal samples at four different outcrops were analyzed by vitrinite reflectance, carbon isotopes and petrography. Reflectance values at sill contacts are elevated over a wider zone than for dikes. Coal [delta]¹³C values increase by 1 % approaching the contacts of dikes and decrease by approximately 1. 5 % at sills due to the addition of ¹²C-rich material such as pyrolytic carbon. Xenoliths show little evidence of dissolution for xenoliths within sills with more dissolution for xenoliths within dikes. The lack of dissolution indicates a short residence time, due to rapid cooling once emplaced. The elevated <b>reflectance</b> <b>pattern</b> observed at sills cannot result from long emplacement durations and the very low thermal conductivity of coal is responsible.

While infestation with an aggressive soil pathogen can be detected via reflected light spectra, it is unknown to what extent hyperspectral reflectance {{could be used to}} detect overall changes in soil biodiversity. We tested the hypotheses that spectra can be used to (1) separate plants growing with microbial communities from different farms; (2) to separate plants growing in different microbial communities due to different land use; and (3) separate plants according to microbial species loss. We measured hyperspectral <b>reflectance</b> <b>patterns</b> of winter wheat plants growing in sterilized soils inoculated with microbial suspensions under controlled conditions. Microbial communities varied due to geographical distance, land use and microbial species loss caused by serial dilution. After 3 months of growth in the presence of microbes from the two different farms plant hyperspectral <b>reflectance</b> <b>patterns</b> differed significantly from each other, while within farms the effects of land use via microbes on plant reflectance spectra were weak. Species loss via dilution on the other hand affected a number of spectral indices for some of the soils. Spectral reflectance can be indicative of differences in microbial communities, with the Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index the most common responding index. Also, a positive correlation was found between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the bacterial species richness, which suggests that plants perform better with higher microbial diversity. There is considerable variation between the soil origins and currently it is not possible yet to make sufficient reliable predictions about the soil microbial community based on the spectral reflectance. We conclude that measuring plant hyperspectral reflectance has potential for detecting changes in microbial communities yet due to its sensitivity high replication is necessary and a strict sampling design to exclude other ‘noise’ factors. </p...|$|R

Special attention is paid to techniques that circumvent the curse of dimensionality introduced by high-dimensional data spaces. Experimental results, focused in this work on a specific case-study of urban data analysis, demonstrate the success of the considered techniques.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method of {{estimating}} pure spectra and the mixture ratio by applying the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to the agricultural remote sensing images for recognizing fine structure vegetation change on farmland, where the covering plant is unknown. This technique enables to separate the change of vegetation into qualitative one due to ecological characteristics such as the chlorophyll quantity, and the quantitative coverage one. In the area of remote sensing several attempts using the ICA have been reported. These methods have defined the spectral <b>reflectance</b> <b>pattern</b> in the wavelength domain, as the independent component (IC), in order to extract pure spectra or only spectral features for the classification. In these cases, {{it is necessary to}} provide sufficient spectral bands to ensure the independence of each IC, as, for example, with hyperspectral images. In our technique, we define the periodical spatial distribution of crops along the farmland position as the IC, so that pure spectra of crops are estimated as the mixture ratio of the IC, the coverage, unlike the conventional ones. To the simulated mixed spectra, we demonstrated that this technique is useful even when the mixed spectra include vegetation covering fluctuation, additive noise such as thermal noise from the sensor and atmospheric noise, in the real data are involved. In addition, by interpreting the coverage as the IC, it is possible {{to reduce the number of}} spectral bands. This means that our method can be applied not only to hyperspectral images but also multispectral images. 1...|$|E

The novelty of the approach is to explicitly model the sparkle geometry for rendering the surface of a graphic object. The light scattering within the system of metal flakes or particles creates the sparkling and glare effects with radial streaks of light around high intensity particles. The 3 D geometry of the simulated flakes creates a view-dependent <b>reflectance</b> <b>pattern</b> that makes the surface appear differently in the two images rendered for each eye’s view in a stereoscopic display.

Stereoscopic display of 3 D objects with and without the 3 D geometry-based surface rendering was used to validate the difference in perceived depth effects associated with the two cases. To confirm the applicability of the technique, we adopted a standard test in common use by paint designers in which the appearance of paints with different sparkle density is observed on silver plates.

The retinas of the left eye of 12 cats under general anesthesia were examined by a functional imaging fundus camera. Near infrared light was used to monitor the reflectance changes (RCs) of the retina. Vertical grating were used to stimulate the retina at 4 Hz. The spatial frequencies of the gratings were 0. 05, 0. 11, 0. 22, 0. 43, 0. 86, 1. 73, and 3. 46 cycles/degree (cpd). Ten images were averaged and used to analyze the RCs to obtain the peak value (PV) of a two dimensional fast Fourier transfer of the RCs. The wavefront aberrations (WA) were measured with a compact wavefront aberrometer and the spatial modulation transfer function (MTF) of the eye was calculated. The retinal reflectance image had a grating pattern. The PV of the spatial sensitivity curve was highest at low spatial frequencies (0. 05 and 0. 11 cpd), and the sensitivity decreased steeply with an increase in the spatial frequency. RCs were not detectable at 3. 46 cpd. The MTF decreased gradually with increases in the spatial frequencies and was 0. 68 at 3. 46 cpd.

The shift in xanthophyll pigments can be quantified as a photochemical reflectance index (PRI) by monitoring specific wavelengths in the visible part of the spectrum. In my research, I applied the photochemical reflectance index to assess changes {{in the degree of}} stress on tropical forests at two extremely different spatial resolutions: first, across the entire Amazon Basin using satellite-borne sensors, and secondly, above an individual stand of trees using a spectroradiometer mounted on a tower. The basin-wide analysis took advantage of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that sequentially monitored 1 x 1 km pixels at different viewing angles from two satellites. To correct for varying atmospheric conditions we used the most sophisticated algorithm available (Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm - MAIAC). With these combined data sets, I was able to discern large differences in photosynthetic efficiency occurred at monthly intervals between 2000 and 2012 across the entire Amazon Basin.

The ill-posed problem (Combal et al. 2002) of model inversion may be behind this lack of improvement because very similar <b>reflectance</b> <b>patterns</b> can be derived from different CBI values and that introduces noise into the inversion process. Therefore, additional efforts are required to obtain models and simulation scenarios that can be more confident in providing consistent reflectance signatures for specific burn severities. As far as multitemporal change is concerned, the reduction of accuracy with respect to the supervised post-fire simulation scenario is probably caused by the multiplying effect of potential noises introduced by radiometric correction in pre-fire and post-fire images.|$|R

Therefore, an indeterminate tillering pattern is not advantageous for harvesting.

We also examine the degree of polarized <b>reflectance</b> of wing <b>patterns</b> in representative species belonging to the nymphalid subfamilies Charaxinae, Heliconiinae, Morphinae and Nymphalinae.

A concentrated changes test performed on a phylogeny of the Nymphalidae, with the Papilionidae as an outgroup, provides further support for the correlated evolution of polarized iridescence and life in a forest light environment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the production and detection of polarized light may have adaptive communicative value in those species inhabiting forest habitats with complex light conditions. The potential utility of polarized iridescence and iridescent wing coloration within differing ambient spectral environments is discussed to provide a basis for future investigation of the polarized light ecology of butterflies...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{detailed}} analysis of hyperspectral and multidirectional remote sensing data acquired using the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) mounted onboard the Project for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA) spacecraft. This instrument is capable of sampling reflected radiation over the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum at a spatial resolution (approx. 17 m) intermediary between sensors traditionally used in land applications (such as Landsat and Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), 30 m– 50 m) and the latest instruments delivering a nominal resolution of 1 m or less. The spectral anisotropic signature of an Alpine coniferous forest during winter in relation to canopy cover was investigated using the Minnaert-k parameter obtained by inverting the Rahman–Pinty–Verstraete (RPV) model against CHRIS data. Although earlier studies have demonstrated that Minnaert- k can be used to characterize surface heterogeneity at subpixel scale, its spectral dependency has not yet been fully assessed in an imaging spectrometry context. Minnaert-k parameter retrievals across CHRIS bands revealed that a switch from bell-shaped to bowl-shaped anisotropic <b>reflectance</b> <b>patterns</b> occurs when comparing visible to NIR responses. Specifically, the degree of canopy cover and background brightness determine where in the spectral domain this switch in reflectance anisotropy occurs. For a bright snow cover background Minnaert-k values correlated best with canopy cover {{at the end of the}} red edge (e. g., around 735 nm). In this spectral region, pixels with medium canopy cover (40 %– 70 %) typically produced bell-shaped anisotropy patterns, while pixels with sparse (, 30 %) or dense (. 70 %) canopy covers typically produced bowl-shaped <b>reflectance</b> anisotropy <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
