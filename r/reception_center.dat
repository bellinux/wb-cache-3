25|$|During World War II, {{the park}} was renamed Camp Kidd, after Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd. Buildings within the park were used for {{multiple}} purposes, including hospital wards, training facilities, and barracks. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, many of the wounded were transported to Camp Kidd's hospital wards. Camp Kidd {{also served as a}} <b>Reception</b> <b>Center</b> for sailors until 1944, when those activities were transferred to Camp Elliott; this allowed for additional hospital expansion. It was returned to civilian authority in 1946, and repair costs to return the buildings and infrastructure to their pre-war status totaled $840,000, with the majority reimbursed by the Navy. In 1948, the funds were used to restore seven buildings that were deemed unsafe.|$|E
25|$|Over 75% of Red Army {{divisions}} {{were listed}} rifle divisions, as infantry divisions were {{known in the}} Red Army. In the Imperial Russian Army, the strelkovye (rifle) divisions were considered more prestigious than pekhotnye (infantry) divisions, and in the Red Army, all infantry divisions were labeled strelkovye divisions. The Soviet riflemen were known as a peshkom ("on foot") or more frequently as a frontovik (front fighter). The term frontovik was not equivalent to the German term Landser, the American G.I Joe or the British Tommy Atkins, all of which referred to soldiers in general, as the term frontovik was used only to describe those infantrymen who fought at the front. All able-bodied males in the Soviet Union were eligible for conscription {{at the age of}} 19 and those attending university or a technical school were able to escape conscription, and even then could defer military service for a period ranging from 3 months to a year. Deferments could be only offered three times. The Soviet Union was divided into 20 military districts, which corresponded with the borders of the oblasts, and were further divided into raions (counties). It was from the raions that quotas were assigned to the number of men that had been produced for the Red Army every year. The vast majority of the frontoviks had been born in the 1920s and grown up knowing nothing other than the Soviet system. Every year, men received draft notices in the mail informing to report at a collection, usually a local school, and customarily reported to duty with a bag or suitcase carrying some spare clothes, underwear, and tobacco. The conscripts then boarded a train to take to a military <b>reception</b> <b>center</b> where they were issued uniforms, underwent a physical test, had their heads shaven and were given a steam bath to rid them of lice. A typical soldier was given ammo pouches, shelter-cape, ration bag, cooking pot, water bottle and an identity tube containing papers listing pertinent personal information.|$|E

50|$|A year later, Congress {{approved}} {{a bill that}} made the harboring of an illegal immigrant a felony. However the Texas Proviso stated that employing unauthorized workers would not constitute as “harboring or concealing” them. This also led {{to the establishment of}} the H2 program, which enabled laborers to enter the U.S for temporary work. There were a number of hearings about the U.S-Mexico migration, which overheard complaints about Public Law 78 and how it did not adequately provide them with a reliable supply of workers. Simultaneously, unions complained that the braceros’ presence was harmful to U.S workers. The outcome of this meeting, was that the U.S ultimately got to decide how the workers would enter the country: by way of <b>reception</b> <b>centers</b> set up in various Mexican states and at the U.S border. At these <b>reception</b> <b>centers,</b> they had to pass a series of examinations at the <b>reception</b> <b>centers.</b> The first step in this process required that the workers pass a local level selection before moving onto a regional migratory station where the laborers had to pass a number of physical examinations; lastly, at the U.S <b>reception</b> <b>centers,</b> workers were inspected by health departments, sprayed with DDT and then were sent to contractors that were looking for workers.|$|R

50|$|Another {{phase of}} {{selection}} was inspection by U.S. labor contractors. At U.S. <b>reception</b> <b>centers,</b> potential workers would typically line up and contractors would physically examine and question them. Some contractors {{reported that they}} looked for workers that would be deferential rather than subversive. Aspiring braceros would also receive a meal at the U.S. <b>reception</b> <b>centers,</b> where they sat at long tables in dining halls. Afterward men were photographed and assigned a number, and then directed to meet with contractors, who would outline {{the terms of the}} labor contract.
