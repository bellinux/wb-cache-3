5|$|Mary Carpenter (3 April 1807– 14 June 1877) was an English {{educational}} and social reformer. The {{daughter of a}} Unitarian minister, she founded a ragged school and <b>reformatories,</b> bringing previously unavailable educational opportunities to poor children and young offenders in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The {{new middle}} class, led {{by those who}} {{agitated}} against the slave trade, in the city began to engage in charitable works. Notable were Mary Carpenter, who founded ragged schools and <b>reformatories,</b> and George Müller who founded an orphanage in 1836. Badminton School was started in Badminton House, Clifton in 1858 and Clifton College was established in 1862. University College, the predecessor of the University of Bristol, was founded in 1876 and the former Merchant Venturers Navigation School became the Merchant Venturers College in 1894. This later formed the nucleus of Bristol Polytechnic, which in turn became the University of the West of England.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, {{only seven}} of the ten {{original}} <b>Reformatories</b> remained. In 1917 the last Industrial School run by the Church of Ireland (Anglican) was closed in Stillorgan. A number of the <b>reformatories</b> were recertified as Industrial Schools so that by 1922, only five remained (one {{of which was a}} Reformatory for boys in Northern Ireland).|$|E

25|$|Title ix, Of the Education of Youth.-(i) Of parish schools. Teachers {{belonging}} to religious congregations should be employed when possible in our schools. The latter should be erected in every parish. For children who attend the public schools, catechism classes should be instituted in the churches. (ii) Industrial schools or <b>reformatories</b> should be founded, especially in large cities. (iii) A desire is expressed {{to have a}} Catholic university in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few decades there was a {{building}} boom to provide new premises for both types of institution. <b>Reformatories</b> were intended for children found guilty of criminal offences, while Industrial Schools were for orphaned neglected and abandoned children and those considered in danger of contact with criminality. This latter category had previously been accommodated in so called 'Ragged Schools (such as the one at the Coombe in Dublin), and in the countrywide network of Workhouses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, the {{government}} of Nazi Germany began arresting thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to salute the Nazi flag {{and sent them to}} concentration camps. The Witnesses taught and still teach that the obligation imposed by the law of God is superior to that of laws enacted by temporal government. Their religious beliefs include a literal version of Exodus, Chapter 20, verses 4 and 5, which says: 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them.' They consider that the flag is an 'image' within this command. For this reason, they refused to salute the flag. Children of Jehovah's Witnesses had been expelled from school and were threatened with exclusion for no other cause. Officials threatened to send them to <b>reformatories</b> maintained for criminally inclined juveniles. Parents of such children had been prosecuted and were being threatened with prosecutions for causing delinquency. In 1935, 9-year-old Carlton Nichols was expelled from school and his father arrested in Lynn, Massachusetts for such a refusal. Additional refusals followed, one such leading to Minersville School District v. Gobitis Even after the Gobitis decision, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to refuse to say the pledge.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze {{technical}} efficiency of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in India during the period 1990 - 91 to 2011 - 12. The paper also examines whether there is statistically significant difference in efficiency of PSBs in the <b>reformatory</b> era (1990 - 91 to 2000 - 01) {{as compared to the}} post <b>reformatory</b> era (2001 - 02 to 2011 - 12). Using CAMEL framework, the paper also investigates the determinants of efficiency of PSBs. The results show that PSBs exhibit higher mean of the efficiency parameters in post <b>reformatory</b> era (2001 - 02 to 2011 - 12) than in the <b>reformatory</b> era (1990 - 91 to 2000 - 01). PSBs inefficiency is attributed to Pure Technical Inefficiency in <b>reformatory</b> era whereas the same is accredited to scale inefficiency in the post <b>reformatory</b> era. Paired t test shows that there is significant difference in performance of Public Sector Banks in <b>reformatory</b> era and post <b>reformatory</b> in all the Efficiency parameters. The results of Panel Data TOBIT regression suggest that various CAMEL parameters have significant impact on the technical efficiency of PSBs. ...|$|R

Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman, an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry-at-Large to the Poor in Boston, Massachusetts. He is said to have directly inspired her start on the path of social reform, partly by a chance remark made when walking with Carpenter through a slum district of Bristol. A small boy in rags ran across their path and Tuckerman remarked, [...] "That child should be followed to his home and seen after." [...] He had established a Farm School in Massachusetts, which became the model for later <b>reformatories.</b> [...] Carpenter's later writings are based upon ideas she developed from her correspondence with Tuckerman.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Reformatory</b> {{buildings}} on Signal Hill were erected in 1880-81, before work {{started on the}} redoubt, using day labour assisted by the <b>Reformatory</b> boys. Dormitory accommodation was provided for 120 boys, along with schoolroom, workshops, store-room, kitchen and other facilities. A large vegetable garden was established and a superintendent's cottage was erected {{to the south of}} the <b>Reformatory</b> building, beyond the fortification earthworks. This cottage has been identified as an 1864 timber building - possibly moved from the Customs Reserve to Signal Hill [...] The 1873 Post and Telegraph Office remained within the <b>Reformatory</b> stockade, and the complex was completed and occupied early in March 1881. At this period, Signal Hill became known as <b>Reformatory</b> Hill.|$|R

2500|$|Many private philanthropic {{schools were}} granted {{certificates}} as <b>Reformatories</b> or Industrial Schools for {{the reception of}} children committed by the courts.

[...] Although Reformatory Schools were established first, Industrial Schools soon surpassed them, both in numbers of schools and of pupils. Between 1851 and 1858, ten <b>Reformatories</b> (five each for boys and girls) were certified.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} other reforms were {{realized}} during the remainder of Wilson's term as governor. Free dental clinics were established, a [...] "comprehensive and scientific" [...] poor law was enacted, and the usage of common drinking cups was prohibited. Trained nursing was also standardized, while contract labor in all <b>reformatories</b> and prisons was abolished, an indeterminate sentence act was passed, and regulation of weights and measures was carried out. A law was introduced that compelled all railroad companies [...] "to pay their employees twice monthly," [...] while regulation of the working hours, health, safety, employment, and age of people employed in mercantile establishments was carried out. Contract labor in penal institutions was abolished. In addition, a law was passed extending the civil service [...] "to employees of the State, counties, and municipalities," [...] labor by women and children was limited, and oversight of factory working conditions was strengthened. A new State Board of Education was also set up [...] "with the power to conduct inspections and enforce standards, regulate districts' borrowing authority, and require special classes for students with handicaps." ...|$|E

50|$|Today all {{trace of}} the <b>reformatory</b> {{building}} has gone, though the Colony Reservoir - a small upland lake - remains {{a short distance from}} the site, on the Charnwood Lodge Nature Reserve (SK464152). As the names suggests, this was used to supply water to the <b>reformatory,</b> or 'colony', and the inmates of the establishment are credited with having excavated it. A large wooden cross marks the <b>reformatory</b> graveyard, in which forty two people are buried - either boys or other servants of the <b>reformatory.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>reformatory</b> {{for boys}} was opened on 16 May 1881.

60|$|The {{justice of}} Spencer's views about {{training}} through pleasurable sensation and achievement in freedom {{rather than through}} uninterested work and pain inflicted by despotic government, is well illustrated by the recent improvements in the discipline of <b>reformatories</b> {{for boys and girls}} and young men and women. It has been demonstrated that the only useful <b>reformatories</b> are those which diminish the criminal's liberty of action as little as possible, require him to perform productive labour, educate him for a trade or other useful occupation, and offer him the reward of an abridgment of sentence in return for industry and self-control. Repression and compulsion under penalties however severe fail to reform, and often make bad moral conditions worse. Instruction, as much freedom as is consistent with the safety of society, and an appeal to the ordinary motives of emulation, satisfaction in achievement, and the desire to win credit, can, and do, reform.|$|E

40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Britain, {{the problem of the}} {{increase}} of young offenders raised the following connected statements. One statement stressed upon the need for the popular education, and the other improvement of the treatment of young offenders. In those days the discourses of reformation and education were formulated within the same framework. Today, however, educational thought can't be said equal to <b>reformatory</b> thought. That suggests that educational thought was gradually distinguished from <b>reformatory</b> thought. In this paper the writer has attempted to clarify the relation between educational thought and <b>reformatory</b> one through examining the "training system" of David Stow (1793 - 1864). The aim of Stow's training system was the formation of good habits of children in schools in place of the bad habits on the streets. Furthermore this training system was also introduced to <b>reformatory</b> institutions, such as <b>reformatory</b> schools and Parkhurst Prison (the first national 'separate juvenile prison' in Briatin). Nevertheless Stow emphasized "Prevention is better than cure". So he asserted that early education was needed for the formation of good habits. These Stow's thoughts showed the dual aspects of the relation of educational thought and <b>reformatory</b> one. On the one hand education in the training schools seemed to have the same function as the reformation in the <b>reformatory</b> institutions. On the other hand the formation of good habits was regarded as different from the reformation of bad habits. Consequently, therefore, {{it can be said that}} Stow's training system indicated the beginning of the distinction between educational thought and <b>reformatory</b> one...|$|R
