5|$|The {{new owners}} oversaw the {{construction}} of a ten-storey expansion to the property. This added a further 200 rooms to the lodge, for which permission was given although the Nevada State Park Advisory Committee opposed the move. They sought to re-open the Cal Neva on July 1, 1969, but instead it partly opened in May of that year with the new expansion opening the following month. The Ohio <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> purchased the lodge in 1970 for $6 million, with the aim to lease it to the U.S. Capital Corporation, who in turn sought to sublease it to Tahoe Crystal Bay Inc. The stockholders of the Ohio <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> filed a lawsuit against the company in 1973, which resulted in the Cal Neva being placed into federal receivership. After opening year round since Sinatra purchased the lodge, it closed for the winter season in 1974 due to a drop in visitors blamed on the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} {{mean-variance}} portfolio optimization of stocks, bonds, hedge funds, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> and commodities is sufficiently exact {{to optimize the}} investor’s utility. We approximate the expected utility using a Taylor series expansion including terms involving third and fourth order moments. The empirial findings for monthly data from August 1994 -August 2009 suggest that the incorporation of skewness and kurtosis cause no noticeable change in the optimal portfolio allocation. However, the serial correlations of smoothed returns of hedge funds and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> indeed cause major changes in optimal portfolio allocation. Consequently, attention needs to be drawn to significant serial correlation and not to potential deviations from normality due to skewed and fat-tailed return distributions. These findings have practical implications for investors {{who are willing to}} diversify their portfolios with hedge funds and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts...</b>|$|R
