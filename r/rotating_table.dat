Durr has explicitly acknowledged Wellesley as {{the catalyst}} of her moral transformation from a racist {{to civil rights}} activist. She came to question segregation after her experience with her college’s dining hall. The dining halls had a <b>rotating</b> <b>tables</b> policy that required students to eat meals with random students regardless of their race. Durr, uncomfortable with this idea, protested this rule, but ended up dealing with it after the head of her house threatened to release her from the university if she didn't embrace the <b>rotating</b> <b>tables</b> policy.

50|$|The initial light system {{produced}} a constant red light, using lamps powered by olive oil. This was replaced in 1896 by a rotating optic system {{supplied by the}} Chance Brothers of Smethwick, which used a <b>rotating</b> <b>table</b> coupled with a Fresnel lens to produce an alternating red and white flash every thirty seconds. The apparatus was powered by a weight slowly descending from the lantern room, which drove a clockwork mechanism turning the table at a set rotation. It was lit using lamps powered by paraffin, which was stored in a copper tank with ornate brass fittings.|$|E
50|$|In a Double Hesitation Mitchell, {{there are}} two points where EW move to NS, though not {{normally}} at directly <b>rotating</b> <b>tables.</b> With an even number of tables, this allows two more rounds to be played {{than the number of}} tables. For example, with 24 boards and 6 tables, eight rounds can be played. Two bye stand tables will also be needed. The position of the rotations and bye stand tables must be chosen precisely, otherwise a conflict will arise, so table cards are needed.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "vertical turret lathe" [...] (VTL) {{is applied}} to {{machines}} wherein the same essential design of the horizontal version is upended, which allows the headstock {{to sit on the}} floor and the faceplate to become a horizontal <b>rotating</b> <b>table,</b> analogous to a huge potter's wheel. This is useful for the handling of very large, heavy, short workpieces. Vertical lathes in general are also called [...] "vertical boring mills" [...] or often simply [...] "boring mills"; therefore a vertical turret lathe is a vertical boring mill equipped with a turret. A CNC version is called a [...] "CNC VTL".|$|E

Mabel {{was capable of}} producing a completed model rocket engine every 5-1/2 seconds. The operation began with an engine casing tube being loaded onto a <b>rotating</b> <b>table.</b> The table then advances through multiple stations where the nozzle, propellant, delay and ejection components are added. A paper end cap is then cut from a roll of heavy paper tape and inserted to retain the loose ejection charge. The completed engine is then ejected from the table, sent through the printer and dropped into the finished engine box below.|$|E
50|$|In other experiments, Coleman Griffith (1920, 1922) and John Detlefson (1923, 1925) reared rats in cages on a <b>{{rotating}}</b> <b>table</b> {{for three}} months. The rats {{adapted to the}} rotating condition {{to such an extent}} that when the rotation was stopped they showed signs of disequilibration and other physiological conditions which were inherited for several generations. In 1933, Roy Dorcus replicated their experiments but obtained different results as the rotated rats did not manifest any abnormalities of posture described by Griffith and Detlefson. Other studies revealed that the same abnormalities could occur in rats without rotation if they were suffering from an ear infection thus the results were interpreted as a case of infection, not Lamarckian inheritance.|$|E

5000|$|On 27 June 1894 plans emerged for an {{electrically}} powered beacon {{by the firm}} of Helios to replace the Old Tower. In 1902 this firm built and mounted the lighting apparatus. This consisted of two carbon arc lamps mounted on a <b>rotating</b> <b>table.</b> Each was surrounded on three sides by Fresnel lenses; on the fourth side a screen blocked the light. This light system existed until 1921, when two bulbs were installed as light sources. In 1995 the system was swapped for a metal-halide lamp with an intensity of 2,325 million candelas. Its electric flashing light sends three flashes every 17.1 seconds and is visible at up to [...] At the same time, {{one of the two}} triple-lens sets was removed and displayed to the public.|$|E
50|$|On {{the theory}} that pieces in major keys may better be accommodated, after many {{unsatisfactory}} attempts, in the 1980s, using computer modeling for assistance in design by scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, bells with a major-third profile were created by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands, being described as resembling old Coke bottles in {{that they have a}} bulge around the middle; and in 1999 a design without the bulge was announced.Although bells are cast to accurate patterns, variations in casting mean that a final operation of tuning is undertaken as the shape of the bell is critical in producing the desired strike note and associated harmonics. Tuning is undertaken by clamping the bell on a large <b>rotating</b> <b>table,</b> and using a cutting tool to remove metal. Much experimentation and research has been devoted to determining the exact shape that will give the best tone.|$|E
50|$|These are the {{standard}} form in modern installations, occasionally called vertical spindle mills. In a typical arrangement, {{the material is}} fed onto a <b>rotating</b> <b>table,</b> onto which steel rollers press down. A high velocity of hot gas flow is maintained close to the dish so that fine particles are swept away {{as soon as they}} are produced. The gas flow carries the fines into an integral air separator, which returns larger particles to the grinding path. The fine material is swept out in the exhaust gas and is captured by a cyclone before being pumped to storage. The remaining dusty gas is usually returned to the main kiln dust control equipment for cleaning. Feed size can be up to 100 mm. Roller mills are efficient, using about half the energy of a ball mill, {{and there seems to be}} no limit to the size available. Roller mills with output in excess of 800 tonnes per hour have been installed. Unlike ball mills, feed to the mill must be regular and uninterrupted; otherwise damaging resonant vibration sets in.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} basic switch designs for roller coasters. Flexing, substituting and <b>table</b> <b>rotating</b> rails {{have all been}} used. Flexing the entire rail truss, fixed at one end, to point towards an {{alternate}} destination requires manipulating a long segment of rail. Substituting a segment requires placing two or more segments of rail on flat plate that is moved in its entirety to provide straight or curved track. Alternatively these substitution track segments can be wrapped around a rotating cylinder, creating a triangular truss or a two sided plate. <b>Rotating</b> a <b>table</b> with a curved track segment in a Y junction is the less used third option. If the curved track turns the cars 60 degrees, and three rail lines meet as three equally spaced spokes, 120 degrees apart, then the curved track sitting on a turn <b>table</b> can be <b>rotated</b> to connect any {{two of the three}} rail lines at this junction, creating a triangle junction.|$|R
