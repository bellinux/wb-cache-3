2500|$|Eisley is a {{rock band}} from Tyler, Texas, {{originally}} consisting of siblings Sherri DuPree, Chauntelle DuPree, Stacy DuPree and Weston DuPree. Remaining recording/touring members are cousins Sherri DuPree-Bemis and Garron DuPree. Their name {{was inspired by the}} Star Wars saga (i.e. Mos Eisley). Since forming, the band has released five studio albums: <b>Room</b> <b>Noises</b> (2005), Combinations (2007), The Valley (2011), Currents (2013), and I'm Only Dreaming (2017), along with numerous EPs. Eisley has recorded videos for [...] "Marvelous Things", [...] "I Wasn't Prepared", [...] "Telescope Eyes" [...] (the version from <b>Room</b> <b>Noises),</b> [...] "Invasion", [...] "Memories", [...] "Smarter", [...] "The Valley" [...] and [...] "Currents", which can be viewed on their official website, but largely, the band's strong, steady, organic growth comes from touring and an aggressive online marketing approach.|$|R
25|$|In September 2006, Eisley {{headed back}} to the studio to record their follow up to <b>Room</b> <b>Noises.</b> While {{tracking}} for their second album, Sherri and Stacy also recorded vocals for Bright Eyes's album Cassadaga. The band finished recording the album in November 2006, but due to assumed conflicts with their label, the album was delayed. Combinations was finally released on August 14, 2007.|$|R
50|$|Hardshell {{headphones}} {{are typically}} {{used by the}} sound board operator to listen to specific channels or {{to listen to the}} entire mix. While an amplified monitor speaker can also be used for this purpose, the high sound volumes in many club settings make hardshell headphones a better choice, because the hard plastic shell and foam cushions help to block the <b>room</b> <b>noise.</b> Some performers may use headphones as monitors, such as drummers in pop music bands.|$|E
5000|$|Filters - Filters {{are used}} to {{essentially}} eliminate certain frequencies from the output. Filters strip off the {{any part of the}} audio spectrum. There are various types of filters. A high-pass filter (low-cut) is used to remove excessive <b>room</b> <b>noise</b> at low frequencies. A low-pass filter (high-cut) is used to help isolate a low frequency instrument playing in a studio along with others. And a band-pass filter is a combination of high- and low-pass filters, also known as a telephone filter (because a sound lacking in high and low frequencies resembles the quality of sound transmitted and received by telephone).|$|E
5000|$|MOS {{historically}} originates from subjective measurements where listeners {{would sit}} in a [...] "quiet room" [...] and score a telephone call quality as they perceived it. This kind of test methodology had been in use in the telephony industry for decades and was standardized in ITU-T recommendation P.800. It specifies that “the talker should be seated in a quiet room with volume between 30 and 120 dB and a reverberation time less than 500 ms (preferably in the range 200-300 ms). The <b>room</b> <b>noise</b> level must be below 30 dBA with no dominant peaks in the spectrum.” Requirements for other modalities were similarly specified in ITU recommendations later.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Room</b> <b>Noises</b> is {{the first}} {{full-length}} album of the band Eisley. It was released on February 8, 2005 on Reprise Records. The album was placed at [...] 9 among Paste magazine's top albums of 2005. The album had three singles: [...] "Memories", [...] "Telescope Eyes", and [...] "I Wasn't Prepared". Music videos were made for each single, as well as [...] "Marvelous Things".|$|R
50|$|A {{special edition}} CD/DVD {{includes}} eight {{songs from the}} band’s Ventura, CA, concert, the Memories video and a 30-minute The Making Of Combinations video piece. The cover art is coloured blue instead of yellow. A vinyl release was expected as the band was recording, but one never came to be. The band is now working on getting it released on vinyl in a combo pack with <b>Room</b> <b>Noises</b> (which only got pressed for 1000 vinyl copies originally).|$|R

Groovy old school house was responsible for inspiring the duo to pursue their dreams and create their art. Their style is typically characterized by big <b>room</b> <b>noise</b> combined with a powerful energy that gets people to dance. Recently, they have opted for a lighter sound generating an airy feeling with a greater focus on the vocals, {{setting the stage for}} feel-good tracks. Paris said, [...] "The only way we can feel accomplished with a production, is to bring it to that special place where people will be emotionally charged, a place where people want to dance, but also want to cry.

5000|$|It was {{announced}} via Steve's official website {{over the summer}} of 2012 that a new album will be available from September as a special LP bundle direct from the artist. An official release was to follow in November through the Grand Harmonium label. Adey worked on The Tower of Silence for several years, mostly mixing and editing early band recordings that were [...] "laid down" [...] in a church. No computers were used and Adey wanted to mix to tape in [...] "an old school" [...] style. [...] "The songs were all written at the piano, but from that point, the direction and possible trajectory could be anything." [...] Each song was approached differently, although the overall sound of the album is seamless and has a continuous mood.A full string section was employed during the initial recording. The sound is more [...] "live" [...] with more emphasis on a stronger [...] "band feel." [...] Album two was recorded, {{for the most part}} in a church, utilising the natural acoustic and <b>room</b> <b>noise.</b> The album received critical acclaim across the board, including positive reviews from The Sunday Times, Q Magazine and Uncut Magazine, who also included the track [...] "Laughing" [...] on a best of 2012 covermount CD.|$|E

The performances of both are compared by performing subjective listening tests. The test signals used are clean signals (i. e. with no background noise), speech signals with <b>room</b> <b>noise</b> and speech signals with artificial noise added. Results indicate that for clean signals and signals with predominantly voiced components the CELP standard performs better than the wavelet method but for signals with <b>room</b> <b>noise</b> the wavelet method performs {{much better than the}} CELP. For signals with artificial noise added, the results are mixed depending on the level of artificial noise added with CELP performing better for low level noise added signals and the wavelet method performing better for higher noise levels...|$|E
25|$|During the {{majority}} of 2004, the band {{spent most of their}} time recording their debut album. During the first part of 2005, the band toured extensively with New Found Glory. In June 2005, Eisley embarked on their first headlining tour, The Summer Scenic Tour, to support their debut album <b>Room</b> <b>Noises</b> with Lovedrug and Pilotdrift as opening acts. On June 10, they performed a sold out show at The Troubadour in California. The recording of The Troubadour show was to be released as a live DVD; however, the band was not pleased with the footage or audio so nothing ever came of it.|$|R
25|$|In August, {{after the}} Hot Hot Heat tour, the band {{went into the}} studio in Seattle for a day to track Head Against The Sky. The song was later {{released}} in October of that year on the Head Against The Sky E.P. with three songs from the cancelled Troubadour DVD. In October and November 2005, Eisley went on tour with Switchfoot as openers. Around this time, the band started playing new, unrecorded material for their second album. In March 2006, the band did a small tour in Australia as main support for Taking Back Sunday. Following that, Eisley headlined their last tour in support of <b>Room</b> <b>Noises,</b> The Final Noise Tour.|$|R
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with Garron, {{it was said that}} the album was named after The Beatles song [...] "I'm Only Sleeping", citing heavy influence from the band during the creation of I'm Only Dreaming. The band's debut record <b>Room</b> <b>Noises</b> was named as a reference to Pet Sounds, making the reference to The Beatles in-line with their early work. Dupree said of the title, [...] "It felt like a lucid dream, one that I was afraid that I might wake up from, but I didn’t want lose that feeling. So I’m Only Dreaming sort of captured some of that hope, fear, and joy that I felt while making the record." ...|$|R

30|$|From unit-level {{measurements}} and examinations {{of the magnetic}} noise prior to the system-level measurement, we determined that battery charging and the magnetic torquer generate time-varying magnetic noise over the required level. During the system-level spacecraft function test in the shielding <b>room,</b> <b>noise</b> from the spacecraft exceeded the environmental noise when the battery was fast-charging and when the magnetic torquer was in operation. Field variation generated by the battery charging current had an amplitude of ~  6  nT at 2.5  m from the spacecraft center, corresponding to an amplitude of ~  0.5  nT {{at the tip of}} the deployed MAST. Variation during torquer operation was about 70 times larger. Therefore, caution is warranted when using data acquired during fast battery charging after an eclipse and at all times when using data acquired during torquer operation, which occurs at perigee in every orbital revolution.|$|E
40|$|Introduction NTT {{has been}} {{studying}} an objective model for evaluating telephone transmission performance [39], [40], [41], [42]. This describes OPINE (Overall Performance Index model for Network Evaluation), focussing on practical use. OPINE deals with transmission loss, circuit noise, <b>room</b> <b>noise,</b> attenuation/frequency distortion (fundamental factors), quantizing distortion, talker echo and sidetone. It models the auditory-psychological process of evaluation by human beings of telephone transmission performance based on these factors. It is therefore {{the second type of}} model according to the classification of 2 (British Telecom). The model's basic principle is the fact that evaluation of psychological factors (not physical factors) on the psychological scale is additive. The model is extended from the first revision to take additional physical factors into account. OPINE was first constructed for fundamental factors in 1983 [39]. The opinion test data used for coefficient trai...|$|E

We present a novel noise-robust feature extraction algorithm that is a combination of our previously developed minimum mean square error (MMSE) log-energy estimation algorithm and the probabilistic optimum filtering (POF) algorithm. We also studied an approach based on training the automatic speech recognition (ASR) system with previously collected noisy speech. While both the above approaches gave significant improvements, it was found that combining them gave the best results.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{in the realm}} of acousti- cal engineering, the effects of <b>room</b> <b>noise</b> and {{reverberation}} on “word intelligibility” and on “listening difficulty” have been investigated.

In this paper, we overcome this limit by proposing a modular, portable, cost-effective, easy- to-extend and easy-to-deploy solution for simultaneous intelligibility tests on possibly large groups of listeners. The collected data are not only the very test results in term of correctness, but also the subjective listening difficulty and the precisely measured response time.
