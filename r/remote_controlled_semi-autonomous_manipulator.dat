40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this project}} is to investigate, {{construct}} and evaluate a radio controlled tracked reconnaissance and inspection vehicle. It is envisaged that this project would implement a series of wireless web cams or video cameras to transmit a video feed back to a remote portable location {{to allow for the}} inspection of hazardous and inaccessible locations. The concept of having mobile robots that are able to control themselves in either an autonomous or semiautonomous operational mode is not at all new. Over the years there have been many different attempts at constructing robots capable of this feat. Generally, most robots of this nature are designed primarily for military use. Under military use, these robots are often deployed for bomb diffusion and bomb placement as well as general reconnaissance. The primary objectives of this project were to construct a <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>semi-autonomous</b> robotic tracked inspection vehicle for the inspection of hazardous and inaccessible locations. It was also necessary that this vehicle be highly stable, and easily adaptable to form the basis for further developments of suitable attachments such as grapplers or robotic manipulators such as arms and hands. The main design criteria for this device were: - Must be able to be constructed from easily available materials and components. - Must be ruggered and durable especially {{if it is to be}} used in hostile environments. - Must be easy and intuitive to operate to facilitate ease of use. - Must have sufficient power and runtime to make its deployment worthwhile. In conclusion, the device which was designed and constructed implemented various components; a large number of these components had to be custom manufactured for this device. Once construction was complete, it underwent numerous hours of infield testing in order to determine its effectively as a remote mobile tracked reconnaissance and inspection vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After scoring {{second in}} RoboCup Rescue 2004 with Kurt 3 D and {{participating}} in 2005 with two robots, namely Kurt 3 D and RTS Crawler, we concentrated {{on the development of}} interaction between both vehicles. Kurt 3 D is able to autonomously explore and map the environment in 3 D and search for victims. The RTS Crawler is designed to access more demanding territory (i. e., red arena), working either <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> or <b>semi-autonomous.</b> The key innovation of this system lies in the capability for autonomous 6 D SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) and 3 D map generation of natural scenes, combined with the intelligent cooperation between robots that enables one operator to efficiently map and explore the whole arena. The robots are equipped with dedicated state of the art equipment, e. g., 3 D laser range finders, infrared camera and CO 2 -sensor. Robots as well as operator station are rather compact and easy to set up. The challenge of controlling two rescue robots with only one operator is managed with a redesigned user interface and a number of autonomous and semiautonomous features...|$|R
30|$|Remote-controlled mobile robots {{are useful}} for searching around and inside {{buildings}} that have collapsed in a disaster. In a disaster area, to avoid the risk of secondary disasters, it is preferable to immediately deploy remote-controlled mobile robots {{instead of waiting for}} first responders such as firefighters. Disaster response robots should have high mobility on rough terrain. The movement mechanism of a crawler-type robot with sub-crawlers has been applied to many disaster response robots in order to realize high mobility [1]. However, its use complicates robot operation because the operator must actively control each sub-crawler by estimating the attitude or state of the robot based on camera images and sensor information. Therefore, because of the multiple degrees of freedom involved, operators must be well trained to achieve high mobility by using <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> A <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>control</b> system for crawler robots has been studied to realize both high mobility and simple operation [2],[3]. This study focused on a crawler robot with passive sub-crawlers to realize simple operation with multiple degrees of freedom. Passive sub-crawlers can adapt to unknown rough terrain. We developed a crawler-type mobile robot for conducting search operations around a disaster area. Passive sub-crawlers called “Scotta I” were adopted for this robot. In a crawler robot with passive sub-crawlers, it is only necessary to control the movement direction and driving speed, unlike in the case of controlling active sub-crawlers. However, posture control is impossible in passive sub-crawlers because the operator cannot actively control each sub-crawler, and a robot with passive sub-crawlers cannot recover from a situation in which it is stuck. A robot with passive sub-crawlers is extremely simple, but it is essential for the operator to possess considerable skill when selecting a route. The operator must select a traversable route for unknown rough terrain using only the information obtained from camera images and sensor data from the robot.|$|R

Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
