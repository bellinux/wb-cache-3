25|$|Difficult to unit test: Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC {{framework}} and stores {{all of its}} configurations in database and as a <b>result,</b> <b>unit</b> testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven development framework such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in {{making it easier for}} developers to write unit-testable code.|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{unit testing}} is to isolate {{each part of}} the program and show that the {{individual}} parts are correct. A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. As a <b>result,</b> <b>unit</b> tests find problems early in the development cycle.|$|E
50|$|In Em City, {{white and}} Latino inmates and guards are {{constantly}} being traded for black guards and inmates who support Adebisi, so O’Reily and Keller unite to turn the tables. They murder inmates Nate Shemin and Mondo Browne, and frame Supreme Allah. As a <b>result,</b> <b>Unit</b> Manager Martin Querns is fired and McManus is rehired.|$|E

40|$|According to Baumol (1993) {{health care}} epitomises Baumol's cost disease. Sectors that suffer from Baumol's cost disease are characterised by slow {{productivity}} growth {{due to a}} high labour coefficient. As a <b>result,</b> <b>unit</b> costs of these sectors rise inexorably if the respective wages increase with productivity growth of the progressive industries such as manufacturing. Thus, according to Baumol (1993) the secular rise in health-care expenditure has been unavoidable. This present paper demonstrates that health care is contracted by Baumol's cost disease, but only to a minor extent. Consequently, policy-makers have more leeway to curbever-increasing health-care expenditure than is suggested by Baumol (1993) and other authors. In addition, we test the implications of Baumol's cost disease for health care by avoiding the well-known flaws in constructing medical price indices. Therefore, the adjusted Baumol variable derived in this paper is also extremely appropriate to test the validity of Baumol's cost diseases of other service industries such as education or the live performing arts. Additionally, our analysis suggests that health care is rather a necessity than a luxury at the national level, which conflicts with macroeconomic evidence provided in the relevant literature...|$|E
30|$|The {{stoichiometric}} K-phase {{was used}} as a subcell of a supercell because its use speeds up calculation while having little impact on final <b>results.</b> <b>Unit</b> cell parameter was equal to 0.375 nm multiplied by the number of subcells in a supercell.|$|R
50|$|Historically many of {{the systems}} of {{measurement}} which had been in use were to some extent based on {{the dimensions of the}} human body. As a <b>result,</b> <b>units</b> of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person.|$|R
50|$|Key odorants can be {{identified}} by comparing the concentrations of the odorants with their respective flavor threshold. The <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> is the odor activity value (OAV). Every key odorant has an OAV higher than 1. Values lower than 1 are not perceived.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, the unnormalized {{frequency}} {{is represented}} in units of radians/second (angular frequency), and denoted by [...] When [...] is normalized by the sample-rate (samples/sec), the <b>resulting</b> <b>units</b> are radians/sample.

5000|$|The {{operation}} was very ambitious from the start, requiring {{large numbers of}} troops for both offensive operations and {{the defense of the}} captured territory. As a <b>result,</b> <b>units</b> of the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Air Force were deployed for ground operations in support of the SLA.|$|R
50|$|Two {{simultaneous}} but independent {{attempts were}} made to raise the division in the waning days of the war; the <b>resulting</b> <b>units</b> are conventionally distinguished as Nord ("North") and Ost ("East"), after the respective theaters where they were being assembled. For all practical purposes the 9th Mountain Division never fully came into being.|$|R

25|$|There {{are various}} methods for {{generating}} screw threads. The method chosen {{for any one}} application is chosen based on constraints—time, money, degree of precision needed (or not needed), what equipment is already available, what equipment purchases could be justified based on <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> price of the threaded part (which depends on how many parts are planned), etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{returning}} Eastern Oklahoma {{elements of}} the former 142nd Infantry merged during 1920-21 with the 3rd Infantry, and the <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> was designated in the Oklahoma National Guard as 3rd Infantry.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to divide an equilateral triangle into three congruent non-convex pentagons, meeting {{at the center of}} the triangle, and to tile the plane with the resulting three-pentagon unit.A similar method can be used to subdivide squares into four congruent non-convex pentagons, or regular hexagons into six congruent non-convex pentagons, and then tile the plane with the <b>resulting</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{measurement}} of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body but letting through those that do the most damage, so any source of radiation may be {{measured in terms of}} its true danger rather than just its strength. The <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> is the sievert or microsievert.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} Silvia was uniquely progressive {{in that it}} {{was originally}} intended to feature a rotary engine, designed and built by Nissan. The <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> was fairly unreliable, and forestalled production. Coincidentally, it shared a chassis code with the Mazda Cosmo, the first Japanese production car to feature a rotary engine. The chassis was no longer shared with the B-series Nissan Sunny, and was upgraded to the larger A-series Nissan Stanza platform.|$|R
5000|$|... 41 Combat Engineer Regiment was {{stood up}} on 6 September 2008 at a parade at the Military Museums in Calgary. The parade officially disbanded and amalgamated 8 Field Engineer Regiment and 33 Field Engineer Squadron. Amalgamation meant the <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> was {{entitled}} to the combined honours {{and history of the}} constituent units. This was authorized by Gordon O'Connor, then Minister of National Defence under Ministerial Organization Order 2006041 on 23 November 2006.|$|R

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The <b>resulting</b> <b>units</b> may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of MgB 20 {{has been investigated}} by X-ray and synchrotron powder diffraction at room temperature. As it happens in other metal-boron systems, the Rietveld refinement of this magnesium boron-rich phase shows a structure derived directly from b-boron. The substantially unaltered B–B framework hosts magnesium atoms in three different atomic positions (D, E and F holes); the occupancy of these sites is partial.

40|$|Unit {{hydrograph}} {{is one of}} flood design {{method that}} commonly used in Indonesia. Problems emerge in the unit hydrograph application including high rainfall variability both time and space, lack of automatic rainfall data needed for unit hydrograph derivation. However, {{the output of the}} catchment system called hydrograph that represent all the phenomena in the system is available. So, effect of rainfall variability on unit hydrograph and the possibility to derive unit hydrograph based on hydrograph data without rainfall data need to be studied. Unit hydrograph derivation is done by using different rainfall input i. e. single station, rainfall catchment and inverse effective rainfall derived based on hydrograph alone. The <b>resulted</b> <b>unit</b> hydrographs are then used for design flood calculation. Results show that the <b>resulted</b> <b>unit</b> hydrographs vary among the different rainfall inputs. The difference in peak relative to unit hydrograph derived based on average rainfall for Bedog, Code and Winongo catchments could reach - 18 %, - 30 % and - 11 %, respectively. This result indicates that in the catchment studied, the rainfall variability is relatively high. However, the difference in flood peak is quite small, that is up to - 12 % for all the catchments. There is a trend that the station closest to the catchment centroid gives small bias in design flood relative to the design flood computed based on average rainfall...|$|R

50|$|The goal of {{this effort}} was to create an {{internal}} turbulence inside the piston chambers so that a higher percent of the fuel was burnt. The <b>resulting</b> <b>unit</b> was very robust and economic, albeit with modest performance {{when compared to the}} competing Volkswagen EA-827. The CHT has lower peak power but with generally higher average torque, with the torque curve being much straighter and closer to the maximum at any engine speed than a similar AP engine. Torque was the CHT engine's advantage, it being capable of running without much loss of power in very low engine speeds as well.|$|R
