Nevertheless, the native vegetation in these zones has been modified or lost {{at an alarming rate}} during the last decades. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> on bird diversity in riparian zones, in order to estimate the ecological implications of a substantial expansion of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations.</b> Breeding birds were sampled by the point-count method in twenty-four <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> of I- 214 clone, according to a factorial design combining stand age and understory management. Furthermore, the three native riparian forests remaining in the study area were also surveyed. Explanatory variables included (1) dendrometric, (2) understory and (3) landscape variables within six different radii of circular buffers. The species richness and abundance index were higher in riparian forests than in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations.</b> Landscape variables (percentage of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> in the surrounding landscape) strongly influenced bird diversity in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations.</b> Furthermore, at the local scale, understory cover was also a key factor in shaping bird assemblages.

Once plantations reach 4 yr, canopy closure results in a relatively impoverished understory plant community, supporting fewer small mammal species at a lower abundance. Creating habitat heterogeneity by maintaining a diversity of plantation ages within the complex may enhance small mammal species diversity across these landscapes.

40|$|Poplars (Populus sp.) {{are widely}} used in short {{rotation}} forestry for production of biomass for bioenergy, fibre and environmental services. Swedish short rotation forestry is based on Salix sp., and {{little is known about}} the production potential of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> and their effects on the environment. This thesis focuses on four aspects of intensive short rotation forestry with poplars: 1) Biomass production and partitioning at several initial densities and a range of latitudes and growing conditions in Sweden, 2) the effects of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation</b> on floristic diversity in the Swedish agricultural landscape, 3) the pattern of wind damage and its effects on production in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> in southern Sweden, and 4) ecological characterisation of poplar varieties in short-term experiments with pot-grown plants. Annual biomass production in <b>poplar</b> plots and <b>plantations</b> over a rotation period of 9 - 14 years ranges between 3. 3 and 9. 2 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1. These high production figures are achieved on relatively fertile, non-fertilised and non-irrigated agricultural land. The production assessments for commercial <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> established at lower initial densities (1000 trees ha- 1) in southern Sweden indicate a similar production potential as in closely spaced cultures (5000 trees ha- 1 yr- 1), though at 3 - 5 years longer rotations. Lower initial densities enable higher pulpwood yields along with the production of biomass for bioenergy. A comparison among 21 poplar plots, 0. 1 - 13 ha large and adjacent arable fields, indicates that small <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> may increase floristic diversity on a landscape scale, mainly by providing a different type of habitat that may favour shade-tolerant and draught-sensitive species. This is reflected by a relatively low number of species shared by both types of habitat. Wind damage in two <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations,</b> 15 and 33 ha large, was assessed using wind damage classes based on leaning angle of individual trees on plots established before wind damage occurred. The loss of increment on the strongest damaged plots during the two-year period after the storm was 30 %, whereas there was no difference in growth between damaged and undamaged plots in the third year after the storm. A short-term experiment using pot-grown plants revealed differences in clonal growth response in terms of physiological and morphological variables that determined relative growth rate and nutrient productivity, despite that most of clones were of the same species and geographic origin. The importance of different response variables in determining growth also shifted as an effect of irrigation and fertilisation treatment. Provided that suitable plant material is selected and widely available, commercial SRF with poplars represent a valuable alternative crop for surplus agricultural land with a potential to produce multiple benefits to society through the high production of biomass and fiber and positive effects on the environment...|$|R
40|$|Estimating the {{profitability}} {{trends of}} <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> under current sectorial public policies. Investments in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> in the Po valley (Northern Italy), {{the most important}} segment of timber production for the Italian forest-based sector, are undergoing a decline since more than two decades. The investment level is influenced by both economic variables {{directly related to the}} production, such as timber prices, management costs, and land costs, as well as external variables indirectly related to it, such as the opportunity cost of competitive agricultural productions, environmental restrictions, and the presence of subsidies. This paper presents the results of an analysis of trends in timber investment returns from <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> in the Po Valley. In specific, we estimated how these returns have changed in the last 15 years (2001 - 2015) {{as a result of the}} evolution of the key variables of cost and timber price, and assuming a representative plantation management regime. The results show that, in the considered period, poplar timber investments have had a significant decline, with estimated Internal Rate of Returns dropped of 22. 1 %- 44. 2 % from 2001 to 2015. In specific, the Internal Rates of Returns, when defined and in the base case scenario, ranged from values between 7. 1 % and 14. 0 % (2001) to 4. 4 %- 11. 0 % (2015). <b>Poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> are offering interesting income opportunities only when average timber prices are high, while in all the other cases the investments are at the threshold of economic viability or even negative. The decreased profitability, together with the high variability of potential financial returns, are negatively influencing the attitude towards the investments in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations.</b> These results are discussed in the light of the recent sectorial public policies. In particular, we focused on the Measures to support plantations of the regional Rural Development Plans, which often proved to be decisive for establishing new plantations and crucial in (de) stabilizing the sector. The lack of a strategic coordination among the northern Italian Regions and the discontinuity of subsidies schemes have contributed to the destabilization of the market...|$|R

The LAP site was excluded from ANOVAs because data was missing from all woodlot plots from this site. This left two remaining sites for Sanguinaria and Trillium, and five sites for Asarum and Maianthemum. The experimental unit was the plot (n[*]=[*] 3 per cell). All response measures were subjected to square-root transformations to improve the normality of ANOVA residuals and homoscedascicity; for presentation purposes the raw data are used in figures and tables.

The question is an important one since the EU actively promotes afforestation and 15 – 18, 000  ha are being forested in Hungary each year. Hybrid poplar is the most planted forest type in shallow groundwater areas of the Hungarian Great Plain because of its profitability. Key questions are generally the following: What will be the effects of afforestation on the water-salt balance of the target area, and, second, do <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> have similar or significantly different effects than native oak woodlands?

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the commercial cost efficiency analysis of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations,</b> according to project evaluation indicator in {{agriculture and forestry}} - {{internal rate of return}} (IRR). The analysis was performed for planting poplar clone I- 214 in the area of Ravan Srem, planting space 6 × 6 m, with different rotations and on different soil types. The methodology, used in this paper refers to the implementation of the dynamic method of economic research, which explains the discount rate, according to which, the current value of cash flow will be equal to the current value of the cash outflaw. The research goal was to check the justifica­tion of funds invested in wood production in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations,</b> based on revenues and cost analysis in different plantation ages, using the IRR. The research showed that the IRR for 12 sample plots varied in interval 4. 32 - 6. 94 % with average rate of 5. 63 %. The internal rates are larger for plantations on good quality soil types, regarding of <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation</b> (aluvial semigleyic soil), and for shorter rotations and vice versa. The IRR values higher than 12 % were not found in researched framework of cost-revenues changes rate. The sensitive analysis proved that the project is very easily affected by cost-revenues changes. ...|$|R
