5|$|The site {{on which}} the SIS {{building}} stands had been {{the location of the}} Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. Archeological excavation of the site during building found the remains of seventeenth century glass kilns, as well as barge houses and an inn called The Vine. Evidence was also found for a <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> on the site.|$|E
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the {{entrance}} channel to Canning Dock {{to the north and}} by Duke's Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new <b>river</b> <b>wall.</b> The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{surviving}} wall is medieval, but Roman-era stretches are visible near Tower Hill Station, in a hotel courtyard at 810 Coopers Row, and in StAlphege Gardens off Wood Street. A section of the <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> is visible inside the Tower. Parts of the amphitheatre are {{on display at the}} Guildhall Art Gallery. The southwestern tower of the Roman fort northwest of town can still be seen at Noble Street. Occasionally, Roman sites are incorporated into the foundations of new buildings for future study, but these are not generally available to the public.|$|E
50|$|The <b>river</b> <b>walls</b> were {{designed}} to be both ornamental as well as functional. Built of concrete, they feature the balustrade motif that was utilized on the public buildings and the bridges. The Court Avenue Bridge also utilizes balustrades in its design {{as well as the}} rounded arch, which is also featured in the buildings.|$|R
5|$|The {{storm surge}} caused EC$15.5million {{of damage to}} sea walls and another EC$15million of damage to coastal bridges. Floods and {{landslides}} contributed EC$17.6million of damage to the island's road network, while river floods destroyed EC$45.5million of <b>river</b> <b>walls.</b> Flooding also devastated the agriculture sector and 95% of the crops were lost. Replanting a rehabilitation of the banana trees, 99% of which were destroyed, was expected to take several years.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Reducing river sediments {{through path}} {{correction}} {{and preservation of}} <b>river</b> <b>walls</b> leads to considerable reduction of sedimentation at the pumping stations. Path correction and preservation of walls {{is not limited to}} one particular method but, depending on various conditions, a combination of several methods can be employed.

25|$|Prior {{to work on}} the new bridge, work crews {{constructed}} and opened a temporary bridge just {{to the north of the}} new bridge. The temporary bridge allowed for the relocation of utilities, construction of an improved <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> and uninterrupted substructure construction for the new bridge. The center span was constructed on three barges in the Chicago River, because of Coast Guard regulations that required the channel to be open at all times. After the center span was constructed, it was towed to the bridge, where 16 jacks lifted the span into place.|$|E
25|$|A new dock {{system was}} also {{proposed}} {{of which the}} main feature was a wide river street encircling the waterfront to afford ample accommodation for the movement of freight and its transportation by rail. The new river and sea wall was to be constructed of granite and a Beton concrete, composed of Portland cement and broken stone. From this wall projecting into the river were a series of piers constructed of wood, iron, and stone. The large concrete blocks used {{in the construction of}} the new <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> were manufactured at the yards of the Dock Commission in Gansevoort Street, Manhattan. Two to three blocks, of forty to fifty tons each, were made daily. Westervelt was closely involved in these improvements.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 she {{was moved}} to a {{custom-built}} dry dock at Greenwich. She was stripped of upper masts, yards, deck-houses and ballast to lighten her before being towed from the East India Import Dock to the special dry dock at Greenwich. The skipper on this occasion was 83-year-old Captain C.E. Irving, who had sailed the world three times in her before he was 17. The river pilot was Ernest Coe. Thereafter the entrance tunnel to the dry dock was filled in, the <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> rebuilt {{and the work of}} re-rigging began. The foundation stone of the dry dock was laid by The Duke of Edinburgh, patron of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society, in June 1953. The restoration, re-rigging and preparation for public exhibition was estimated to cost £250,000.|$|E

50|$|Work on {{the present}} stone {{structure}} began in September 1855, and it was opened in August 1857, although {{a considerable amount of}} work remained to be done. Construction of shops on the north side began almost immediately, this time in stone rather than wood, and supported on extensions to the bridge piers and <b>river</b> <b>walls.</b> The bridge was widened on the south side in 1861-2, and buildings started to be constructed on the south side in 1865. The buildings were removed in the mid-1960s.|$|R
2500|$|Floods have {{continued}} to be a concern for Johnstown, which had major flooding in 1894, 1907, 1924, 1936, and 1977. The biggest flood {{of the first half of}} the 20th century was the St. Patrick's Day Flood of March 1936. It also reached Pittsburgh, where it was known as the Great Pittsburgh Flood of 1936. Following the 1936 flood, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged the river within the city and built concrete <b>river</b> <b>walls,</b> creating a channel nearly 20 feet deep. Upon completion, the Corps proclaimed Johnstown [...] "flood free." ...|$|R

The event was obviously important to the Britons, as [...] "Macsen Wledig" [...] would remain a major figure in Welsh folklore and several medieval Welsh dynasties claimed descent from him. He was probably responsible for London's new church in the 370s or 380s. He was initially successful but was defeated by TheodosiusI at the 388 Battle of the Save.

2500|$|Over {{the next}} century, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians arrived and {{established}} tribal areas and kingdoms. The {{area of the}} Roman city was administered {{as part of the}} Kingdom of the East Saxons - Essex, although the Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was not within the Roman walls but to the west in Aldwych. It was not until the Viking invasions of England that King Alfred the Great moved the settlement back within the safety of the Roman walls, which gave it the name Lundenburh. The foundations of the <b>river</b> <b>wall,</b> however, were undermined over time and had completely collapsed by the 11th century.

2500|$|The planned {{location}} of the Munich gardens was the area north of the Schwabinger city gate, a hunting ground of the Wittelsbach rulers since the Middle Ages. Known as the Hirschanger (or [...] "deer park"), the higher part of the hunting ground closer to the city {{was included in the}} scheme, while the Hirschau (also meaning [...] "deer park"), lower and further north, and a more densely wooded part to the south known as the Hirschangerwald ("Deer Park Wood") were [...] originally not included. The whole area had been subject to flooding from the Isar, the river on which Munich stands, a little to the east. This problem was soon removed by the construction of a <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> in 1790, which became known as the [...] "Riedl-Damm" [...] after the engineer Anton von Riedl, who had supervised its construction.|$|E
2500|$|From 340 onwards, {{northern}} Britain {{was repeatedly}} attacked by Picts and Gaels. In 360, a large-scale attack forced the emperor Julian the Apostate {{to send troops}} {{to deal with the}} problem. Large efforts were made to improve Londinium's defenses around the same time. At least 22 semi-circular towers were added to the city walls to provide platforms for ballistae and the present state of the <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> suggested hurried repair work around this time. In 367, the Great Conspiracy saw a coördinated invasion of Picts, Gaels, and Saxons joined with a mutiny of troops along the Wall. Count Theodosius dealt with the problem over the next few years, using Londinium—then known as [...] "Augusta"—as his base. It may have been at this point that one of the existing provinces was renamed Valentia, although the account of Theodosius's actions describes it as a province recovered from the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Tashbaan: The {{capital city}} of Calormen, an ancient and {{powerful}} empire south across a desert {{from the land of}} Narnia. Tashbaan is a great city built on an island in the delta of a large river {{in the northern part of}} Calormen, just two days' ride south of Archenland (the small country between Narnia and Calormen) but several weeks ride from the southern parts of Calormen. It is described as one of the wonders of the world. The city is a hot and crowded place, though with fine streets, magnificent palaces, and gardens. It is built on a natural slope, rising to the palace of the Tisroc and the great Temple of Tash at the pinnacle of the hill. The palace of the Tisroc is described as magnificent beyond description and opens onto gardens that run right down to the <b>river</b> <b>wall.</b> Tashbaan is surrounded by a strong wall that rises out of the water and is reached by long bridges from both banks, providing the only place where crossing the great river of Calormen is possible for many miles. The banks of the river are lined with gardens and country houses. The Tombs of the Ancient Kings, believed by the Carlomens to be haunted, lie directly across the river from Tashbaan, on the edge of the desert. The city's name is clearly derived from the name of the god Tash; Paul Ford identifies baan with the Arabic for [...] "house of". (HHB) ...|$|E

50|$|A more {{substantial}} project began in 1880, {{with the intention}} of blasting and clearing the rock to a depth of twenty feet across much of the width of the river. This work was completed in 1886, having cost £70,000 (equivalent to £3.2 million in 2005). Completing this task required the development of innovative engineering techniques for mechanized diamond drilling underwater without the assistance of divers, and experimentation with a range of explosives. The work attracted international attention. In all 15,000 blasting holes were drilled and 90,000 pounds of explosives consumed. 110,000 tons of rock was removed, some of which was used in building <b>river</b> <b>walls</b> for further improvement of the Clyde.|$|R

The day was dull and a haze of smoke from two towns hung about the long rows of warehouses and massive <b>river</b> <b>walls.</b> Out in the stream, a small steamer with a black funnel and a row of white deckhouses moved seawards with the tide. The figures grouped along her rail got indistinct, but Flora's eyes were fixed upon two that stood away from the rest, until they faded. Then the African boat vanished behind the towering hull of an anchored liner.|$|R

Farther in the distance, the <b>river</b> <b>wall</b> was hidden by more closely massed bushes, and the formal, geometric precision of the nearer view was relieved by a background of vine-colored bowers, and a profusion of small trees and flowering shrubs arranged in studied disorder.|$|E
