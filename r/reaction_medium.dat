40|$|Baker’s yeast catalyzes the {{asymmetric}} {{reduction of}} prochiral ketones {{in water and}} in various organic solvents. The reaction in water, {{which is the first}} solvent of choice for bio-reactions, led to a high product yield and enantiomeric excess, but the low miscibility of organic molecules in water resulted in lower conversions when more hydrophobic ketones were used. Petroleum-based solvents such as hexane and petroleum ether were also successfully employed as <b>reaction</b> <b>mediums,</b> but the viability of the yeast in these solvents was negligible, and they have severe environmental impacts due to their high toxicity levels. Performing the reaction in green solvents, like ionic liquids, fluorous media, and glycerol-based solvents, which have low volatilities and can be recycled, enabled dissolution of the substrates and of the energy source and also promoted isolation of the product. Among all tested green solvents, glycerol-based solvents are preferable due to their biodegradable natures and their origins from renewable sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon/carbon {{composites}} with hydroxyapatite coatings {{are one of}} {{the attractive}} materials in the dental and orthopedic fields. In this study, hydrothermal treatment, in KOH aqueous and ammonia solutions, was used to convert an induction-heating-deposited monetite coating to an adherent HA coating on H 2 O 2 treated C/C composites. The structure, morphology and chemical composition of the as-received HA coatings were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and EDS. A scratch test was conducted to measure the adhesion of HA coatings to HT–C/C substrate. The results show that well-crystallized carbonate hydroxyapatite coatings could be achieved under the two <b>reaction</b> <b>mediums.</b> However, the as-obtained HA coatings after KOH hydrothermal treatment have higher crystallinity and Ca/P ratio than those after ammonia hydrothermal treatment, and reveal an average critical load of 29 N which is more than two times as high as that for HA coatings after ammonia hydrothermal treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the <b>reaction</b> <b>mediums</b> and {{conditions}} for producing high yield of valuable monomers from concentrated sulfuric acid hydrolyzed lignin. The solvent, temperature and time effects on the hydrogenolysis of hydrolyzed lignin were investigated under the catalysis of Pd/C and CrCl 3. Supercritical methanol exhibits the best depolymerization performance, because of its unique diffusion, dissolution and acid-base properties. Afterwards, the influence of reaction temperature and time on depolymerization, repolymerization and coking during hydrogenolysis was examined in methanol. The high temperature is found to favor the depolymerization, with the beta-O- 4 linkages cleaved significantly. However, the repolymerization is promoted simultaneously, and a high amount of beta-beta groups form. These reactions are in constant competition with each other and the repolymerization is preferred at excessive high temperature, producing bulk char residues, that is coking. This study will provide a beneficial reference for the maximization of lignin waste valorization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this study, the use of electrochemical technology (ET), using BDD with Ti as substrate (Ti/BDD), is evaluated in electrolysis of spent caustic mixtures, obtained through individual samples from different refineries.
