2500|$|The spans and wing {{areas of}} the DH.9A and H.P.20 were about the same, so the wing chord of the {{monoplane}} was about double that of the biplane. As a result, the tailing edge extended aft beyond the DH.9A's pilot's cockpit and so the H.P.20 was flown from {{what had been the}} gunner's position. There was a small cut out in the trailing edge to enhance the pilot's view. As there was no upper wing to house the fuel, the H.P.20 had a slightly <b>round-ended</b> <b>cylindrical</b> tank mounted high over the centre section to provide gravity feed. [...] Because high angles of attack were used in landing and take off with the slots open, the undercarriage was lengthened, as it had been on the H.P.17. There was an airflow direction indicator mounted on a little boom which projected forward of the starboard wing.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} of the Acacia genus with the {{specific}} species name being brachystachya. The plant is called brachystachya due to its short spikes, brachys (short), and stachys (spike). Acacia brachystachya is classed as a group 1 Acacia under the informal groupings outlined by D.A Morrison and S.J Davies. Group 1 plants are identified as having phyllodes, {{as well as being}} the only group which features flowers in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} is novel compared with previous works, {{in the following}} three respects. First, self-occlusion of the input face is detected automatically by estimating the head pose using a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head</b> model. Second, a 3 D model fitting scheme is designed based on selected visible facial feature points, which facilitates 3 D face reconstruction without any effect from self-occlusion. Third, the reconstruction performance is enhanced by using the estimated pose as the initial pose parameter during the 3 D model fitting process.|$|R

50|$|The term flail {{refers to}} two {{different}} weapons: a long, two-handed infantry weapon with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head,</b> and a shorter weapon {{with a round}} metal striking head. The defining characteristic of both is that they involve a separate striking head attached to a handle by a flexible rope, strap, or chain. The chief tactical virtue of the flail was its capacity to strike around a defender's shield or parry. Its chief liability {{was a lack of}} precision and the difficulty of using it in close combat, or closely ranked formations.|$|R

40|$|Both the {{configuration}} of facial features and the timing of facial actions are important to emotion and communication. Previous literature {{has focused on the}} former. We developed an automatic facial expression analysis system that quantifies the timing of facial actions as well as head and eye motion during spontaneous facial expression. To assess coherence among these modalities, we recorded and analyzed spontaneous smiles in 62 young women of varied ethnicity ranging in age from 18 to 35 years. Spontaneous smiles occurred following directed facial action tasks, a situation likely to elicit spontaneous smiles of embarrassment.
