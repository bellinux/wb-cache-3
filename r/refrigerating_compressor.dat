40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} learn mechanical, corrosive and abrasive wear mechanisms and wear mechanisms in <b>refrigerating</b> <b>compressor</b> systems. The range of author’s examinations includes electrolytic liquids with abrasive material used in the food industry, especially in the sugar industry and lubricating oils polluted with refrigerant occurring in stationary and mobile <b>refrigerating</b> <b>compressor</b> systems. Tests on the wear mechanisms in complex service conditions show that the total wear occurring in tribological pairs due to simultaneous occurrence of destructive processes: frictional, corrosive and abrasive, {{is not a simple}} superposition of their individual effects occurring in conditions of their independent interactions. On the basis of carried out experiments with the use of mathematical methods for experimental designs, a statistical model describing the complex process of simultaneous wear was formulated. This model enables forecasting the wear and indicates that the abrasive wear is of dominating character. In the compressor refrigerating systems, the oil–refrigerant system is characterized by complex relations. Refrigerants andcompressor oils create compounds causing the accelerated wear of refrigerating compressors. The complex dependencies in case of the oil–refrigerant compound, cause that the lubricating and anti-wea...|$|E

In this paper, the author analyzed a refrigeration system in which the condensing heat is cooled by the stored ice, and the refrigerating temperature is less than 0 ℃, the freezing/melting temperature of water. Any stored ice, for example natural snow/ice or ice made by the refrigerator, may be used in this system. A simple thermodynamic and economic analysis confirmed that this system is useful for reducing the work and size of a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>compressor.</b> This reduction is particularly remarkable in the case of cooling by natural snow/ice.

This paper describes the fuzzy models of <b>refrigerating</b> <b>compressor,</b> expansion valve, evaporator and condenser as basic elements of vapor compression air conditioning system. Compressor speed, delivery pressure, refrigerant flow rate, valve opening area, pressure difference across the orifice of expansion valve, evaporator temperature, condenser temperature, evaporator superheat and condenser superheat have been taken as different variables for vapor compression elements. Fuzzy model of all the elements has been compared with their respective mathematical models for their validation. Integrated fuzzy model was also developed for vapor compression air conditioning system. Performance was evaluated by comparing, integrated fuzzy model, individual fuzzy model and mathematical model for the vapor compression systems.

40|$|Abstract-With {{a view to}} {{conserve}} energy, the use of azeotropes in a multistage refrigerating system is quite timely. Depending upon the requirement, such a system incorporates conventionally either a water cooled or air cooled condenser. The total operating cost of a refrigerating system with a water cooled condenser comprises the cost of water {{and the cost of}} electricity needed to drive the compressor(s). There is enough potential for research in finding out the ways to achieve maximum coefficient of performance and the least operating cost simultaneously for multistage azeotropic system. However, to avoid overloading of sewage facilities and to comply with municipal codes for the use of water, the water flow rate required in refrigerating system should be minimized. In the present investigation, economic water rates for two stage refrigerating systems, operating on most commonly used azeotropes R- 500 and R- 502, have been searched out over a wide range of operating limits. Such economic rates, if followed, would produce maximum COP and consume minimum power. The effects of controlling variables, e. g. approach, cost ratio etc have also been studied on the heat transfer to condenser, optimum condensing temperature and economic water rate. The results have been presented in tabular form only. Index Terms — Azeotropes, multistage <b>refrigerating,</b> <b>compressors,</b> water cooled condenser. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{computerized}} {{simulation of}} a simple single-stage vapour-compression refrigeration system has been made. The steady-state simulation uses the accurate property correlations developed by Cleland for refrigerant R 134 a. The inputs to the program are: evaporator pressure, condenser pressure, superheating at evaporator outlet, subcooling at condenser outlet and compressor isentropic efficiency. The program outputs are: <b>refrigerating</b> effect, <b>compressor</b> work input, coefficient of performance (COP) and suction vapour flow rate per kW of refrigeration. An increase in the evaporator pressure from 150 to 250 kPa improves the COP by 40 %. The COP is decreased by 35 % when the condenser pressure is increased from 1000 to 1500 kPa. Increasing the superheat at the evaporator outlet from 0 to 16 °C improves the COP by 2. 6 %. An increase in subcooling at the condenser outlet from 0 to 16 °C increases the COP by 20 %. The COP is improved by 150 % when the compressor isentropic efficiency is increased from 0. 4 to 1...|$|R

40|$|Compressor and {{refrigerant}} {{play key}} roles in a refrigeration system. Owing to the de-mands of environment protection, the CFCs and HCFCs refrigerants will {{be phased out}} in a short time, and new refrigerants such as R 600, R 134 a and R 407 C will be used. As the new refrigerant is selected, the motion regularity of the valves will be changed. The motion regularity of the ring valves of a 2 -stage <b>refrigerating</b> piston <b>compressor</b> is simu-lated, and the calculations are done respectively with refrigerants R 717 (ammonia), R 22 and R 134 a. The results show that refrigerants and working conditions of a compressor have a direct effect on {{the motion of the}} ring valves. Comparing the original design pa-rameters of the ring valves with the modified ones, the former are effective for the HCFC refrigerants, the latter have perfect motion of the valves for the new refrigerants, and the refrigeration system performance parameters, such as input power, the refriger-ating quantity and the COP value, are also better. Service life test of the compressor system using the ring valves has been done for R 717. The compressor using the modi-fied ring valves has a life exceeding 8000 hours. Hence, the valve design should con-sider the influences of the refrigerant. Key words: ring valve, compressor, refrigerant, design, simulation 1...|$|R

Four diffusers with divergence angle 10, 15, 20 and 30 were designed for same inlet and outlet diameters. The diffusers used were with inlet diameter equal to discharge tube diameter of compressor and outlet diameter equal to condenser inlet diameter. The system was analysed using {{the first and second}} laws of thermodynamics to determine the <b>refrigerating</b> effect, the <b>compressor</b> work input, coefficient of performance (COP) and the rate of heat rejected from the system. During the test, the COPs of the system without diffuser and with optimized diffuser at condenser inlet were found out. With diffuser at condenser inlet, amount of heat rejected from condenser is also increased. To remove the same amount of heat, less heat transfer area required. This concept reduces size of condenser to achieve the same system efficiency...|$|R

A theoretical study of thermodynamic properties such as pressure, density, and specific volume, latent {{heat of vaporization}} compression index, and critical values are done. The theoretical performance of vapour compression refrigeration system with R 152 a, R 429 A, R 430 A, R 431 A and R 435 A was done and their results are compared. The effects of the main parameters of performance analysis such as <b>refrigerating</b> effect, <b>compressor</b> work, coefficient of performance, volumetric refrigerating capacity, discharge temperature, pressure ratio, condenser duty, <b>compressor</b> power, <b>refrigerating</b> mass flow are analyzed for various evaporating temperatures.

The paper describes the investigations of this R 718 refrigerating cycle. The limitations of the R 718 centrifugal compressor stage pressure ratio are discussed, and possibilities for introduction of two-phase ejectors in the R 718 refrigerating systems with direct evaporation and condensation are analyzed. The complex thermal and flow phenomena connected with additional compression, desuperheating and condensation inside the two-phase ejector flow field are investigated and performance characteristics are estimated. The thermodynamic processes are shown in pressure – enthalpy and temperature – entropy diagrams.
