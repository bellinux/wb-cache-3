5|$|After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial {{movement}} had {{split into two}} parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller tribal groups. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its President, although the government vetoed it, insisting {{that he had been}} an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} the program's approval, Nathaniel Davis, the Assistant Secretary of State, told Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, that he {{believed}} maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible. Davis correctly predicted the Soviet Union would respond by increasing involvement in the Angolan conflict, leading to more violence and negative publicity for the United States. When Ford approved the program, Davis resigned. John Stockwell, the CIA's station chief in Angola, echoed Davis' criticism saying that success required {{the expansion of the}} program, but its size already exceeded what could be hidden from the public eye. Davis' deputy, former U.S. ambassador to Chile Edward Mulcahy, also opposed direct involvement. Mulcahy presented three options for U.S. policy towards Angola on 13 May 1975. Mulcahy believed the Ford administration could use diplomacy to campaign against foreign aid to the communist MPLA, <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> sides in factional fighting, or increase support for the FNLA and UNITA. He warned however that supporting UNITA would not sit well with Mobutu Sese Seko, the president of Zaire.|$|E

She tells {{them about the}} Black Garden, a city where the Vex are born, and implores the Guardian to find it and rip out its heart, {{as it is the}} only way the Traveler will begin to heal. Ghost says that they need to speak to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef and <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves as she did not have time to explain things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy. After defeating Draksis, a Fallen Kell of the House of Winter, the Guardian confronts the Vex Gate Lord, claims its head, and returns to the Queen, who tells them to take its eye to the Meridian Bay on Mars, where it can be used to enter the Black Garden.|$|E

When he enters Seishu High School, he joins the baseball club along with his childhood friends, Akaishi and Nakanishi. However, the interim principal (the regular principal is on medical leave) has brought in a new head coach, and he in turn brings in transfer students from other schools as ringers just to play baseball. This team, led by their star, Yūhei Azuma, is the clear favorite of the school. Because the three friends <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> evaluation tests to join the first-string team, they are placed on the second-string [...] "portable" [...] team under the former head coach, Maeno, who has to use the Seishu Junior High School field for practice.

500|$|In 1793, {{when the}} British {{government}} {{called on the}} nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: [...] "Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> any part in the Fast?" [...] Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, on the moral responsibility of the individual; for her, each individual {{is responsible for the}} actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state and while she argues that [...] "insubordination" [...] can undermine a government, she does admit that there are lines of [...] "conscience" [...] that one cannot cross in obeying a government. The text is a classic consideration of the idea of an [...] "unjust war." ...|$|E
