5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{sit down}} with Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} in the discussions of presidential {{candidates}} that preceded the Whig National Convention for the 1840 race. He initially supported General Winfield Scott, but <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to defeat Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison campaign, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E

5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|We <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
5|$|Despite being fit he {{was often}} {{overlooked}} by then-manager Jacques Santini. It was unclear as to whether Santini <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> him at all as there was much media speculation that Carrick was bought by Tottenham's Director of Football Frank Arnesen rather than Santini. However, following the departure of Santini and the appointment of new manager Martin Jol he soon emerged as a regular starter in midfield. His first full start for Tottenham was also Jol's first game {{in charge of the}} club away to Burnley in the League Cup on 9 November. During the game he assisted a goal for Robbie Keane as they went on to win 3–0. On 18 December, he produced a display that was influential in helping Tottenham to a 5–1 win at home over Southampton. Carrick subsequently ended the 2004–05 season with 29 league appearances but failed to score as they finished the table in 9th and missed out on a UEFA Cup spot.|$|E

25|$|When Davies {{left school}} {{he became an}} {{apprentice}} with AJS. He gained motorcycle building experience, but <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to go racing. AJS were fully occupied filling orders {{at the time and}} racing had no priority. Sunbeam had a good racing team, but had a no-staff-poaching agreement with AJS, so Davies moved to Clyno as a tester, and shortly thereafter moved to Sunbeam.|$|E
25|$|So, what Arrow's theorem really {{shows is}} that any majority-wins electoral system is a non-trivial game, and that game theory {{should be used to}} predict the outcome of most voting mechanisms. This could be seen as a {{discouraging}} result, because a game need not have efficient equilibria; e.g., a ballot could result in an alternative nobody <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> in the first place, yet everybody voted for.|$|E
25|$|Galileo Galilei lampooned {{the misuse}} of Occam's razor in his Dialogue. The {{principle}} is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio.

25|$|Russia {{produced}} more goods, and enlisted {{thousands of troops}} during Catherine's reign. While she acquired new lands, including Crimea and Poland, updated the army, and supported burgeoning manufactures, she <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to westernize Russia by reforming it, specifically {{the lives of the}} gentry, qualitatively. Bringing Russia to an equal level with the rest of Europe intellectually was a major concern of Catherine's. For this reason she created laws that justified her rule.|$|E
25|$|Tim Cain, the producer, lead {{programmer}} {{and one of}} {{the main}} designers of the 1997 computer game Fallout, said: This book was how individual will handle thinking that he is the last survivor on Earth.

That sense: You are the only personality here on the Wasteland who is called a normal person and what do you feel like special in that way.|$|E
25|$|Money {{generated}} by the non-profit Life Extension Foundation allowed Saul Kent to finance the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, the world's largest cryonics organization. The cryonics movement had been launched in 1962 by Robert Ettinger's book, The Prospect of Immortality. In the 1960s, Saul Kent had been a co-founder of the Cryonics Society of New York. Alcor gained national prominence when baseball star Ted Williams was cryonically preserved by Alcor in 2002 and a family dispute arose as to whether Williams had <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to be cryopreserved.|$|E
