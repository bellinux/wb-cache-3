40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> an erbium-doped fiber {{amplifier}} (EDFA) and a Raman pump are utilized effectively for pumping a 0. 45 m long bismuth-based EDF (Bi-EDF) in linear-cavity L-band multi-wavelength {{fiber laser}} generation. A 7. 7 km dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) operates as both Brillouin and Raman gain media and a 6. 5 dBm fixed-power tunable laser source (TLS) amplified by an EDFA {{works as a}} Brillouin pump (BP). By inserting the Bi-EDF in the linear cavity and using the EDFA and the fixed Raman pump <b>residual</b> <b>powers</b> 13. 6 mW and 64 mW, at wavelengths 978. 8 nm and 1490. 6 nm respectively, the gain spectrum is inhomogeneously broadened so that linewidth of the gain spectrum is expanded from 3. 4 to 12. 3 nm. As a result, the number of lines of an L-band multi-wavelength fiber laser (MFL) is increased noticeably. In addition, the number of lines at a BP wavelength 1590. 6 nm decreased from 38 to 32 by using the maximum EDFA pump <b>residual</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> 44 mW due {{to a reduction in}} the quantum coefficient efficiency.

30|$|With the {{substantial}} progress in self-interference (SI) cancelation, the full-duplex (FD) technique, {{which allows the}} communication user to transmit and receive signals over the same frequency band simultaneously, enables a significant enhancement of spectral efficiency (SE) {{in comparison with the}} traditional half-duplex (HD) technique. Recently, relay-assisted device-to-device (D 2 D) communications underlaying cellular networks have aroused a great deal of research interests due to its high SE. For the new meaningful paradigm of the combination of the FD and the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay-assisted D 2 D communications, analyzing the SE and energy efficiency (EE) is crucial, which have not been investigated in the existing works. In this paper, we focus on the EE of the FD two-way (FDTW) relay-assisted D 2 D communications with uplink channel reuse by considering the residual SI at the D 2 D users and compare it with the HD counterpart. Our goal is to find the optimal transmission powers and amplification gain to maximize the system EE while guaranteeing SE requirements and maximum transmission power constraints. A new two-tier alternative iteration optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that (1) the results obtained by the proposed algorithm is very close to those obtained by the exclusive searching method, (2) smaller <b>residual</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> SI leads to better performance of EE and SE, (3) the SE obtained by FDTW relay-assisted D 2 D networks is higher than the SE obtained by the HD counterpart, and (4) the EE comparison of FDTW relay-assisted D 2 D networks and its HD counterpart depends on the <b>residual</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> SI. The EE obtained by FDTW relay-assisted D 2 D is higher than the EE obtained by HD counterpart only when the <b>residual</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> SI is sufficiently small.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Broadcast is an {{important}} operation in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Flooding, a straightforward approach, performs the broadcast. Unfortunately, flooding will not only cause problems like redundancy, contention, and collision but may lead to rapid battery exhaustion and reduce the network lifetime. Hence, how to balance remaining battery energy of mobile hosts is a critical issue for the MANETs. Our proposed power-balance broadcast algorithms take the residual battery en-ergy of hosts into consideration. Each host has a rebroadcast probability which is determined by its <b>residual</b> <b>power,</b> number <b>of</b> neighbors, and average <b>residual</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> neighbors. Therefore, the hosts with less energy will have lower probability to broadcast than those with more energy. We inhibit low energy hosts from rebroadcasting to balance the host remaining energy and extend the lifetime of the networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can balance the remaining battery energy of hosts and extend network lifetime without scanting the reachability, even in the environment of high mobility and density...|$|R

But a closer review will demonstrate that the court’s analysis, despite its overt reliance on contractual principles, is ultimately of a hybrid nature that takes on board both contractual as well as public policy concerns.
