At low-incident wave frequencies, although <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinders</b> to <b>the</b> wavelength were small, <b>the</b> oscillating <b>cylinder</b> had little influence on the flow field. <b>The</b> numerical responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> were in very good agreement with the experimental data. As <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming wave increased, the diffraction effect caused by <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> became significant, and <b>the</b> simulated responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> were slightly weaker than those <b>of</b> experiment.
