The continuous distribution of traits such as height and skin color described above, reflects the action of genes that do not manifest typical patterns of dominance and <b>recessiveness.</b> Instead the contributions of each involved locus are thought to be additive.

40|$|Complex binary traits {{result from}} an {{intricate}} network of genetic and environmental factors. To aid their genetic dissection, several generalized linear {{models have been}} described to detect interaction between genes. However, it is recognized that these models have limited genetic interpretation. To overcome this problem, the allelic penetrance approach was proposed to model the action of a dominant or a recessive allele at a single locus, and to describe two-locus independent, inhibition, and cumulative actions. Classically, a recessive inheritance requires the expression of both recessive alleles in homozygotes to obtain the phenotype (type I <b>recessiveness).</b> In previous work, <b>recessiveness</b> was defined alternatively as a situation where a recessive allele is able to express the phenotype when the dominant allele is not active (type II <b>recessiveness).</b> Both definitions of <b>recessiveness</b> are then discussed under the allelic penetrance models. Bayesian methods are applied to analyze two data sets: one regarding {{the effect of the}} haplotype [HLA-B 8, SC 01, DR 3] on the inheritance of IgD and IgG 4 immunoglobulin deficiencies in humans, and other related to two-locus action in the control of Listeria infection susceptibility in mice. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the sexual Penna ageing model {{to show that the}} {{relation}} between dominance and <b>recessiveness</b> could be a force which optimizes the genome size. While the possibility of complementation of the damaged allele by its functional counterparts (<b>recessiveness)</b> leads to the redundancy of genetic information, the dominant effect of defective genes tends to diminish the number of alleles fulfilling the same function. Playing with the fraction of dominant loci in the genome it is possible to obtain the condition where the diploid state of the genome is optimal. If the status of each bit position as dominant or recessive mutations is changed for each individual randomly and rarely, then after a long time a stationary equilibrium of many recessive and few dominant loci is established in the sexual Penna model. This effect vanishes if the same changing distribution of dominant loci applies to all individuals. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The tricolored plumage {{patterns}} {{known as}} speckled, mille fleur, porcelain, and spangled (Old English Game type) were studied {{along with the}} black and white mottled plumage pattern. Crosses between birds carrying these phenotypes showed the mo gene to be common to all of these plumage color patterns. Crosses between Speckled Sussex and Black-tailed White Japanese Bantams resulted in a new plumage color pattern in which silver replaced gold to change a tri-colored to a bicolored pattern. The <b>recessiveness</b> of the mo gene was verified by crossing birds of the wild-type plumage coloration which differed only at the mo locus. Also, a hypothesis for the gene action of mo is offered to account for the many different phenotypes produced by it...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{mutagenesis}} in many organisms {{indicate that}} the majority (over 90 %) of mutations are recessive to wild type. If <b>recessiveness</b> represents the 'default' state, what are the distinguishing features that make a minority of mutations give rise to dominant or semidominant characters? This review draws on the rapid expansion in knowledge of molecular and cellular biology to classify the molecular mechanisms of dominant mutation. The categories discussed include (1) reduced gene dosage, expression, or protein activity (haploinsufficiency); (2) increased gene dosage; (3) ectopic or temporally altered mRNA expression; (4) increased or constitutive protein activity; (5) dominant negative effects; (6) altered structural proteins; (7) toxic protein alterations; and (8) new protein functions. This provides a framework for understanding the basis of dominant genetic phenomena in humans and other organisms...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preliminary {{evidence}} indicates that variants of the C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL- 6 genes might {{be associated with the}} presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in childhood. Thus a candidate-gene association study was conducted to investigate the association of four variants of the CRP gene (1444 C/T, - 717 T/C, 1861 C/T, and 1919 A/T) and two variants of the IL- 6 gene (- 174 G/C and 597 G/A) with OSA in a cohort of European American and Greek children. Methods: The genetic risk effects were estimated based on the odds ratio (OR) of the allele contrast and the generalized odds ratio (ORG), which is a model-free approach. The mode of inheritance was assessed using the degree of dominance index. The impact of haplotypes was also examined. Results: In the American population, the allele contrast and the model-free approach produced significant ORs for the CRP 1444 C/T variant (OR, 3. 82 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 1. 91 - 7. 63] and ORG, 4. 37 [95 % CI, 1. 96 - 9. 76]), respectively, and the mode of inheritance was <b>recessiveness</b> of allele T. Significance was also shown for the CRP 1919 A/T variant (OR, 2. 45 [95 % CI, 1. 23 - 4. 85] and ORG, 2. 76 [95 % CI, 1. 26 - 6. 03]) with the mode of inheritance being nondominance of allele T. For the IL- 6 - 174 G/C variant, there was an indication of <b>recessiveness</b> of allele C. Finally, the IL- 6 - 174 C/IL- 6 597 A haplotype was associated with OSA. In the Greek population, no association was detected for any variant or haplotype. Conclusions: Genetic variation in the IL- 6 /CRP pathway was associated with increased risk for OSA in European American children and may account for the higher CRP levels in the context of pediatric OSA compared to Greek children.

40|$|This paper {{combined}} with the adaptive principle to improve the genetic algorithms (GA) and applied it to optimal design of {{the shape of the}} concrete face rock-fill dam (CFRD). Based on the improved GA, a mathematical model was established for the design optimization of CFRD.

Dam stability, stress, displacement, and stress level are used as the main condition constraints. The calculation procedures were prepared, and the GA was used to optimize the design of Jishixia CFRD.

40|$|A glyphosate-tolerant chicory callus (R 1) was {{selected}} by a stepwise procedure. It had ability to tolerate a glyphosate concentration 25 times higher than that inhibiting the wild-type callus. Tolerance {{was associated with a}} 4. 4 -fold elevated level of 5 -enol-pyruvyl-shikimate- 3 -phosphate (EPSP) synthase (EC 2. 5. 1. 19) in the selected callus compared to the wild-type. EPSP synthases from glyphosate-tolerant and sensitive calli were similarly inhibited by glyphosate. Plants regenerated from R 1 callus also had enzyme levels higher than those of sensitive plants, although the 2. 5 -fold difference was less pronounced. Callus derived from these regenerated resistant plants retained partial tolerance (18 -fold) and possessed an increased EPSP synthase specific activity (3. 3 -fold greater than the control). As the R 1 plants were self-incompatible, seeds were obtained by crossing with the wild-type; the plants of the G 1 generation were sensitive to glyphosate. The lack of inheritance of herbicide tolerance may be due to <b>recessiveness</b> or to epigenetic inheritance...|$|E
40|$|Radiation-induced {{chromosomal}} rearrangements of h+ {{have given}} rise to several Drosophila stocks that exhibit apparent position-effect inactivation; i. e., flies carrying the rearranged chromosomes heterozygously with h show varying degrees of hairiness. The numbers of hairy chaetae produce a quantifiable index of position effect. Six such "position-allele" stocks are here discussed, both as to their basic expressions and in all possible pair-wise combinations with each other. Such crosses reveal complex interactions between the respective position alleles; little evidence is seen for clear-cut dominance or <b>recessiveness.</b> The stocks appear not to conform unequivocally to classical distinctions between variegated and stable types of position effects, nor to usual dicta relating the degree of inactivity to the proximity to heterochromatin. Indeed, these stocks appear to suggest additional dimensions to several of the principles to which position effects usually subscribe. The evidence additionally suggests that the hairy locus itself is associated with a tissue-specific suppressor effect on an otherwise polygenic system that produces the chaetae associated with the hairy phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{predictions}} about the evolution of selfing depend on the genetic architecture of loci controlling selfing (monogenic vs. polygenic determination, large vs. small effect of alleles, dominance vs. <b>recessiveness),</b> and studies of such architecture are lacking. We inferred the genetic basis of mating system differences between the outbreeding Mimulus guttatus and the inbreeding M. platycalyx by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using random amplified polymorphic DNA and isozyme markers. One to three QTL were detected for each of five mating system characters, and each QTL explained 7. 6 - 28. 6 % of the phenotypic variance. Taken together, QTL accounted for up to 38 % {{of the variation in}} mating system characters, and a large proportion of variation was unaccounted for. Inferred QTL often affected more than one trait, contributing to the genetic correlation between those traits. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that quantitative variation in plant mating system characters is primarily controlled by loci with small effect...|$|E

40|$|Cycloheximide {{resistance}} (CHr) {{was shown}} to be a function expressed in differentiated plant tissues, but not in unorganized callus tissues. A variant, WCH 105, expressing CHr in the callus, as well as in regenerated plantlets, was isolated from a cell line derived from a wild carrot plant. The plantlets regenerated from WCH 105 are green, but do not produce normal, dissected leaves. Protoplasts of WCH 105 were fused with that of a cycloheximidesensitive (CHs) cell line derived from an albino, domesticated carrot. Hybrid selection was based on (1) irreversible growth inhibition of WCH 105 protoplasts by iodacetamide, and (2) restoration of green plants producing dissected leaves. ——Analysis of the CHr trait as an unselected marker in the callus cells of the somatic hybrids indicated that it behaved as a recessive. The combined recessive and resistant phenotype of this trait allowed the recovery of CHr segregants from CHs hybrids at a frequency of 10 - 4, 1000 times higher than the spontaneous frequency of CHr. The recovery of CHr somatic segregants confirmed the <b>recessiveness</b> of the CHr trait...|$|E
40|$|The use of autozygosity as {{a mapping}} {{tool in the}} search for {{autosomal}} recessive disease genes is well established. We hypothesized that autozygosity not only unmasks the <b>recessiveness</b> of disease causing variants, but can also reveal natural knockouts of genes with less obvious phenotypic consequences. To test this hypothesis, we exome sequenced 77 well phenotyped individuals born to first cousin parents in search of genes that are biallelically inactivated. Using a very conservative estimate, we show that each of these individuals carries biallelic inactivation of 22. 8 genes on average. For many of the 169 genes that appear to be biallelically inactivated, available data support involvement in modulating metabolism, immunity, perception, external appearance and other phenotypic aspects, and appear therefore to contribute to human phenotypic variation. Other genes with biallelic inactivation may contribute in yet unknown mechanisms or may be on their way to conversion into pseudogenes due to true recent dispensability. We conclude that sequencing the autozygome is an efficient way to map the contribution of genes to human phenotypic variation that goes beyond th...|$|E

40|$|Dominance, semidominance, and <b>recessiveness</b> are {{important}} modes of Mendelian inheritance. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) regulates many plant growth and developmental processes. The previously cloned semidominant GA-insensitive (GAI) genes Reduced height 1 (Rht 1) and Rht 2 in wheat (Triticum aestivum) were {{the basis of}} the Green Revolution. However, no completely dominant GAI gene has been cloned. Here, we report the molecular characterization of Rht-B 1 c, a dominant GAI allele in wheat that confers more extreme characteristics than its incompletely dominant alleles. Rht-B 1 c is caused by a terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature insertion in the DELLA domain. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that Rht-B 1 c protein fails to interact with GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID 1), thereby blocking GA responses and resulting in extreme dwarfism and pleiotropic effects. By contrast, Rht-B 1 b protein only reduces interaction with GID 1. Furthermore, we analyzed its functions using near-isogenic lines and examined its molecular mechanisms in transgenic rice. These results indicated that the affinity between GID 1 and DELLA proteins is key to regulation of the stability of DELLA proteins, and differential interactions determine dominant and semidominant gene responses to GA...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the acu-I gene {{which lead}} to {{inability}} to use acetate as sole carbon source {{have been used to}} select recessive suf gene mutations. Of five acu-I alleles tested, two, designated mu- 1 - 2 a n d ucu- 1 - 4, were suppressible. At least three dif-ferent suf genes suppressed the acu- 1 - 2 mutation and two mf genes suppressed the ucu- 1 - 4 mutation. All five sw mutations are completely allele specific and will only suppress the acu-r mutation for which they were selected. On a glucose medium, where S U ~ activity is not required for growth, presence of a su+ gene de-presses the growth rate. These two facts suggest that the sill genes act by causing translation errors.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{strategies for}} detecting linkage of recessive and partially recessive traits, using sibling pairs and inbred individuals. We {{assume that a}} genomewide search is being conducted and that locus heterogeneity of the trait is likely. For sibling pairs, we evaluate the efficiency of different statistics {{under the assumption that}} one does not know the true degree of <b>recessiveness</b> of the trait. We recommend a sibling-pair statistic that is a linear compromise between two previously suggested statistics. We also compare the power of sibling pairs to that of more distant relatives, such as cousins. For inbred individuals, we evaluate the power of offspring of different types of matings and compare them to sibling pairs. Over a broad range of trait etiologies, sibling pairs are more powerful than inbred individuals, but for traits caused by very rare alleles, particularly in the case of heterogeneity, inbred individuals can be much more powerful. The models we develop {{can also be used to}} examine specific situations other than those we look at. We present this analysis in the idealized context of a dense set of highly polymorphic markers.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the dominance and <b>recessiveness</b> of the homothallism genes, HMα/hmα and HMa/hma, for mating-type conversion, we constructed hybrids with various configurations of the homothallic genes by fusion of protoplasts prepared from haploid strains having identical mating types. Eight {{different combinations of}} the homothallic genes were tested for their function by observing the mating and sporulation abilities of the fusion products. With few exceptions, nonmating and sporogenous fusion products {{were obtained from the}} following combinations: α HO hmα HMa + α ho hmα hma, α HO hmα HMa + α ho HMα hma, α HO hmα HMa + α ho HMα HMa, a HO HMα hma + a ho hmα hma, a HO HMα hma + a ho hmα HMa and a HO HMα hma + a ho HMα HMa. All the fusion products from the α HO hmα HMa + α ho hmα HMa and a HO HMα hma + a ho HMα hma combinations showed mating types identical to those of the respective haploid strains. These results clearly support the co-dominance of the HMα/hmα and HMa/hma alleles and indicate that the hmα allele has the same function as the HMa allele and that the hma allele has the same function as the HMα allele...|$|E
40|$|Sexual conflict, {{where the}} {{reproductive}} {{interests of the}} sexes disagree, is probably widespread and often mediated by interactions between male or sperm proteins and female or egg proteins. A possible evolutionary consequence is the maintenance of polymorphism in these proteins, which might manifest itself as partial reproductive isolation between sympatric subpopulations. Here, I investigate the conditions for polymorphism maintenance {{in a family of}} mathematical models of sexual conflict over mating or fertilization frequency. The models represent a male or sperm ligand and a female or egg receptor, and they differ in whether expression of either protein is haploid or diploid. For diploid expression, the conditions imply that patterns of dominance, which involve neither overdominance nor underdominance, can determine whether polymorphism is maintained. For example, suppose ligand expression is diploid, and consider ligand alleles L 1 and L 2 in interactions with any given receptor allele; if, say, L 1 -homozygotes are fitter than L 2 -homozygotes in such interactions, then polymorphism is promoted if L 1 is at least partially dominant in such interactions but may be suppressed otherwise. Fitter-allele dominance or <b>recessiveness</b> might be characteristic of a ligand or its receptor, in which case polymorphism or monomorphism might be characteristic of the pair. ...|$|E
40|$|In plants, several {{population}} types [F 2, recombinant {{inbred lines}}, backcross inbred lines (BILs), etc. ] {{are used for}} quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. However, dissection of the trait of interest and subsequent confirmation by introgression of QTLs for breeding purposes {{has not been as}} successful as that predicted from theoretical calculations. More practical knowledge of different QTL mapping approaches is needed. In this recent study, we describe the detection and mapping of quantitative resistances to downy mildew in a set of 29 BILs of cultivated lettuce (L. sativa) containing genome segments introgressed from wild lettuce (L. saligna). Introgression regions that are associated with quantitative resistance are considered to harbor a QTL. Furthermore, we compare this with results from an already existing F 2 population derived from the same parents. We identified six QTLs in our BIL approach compared to only three in the F 2 approach, while there were two QTLs in common. We performed a simulation study based on our actual data to help us interpret them. This revealed that two newly detected QTLs in the BILs had gone unnoticed in the F 2, due to a combination of <b>recessiveness</b> of the trait and skewed segregation, causing a deficit of the wild species alleles. This study clearly illustrates the added value of extended genetic studies on two different population types (BILs and F 2) to dissect complex genetic trait...|$|E
40|$|Many binary phenotypes do {{not follow}} a {{classical}} Mendelian inheritance pattern. Interaction between genetic and environmental factors is thought {{to contribute to the}} incomplete penetrance phenomena often observed in these complex binary traits. Several two-locus models for penetrance have been proposed to aid the genetic dissection of binary traits. Such models assume linear genetic effects of both loci in different mathematical scales of penetrance, resembling the analytical framework of quantitative traits. However, changes in phenotypic scale are difficult to envisage in binary traits and limited genetic interpretation is extractable from current modeling of penetrance. To overcome this limitation, we derived an allelic penetrance approach that partitioned incomplete penetrance into the alleles controlling the phenotype and into the genetic background and environmental factors. We applied this approach to formulate dominance and <b>recessiveness</b> in a single biallelic locus and to model different genetic mechanisms for the joint action of two biallelic loci. We fit the models to data on the susceptibility of mice following infections with Listeria monocytogenes and Plasmodium berghei. These models gain in genetic interpretation, because they specify the alleles that are responsible for the genetic (inter) action and their genetic nature (dominant or recessive), and predict genotypic combinations determining the phenotype. Further, we show via computer simulations that the proposed models produce penetrance patterns not captured by traditional twolocus models. This approach provides a new analysis framework for dissecting mechanisms of interlocus joint action in binary traits using genetic crosses...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the factors}} that {{regulate}} membrane fusion resulting in polykaryocyte formationhave been investigated, using the model system of human cells infected with mutants of herpes simplex virus (HSV). One of the mutant viruses used in this study (MP) failed to produce the viral glycoprotein designated C 2 [...] a nonlethal defect that has previously been correlated with the polykaryocyte-inducing phenotype of this and other mutant strains (wild-type strains of HSV usually induce the aggregation of infected cells rather than their fusion). The other mutant virus (tsB 5), a temperature-sensitive conditional-lethal mutant, failed to produce glycoprotein B 2 at non-permissive temperature, whereas the synthesis of all other viral products appeared to be normal. We produced and isolated seven recombinants of MP and tsB 5 that expressed both of the parental alterations in glycoprotein synthesis. All of the re-combinant viruses induced the fusion of infected cells at 34 degrees (correlated with the absence of C 2 expression) but were unable to cause cell fusion at 39 degrees (correlated with the absence of C 2 and of B 2 expression), even after infection at multiplicities high enough to ensure that all cells in the cultures synthesized viral macromolecules. These results and studies on the dominance or <b>recessiveness</b> of the fusion-inducing phenotype in mixed infections provide evidence that glycoprotein B 2 plays a critical role in the promotion of cell fusion and that glycoprotein C 2 can act to suppress fusion...|$|E
40|$|Relative viabilities of {{individuals}} homozygous or randomly heterozygous for wild O chromosomes {{derived from a}} marginal (Norwegian) and a central (Greek) population of D. subobscura were obtained {{by means of a}} newly prepared marker strain. In the central and marginal populations 20. 8 and 28. 8 percent of all chromosomes proved lethal or semilethal in homozygous condition. Mean viability was higher for +/+ random heterozygotes than for +/+ homozygotes. This remained the case for the marginal, but not for the central populations, after exclusion of the detrimental chromosomes from the calculations. The variances of viabilities were higher for homozygotes than for heterozygotes, but the test crosses with chromosomes from the marginal population had generally higher variances than those with chromosomes from the central population. No correlation was found in either populations between the action of a chromosome in homozygous condition with its action in heterozygous condition. This is interpreted as complete <b>recessiveness</b> of genetic load. The results are discussed in terms of the observed reduction of the inversion polymorphism which is not paralleled by a reduction in enzyme and, as shown here, by reduction in viability variation. It is thought that the heterotic effect of inversions is due to their homeostatic action, which depends less on structural genes than on higher orders of organization due to gene interaction or regulation. Whatever the causes, it is very likely that marginal populations differ from central populations with respect to their genetic system...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of X-linked disorders in humans {{has been recognized}} for many centuries, based on lessons in religious texts and observations of specific human families (e. g., color blindness or Daltonism). Our modern concepts of Mendelian (including X-linked) inheritance originated just {{after the turn of}} the last century. Early concepts of dominance and <b>recessiveness</b> were first used in conjunction with autosomal traits, and then applied to "sex"-linked traits to distinguish X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance. The former was defined as vertical transmission in which carrier women pass the disorder to affected sons, while the latter was defined as vertical transmission in which daughters of affected males are always affected, transmitting the disorder to offspring of both sexes. However, many X-linked disorders such as adrenoleukodystrophy, fragile X syndrome, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency do not fit these rules. We reviewed the literature on 32 X-linked disorders and recorded information on penetrance and expressivity in both sexes. As expected, penetrance and an index of severity of the phenotype (defined in our Methods) were both high in males, while the severity index was low in females. Contrary to standard presentations of X-linked inheritance, penetrance was highly variable in females. Our analysis classified penetrance as high in 28 % of the disorders studied, intermediate in 31 %, and low in 40 %. The high proportion of X-linked disorders with intermediate penetrance is difficult to reconcile with standard definitions of X-linked recessive and dominant inheritance. They do not capture the extraordinarily variable expressivity of X-linked disorders or take into account the multiple mechanisms that can result in disease expression in females, which include cell autonomous expression, skewed X-inactivation, clonal expansion, and somatic mosaicism.

Through {{successive}} backcrosses, the cytoplasm {{and nuclear}} fertility restorer gene of K 98,a line of Oryza rufipogon, were introduced into Taichung 65,O. sativa, and a nuclear-substituted line, RT 98 C, was developed. This line showed {{a high degree}} of spikelet fertility, but it produced fertile and sterile plants in the cross with Taichung 65. To analyze the mode of inheritance of the fertility, crossing tests were carried out, and the following results were obtained. Pollen fertility was controlled by the interaction of the cytoplasm and the single restorer fertility gene (Rf-rf), but the function of the embryosac was not affected by the cytoplasm and restorer fertility gene. That is, all the pollen grains in the cytoplasm of Taichung 65 were normal regardless of the dominance or <b>recessiveness</b> of the restorer fertility gene they carried. On the other hand, the pollen grains carrying the Rf gene in the cytoplasm of RT 98 C were normal, while the pollen grains carrying the rf gene in this cytoplasm became sterile. The normal cytoplasm of Taichung 65 was designated as (mfc) and the sterile cytoplasm of RT 98 C as (msc). When the (msc) Rfrf plants were selfed, in all the resulting plants, spikelet fertility was restored, and no sterile plants were observed, suggesting that the pollen grains carrying the rf gene were not viable. Thus, the male sterility and fertility restoration in this line were controlled by the genotype of the gamete itself but not by that of the zygote, indicating the presence of a gametophytic control of fertility. Only in the (msc) rfrf plants spikelet fertility was not restored, while in the plants with all the other genotypes, viz. (msc) RfRf, (msc) Rfrf, (mfc) RfRf, (mfc) Rfrf and (mfc) rfrf, spikelet fertility was restored, resulting in {{a high degree of}} spikelet fertility. Although pollen grains carrying rf in (msc) degenerated regardless of the plant genotype (Rfrf or rfrf), they all stained well in a I_ 2 KI solution and showed a normal size...|$|E

The majority of reactions in the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway were first elucidated in the 1940 - 50 's. It is only in recent times that molecular mechanisms of the intermediate steps have been determined. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with mechanistic studies of two successive steps of the pathway from Rba. capsulatus. The two enzymes involved are magnesium chelatase (consisting of BchI, BchD, and BchH subunits), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:magnesium protoporphyrin IX O-methyltransferase (BchM). Their respective reaction mechanisms were analysed separately and shown how they operate in a coupled system. Also studied is the interaction between magnesium chelatase and an unclassified protein in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, BchJ. [...] Dominant inhibition of magnesium chelatase activity in vitro with BchD mutants revealed this subunit was oligomeric. Kinetic data indicated that the molar ratio of BchI:BchD was 1 : 1, while there are ~ 2 BchH subunits that interacted with each BchI-BchD complex. It was proposed that secondary catalysis of magnesium chelatase required ATPase activity of BchI for the structural reorganization of the BchI-BchD complex and BchH subunit into catalytic-ready configurations. [...] O-methyltransferase required the phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol for stability and optimal enzymatic activity. Enzyme kinetics showed the Km of Mg-proto from Rba. capsulatus O-methyltransferase was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the plant/algal enzyme, but similar to O-methyltransferase from another photosynthetic bacterium, Chlorobaculum tepidum. The reaction mechanism was random sequential which is comparable to previous studies with O-methyltransferase from Synechocystis. [...] Interactions between magnesium chelatase and BchM or BchJ were observed with magnesium chelatase assays. BchM or BchJ removed {{the product of the}} magnesium chelatase reaction, magnesium protoporphyrin IX from BchH. There was a 1 : 1 molar ratio of BchM or BchJ with BchH. BchH-BchM was the dominant interaction, so it is suggested that BchJ could play a role as a porphyrin binding protein. Mode of access: World Wide Web. x, 184 p. ill. (some col. ...|$|E
