The paper aims to explore the effectiveness and the experience of fostering actions for innovative startups in the Italian context. In particular, the study will move from the analysis of the case study about the “Start-Up Start-Hope” project in the administrative <b>region</b> <b>Abruzzo.</b> The results reveal that Start-Hope Fund has selected and actually supported both technological and traditional start-ups. In addition, the promising perspective elaborations, about the investment made, the estimated value of production and the involved human capital, attest the goodness and the effort in promoting this type of innovative ventures.

BESIDES THE EXISTING PROCESSING PRACTICIES, ALTERNATIVE SLUTIONS MIGHT BE FOUND TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME CONSTRAINTS ON THA ANIMAL WASTE PROCESSING OPTIONS HAVE ARISEN FROM RECENTLY ISSUED REGULATION. IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A WIDEReu-FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECT TITLED "CICLE PELL: INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY IN THE ANIMAL-TO-LEATHER CHAIN", THE AUTHORS HAVE EXTIMATE THE PRESENT SCENARIO OF BOVINE SLAUGHTERING BY-PRODUCT GENERATION AND TREATMENT FOR THE <b>REGION</b> <b>ABRUZZO,</b> ITALY, WITH THE AIM OF IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT SOLUTIONS. THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES THE MAIN ISSUES CONCERNING THE DATA COLLECTION AND ESTIMATION OF A LOCAL BY-PRODUCT DATA-BASIS, THE RECOGNITION OF SOME COMMON PROCESSING OPTIONS FOR SUCH WASTES AND THE INDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR ENERGY AND MATERIAL RECOVERY. FURTHERMORE, STARTING FROM THE OBSERVATION OF THE POOR EXISTING COOPERATION LEVEL IN BY-PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR THE LOCAL SLAUGHTERHOUSES, A MORE SYSTEMIC ECO-INDUSTRIAL APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ENHANCE FIRM COMPETITIVENESS AND GENERATE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM AND IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF RESIDUE...|$|E
40|$|This chapter aims to {{critically}} {{analyze the}} relevance of location for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) producing regional products (RPs) and selling them internationally by e-commerce. This type of product is quite relevant in the Italian economy, being Italy the most important {{country in the world}} for the amount of RPs (4. 120 food specialties while data on craft ones are not available) and the second for EU protected designations (19, 51 per cent of PDO, PGI and TSG). Such products have a total turnover of € 7, 6 billion, with exports of € 1, 4 billion €. With respect to opportunities offered by e-commerce to SMEs internationalization, two ideas seems to be generally accepted. Firstly, Internet and electronic transactions (Zwass, 1998) are supposed to provide SMEs and bigger companies the same access to the global markets. Secondly, it is assumed that e-commerce may reduce boundaries of distance among markets and make location not so relevant. In other words, both production and market areas- become bigger and bigger, being possible for manufacturers to produce and sell products everywhere. Moreover the paper focuses attention on business opportunities Internet offers to SMEs, especially in terms of internationalization strategies. The paper is structured in two main sections, in the first of which a series of reflections regarding the definition of RPs are presented and a short literature review on the internationalization processes of such products is conducted. In the second section, empirical findings related to manufacturers selling by e-commerce in a specific <b>region</b> (<b>Abruzzo,</b> Italy) are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: To {{forecast}} {{the effects of}} climate change on the spatial distribution of Black pine of Villetta Barrea in its natural range and to define a possible conservation strategy for the species Area of study: A rear-edge marginal population of Pinus nigra spp. nigra in Abruzzo region, central Italian Apennines Matherials and Methods: For its adaptive and genetic traits this population is considered endemic of the Italian peninsula and represents a rear-edge marginal population of nigra subspecies. The spatial distribution of the tree in the administrative <b>Region</b> (<b>Abruzzo)</b> was used to define the ecological traits while three modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, Random Forest) were used to build a Species distribution model according to two climatic scenarios. Main results: The marginal population's range was predicted to shift at higher elevations as consequence of climatic adaptation. Many zones, represented by the higher part of the mountains surrounding the study area (currently bare and inhospitable for trees), were identified as suitable in future for the species. However, {{in the case of a}} rapid climate change, this marginal population may not be able to move as fast as necessary. An in-situ adaptive management integrated with an assisted migration protocol might be considered to enforce the natural regeneration and improve the richness and variability of the genetic pool. Research highlights: Most of the genetic richness is held in small populations at the borders of natural distribution of forest species. Monitoring this MAP could be useful to understand the adaptive processes of the species and could support the future management of many other within-core populations.
