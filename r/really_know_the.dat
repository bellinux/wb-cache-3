[...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better." [...] Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said [...] "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions.

500|$|Ayola's {{first film}} {{appearance}} {{was in the}} 1993 film Great Moments in Aviation, written by Jeanette Winterson, in which she starred alongside Jonathan Pryce and John Hurt. Variety magazine's David Rooney said of her performance: [...] "In the film's most naturalistic turn, Ayola is a constant pleasure to watch. Unforced and appealing, she often succeeds in pulling the fanciful fireworks momentarily back down to Earth." [...] Ayola recalls having been daunted {{at the prospect of}} working alongside so many established names, but has deemed it to have been a [...] "wonderful experience". Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret Laughter of Women, set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth, thriller The i Inside, filmed in Sully Hospital, Cardiff, and starring Ryan Phillippe, and Sahara, filmed in Morocco whilst Ayola was pregnant with her first child, starring Penélope Cruz. Ayola says of her film career: [...] "I really like doing film [...] I've not done enough big films though to <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> difference between film and television." ...|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season. Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So I talked to the director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort of what I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, Lewis {{studied at}} the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas, before being thrown out for daring to play a boogie-woogie version of [...] "My God Is Real", and that early {{incident}} foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing [...] "the devil's music." [...] Lewis had a recorded argument with Sam Phillips during the recording session for [...] "Great Balls of Fire", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can...How can the devil save souls? [...] What are you talkin' about?" [...] he asks Phillips during one heated exchange). During the famous Million Dollar Quartet jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer Rick Bragg explains {{that part of the}} reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because [...] "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [...] raised in the Assembly of God", and Johnny and Carl didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> words … they was Baptists', [...] said, and therefore deprived." [...] He often talked to his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart, about the condition of his soul. Evangelist Swaggart and Lewis would pray together, but Lewis found it hard to alter his lifestyle. Evangelist Swaggart still often speaks with love of his cousin in his sermons, of their childhood together, and their continuing relationship. He will ask for prayers for Lewis if he is suffering illness.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia {{you get when}} you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I {{used to be a}} cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
