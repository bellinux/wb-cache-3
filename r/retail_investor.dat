25|$|Controversy also arose {{around the}} fact that retail investors were {{excluded}} from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.|$|E
