50|$|In 1904 Hansen {{published}} an important {{body of work}} where he reclassified the separate yeasts he worked with in terms of species, rather than as races or strains {{of the same species}} as he had previously done. Here Hansen classified a separate species of yeast isolated from the Carlsberg brewery as S. pastorianus, a name derived from and attributed to <b>Reess</b> 1870. This strain was admitted to the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) in 1935 as strain CBS 1538, Saccharomyces pastorianus <b>Reess</b> ex Hansen 1904. In a further publication in 1908, Hansen reclassified the original “Unterhefe Nr. I” as the new species Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and another yeast “Unterhefe Nr. II” as the new species Saccharomyces monacensis. The taxonomy was attributed to Hansen 1908 and the yeasts entered into the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures in 1947 as CBS 1513 and CBS 1503 respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Saccharomyces pastorianus is a yeast used industrially for the {{production}} of lager beer, and was named in honour of Louis Pasteur by the German Max <b>Reess</b> in 1870.

5000|$|In June 2011, The Guardian newspaper, {{calling for}} a public inquiry into the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, focused its {{criticism}} of the parent company News Corporations handling of accusations of crime within the organisation on the newspapers use of Jonathan <b>Reess</b> investigative services. <b>Reess</b> activities were described as a [...] "devastating pattern of illegal behaviour", far exceeding {{those of the other}} investigators commissioned by News Corporation, who used illicit means to target prominent figures. They included unauthorised access to computer data and bank accounts, corruption of police officers and alleged commissioning of burglaries, for information about targets at the highest level of state and government, including the royal family and the Cabinet, police chief commissioners, governors of the Bank of England and the intelligence services. The Guardian queried why the Metropolitan Police had chosen to exclude a very large quantity of Rees material from investigation by its Operation Weeting inquiry into phone hacking.|$|E
50|$|So-called bottom fermenting {{strains of}} brewing yeast were {{described}} {{as early as the}} 14th century in Nuremberg and have remained an indispensable part of both Franconian and Bavarian brewing culture in southern Germany through modern times. During the explosion of scientific mycological studies in the 19th century, the yeast responsible for producing these so-called “bottom fermentations” was finally given a taxonomical classification, Saccharomyces pastorianus, by the German Max <b>Reess</b> in 1870.|$|E
50|$|Donovan was, at first, {{the very}} {{successful}} {{author of a}} number of natural history titles, including Natural History of British Birds (1792-97), Natural History of British Insects (1792-1813), Natural History of British Fishes (1802-08) and the two-volume Descriptive Excursions through South Wales and Monmouthshire in the Year 1804, and the Four Preceding Summers (1805) and the short-lived Botanical Review, or the Beauties of Flora (London, 1789-90). He also wrote articles on conchology, entomology etc., made drawings and arranged the natural history plates in <b>Reess</b> Cyclopædia and undertook commissions for private albums of his botanical artwork.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{detailed}} evidence, the Metropolitan Police {{failed to}} pursue investigations into <b>Reess</b> corrupt {{relationship with the}} News of the World, over more than a decade. In 2006, the Metropolitan Police accepted the News of the Worlds disclaimer that the papers royal correspondent Clive Goodman, who {{had been sent to}} prison in 2007 for intercepting the voicemail of the British royal family, had been operating alone. They did not interview any other News of the World journalists or executives and did not seek a court order allowing them access to News of the World internal records.|$|E
50|$|The now-defunct synonym Saccharomyces carlsbergensis was and {{continues}} to be used in scientific literature, but is invalid, as the name Saccharomyces pastorianus (<b>Reess</b> 1870) has taxonomic precedence. The name S. carlsbergensis is typically attributed to Emil Christian Hansen from the era when he worked for the Danish brewery Carlsberg in 1883, but in actuality it was not officially described by Hansen as a distinct species until 1908, along with another synonym, Saccharomyces monacensis. The type strains of both synonyms are currently stored in yeast banks under the taxonomic name S. pastorianus.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formally}} described in 1786 by German botanist Georg Forster, {{who gave it}} the name Ophrys squamata. It was then transferred to the genus Cymbidium as Cymbidium squamatum by the Swedish botanist Olof Swartz in 1800. In 1810, Scottish botanist Robert Brown noted the similarity of Cymbidium squamatum to his newly erected genus Dipodium, but {{did not make the}} combination, thus the commonly used author citation Dipodium squamatum (G.Forst.) R.Br. is incorrect. In 1819, the English botanist James Edward Smith provided the first valid combination for Dipodium squamatum in <b>Reess</b> Cyclopædia.|$|E
50|$|Edwards {{produced}} plates at {{a prodigious}} rate: between 1787 and 1815 he produced over 1,700 watercolours for the Botanical Magazine alone. He illustrated Cynographica Britannica 1800 (an encyclopaedic compendium of dog breeds in Britain), New Botanic Garden 1805-7, New Flora Britannica 1812, and The Botanical Register 1815-19. Edwards established the latter {{under his own}} editorship in 1815 after a disagreement with John Sims, who succeeded Curtis as editor. He also provided drawings for encyclopaedias such as Pantologia and <b>Reess</b> Cyclopædia. He completed a number of parrot illustrations between 1810 and 1812 which were acquired by Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Edwards was a Fellow of the Linnean Society.|$|E
50|$|As the Britannica is {{a general}} encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with {{specialised}} encyclopaedias such as the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the Britannicas main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, <b>Reess</b> Cyclopædia and Coleridges Encyclopædia Metropolitana. In the 20th century, successful competitors included Colliers Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Americana, and the World Book Encyclopedia. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the Britannica was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia, especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. The print version of the Britannica was significantly more expensive than its competitors.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subsequent}} inquiry by the Chief Harbourmaster, Captain C J Irvine, {{established that}} the master, Captain Rees, had mistaken the mark buoy in {{the north side of}} the channel leading to Denham for the outer or westerly buoy. In the hazy prevailing weather, Captain Rees had been prevented from verifying his position by bearings from the headlands, and there was little warning of the approach of shoal waters. The Chief Harbourmaster therefore concluded that more care should have been exercised when approaching Bar Flats, and the speed of the ship reduced to [...] "slow" [...] until the vessels position had been definitely ascertained. However, in light of Captain <b>Reess</b> past good record, and in the absence of any damage to the ship, he recommended that no further action be taken.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1900s, bottom-fermenting strains of brewery yeast have been {{typically}} classified as S. carlbergensis in scientific literature, and the earlier valid name {{assigned to a}} bottom-fermenting yeast by <b>Reess</b> in 1870 was rejected without merit. This situation was rectified using DNA-DNA reallocation techniques in 1985 when Vaughan-Martini and Kurtzman returned the species name to S. pastorianus under the type strain CBS 1538 and relegated the two former species assigned by Hansen in 1908, S. carlsbergensis CBS 1513 and S. monacensis CBS 1503, {{to the status of}} synonyms. These experiments also clearly revealed the hybrid nature of the lager brewing yeast species for the first time, even though one of the parental species was incorrectly classified in retrospect. Nonetheless, over the last decades of the 20th century, debate continued in scientific literature regarding the correct taxon, with authors using both names interchangeably to describe lager yeast.|$|E
5000|$|After leaving university, Rees wrote {{first for}} the Manchester Guardian. In 1936, he became {{assistant}} editor of The Spectator, for which he travelled to Germany, Russia, Spain, and Czechoslovakia. Though a Marxist {{during most of the}} 1930s, the Hitler-Stalin Pact turned him from Communism and led him to enlist before the UK entered the war. During World War II, he joined the Royal Artillery and rose to second lieutenant in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. After the army, he resumed work at The Spectator. In 1946, he then became an administrator for H. Pontifex & Son and may have started working for MI6. <b>Reess</b> daughter confirms that he worked for MI6 then and through at least 1949: [...] "...And in the afternoons he went to 54 Broadway, next door to St. Jamess Park tube station, the offices of SIS (or MI6), where he worked for the Political Section which... assessed and evaluated information..." [...] In 1953, Rees became principal of Aberystwyth University. In 1956, a series of articles appeared in The People. They described their anonymous author as a [...] "Most intimate friend, a man in a high academic position." [...] Guy Burgess appeared in them as a corrupt man, spy, blackmailer, homosexual, and drunk. The Daily Telegraph then revealed Rees was author. The university held an enquiry into the matter (1956-1957). Despite student support, university staff did not support him. Rees resigned before the enquiry ended, thus also ending his academic career. The enquirys report was very critical of Rees. [...] Moreover, [...] "It turned out that a great many old acquaintances of Burgess and Maclean were much more horrified - felt, indeed, much more betrayed - {{by the fact that the}} late Goronwy Rees gave a version of their flight to the People than by the flight itself. When Stephen Spender showed the Daily Express a friend’s letter about Burgess, he was held to have disgraced himself." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{electric}} vehicle, {{battery is}} {{the main source of}} energy for tractive power. It is technically known as “Rechargeable Electrical Energy Storage System (<b>REESS).</b> The durability and efficiency of the <b>REESS</b> is mainly based on its charging rate, discharging rate, Depth of Discharge (DOD) and operating temperature. For a given <b>REESS</b> the charging rate, Discharging rate at conditional temperature and DOD are the main characteristics which are constant. The operating temperature of the <b>REESS</b> can be effectively controlled by optimized design of ventilation systems and enhanced energy efficient electric components. During charging and discharging, <b>REESS</b> temperature rises due to its internal resistance. Rapid charging and discharging of <b>REESS</b> leads to rise in its temperature beyond its safe operating limit. The maximum efficiency coupled with design intended life of <b>REESS</b> shall be attained when it is operated at the temperature of 100 C to 45 °C. The cell (which is the individual building block of <b>REESS)</b> temperature across the battery pack has to be maintained uniformly. Uneven cell temperatures cause improper charging and discharging and reduction in its capacity and life. The following issues are currently, 	One particular cell temperature reaches to its cut back temperature, during high speed drive. 	The overall battery pack temperature reaches its cut back temperature, after undergoing cyclic charge and discharge (drive) of the vehicle.

40|$|Three ascomycetous yeast strains, H- 6 T, ZX- 15 and ZX- 20, {{isolated}} from the bark of two tree species of the family Fagaceae collected from different regions of China, formed unconjugated and persistent asci containing two to four globose ascospores. 26 S rDNA D 1 /D 2 domain and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (including 5. 8 S rDNA) sequence analysis showed that they were {{closely related to the}} currently accepted Saccharomyces species with strong support.

40|$|There are {{relatively}} few {{reports in the}} literature focusing on negative laboratory leaders. Most of the reports focus exclusively on the simpler positive laboratory leader that is more commonly encountered in high voltage engineering [Gorin et al., 1976; Les Renardieres Group, 1977; Gallimberti, 1979; Domens et al., 1994; Bazelyan and Raizer 1998]. The physics of the long, negative leader and its positive counterpart are similar; the two differ primarily in their extension mechanisms [Bazelyan and Raizer, 1998]. Long negative sparks extend primarily by an intermittent process termed a 'step' that requires the development of secondary leader channels separated in space from the primary leader channel. Long positive sparks typically extend continuously, although, under proper conditions, their extension can be temporarily halted and begun again, and this is sometimes viewed as a stepping process. However, it is emphasized {{that the nature of}} positive leader stepping is not like that of negative leader stepping. There are several key observational studies of the propagation of long, negative-polarity laboratory sparks in air that have aided in the understanding of the stepping mechanisms exhibited by such sparks [e. g., Gorin et al., 1976; Les Renardieres Group, 1981; Ortega et al., 1994; <b>Reess</b> et al., 1995; Bazelyan and Raizer, 1998; Gallimberti et al., 2002]. These reports are reviewed below in Section 2, with emphasis placed on the stepping mechanism (the space stem, pilot, and space leader). Then, in Section 3, reports pertaining to modeling of long negative leaders are summarized...|$|E
