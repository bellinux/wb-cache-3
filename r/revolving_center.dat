50|$|A <b>revolving</b> <b>center,</b> {{also known}} as a live center in some countries, is {{constructed}} so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|E

5000|$|Spin: each {{particle}} {{in quantum}} field theory has a particular spin s, which is an internal angular momentum. Classically, the particle rotates in a fixed frequency, but this cannot be understood if particles are point-like. In string theory, spin is understood by {{the rotation of the}} string; For example, a photon with well-defined spin components (i.e. in circular polarization) looks like a tiny straight line <b>revolving</b> around its <b>center.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{gear bearing}} {{is a type}} of rolling-element bearing similar to an {{epicyclic}} gear. Gear bearings consist of a number of smaller 'satellite' gears which <b>revolve</b> around the <b>center</b> of the bearing along a track on the outsides of the internal and satellite gears, and {{on the inside of the}} external gear. Each gear is in between two concentric rings. Therefore, the widths of the satellite gears must all be the same.|$|R

Upgrading Gem chances set opportunities of getting higher tier Gems easier, but may hinder {{the ability to get}} special combinations. The highest quality Gems are not a logical choice when lower tier alternatives are needed to make special Gems.|$|R

50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear <b>revolves</b> around the <b>center</b> of the other. A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear, around the other, called the sun gear. The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun gear is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the sun gear.|$|R

50|$|Many {{autosamplers}} {{for liquids}} {{consist of a}} carousel and the sampling apparatus. The carousel holds the samples, and <b>revolves</b> around its <b>center</b> so that samples change their horizontal position. There may be several concentric rings holding samples in a carousel. The sampling apparatus can be fixed horizontally, only {{moving up and down}} to allow the carousel to move, or it can also move horizontally, depending on the design of the system. The sampling apparatus in most of such autosamplers consist of a needle connected to a remote pumping syringe via tubing. Similar designs have been employed for titrators, which do not have a sampling apparatus, but a titration apparatus.|$|R
50|$|Revolving FP {{shutters}} produce {{images with}} unusual distortion where the image center seems to bulge toward the viewer, while the periphery appears to curve away, because the lens's {{field of view}} changes as it swivels. This distortion will disappear if the photograph is mounted on a circularly curved support and viewed with the eye at the <b>center.</b> <b>Revolving</b> shutters must also rotate smoothly; otherwise uneven exposure will result in ugly vertical banding in the image. Since the rotation may take several seconds to complete, no matter the shutter speed, the camera should be tripod mounted. For the same reason, flash cannot be used with these cameras.|$|R
5000|$|Assume {{that the}} wave {{generator}} is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh <b>revolve</b> around the <b>center</b> point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|In Philolaus's system, {{the earth}} did not rotate.

[...] A flat Earth facing away from the Central Fire would be consistent with the pre-gravity concept that if all things must fall towards the center of the universe, this force would allow the earth to <b>revolve</b> around the <b>center</b> without spilling everything on the surface into space.

In his {{roundabout}} chapter on Cycles and Epicycles, with Notes on the Ecliptic, he thus discourseth:--'All things <b>revolve</b> upon some <b>center,</b> to them, fixed; for the centripetal is ever {{too much for the}} centrifugal. Wherefore, it is a perpetual cycling with us, without progression; and we fly round, whether we will or no. To stop, were to sink into space. So, over and over we go, and round and round; double- shuffle, on our axis, and round the sun.' In an another place, he says:--'There is neither apogee nor perigee, north nor south, right nor left; what to-night is our zenith, to-morrow is our nadir; stand as we will, we stand on our heads; essay to spring into the air, and down we come; here we stick; our very bones make glue.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... § 7 Doppler {{argues that}} his theory applies mainly to binary stars. In his opinion the fixed stars are {{immobile}} and white. In a binary star high speeds could be possible due to orbital motion, and binaries {{appear to be}} colourful. Doppler divides the binaries in two groups: (1) binary stars of unequal brightness; and (2) binary stars of equal brightness. His interpretation is: in case (1) the brighter star is the heavier one, the weaker star revolves around him; in case (2) both stars <b>revolve</b> around a <b>center</b> of mass in the middle, or around a dark third star. In case (2) the colours are usually complementary. Doppler rules out that the rich complementary colours of binaries are contrast illusions, because an astronomer said he had observed that covering one star {{does not change the}} colour impression of the other star. Doppler claims that his theory is supported by the fact that for many binary stars the colour indication in Struve's catalogue is different from that in Herschel's older catalogue, attributing the difference to progress of the orbital motion.|$|R
40|$|The (planar) ERTBP {{describes}} {{the motion of}} a massless particle (a comet) under the gravitational field of two massive bodies (the primaries, say the Sun and Jupiter) <b>revolving</b> around their <b>center</b> of mass on elliptic orbits with some positive eccentricity. The aim {{of this paper is}} to show that there exist trajectories of motion such that their angular momentum performs arbitrary excursions in a large region. In particular, there exist diffusive trajectories, that is, with a large variation of angular momentum. The framework for proving this result consists on considering the motion close to the parabolic orbits of the Kepler problem between the comet and the Sun that takes place when the mass of Jupiter is zero. In other words, studying the so-called infinity manifold. Close to this manifold, it is possible to define a scattering map, which contains the map structure of the homoclinic trajectories to it. Since the inner dynamics inside the infinity manifold is trivial, two different scattering maps are used. The combination of these two scattering maps permits the design of the desired diffusive pseudo-orbits, which eventually give rise to true trajectories of the system with the help of shadowing techniques...|$|R
40|$|As {{an example}} of deconstructivist architecture, Peter Eisenman’s Wexner <b>Center</b> <b>revolves</b> around a {{particularly}} nuanced question of meaning. Specifically, the building’s significance is not static but lies in an ever-changing discussion {{of what it is}} and how it acts. While the theoretical background supporting this interpretation must be understood and appreciated, I contest that a complete study of the complex should consider also how its inhabitants affect it and are affected by it. Blueprints and articles should be only first steps after which the living building and its effects are observed and assessed. This paper combines traditional analyses of the Wexner (e. g. formal, symbolic, textual) with an “experiential analysis” derived from two visits in which I photographed the site and interviewed its daily users. The product of these analyses is a critique of the Wexner Center as it functions today rather than a description of how Eisenman assumed it would operate when he designed it. Reconfiguring the Wexner as an architectural ecosystem, I address a number of wider concerns, including how successful it is as a public building and whether Eisenman builds what he professes in his written work.

50|$|During {{this time}} Powell was invited by Jerry Dale McFadden (keyboardist for The Mavericks and Sixpence None the Richer to sing backup vocals on a jam session {{recorded}} {{with some other}} Nashville friends. The group included a <b>revolving</b> membership but <b>centered</b> on McFadden and Robert Reynolds (bassist for the Mavericks). After releasing a 45rpm single on Diesel Only Records, the band began to play some gigs around Nashville. At that point Powell, McFadden, Reynolds, Ken Coomer (drummer for Wilco), and Tom Petersson started playing under the name Swag. Over {{the next few years}} Swag wrote and recorded whenever everyone was in town. Petersson had moved from Nashville, however, and played a lesser role. Brad Jones and Warren Pash took on the main bass duties in the studio and live, respectively. Jones also produced the full-length album Catch-all, released by Yep Roc in 2001. Legal issues caused the first pressing to be recalled and re-released with Todd Rundgren replacing the few parts recorded by Tom Petersson. Swag appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on April 20, 2001. Powell left Swag after suffering a vocal chord injury that required surgery and left him unable to tour. While recuperating in 2001, Japanese label Wizzard in Vinyl released an EP of songs called Venus Di Milo's Arms, featuring darker, more aggressive songs than his previous work.|$|R
40|$|The {{restricted}} planar elliptic three body problem (RPETBP) {{describes the}} motion of a massless particle (a comet) under the gravitational field of two massive bodies (the primaries, say the Sun and Jupiter) <b>revolving</b> around their <b>center</b> of mass on elliptic orbits with some positive eccentricity. The aim {{of this paper is}} to show the existence of orbits whose angular momentum performs arbitrary excursions in a large region. In particular, there exist diffusive orbits, that is, with a large variation of angular momentum. The leading idea of the proof consists in analysing parabolic motions of the comet. By a well-known result of McGehee, the union of future (resp. past) parabolic orbits is an analytic manifold. In a properly chosen coordinate system these manifolds are stable (resp. unstable) manifolds of a manifold at infinity P_∞, which we call manifold at parabolic infinity. On this manifold, it is possible to define two scattering maps, which contain the map structure of the homoclinic trajectories to it, i. e. orbits parabolic both in the future and the past. Since the inner dynamics inside P_∞ is trivial, two different scattering maps are used. The combination of these two scattering maps permits the design of the desired diffusive pseudo-orbits. Using shadowing techniques and these pseudo orbits we show the existence of true trajectories of the RPETBP whose angular momentum varies in any predetermined fashion...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} {{case study of}} four smart schools’ teachers using purposive sampling. The study unveils the implementation of smart teaching and learning strategies in pre-writing activities in Bahasa Melayu (Malay Language). Pre-writing activities include reading, free writing, brainstorming, mind mapping, and listening. These activities <b>revolve</b> around student <b>centered</b> learning, thoughtful learning, group work, and also media {{in the implementation of}} teaching and learning. There is Integration of Learning Theories based on Brain Based Learning Theory in the prewriting activities. Qualitative data are derived from triangulation of data from non-participant observation, interviews, document analysis as well as vignette and concept maps. Validity is documented through six segments: triangulation from multisources, experts’ review, long-term observation, peer checking, investigator’s position, and collaborative ties with participants. Reliability is determined by the researcher, who uses triangulation and an audit trail. The key findings of the study are as follows: First, prewriting activities include brainstorming activities and mind mapping, reading and interpreting data from print and electronic media. The ability to convey information helps to develop critical thinking. Second, the efforts of smart teachers strengthen learning and teaching which inculcate analytical and critical skills to solve problems. Third, a cyclical model is created from the interviews and observations made during the prewriting activities. Efforts to make smart teaching and learning a success require teachers as well as students to think creatively. Fourth, smart characteristics are related to the integration of brain-based learning theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Worm cam {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} indexing mechanism which is widely used in automatic machinery. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the mechanism has high demands on the cylinder cam. The machining methods of cylinder cam are unique and the methods of special machine tool and NC machining are the two methods that general adopted in the machining of it. In this paper, the method of CNC Programming which is used for machining cylinder cam in 5 -axeses high speed DMU 70 eVolution Machining Center is introduced. The machining principle of cylinder cam has been studied, and the mathematical model for CNC Programming has also been worked out. The automated compensation of cutting tool’s radius is used in this field for the first time. Worm {{cam mechanism}} Cylinder cam mechanism is widely used in automatic machinery. Fig. 1 shows one kind of cylinder cam mechanism. When the camshaft rotates, the groove and the convex ridge in the cam make the rollers <b>revolve</b> round the <b>center</b> of the indexing plate, so the cyclical movement of indexing plate is realized. This mechanism is mainly used in the occasions of more indexing workstations, larger load and lower speed. The speed and acceleration rules of its cam follower can be chosen according to the predetermined motion demands, and then realize the precise transmission. Because of its high transmission precision requirements, the special and complex shape, the machining methods of this mechanism are unique. The common machining methods of worm cam have the following two: The method of special machine tool: Because the indexing curves of cam have a high transmission precision requirement and complex shape, and also, they are space curved face, so we {{could take advantage of}} copying machine to machine the cam curves by model or use the special machine tool to machine them...|$|R
5000|$|Although a {{substantial}} number of the faculty organized in opposition to President Pusey's actions, Cox found himself aligned with the administration and assigned various tasks to enforce order including becoming the university's prosecutor against students before the disciplinary body called the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities. In the fall of 1969 student protests began to <b>revolve</b> around the <b>Center</b> for International Affairs for its connection to American defense interests and its co-founder (with Henry Kissinger) Robert Bowie (for whom Cox's daughter Sally worked). Pusey asked Cox to head a committee (made up of faculty with military or law enforcement backgrounds) to deal with student disturbances. Through this committee Cox became the university's troubleshooter on student unrest. Cox was thus forced to make improvised decisions on when to evacuate buildings as a result of bomb threats, how to handle students mobs and when to use the police. During the period through 1972 when disturbances gradually ceased, Cox saw one commencement interrupted by protests, one bombing of the Center for International Affairs (injuring no one), one old building burned (in which a fireman was uninjured, for which Cox and the university were sued). Cox received national attention for his role in one incident. On March 26, 1971 a [...] "counter teach-in" [...] was organized by conservative students to feature pro-war speaker. Anti-war demonstrators arrived to drown out the speeches. Cox took the microphone to appeal for tolerance and to note the virtues of free speech, but at the end left with the speakers through an underground passage after telling the demonstrators of the [...] "disciplinary action that will surely follow." [...] When he testified at the hearing he admitted that it was [...] "self-deception" [...] to think he could quiet the crowd. He nevertheless was lauded for the attempt by conservatives. John P. Roche's nationally syndicated column, comparing the demonstrators to Nazis, called his attempt [...] "noble." [...] Chief Justice Warren E. Burger also told Cox's biographer {{that was one of the}} most memorable defenses of freedom of speech in [...] "modern times." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator, a flexspline, and a circular spline. More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The wave generator {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a wave generator plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flexspline and the circular spline. Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh <b>revolve</b> around the <b>center</b> point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 − 202)/200 = −0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|R
