5|$|Sharon {{planned for}} Raviv's brigade to {{attack from the}} east, {{diverting}} Egyptian attention away from Deversoir. Erez was tasked with transporting a pre-constructed roller bridge to the crossing area at Deversoir, while one of his tank battalions would {{be attached to the}} paratroopers. Colonel Reshef was given the most critical tasks of all. Accordingly, his brigade was heavily reinforced to incorporate four armored and three mechanized infantry battalions, in addition to the division's reconnaissance battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yaov Brom. His brigade would conduct a turning maneuver at 6:00 AM on October 15 south of Akavish Road, move through the sand dunes to reach Fort Lakekan, before heading north to occupy Fort Matzmed. Reshef's brigade would then split up to clear the Akavish and Titur Roads and seize the Chinese Farm, while occupying the crossing area and awaiting Matt's brigade. Matt's paratrooper brigade, containing an additional tank company and the armored battalion, would move south-west via Akavish to reach Fort Matzmed. From there, it would continue on to the Yard and cross the canal at 11:00 PM, using <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and rafts for the tanks.|$|E
25|$|Despite the delays, the Israeli advance {{along the}} coastal road {{continued}} steadily. This advance {{was supported by}} heavy air attacks against PLO positions that included the use of cluster bombs. Israeli missile boats also employed 76mm cannons to destroy targets along the coast, firing 3,500 shells during ten days of fighting. Israeli armor continued to advance towards Sidon, while other Israeli infantry attacked the three Palestinian refugee camps {{in the area that}} were used as PLO bases: Rashidiya, Burj ash-Shamali, and al-Bass. The camps were all criscrossed with networks of bunkers, trenches, and firing positions. The Israelis took each camp section by section using the same method: warnings were blared by loudspeaker urging civilians to leave, before air and artillery bombardment commenced, followed by an infantry assault. Israeli infantry had to engage in fierce urban combat in narrow streets. The PLO defenders put up strong resistance and sometimes used civilians as human shields. It took four days of combat to secure Rashidiya and three days to secure the other three camps. At the same time, an Israeli amphibious operation was conducted north of Sidon, beginning with a diversionary bombardment of targets away from the landing zone by missile boats and aircraft. Two groups of commandos from the Shayetet 13 naval commando unit then came ashore to probe enemy defenses and secure the landing site, one which swam to the mouth of the Awali River and another which came ashore on the landing beach in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies.</b> After a brief gunbattle with armed Palestinians, the main landings began, with paratroopers coming ashore in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> to establish a beachhead followed by three landing craft that unloaded troops and armor. Over the following days, the three landing ships would run between Israel and Lebanon, shuttling more troops and armor onto the beachhead. The PLO response was limited to ineffective mortar fire, while Israeli missile boats and aircraft attacked Palestinian positions in response, and in total, about 2,400 soldiers and 400 tanks and armored personnel carriers were landed. From the beach, these forces advanced on Sidon, supported by naval gunfire from missile boats. At the same time, Israeli forces in the central sector advanced towards Jezzine while those in the eastern sector remained in place, but began setting up heavy artillery positions that put Syrian SAM units in artillery range.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Hewson {{participated in}} Greenpeace {{protests against the}} Sellafield plant for nuclear reprocessing, located across the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. She was {{especially}} set against the under-construction Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant component being opened. She was aboard Greenpeace's MV Solo when it staged a publicity-oriented [...] "raid" [...] wherein the band members landed {{on the beach at}} the plant in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies,</b> but she said she had not been responsible for that particular protest.|$|E
5000|$|Huai Mae Lamao (ห้วยแม่ละเมา) This large creek {{is in an}} unspoiled forest, {{offering}} whitewater rafting on <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Later other {{equipment}} was procured including a hydrographic winch, <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy,</b> portable echosounder, laboratory glassware, and specimen jars.|$|R
50|$|The {{airborne}} lifeboat {{was developed}} to provide downed airmen with a more navigable and seaworthy vessel that could be sailed greater distances than the <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> One of the reasons necessitating this was that when ditching or abandoning an aircraft near enemy-held territory, often the tides and winds would propel the <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> toward shore, {{despite the efforts of}} the occupants to paddle away, resulting in their eventual capture.|$|R
500|$|On 19 June 1992, {{during the}} European indoor leg, U2 played the [...] "Stop Sellafield" [...] concert in Manchester, {{alongside}} Kraftwerk, Public Enemy, and Big Audio Dynamite II, {{to protest the}} operation of a second nuclear reactor at Sellafield. For the group's performance, the stage was made to resemble their Zoo TV stage. The following day, the band participated in a demonstration organised by Greenpeace in which protesters landed {{on the beach at}} Sellafield in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and displayed 700 placards for the waiting media.|$|E
2500|$|Albania signed {{its first}} Readmission Agreement with Italy on 18 November 1997. In August 2002, {{after making a}} show of burning some {{inflatable}} boats used for people smuggling in the mole of Radhima, the Albanian Prime minister Fatos Nano declared that [...] "… we are burning the past and piracy from our coasts. There's no more <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and traffickers on {{the waters of the}} Republic of Albania." [...] Despite the political reforms and successes of the Albanian government in its efforts to stop illegal emigration, in early 2004 this phenomenon still existed, as evidenced by the Karaburun deaths on 9 January. [...] It was not until some {{six and a half years}} later, on 8 November 2010, that the Council of the European Union approved visa-free travel into the Schengen Area for Albanian citizens.|$|E
2500|$|Instead, the six aircrew lashed {{three of}} their own {{inflatable}} <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> together and abandoned the aircraft in ten-foot (3 m) swells. Another Warwick dropped another Fox airborne lifeboat some distance away, but its parachute didn't open and it was destroyed upon striking the water. An SB-17 flying in the , [...] breeze dropped its load—Higgins Airborne Lifeboat No. 25—from an altitude of [...] to land about [...] from the men. As it hit the water, one of the lifeboat's tethering rocket lines snaked out over the junction {{of two of the}} dinghies, making an ideal shot. The six airmen transferred to the Higgins lifeboat where they huddled down and waited for three days in the worst North Sea storm of 1945 before two more Fox airborne boats were dropped with gasoline and supplies on April 3, the lifeboats either swamping or breaking up upon hitting the water. On April 4 in continuing rough seas, the airmen were picked up by two Rescue Motor Launch (RML) boats, and the Higgins A-1 lifeboat, unable to be towed, was intentionally sunk by gunfire.|$|E

50|$|Two {{men in a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> {{had brought}} it over from an oceangoing vessel called the Pong Su. In the process of meeting their three-man shore party, the dinghy capsized {{and one of the}} men drowned.|$|R
50|$|Also {{causing a}} stir was the Investorenbejubeln (Investors' Celebration), a {{demonstration}} {{on the river}} Spree in which protestors used <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and paddle boats to follow a boat-cruise of Mediaspree investors, which was then broken off prematurely.|$|E
50|$|Dabur-class boats first battle engagements {{were made}} in the October 1973 Yom Kippur War. During the war, two Dabur boats {{attacked}} an Egyptian commando force in its own port at Marse Telemat and destroyed speed boats and <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> just as they were preparing for attacks on Israeli targets in the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 10 May, 12 Heinkel He 59 {{seaplanes}} landed on the Nieuwe Maas. <b>Rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> were launched. Each could carry six soldiers and their equipment; about 80 German soldiers landed on both banks of the river and an island. The Germans quickly seized some of the bridges, which were not guarded. The only resistance they met was from some Dutch policemen.|$|E
50|$|Late that year, {{the first}} two {{prototype}} 550 HP engines were installed in a new 58 ft sport <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> In close collaboration with Pete Hledin of Douglas Marine (the parent company of Skater) and Bob Morgan of Big Thunder Marine, the Ilmor V10's underwent extensive durability testing {{and the results were}} encouraging.|$|R
50|$|After he {{declares}} {{that he will}} attempt to destroy any Soviet survivors that he may eventually find, he sets the original experiment candidates loose on a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy,</b> claiming that he will let them go to another island. As they float away in the ocean, Geragty has them machine-gunned in the water, destroying all dissent in his new society.|$|R
50|$|Worse was to come. On {{the night}} of 15 May three men in a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> started a fire on the Mebo II which damaged the stern. RNI {{broadcast}} mayday calls. All on board were rescued and the fire was extinguished. The studios and transmitters were undamaged and RNI went {{back on the air}} the following morning.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of October 15, 750 of Colonel Matt's paratroopers crossed the canal in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies.</b> They were soon joined by tanks ferried on {{motorized}} rafts and additional infantry. The force encountered no resistance initially and fanned out in raiding parties, attacking supply convoys, SAM sites, logistic centers and anything of military value, with priority given to the SAMs. Attacks on SAM sites punched {{a hole in the}} Egyptian anti-aircraft screen and enabled the Israeli Air Force to strike Egyptian ground targets more aggressively.|$|E

50|$|The plane {{comes down}} near an island. The {{navigator}} {{has been killed}} by toxic gas produced when {{the wrong kind of}} extinguisher is used on an electrical fire aboard the plane but the others make it to land in two <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies.</b> Just offshore a fleet of derelict ships is anchored. On the island are two concrete bunkers. In one, a number of goats are tethered. The other, which is lead-lined, contains cameras and measuring instruments. The cameras are trained on a device standing on a smaller island some distance away.|$|E
500|$|Among the [...] "special" [...] {{equipment}} of the Ju 87 C was a two-seat <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> with signal {{ammunition and}} emergency ammunition. A quick fuel dump mechanism and two inflatable 750L (200US gal) bags in each wing and a further two 500L (130US gal) {{bags in the}} fuselage enabled the Ju 87 C to remain afloat {{for up to three}} days in calm seas.|$|R
50|$|MOAS {{organised}} {{its first}} migrant rescue on August 30 when it assisted {{a group of}} 250 Syrians and Palestinians, including 40 children. On the same day, the Phoenix also assisted some 96 Sub-Saharan migrants from a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> who were transferred onto a merchant ship. On September 8, the Phoenix conducted two rescues involving almost 700 migrants, including 83 women and children. A two-day old infant was among the people saved.|$|R
50|$|The {{lifeboat}} {{was launched}} to {{service on the}} 21 October to a ditched British bomber close to Blakeney Point. The lifeboat came upon a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> with all five of the crew, very tired and wet but all unharmed. The relieved aircrew were given chocolate and brandy from the lifeboat's emergency rations and were taken back {{to the safety of}} Sheringham where they were given warm clothes following warm baths.|$|R
50|$|Heavy rain {{started at}} around 5 p.m. local time (2000 UTC) on Monday 5 April in Rio de Janeiro city, and {{continued}} for 24 hours, {{with a total}} of 28.8 cm (11½ in.) of rain falling, more than was predicted for the whole of April and the heaviest rainfall for thirty years. The Brazilian TV station Globo said the rainfall was equivalent to 300,000 Olympic swimming pools of water. There were drivers who were forced to sleep in their cars. There were also firemen who used <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> to rescue passengers from stranded buses, and shopkeepers who worked very quickly to prevent the rainfall from destroying their businesses.|$|E
50|$|U-1277 {{is unusual}} in {{so much that it}} either did not receive Dönitz’s {{surrender}} order on 8 May 1945, or chose to ignore it. What is known is that she continued her patrol in the North Atlantic for a further month, her crew finally scuttling her on 3 June 1945 off the northern coast of Portugal. All 47 crew disembarked safely from their sinking boat in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and made their way ashore, landing on the beach at Angeiras, Portugal. There they were interned by the Portuguese authorities, and handed over to a British warship a few days later. The crew were not released from a POW camp until 1947.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were prepared}} {{with a number}} of modifications from standard specification. Hulls and wingtip floats were finished with white enamel and larger engine radiators, oil tanks and top-plane fuel tanks were fitted. In addition, there were internal changes to provide more space and support facilities for the crew, who had to live on board for periods during the trip. Metal, instead of wooden, airscrews were fitted to the aircraft during the flight. [...] Specially designed collapsible <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> were also carried. No automatic pilots or blind flying aids were fitted, and only two of the four aircraft had radio sets - communication between aircraft in the air being by lamp or hand-signals.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{difficult}} places, in terms of logistics, was the Sudan, where the crew had to be flown in — despite there being no runways or indeed roads. Conversely, {{areas such as the}} Himalayas permitted no transportation at all, so the only option was to walk. In South America, a shortage of boats led to one cameraman having to push his equipment in a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy,</b> while he himself swam behind it.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1941 two Norwegians, John [...] "Helge" [...] Moe (Mutt) and Tor Glad (Jeff) fetched up on {{a remote}} Aberdeenshire beach in Scotland, having {{travelled}} by seaplane and <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> They immediately turned themselves in to the local police as German spies. MI5 soon 'turned' them, assigning them their codenames, which were the names {{of a pair of}} cartoon strip characters (see Mutt and Jeff). 'Mutt and Jeff' is also rhyming slang for 'deaf'.|$|R
50|$|The {{best time}} for the mission was {{projected}} to be between 15 and 25 September 1941. Vessenmayer had consulted with Oberstleutnant von Harlinghausen of the Luftwaffe and decided that the Heinkel He 59 seaplane was to be used. The seaplane would cut its engine on descent and glide in {{to land on the}} lake. The personnel would make landfall via a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy,</b> and carry folding bicycles for transport. The Brandon Bay area in County Kerry was decided to be the best location.|$|R
5000|$|BBC war {{correspondent}} Robert Barr {{described the}} scene as paratroopers prepared to board their aircraft: Their faces were darkened with cocoa; sheathed knives were strapped to their ankles; tommy guns strapped to their waists; bandoliers and hand grenades, coils of rope, pick handles, spades, <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> hung around them, and a few personal oddments, like the lad who was taking a newspaper to read on the plane ... There was an easy familiar touch {{about the way they}} were getting ready, as though they had done it often before. Well, yes, they had kitted up and climbed aboard often just like this - twenty, thirty, forty times some of them, but it had never been quite like this before. This was the first combat jump for every one of them.|$|E
5000|$|Following the war Dagnall founded his own company, {{which has}} since become famous for {{pneumatic}} dinghies and barrage balloons. The RFD name is now synonymous with [...] "Rapid Floatation Device" [...] and the supply of marine and aviation safety equipment. He had researched flotation gear of various sorts, and in 1918 he built {{some of the earliest}} <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies.</b> RFD moved to Guildford in 1926 and expanded to Catteshall Lane, Godalming, in 1936 the Godalming factory burnt down and was rebuilt in 1954. In 1959 RFD merged with Perseverance Mill. In 1963 it took over Elliot Equipment and acquired GQ Parachute Company Ltd. It purchased Mills Equipment Company in 1968. In 1970 the three companies merged to form RFD-GQ In 1975 RFD-GQ divided into: - RFD Inflatables Ltd - GQ Parachutes Ltd - RFD Systems Engineering Ltd - RFD Mills Equipment Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 March 1945, Platypus 1 (also {{known as}} Project “Robin”) was carried out, using Hoehn folboats (collapsible canoes) and {{inflatable}} <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> {{that had been}} lashed {{to the side of}} the submarine USS Perch. Four members of Z Force, in two of the folboats, which had been fitted with outboard motors, travelled to shore 55 km north of Balikpapan. As one of the motors failed to start, both crews resorted to paddling. One folboat, crewed by Sergeants Bruce Dooland (Australian Army) and Bill Horrocks (New Zealand Army), managed to reach the shore. The other folboat, carrying the mission commander, Major D. J. (Don) Stott and his deputy, Captain Leslie McMillan, both New Zealanders, capsized; both men were reported missing, presumed drowned. At other planned landing sites, Japanese patrols were encountered and no further landings took place that night.|$|E
5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Long {{released}} another LP, {{this time}} not entirely Australian folk songs, Songs of the Sea. This album {{was dedicated to}} Long's early memories of {{fishing off the coast}} of New South Wales near Port Macquarie and his boyhood adventure of trying to sail from Sydney to Newcastle (130 km) in a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> at the age of 10. Long was a keen sailor, having owned boats and spent much time sailing and fishing with friends, many of whom were famous recording artists in their own right.|$|R
50|$|River rafting {{or white}} water rafting, {{as it is}} also called, is swiftly making Bilaspur a focus for this scintillating sport. For a torrent of {{adrenaline}} to gush through every vein and surge cover every muscle, one can race over the rapids of river - Sutlej, right from Rampur to Bilaspur through serpentine path in deep gorges, placid mountains, green alpine meadows and thick forests, all forming an immense spectrum. Non swimmers and novice can also have this thrilling experience in an inflatable <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy,</b> {{on some of the}} gentler rapids.|$|R
