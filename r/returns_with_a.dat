5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E

5|$|In the 2009 preseason, Munnerlyn was {{competing}} with wide receiver Ryne Robinson for the punt returner job. In the Panthers second preseason {{game against the}} Miami Dolphins, Munnerlyn returned a punt 58yards and also fumbled one but recovered it, while Robinson fumbled a punt which the Dolphins recovered. He eventually won the punt return job {{as well as the}} primary nickel cornerback spot beating out C. J. Wilson and Sherrod Martin (who was drafted 157 picks before Munnerlyn) by the end of September. On November 29, Munnerlyn suffered a concussion against the New York Jets but said days later that he planned on playing in the next game despite the NFL's changing of the concussion policy. Munnerlyn did not play the following week's game against the Buccaneers as he was inactive but returned the next week to play against the 8-5 New England Patriots; in the game, he recovered a fumble by running back Sammy Morris. In a Week 16 game at the New York Giants, he forced a fumble by quarterback Eli Manning on the last play of the first half. Munnerlyn completed his first season as a Panther playing in 15 games total with four starts, posting 43 tackles, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery and two passes defensed as the Panthers defense finished fourth in the NFL in pass defense, eighth in total defense and ninth in scoring defense and recorded 18 takeaways in the final six games of the season. The Panthers ended up finishing 3rd in the NFC South with 8 wins and 8 losses. On special teams, Munnerlyn also averaged 9.0 yards on 31 punt <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long of 37 yards, returned one kickoff for 15 yards and was credited with four special teams tackles.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn {{played in}} 16 games with 11 starts for Carolina in the 2012 season. He {{tied for the}} team lead with two interceptions and tied the team record for interceptions {{returned}} for scores in a season as he returned both interception for touchdowns, a record that was previously accomplished by Eric Davis in 1998 and Mike Minter in 2003. He produced more tackles than the previous season with 61 tackles. He also batted down six passes and was credited with two quarterback pressures, contributing to a unit that ranked 10th in the NFL in total defense. He started 11 of the last 12 games at left cornerback after Chris Gamble suffered a season-ending injury in Week 7. As a punt returner, he averaged 5.1 yards on a team-high 14 punt <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long of 20 yards. In Week 5 against the Seattle Seahawks, he intercepted a pass by quarterback Russell Wilson and returned it 33 yards for a touchdown. In Week 10 at the Denver Broncos, he matched a career-high in tackles with seven. In Week 11, he picked off a pass by Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman and returned it 74 yards for a touchdown, his second of the year. In {{the final game of}} the season at New Orleans Saints, he equaled his previous career-high of seven tackles.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he always does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E

25|$|The {{series is}} set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural history since its {{settlement}} of migrants from New England in the late 19th century. It follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident, as she {{falls in love with a}} 162-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley). Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) <b>returns,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan to bring back their past lover Katherine Pierce, a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. Although Damon is initially the villain and harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine. The brothers' history and the town's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.|$|E
25|$|Malick is {{introduced}} {{on the verge}} of being fired from Holby City Hospital, after assaulting his boss on the Day Care Surgical ward. He explains to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that it was necessary to save a patient: resuscitation had been abandoned, but after forcefully taking control of the situation, Malick was able to revive them. On the proviso that he attends anger management counselling, Hanssen gives Malick a final chance and attaches him to the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU). There, he soon clashes with the unit's staff: consultant Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), Foundation doctor Penny Valentine (Emma Catherwood), and ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). Relations begin to improve when Malick is left in charge of the unit for the day. Although he initially dismisses Penny's diagnoses and advice, ultimately he is forced to call on Michael for help and realises that she was right all along. He also becomes Frieda's mentor when she is accepted onto the Foundation programme. A racist patient makes a complaint about Malick; when her condition rapidly deteriorates in theatre, he walks out, causing the junior AAU staff to believe he has abandoned them.

25|$|The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who {{are dressed}} as monks and are begging for alms, and their {{companion}} Grigoriy, {{who is in}} secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bottle, he drinks and launches into a ferocious song ("So {{it was in the}} city of Kazan") of Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police are watching the ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known way to get to the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam's suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman thinks he has found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam's description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and leaps out of the window. The men set off in pursuit.|$|E

25|$|Magda and Ruggero {{have been}} living {{together}} on the French Riviera for some months. They talk about their first meeting and happiness together, living quietly by the sea. Ruggero tells Magda that he has written to his mother to ask for money to pay their growing debts and for her consent to his marriage to Magda. Ruggero imagines their happy married life and the child they may have (Aria: Dimmi che vuoi seguirmi). Magda is deeply touched, but also uneasy: she knows that her past life as a courtesan would make her unacceptable to Ruggero's family, and possibly to Ruggero if he knew who she really was. As Ruggero leaves to post his letter she meditates on her dilemma, torn between her desire to tell Ruggero everything, her wish not to hurt him and her fear of losing his love. Prunier and Lisette arrive. Lisette has had a brief and disastrous career as a music-hall singer: her performance in Nice the previous evening was a catastrophe. She and Prunier bicker with each other while waiting for Magda. When Magda appears, Lisette begs for her job back, and Magda consents. Prunier expresses surprise that Magda can be happy away from Paris, and delivers a message to Magda from Rambaldo: he is happy to take her back on any terms. Magda refuses to listen. Prunier takes his leave of Lisette (first arranging a rendezvous with her for that evening) and Lisette resumes her duties as Magda's maid. Ruggero <b>returns</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> letter from his mother, in which she says that if Ruggero's fiancée has all the virtues he has described to her, {{he will have a}} blissful marriage. She looks forward to welcoming the couple to her home and sends Magda a kiss. Magda is unable to keep her secret any longer. She tells Ruggero about her past and declares that she can never be his wife – she would cause his parents too much grief. Ruggero implores Magda not to abandon him (Ma come puoi lasciarmi), but Magda is adamant that they cannot remain together, and that Ruggero must return home. Like a swallow, she flies back to Rambaldo and her old life, leaving Ruggero behind, devastated.|$|E
