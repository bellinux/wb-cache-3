5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes.

Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E

Analyses based on morphology, immunology, and <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> have given contradictory placements of Phaner, while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded poor resolution of their placement.|$|E

Eumastusia k. koebelei presented 2 n= 23, X 0 and, in one individual, two copies of the same variant of a B chromosome were noticed, which are associated during meiosis. The C-positive blocks were located in the pericentromeric regions of the standard complement and along {{the entire length of}} the B chromosomes. Some G+C-rich heterochromatic blocks were noticed, including conspicuous blocks in the B chromosomes. The mapping of 18 S rDNA and U 2 snDNA revealed only autosomal clusters, and the telomeric probe hybridized in terminal regions. Finally, the DOP-PCR probe obtained from an individual without a B chromosome revealed signals in the heterochromatic regions, including {{the entire length of the}} B chromosome. The possible intraspecific origin of the B chromosomes, due to the shared pool of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> between the A and B chromosomes and the possible consequences of their association are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Supernumerary {{chromosomes}} (B chromosomes) {{occur in}} approximately 15 % of eukaryote species.

The accumulation of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> is one remarkable characteristic of B chromosomes, and the occurrence of distinct types of multigene families, satellite DNAs and some transposable elements have been reported. Here, we describe the organization of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the A complement and B chromosome system in the grasshopper species Abracris flavolineata using classical cytogenetic techniques and FISH analysis using probes for five multigene families, telomeric repeats and repetitive C 0 t- 1 DNA fractions. The 18 S rRNA and H 3 histone multigene families are highly variable and well distributed in A. flavolineata chromosomes, which contrasts with the conservation of U snRNA genes and less variable distribution of 5 S rDNA sequences. The H 3 histone gene was an extensively distributed with clusters occurring in all chromosomes. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> were concentrated in C-positive regions, including the pericentromeric region and small chromosomal arms, with some occurrence in C-negative regions, but abundance was low in the B chromosome. Finally, the first demonstration of the U 2 snRNA gene in B chromosomes in A. flavolineata may shed light on its possible origin.

The sequence exhibited no unusual or remarkable features. Repetitive sequences complementary to the cloned BAM 5 fragment were found in rat DNA, but not in feline or human DNA. Restriction mapping suggested that many BAM 5 sequences were components of much larger <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> which were scattered throughout the mouse genome.

5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{similarity}} between human and gorilla genomes {{has been found}} in all chromosome arms, but not in centromeres, using whole-comparative genomic hybridization (W-CGH). In human chromosomes, centromeric regions, generally containing highly <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs,</b> are characterized by the presence of specific human DNA sequences and an absence of homology with gorilla DNA sequences. The only exception is the pericentromeric area of human chromosome 9, which, in addition to a large block of human DNA, also contains a region of homology with gorilla DNA sequences; the localization of these sequences coincides with that of human satellite III.

40|$|Among several {{different}} types of repetitive sequences found in the human genome, this study has examined the telomeric repeat, necessary {{for the protection of}} chromosome termini, and the disease-associated triplet repeat (CTG) ·(CAG) n. Evidence suggests that replication of both types of repeats is problematic and that a contributing factor is the repetitive nature of the DNA itself. Here we have used electron microscopy to investigate DNA structures formed at replication forks on large model DNAs containing these repeat sequences, in an attempt to elucidate the contributory effect that these <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> may have on their replication. Visualization of the DNA revealed that there is a high propensity for a paused replication fork to spontaneously regress when moving through <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs,</b> and that this results in a four-way chickenfoot intermediate that could present a significant block to replication in vivo, possibly leading to unwanted recombination events, amplifications or deletions...|$|R

Based {{on the amount of}} these <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs,</b> 4 types of B variants were found: B 1, showing an equal or higher amount of rDNA than satDNA, and 3 other variants, B 2, B 24 and B 5, bearing a higher amount of satDNA than rDNA. The variants B 1 and B 2 varied in size among populations: B 1 was about half the size of the X chromosome in Balearic Islands, but two-thirds of the X in Iberian populations at Alicante, Murcia and Albacete provinces. Likewise, B 2 was about one-third the size of the X chromosome in populations from the Granada province but half the size of the X in the populations collected at Málaga province.

25|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1–6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times. Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They {{have a higher}} mutation rate than other areas of DNA DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage {{is more likely to}} occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|E

[...] Telomeres are regions of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in somatic cells.

(This is known as the Hayflick limit.) [...] Within the germ cell line, which passes DNA to the next generation, telomerase extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to cancer formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.|$|E
