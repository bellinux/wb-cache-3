40|$|ABSTRACT: Rockfall {{barriers}} are optimized to absorb high punctual impact energies. In mountain areas the {{barriers are}} also loaded by avalanches and snow pressure. Snowpack forces and dynamic avalanche pressures act over {{a much larger}} area and over longer time periods. Thus, if not properly designed, rockfall barriers can be damaged. In winter 2003 – 2006 we investigated the interaction of flexible rockfall barriers with avalanches and snow pressure on a study site in Fieberbrunn, Austria and in other areas. In several locations the barriers successfully stopped small wet snow avalanches. However, the main problem {{turned out to be}} the insufficient retention capacity during the whole winter and the structural behaviour. The weakest points are the <b>retaining</b> <b>ropes</b> and the post foundations. For an appropriate design of the barrier the main input factors determining snow pressure and avalanche pressure have to be assessed...|$|R

The first published design was the Croatian Fausto Veranzio's homo volans (flying man) which appeared in his book Machinae novae (New machines) in 1595. Based on a ship's sail, it comprised a square of material stretched across a square frame and <b>retained</b> by <b>ropes.</b> The parachutist was suspended by ropes {{from each of the}} four corners.|$|R

The rope drum comprises a drum cladding with a groove (5) for <b>retaining</b> of a <b>rope.</b> The groove runs over a circumference {{of the rope}} drum in a helical manner. The sleeve is dimensioned such that the sleeve prevents sliding of the rope from the groove. A slot (4) exhibits a slit width for feedthrough of the rope, where the slit width is smaller than 1 / 8 of a circumference of the rope drum. The slot is extended parallel to the drive axle...|$|R

40|$|The {{excavation}} of Sieur de la Salle's ship, La Belle, yielded {{a large amount}} of waterlogged rope requiring conservation. A history of hemp and rope manufacture is reviewed to assist in the identification of the materials and rope-work recovered from the La Belle, as well as to assist in selecting an appropriate conservation treatment. A summary of several methods used to conserve cordage is presented. Time has shown that not all of these treatment methods have remained viable options, and that continued study and experimentation are needed so that the conservator has the tools to develop an appropriate conservation plan for each artifact. The majority of La Belle's cordage was conserved using the passivation polymers method developed by Dr. C. Wayne Smith and Dr. Donny L. Hamilton, both of Texas A&M University, in conjunction with Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan. An experiment applying knowledge gleaned from the passivation polymers process to polyethylene glycol (PEG) impregnation was conducted in an attempt to stabilize the PEG within the rope. The results were good; the <b>rope</b> <b>retained</b> some flexibility and appears stable with a slightly darker color than with silicone oil...|$|R
