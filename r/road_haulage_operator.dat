50|$|The site {{first became}} {{operational}} in July 1997, and was officially opened in November 1997 by HRH The Princess Royal, at inception the facility included a 475000 sq ft warehouse operated for <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> <b>operator</b> Eddie Stobart. The rail connected terminal was operated by Tibbett and Britten; {{construction of a}} 210000 sq ft rail connected warehouse was started in 1998, a second 24600 m2 facility was constructed in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> <b>operators,</b> {{who had no}} such restrictions, could privately {{negotiate}} {{any rate}} they wished to undercut the railways' published price lists, and take away their business while offering door-to-door delivery. The train companies had previously relied on horse-drawn trailers for local goods deliveries from the station; to compete they bought in motorised local delivery vehicles such as the Karrier 'Cob' and Scammell 'Mechanical Horse'. It was then thought that no large railway could operate at a profit unless {{more than half of}} its traffic was freight, and thus any reduction in the freight business would also affect the viability of the passenger business.|$|R
30|$|In {{line with}} the Browne et al. [72] {{comparison}} of Paris and London, targeted stakeholder consultation communicating knowledge on freight issues and priorities for action, as well as involvement in the planning process, are practised in the freight plans identified in this paper. This complies {{with the emphasis on}} stakeholder consultation as key in urban freight planning [2, 10, 73, 74]. Collaboration is also highlighted as a key element in the SUTP, SUMP and SULP methodology fundamental to improvement of the planning procedures [74]. Key stakeholders involved in the identified planning process are: logistics service providers, suppliers, receivers, parish councils, <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> <b>operators</b> and delivery companies, and heavy goods vehicle drivers [2]. In Västra Götaland, for example, a freight strategy reference group with representatives from municipalities, municipal associations, businesses, academia, research institutes, NGOs and government agencies is involved in the planning [31]. Freight plans are designed to best serve the needs of both the freight industry and local communities by consulting with local authorities, representatives of the freight and logistics community. The use of a collaborative approach is in line with Lindholm’s [20] conclusion that including all relevant stakeholders in the planning process secures acceptance, thus increasing the likelihood of the plan delivering its full potential benefit [39].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the road freight {{transport}} industry, using the UK as a case study. It examines {{the extent to which}} Internet freight exchanges and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) processes are affecting general haulage. Recent surveys suggest that there is scope within the road transport industry to improve efficiency in terms of fill rates and empty running. Any improvements may also help to alleviate the pressures faced in many developed countries by the haulage industry, which include driver shortages, new legislation, such as the Working Time Directive in Europe, increasing road congestion, as well as to support improvements desired for sustainability. A background summary of the UK <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> industry and the potential impact of e-commerce are provided before the results of a survey from 49 general <b>haulage</b> <b>operators</b> in their attitude to and adoption of ICT developments are analysed and assessed. The study concludes that a split picture is emerging. While many of the smaller <b>haulage</b> <b>operators</b> remain dependent upon traditional communication and process systems, the larger logistics companies, who control the majority of vehicles and freight movements, are progressively developing new ways of working supported by ICT adoption...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in mobile and wireless technology have made possible {{new types of}} information systems supporting key activities in transport organizations. By including mobile actors and equipment, such technology is a key enabler for realizing the vision of enterprise system support in this context. This paper focuses on {{a particular type of}} transport organization, that of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms. The term Transport Information Systems (TIS) is used to discuss a specific type of enterprise technology, incorporating support for critical mobile aspects of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms and relevant functionality of conventional enterprise systems. To capture expectations of enterprise support in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> business, a qualitative interview study including 18 Swedish <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms was performed. Building on the results of the study, this paper contributes a set of sociotechnical challenges important for successful implementation of TIS in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms. In addition, this paper outlines implications for future research on enterprise systems in transport organizations. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{operations}} in general, and distribution in particular, are inefficient. Given the societal importance of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{and the low}} efficiency of the sector, road hauliers need to improve their operations and systematically tackle inefficiencies. However, the real causes of these inefficiencies, the “root causes”, have not been sufficiently examined in previous studies. This paper expands on prior research by adapting existing models {{that can be used}} to identify the root causes of inefficiencies, and to enable systematic improvements in road transport operations. Our research is based on a lean approach and an adapted version of Ishikawa’s model. It is shown as a matrix based on transport processes and the Ishikawa categories to identify the root causes of inefficiencies in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> that influence performance. The adapted model was tested in three <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> case studies. Our findings suggest that most efficiency problems appear in the actual transport execution...|$|R

Based on primary data obtained from major players in the haulage industry, there is a lack of common benchmark for these <b>haulage</b> <b>operators</b> could use to measure industry performance. Instead, each <b>haulage</b> <b>operators</b> use their own performance measures which basically are simple input-output production ratios.
