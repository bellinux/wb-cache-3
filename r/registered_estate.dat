To better realization of a generic context, especially for comprehension of the real <b>estate</b> <b>register</b> principles and recent state of filed data in the real <b>estate</b> <b>register,</b> there is also the historical evolution of <b>registering</b> the real <b>estate</b> in this thesis mentioned. It is difficult to understand some specific problems without knowledge of history because these problems result from former methods of <b>registering</b> the real <b>estate</b> and legal relations to them. Great attention is paid to keeping the state of filing in the real <b>estate</b> <b>register</b> in accordance with reality that is why the illustrations of some particular cases and examples are shown. This was led by effort to connect theoretical principles with their practical use, the major model situations were assumed from the experience of Klatovy Real <b>Estate</b> <b>Register's</b> employees.

40|$|RESUMÉ The Land Registry The Land Registry is a {{collection}} of data concerning the estates in the Czech Republic including a registration list with specification of their geometric and positional sites. It is an integrated, continuously updated system in which ownership titles and other property rights are registered. In addition, data can be applied by other public municipal systems, mainly for protection of estates rights, for tax and fee payment purposes, for protection of environment, cultural monuments, for land development purposes etc. The Land Registry's mission is to provide the best service for guaranteeing ownership of property and facilitating property transaction. In pursuit of this mission, the Land Registry's principal aims are to maintain and develop a stable, effective registration system as the cornerstone for the creation and free movement of interests in property, to guarantee title to <b>registered</b> <b>estates</b> and interests within the territory of the Czech Republic, to provide ready access to updated information relating to <b>registered</b> <b>estates</b> and to make property transactions easier for all. The purpose of my thesis is to summarize basic information about the Land Registry and to provide to a reader a total view of the subject matter to better orientate in such a "law labyrinth".

The Malaysian Institute of Estate Agents (MIEA) is the {{recognized}} body representing all <b>Registered</b> <b>Estate</b> Agents. This paper examines real estate agency organization, education, and standards of practice in Malaysia. It employs the instrument of document review of (i) Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents (VAEA) Act No. 242 of 1981, incorporating all amendments up to January 10, 2014 (i) (ii) Malaysian Institute of Estate Agents ’ Brochure 2014 (iii) Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents ’ Rules of 1986 (iv) Malaysia Real Estate Agency Standards of 1999, and triangulated the reviews by direct observation of procedures and operations in selected Real Estate Agents ’ Offices in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor for fourteen working days. It found significant compliance with the Act and the Agency Standards by Appraisers, Real Estate Agents and Negotiators. The study provides evidence to the National Assembly of Nigeria to amend the Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria (ESVARBON) Act No. 24 of 1975 for the statutory definition of an Estate Agent; facilitate the setting up of Training Institute for prospective estate agents who are not <b>registered</b> <b>estate</b> surveyors and valuers.

Data for the study were generated using questionnaire and oral interviews. Random sampling technique was employed to select 12 states from the 6 geopolitical zones of the country which stratified random sampling was used to select 100 Registered Real Estate Surveyors and Valuers. Analysis of the results shows among others that most cases of professional misconduct and negligence are hardly reported to the regulating agencies. Victims of cases of fraud in the industry are those people that do patronize charlatans instead of transacting business with <b>registered</b> <b>Estate</b> Surveyors and Valuers.

Analysis showed that the continuous influx of intruders into real estate business is as a result of inability of those <b>registered</b> <b>estate</b> surveyors and valuers to meet the local demand for their services coupled with the poor performance of some sole proprietor firms in the area of valuation accuracy. Also, Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria need to encourage partnerships and the registration of additional estate management graduates through extensive training and rigorous accreditation standards.

The results reveal that in the short run, office property does not provide a good hedge against inflation but, does so in the long run; while shop property does not hedge against inflation both in the long and in the short runs. Investors who are into direct real estate investment should look more at office properties and, if location is anything to go by, those locations that have shown better prospects are recommended to be sought after...|$|E

However, collection of double professional fees is the most prevalent challenge of estate marketing in the study area. Finally, aggressive marketing which leads to unethical practices is the most prevalent mitigating measures adopted by Estate Surveyors and Valuers in the study area.
