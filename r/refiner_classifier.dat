The strategy is generic and takes advantage of training errors to successively refine the classification model of a base classifier. We describe how it is applied to generate two new classification algorithms; a <b>Refined</b> Centroid <b>Classifier</b> and a <b>Refined</b> Naïve Bayes <b>Classifier.</b> We present an extensive experimental evaluation of both algorithms on three English collections and one Chinese corpus. The results indicate that in each case, the <b>refined</b> <b>classifiers</b> achieve significant performance improvement over the base classifiers used.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} combining domain knowledge and machine learning (CDKML) for classifier generation and online adaptation. The method exploits advantages in domain knowledge and machine learning as complementary information sources. While machine learning may discover patterns in interest domains that are too subtle for humans to detect, domain knowledge may contain information on a domain not present in the available domain dataset. CDKML has three steps. First, prior domain knowledge is enriched with relevant patterns obtained by machine learning to create an initial classifier. Second, genetic algorithms <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier.</b> Third, the classifier is adapted online based on user feedback using the Markov decision process. CDKML was applied in fall detection. Tests showed that the classifiers developed by CDKML have better performance than ML classifiers generated on a one-sided training dataset. The accuracy of the initial classifier was 10 percentage points higher than the best machine learning classifier and the refinement added 3 percentage points. The online adaptation improved {{the accuracy of the}} <b>refined</b> <b>classifier</b> by additional 15 percentage points...|$|R
40|$|Machine {{learning}} is an increasingly used computational tool within human-computer interaction research. While most researchers currently utilize an iterative approach to <b>refining</b> <b>classifier</b> models and performance, we propose that ensemble classification techniques {{may be a}} viable and even preferable alternative. In ensemble learning, algorithms combine multiple classifiers to build one that is superior to its components. In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} system and the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly combine multiple classifiers operating on multiple feature sets to produce an ensemble classifier with accuracy that approaches best-reported performance classifying images in the CalTech- 101 dataset.

40|$|Interactive {{end-user}} {{training of}} machine learning systems has received significant attention {{as a tool}} for personalizing recognizers. However, most research limits end users to training a fixed set of application-defined concepts. This paper considers additional challenges that arise in end-user support for defining the number and nature of concepts that a system must learn to recognize. We develop BeatBox, a new system that enables end-user creation of custom beatbox recognizers and interactive adaptation of recognizers to an end user’s technique, environment, and musical goals. BeatBox proposes rapid end-user exploration of variations in the number and nature of learned concepts, and provides end users with feedback on the reliability of recognizers learned for different potential combinations of percussive vocalizations. In a preliminary evaluation, we observed that end users were able to quickly create usable classifiers, that they explored different combinations of concepts to test alternative vocalizations and to <b>refine</b> <b>classifiers</b> for new musical contexts, and that learnability feedback was often helpful in alerting them to potential difficulties with a desired learning concept...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{we propose}} two novel {{classifiers}} for multi-class classification problems using mathematical programming optimisation techniques. A hyper box-based classifier (Xu & Papageorgiou, 2009) that iteratively constructs hyper boxes to enclose samples of different classes has been adopted. We firstly propose a new solution procedure that updates the sample weights during each iteration, which tweaks {{the model to}} favour those difficult samples in the next iteration and therefore achieves a better final solution. Through a number of real world data classification problems, we demonstrate that the proposed <b>refined</b> <b>classifier</b> results in consistently good classification performance, outperforming the original hyper box classifier {{and a number of}} other state-of-the-art classifiers. Furthermore, we introduce a simple data space partition method to reduce the computational cost of the proposed sample re-weighting hyper box classifier. The partition method partitions the original dataset into two disjoint regions, followed by training sample re-weighting hyper box classifier for each region respectively. Through some real world datasets, we demonstrate the data space partition method considerably reduces the computational cost while maintaining the level of prediction accuracies...|$|R

Instead of supervised learn-ing and manual labeling of large training samples, our clas-sifiers are initialized and refined online automatically. With efficient features extracted and organized, the approach can be real-time and achieve high classification accuracy.

40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{approaches have}} become the de-facto standard for creating object detectors (such as face and pedestrian detectors) which are robust to lighting, viewpoint, and pose. Generating sufficiently large labeled data sets to support accurate training is often the most challenging problem. To address this, the active learning paradigm suggests interactive user input, creating an initial classifier based on a few samples and <b>refining</b> that <b>classifier</b> by identifying errors and re-training. In this paper we seek to maximize {{the efficiency of the}} user input; minimizing the number of labels the user must provide and minimizing the accuracy with which the user must identify the object.

40|$|We propose an {{iterative}} crowd-enabled {{active learning}} algorithm for building high-precision visual classifiers from unlabeled images. Our method employs domain experts {{to identify a}} small number of examples of a specific visual event. These expert-labeled examples seed a classifier, which is then iteratively trained by active querying of a non-expert crowd. These non-experts actively <b>refine</b> the <b>classifiers</b> at every iteration by answering simple binary questions about the classifiers’ detections. The advantage of this approach is that experts efficiently shepherd an unsophisticated crowd into training a classifier capable of fine-grained distinctions. This obviates the need to label an entire dataset to obtain high-precision classifiers. We find these classifiers are advantageous for creating a large vocabulary of visual attributes for specialized taxonomies. We demonstrate our crowd active learning pipeline by creating classifiers for attributes related to North American birds and fashion. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{medically}} important disease-causing bacteria (collectively known as Gram-negative bacteria) {{has been shown}} to have a rather distinct cell structure, in which there exists an extra "outer" membrane in addition to the "inner" membrane that presents in the cells of most other organisms. Proteins resident in this outer membrane (outer membrane proteins) are of primary research interest since such proteins are exposed on the surface of these bacterial cells and so are the prioritized targets to develop drugs against. Determination of the biological patterns that discriminate outer membrane proteins from non-outer membrane proteins could also provide insights into the biology of this important class of proteins. To date, it remains difficult to predict outer membrane proteins with high precision. Existing protein localization prediction algorithms either do not predict outer membrane proteins at all, or they simply concentrate on the overall accuracy or recall when identifying outer membrane proteins. However, as the study of a potential drug or vaccine takes great amount of time and effort in the laboratory, it is more appropriate that priority be given to getting a high precision on outer membrane protein prediction. In this thesis, we address the problem of protein localization classification with the performance measured mainly on precision of the outer membrane protein prediction. We apply the technique of association-rule based classification and propose several important optimization techniques in order to speed up the rule-mining process. In addition, we introduce the framework of building classifiers with multiple levels, which we call the <b>refined</b> <b>classifier,</b> in order to further improve the classification performance on top of the single-level classifier. Our experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient and produce high precision while maintaining the corresponding recall at a good level. Also, the idea of refined classification indeed improves the performance of the final classifier. Furthermore, our classification rules turn out to be very helpful for biologists to improve their understanding of functions and structures of the outer membrane proteins...|$|R
30|$|To begin with, {{the hand}} is {{segmented}} in each frame from the background using an adaptive color detection algorithm. A Bayesian classifier is utilized during off-line phase [4]. An adaptive algorithm for determining skin probability is then applied to <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier</b> {{to train the}} system robustly [5]. Following this, we determine probabilities for fingertips by cropping the models of semicircle shape for a fit to the fingertip [6]. After superimposing the models on every candidate in the test image, we normalize the results which {{will be used as}} the fingertip probability map for tracking. Next, a clustering approach [7] is used to determine for regions of interest (ROIs) and sequential Monte Carlo [8] method is used for tracking by distributing the particles inside the corresponding ROIs. This vision-based methodology enables us to track the fingertips even when some fingers are not fully stretched out or when the luminance changes.|$|R

With these mined regions, we train a binary SVM classifier for each class and further <b>refine</b> these <b>classifiers</b> with hard negatives mining. In testing, a score is computed for each proposed region and we select the regions using non-maximum suppression and output the locations and predicted class names.

40|$|Outliers are {{pervasive}} in many computer vision and pattern recognition problems. Automatically eliminating outliers scattering among practical data collections becomes increasingly important, especially for Internet inspired vision applications. In this paper, we propose a novel oneclass learning approach which is robust to contamination of input training data {{and able to}} discover the outliers that corrupt one class of data source. Our approach works under a fully unsupervised manner, differing from traditional one-class learning supervised by known positive labels. By design, our approach optimizes a kernel-based max-margin objective which jointly learns a large margin one-class classifier and a soft label assignment for inliers and outliers. An alternating optimization algorithm is then designed to iteratively <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier</b> and the labeling, achieving a provably convergent solution {{in only a few}} iterations. Extensive experiments conducted on four image datasets in the presence of artificial and real-world outliers demonstrate that the proposed approach is considerably superior to the state-of-the-arts in obliterating outliers from contaminated one class of images, exhibiting strong robustness at a high outlier proportion up to 60 %. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} tracking multiple skincolored objects in images acquired by a possibly moving camera. The proposed method encompasses a collection of techniques that enable the modeling and detection of skin-colored objects {{as well as their}} temporal association in image sequences. Skin-colored objects are detected with a Bayesian classifier which is bootstrapped with a small set of training data. Then, an o#-line iterative training procedure is employed to <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier</b> using additional training images. On-line adaptation of skin-color probabilities is used to enable the classifier to cope with illumination changes. Tracking over time is realized through a novel technique which can handle multiple skin-colored objects. Such objects may move in complex trajectories and occlude each other in the field of view of a possibly moving camera. Moreover, the number of tracked objects may vary in time.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to establish a coherent framework for data mining in the relational model. Observing that data mining depends on two partitions, the classifier and the estimator, this paper defines the classifier/estimator (CE) framework.

The estimator is typically simply expressible using the relational instance. The degree to which the estimator <b>refines</b> the <b>classifier</b> partition can be used to measure how well the data instance matches the concept being investigated. The CE framework is shown to generalize a variety of data mining and database concepts, including rough sets, functional dependency, multivalued dependency, and association rules.

However, compared with fully supervised detection, {{it is more}} challenging to train deep network based detectors in a weakly supervised manner. Here we formulate weakly supervised detection as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where instance classifiers (object detectors) are put into the network as hidden nodes. We propose a novel online instance classifier refinement algorithm to integrate MIL and the instance classifier refinement procedure into a single deep network, and train the network end-to-end with only image-level supervision, i. e., without object location information. More precisely, instance labels inferred from weak supervision are propagated to their spatially overlapped instances to <b>refine</b> instance <b>classifier</b> online. The iterative instance classifier refinement procedure is implemented using multiple streams in deep network, where each stream supervises its latter stream.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{subcellular}} localization {{is concerned}} with predicting {{the location of a}} protein within a cell using computational method. The location information can indicate key functionalities of proteins. Accurate predictions of subcellular localizations of protein can aid the prediction of protein function and genome annotation, as well as the identification of drug targets. Computational methods based on machine learning, such as support vector machine approaches, have already been widely used in the prediction of protein subcellular localization. However, a major drawback of these machine learning-based approaches is that a large amount of data should be labeled in order to let the prediction system learn a classifier of good generalization ability. However, in real world cases, it is laborious, expensive and time-consuming to experimentally determine the subcellular localization of a protein and prepare instances of labeled data. Results In this paper, we present an approach based on a new learning framework, semi-supervised learning, which can use much fewer labeled instances to construct a high quality prediction model. We construct an initial classifier using a small set of labeled examples first, and then use unlabeled instances to <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier</b> for future predictions. Conclusion Experimental results show that our methods can effectively reduce the workload for labeling data using the unlabeled data.

We describe and demonstrate the effectiveness of ReQ-ReC (ReQuery-ReClassify), a double-loop retrieval system that combines iterative expansion of a query set with itera-tive refinements of a classifier. This permits a separation of concerns: the query selector’s job is to enhance recall, while the classifier’s job is to maximize precision on the items that have been retrieved by any of the queries so far. The overall process alternates between the query enhancement loop (to increase recall) and the classifier refinement loop (to increase precision). The separation allows the query enhancement process to explore larger parts of the query space. Our ex-periments show that this distribution of work significantly outperforms previous relevance feedback methods that rely on a single ranking function to balance precision and recall...|$|R

The task is the quality control in the production of refrigerators, detecting possible defects that can lead either to a real malfunction or even to a degradation of their performance. The testing phase was required to be accomplished in a short time with respect to a complete testing in order to avoid delays in the production process. Moreover the requirements for the testing system included an easy extension to different products, a good detection of the malfunctioning equipment and a simple use for the personnel. The system is based on a classifier realized with neural autoassociators. This approach allows us to build easily a model of the standard functional equipment, which satisfies the product requirements, by learning from examples. The neural autoassociator can learn to recognize functional devices only from positive samples, but in order to improve its recognition performance the learning algorithm can be extended easily to take into account also negative examples.

40|$|IntroductionEarly {{detection}} {{of lung cancer}} in high-risk individuals reduces mortality. Low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard but suffers from an exceedingly high false-positive rate (> 96 %) leading to unnecessary and potentially dangerous procedures. We, therefore, set out to develop a simple, noninvasive, and quantitative assay to detect lung cancer. MethodsThis proof-of-concept study evaluated the sensitivity/specificity of the CyPath Early Lung Cancer Detection Assay to correctly classify LDCT-confirmed cohorts of high-risk control (n = 102) and cancer (n = 26) subjects. Fluorescence intensity parameters of red fluorescent cells (RFCs) from tetra (4 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) -labeled lung sputum samples and subjects’ baseline characteristics were assessed for their predictive power by multivariable logistic regression. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to evaluate the sensitivity/specificity of the CyPath assay. ResultsRFCs were detectable in cancer subjects more often than in high-risk ones (p = 0. 015), and their characteristics differed between cohorts. Two independent predictors of cancer were the mean of RFC average fluorescence intensity/area per subject (p < 0. 001) and years smoked (p = 0. 003). The CyPath-based classifier had an overall accuracy of 81 % in the test population; false-positive rate of 40 % and negative predictive value of 83 %. ConclusionsThe tetra (4 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin -based CyPath assay correctly classified study participants into cancer or high-risk cohorts with considerable accuracy. Optimizing sputum collection, sample reading, and <b>refining</b> the <b>classifier</b> should improve sensitivity and specificity.

The success of classification is heavily dependent on the labeled training data.

Construction {{of a new}} quasar {{candidate}} catalog {{from the}} Red-Sequence Cluster Survey 2 (RCS- 2), identified solely from photometric information using an automated algorithm suitable for large surveys. The algorithm performance is tested using a well-defined SDSS spectroscopic sample of quasars and stars. Methods. The Random Forest algorithm constructs the catalog from RCS- 2 point sources using SDSS spectroscopically-confirmed stars and quasars. The algorithm identifies putative quasars from broadband magnitudes (g, r, i, z) and colours. Exploiting NUV GALEX measurements for {{a subset of the}} objects, we <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier</b> by adding new information. An additional subset of the data with WISE W 1 and W 2 bands is also studied. Results. Upon analyzing 542, 897 RCS- 2 point sources, the algorithm identified 21, 501 quasar candidates, with a training-set-derived precision (the fraction of true positives within the group assigned quasar status) of 89. 5 % and recall (the fraction of true positives relative to all sources that actually are quasars) of 88. 4 %. These performance metrics improve for the GALEX subset; 6, 530 quasar candidates are identified from 16, 898 sources, with a precision and recall respectively of 97. 0 % and 97. 5 %. Algorithm performance is further improved when WISE data are included, with precision and recall increasing to 99. 3 % and 99. 1 % respectively for 21, 834 quasar candidates from 242, 902 sources.

Given the large volume of photometric survey data available in the near future, automated methods for doing so are required. In this article, we present a new quasar candidate catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey 2 (RCS- 2), identified solely from photometric information using an automated algorithm suitable for large surveys. The algorithm performance is tested using a well-defined SDSS spectroscopic sample of quasars and stars. The Random Forest algorithm constructs the catalog from RCS- 2 point sources using SDSS spectroscopically-confirmed stars and quasars. The algorithm identifies putative quasars from broadband magnitudes (g, r, i, z) and colors. Exploiting NUV GALEX measurements for {{a subset of the}} objects, we <b>refine</b> the <b>classifier</b> by adding new information. An additional subset of the data with WISE W 1 and W 2 bands is also studied. Upon analyzing 542 897 RCS- 2 point sources, the algorithm identified 21 501 quasar candidates with a training-set-derived precision (the fraction of true positives within the group assigned quasar status) of 89. 5 % and recall (the fraction of true positives relative to all sources that actually are quasars) of 88. 4 %. These performance metrics improve for the GALEX subset: 6529 quasar candidates are identified from 16 898 sources, with a precision and recall of 97. 0 % and 97. 5 %, respectively. Algorithm performance is further improved when WISE data are included, with precision and recall increasing to 99. 3 % and 99. 1 %, respectively, for 21 834 quasar candidates from 242 902 sources. We compiled our final catalog (38 257) by merging these samples and removing duplicates. An observational follow up of 17 bright (r < 19) candidates with long-slit spectroscopy at DuPont telescope (LCO) yields 14 confirmed quasars. The results signal encouraging progress in the classification of point sources with Random Forest algorithms to search for quasars within current and future large-area photometric surveys. proyecto FONDECYT 	 1120676 11130630 FONDECYT 	 312021...|$|R
40|$|Discrete {{multiple}} signal classification (MUSIC) {{with its}} {{low computational cost}} and mild condition requirement becomes a significant noniterative algorithm for joint sparse recovery (JSR). However, it fails in rank defective problem caused by coherent or limited amount of multiple measurement vectors (MMVs). In this letter, we provide a novel sight {{to address this problem}} by interpreting JSR as a binary classification problem with respect to atoms. Meanwhile, MUSIC essentially constructs a supervised classifier based on the labeled MMVs so that its performance will heavily depend on {{the quality and quantity of}} these training samples. From this viewpoint, we develop a semisupervised MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) in the spirit of machine learning, which declares that the insufficient supervised information in the training samples can be compensated from those unlabeled atoms. Instead of constructing a classifier in a fully supervised manner, we iteratively <b>refine</b> a semisupervised <b>classifier</b> by exploiting the labeled MMVs and some reliable unlabeled atoms simultaneously. Through this way, the required conditions and iterations can be greatly relaxed and reduced. Numerical experimental results demonstrate that SS-MUSIC can achieve much better recovery performances than other MUSIC extended algorithms as well as some typical greedy algorithms for JSR in terms of iterations and recovery probability.
