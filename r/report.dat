5|$|Although the Robbins <b>Report</b> did {{not receive}} the same {{recognition}} as the Leopold <b>Report,</b> it reached similar conclusions. However, unlike the Leopold <b>Report,</b> the Robbins <b>Report</b> criticized the NPS for its lack of scientific research and made recommendations for sweeping changes {{in the structure of}} the NPS, with a proposal for a strong focus on a science-based approach. In 1972, the far more detailed Cain <b>Report</b> was released; amounting to 207 pages in comparison to the Leopold Report's scant 28, its committee was chaired by Stanley A. Cain, who also worked on the Leopold <b>Report.</b> Although this <b>report</b> made similar recommendations to the one primarily written by Leopold, it stated that little had been done to advance the previous report's findings, especially in terms of predator control. As a result of the Cain Report's recommendations, President Richard Nixon signed Executive Order 11643, which restricted the usage of poisons such as strychnine and sodium cyanide for predator control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the future of}} IC <b>reporting</b> by offering critical reflection on different forms of <b>reporting,</b> with a particular focus on Integrated <b>Reporting</b> (). While, the Global <b>Reporting</b> Initiative (GRI) framework for corporate social responsibility disclosures, the International Integrated <b>Reporting</b> Council (IIRC), and the various financial <b>reporting</b> regulators {{appear to be in}} a contest for supremacy, {{what does this mean for}} IC? We examine how IC is <b>reported</b> under each of these frameworks and conclude that is unlikely to subsume traditional financial statement <b>reporting,</b> nor will it be able to provide all the information currently <b>reported</b> in GRI-type <b>reports.</b> The interplay of these <b>reporting</b> frameworks and their future development bodes well for IC, because different kinds of IC information will be <b>reported</b> under each of, GRI-type <b>reports</b> and in financial statements; that is IC does not compete with these forms of <b>reporting</b> forms, but forms an essential part of each.

40|$|Purpose. Aim of {{the study}} is {{to get a better view}} of the {{contribution}} of pharmacists to the quantity and the quality of <b>reports</b> and in this way to the quality of a voluntary <b>reporting</b> system of adverse drug reactions. Methods. 15, 293 <b>reports,</b> sent to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb between 1995 and 2000 were analysed for the characteristics of pharmacists' <b>reports</b> and the differences with <b>reports</b> of physicians. Dispersion of adverse drug reaction was related to the different System and Organ Classes, the seriousness of the <b>reports</b> according to the CIOMS criteria and the documentation grade of the <b>reports.</b> 200 <b>reports</b> were at random selected and their quality assessed for the quality of the <b>reports.</b> Results. Pharmacists are responsible for 40 % of the <b>reports</b> sent in to Lareb during this period. Their <b>reports</b> more frequently concern adverse effects in relation to skin and the eyes. The seriousness of pharmacists' <b>reports</b> is less than with physician's <b>reports</b> as is the case with the documentation grade of <b>reports.</b> The quality of the clinical information of physicians' <b>reports</b> is higher. Conclusions. The contribution of pharmacists in the voluntary <b>reporting</b> system in the Netherlands is of great importance, both for the number of <b>reports</b> and the quality of <b>reports...</b>|$|R

5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a <b>report</b> {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The <b>report</b> {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the <b>report</b> was published. A temporary <b>report</b> was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the <b>report</b> laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final <b>report</b> was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The <b>report</b> contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
