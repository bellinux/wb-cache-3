This antenna is electromagnetically excited by three monopoles {{connected to the}} microstrip line on the lower dielectric substrate by through holes.

40|$|In {{their paper}} "Pythagorean Boxes", Raymond A. Beauregard and E. R. Suryanarayan define the concept or notion of Pythagorean Rectangle as one with sidelengths and integer {{diagonal}} lengths(see [1]);they also introduce {{the concept of}} a Pythagorean Box as a <b>rectangular</b> three-dimensional <b>parallelepiped</b> whose edges and diagonals have integer lengths. As in that paper, the abbreviation PB will simply stand for "Pythagorean Box";also in this article,the abbreviated notion PR will stand for "Pythagorean Rectangle". In the Beauregard and Suryanarayan paper,it was shown that there exist infinitely many PB's with a square base and height equal to 1. In this paper,we present a method and formulas that generate infinitely many PB's that contain a pair of opposite(and hence congruent) PR's which are primitive;a PR is primitive if the four congruent Pythagorean triangles contained there in are primitive. There are three results in this paper. In Result 1,we derive certain explicit conditions that a PB must satisfy, if it possesses two pairs of(opposite) primitive PR's. In Result 2,we show that if similar conditions are satisfied then infinitely many PB's can be generated containing a pair of(opposite) PR's. In Result 3, we prove that there exist no PB's with a square base and a face(and hence two faces) which is a primitive PR. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} fully analytical solutions, together with explicit expressions, in the time and frequency domain for the heat conduction response of homogeneous unbounded and of bounded rectangular spaces (three-, two-, and one-dimensional spaces) subjected to point, line, and plane heat diffusion sources. Particular attention {{is given to the}} case of spatially sinusoidal, harmonic line sources. In the literature this problem {{is often referred to as}} the two-and-a-half-dimensional fundamental solution or 2. 5 D Green’s functions. These equations are very useful for formulating three-dimensional thermodynamic problems by means of integral transforms methods and/or boundary elements. The image source technique is used to build up different geometries such as half-spaces, corners, <b>rectangular</b> pipes, and <b>parallelepiped</b> boxes. The final expressions are verified here by applying the equations to problems for which the solution is known analytically in the time domain...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{integration}} of mass matrix {{components in the}} element domain is performed using various numerical integration schemes, each one possess different level of accuracy, alters in number of integration (Gauss) points and requires different amount of computations. Herein semi-analytical approach is suggested. Metric (Jacobian determinant) is approximately modeled using its evaluations in certain points. Analytical integration is performed to derive simple explicit closed-form expressions for each term of the mass matrix. Two schemes are discussed: the first assumes constant metric (CM) in the initial domain, using evaluation at the centroid. The second allows for linear variation of the metric (LM linear metric) in the domain using 3 additional evaluation points. Both schemes are exact for <b>rectangular</b> and non-rectangular <b>parallelepiped</b> mesh. Careful symbolic manipulations and convenient choice of evaluation points allow us to avoid unnecessary operations. The accuracy of both schemes is studied numerically using randomly generated coarse mesh. Significant superiority in accuracy over equivalent schemes is reported. An important implication {{of this study is}} that it can replace currently used schemes...|$|R

5000|$|In a {{rectangular}} cuboid, all angles are right angles, and opposite faces of a cuboid are equal. By definition {{this makes it}} a right rectangular prism, and the terms <b>rectangular</b> <b>parallelepiped</b> or orthogonal parallelepiped are also used to designate this polyhedron. The terms [...] "rectangular prism" [...] and [...] "oblong prism", however, are ambiguous, since they do not specify all angles.|$|E
5000|$|In geometry, a cuboid is a convex {{polyhedron}} bounded by six quadrilateral faces, whose polyhedral graph {{is the same}} as that of a cube. While mathematical literature refers to any such polyhedron as a cuboid, other sources use [...] "cuboid" [...] to refer to a shape of this type in which each of the faces is a rectangle (and so each pair of adjacent faces meets in a right angle); this more restrictive type of cuboid is also known as a rectangular cuboid, right cuboid, rectangular box, rectangular hexahedron, right rectangular prism, or <b>rectangular</b> <b>parallelepiped.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interest in elastic {{properties}} {{made its}} entrance with 17th century philosophers, {{but the real}} theory of elasticity, indicating that the elastic constants of a material could be obtained by measuring sound velocities in that material, was summarized only two hundred of years later. In 1964, D. B. Frasier and R. C. LeCraw used the solution calculated in 1880 by G. Lamè and H. Lamb to solve the forward problem, and then inverted it graphically, {{in what may be}} the first RUS measurement. Nevertheless, we had to wait the participation of geophysics community, interested in determining the earth's interior structure, to solve also the inverse problem: in 1970 three geophysicists improved the previous method and introduced the term resonant sphere technique (RST). Excited by the encouraging results achieved with lunar samples, one of them gave one of his students the task of extending the method for use with cube shaped samples. This method, now known as the <b>rectangular</b> <b>parallelepiped</b> resonance (RPR) method, was further extended by I. Ohno in 1976. Finally, at the end of eighties, A. Migliori and J. Maynard expanded the limits of the technique in terms of loading and low-level electronic measurements, and with W. Visscher brought the computer algorithms to their current state, introducing the final term resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS).|$|E

Moreover, i - the combinatorics is preserved, and ii- the boundary is preserved: vertices corresponding to the cubes {{at the corners of}} the <b>rectangular</b> <b>parallelepiped</b> are at the corners of the topological cube.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{hypothetical}} assumption of neglecting transverse normal stress in vibration analysis for cantilevered thick plates and <b>rectangular</b> <b>parallelepiped.</b> The analysis solves the three-dimensional elasticity energy functional including, {{as well as}} excluding, transverse normal stress and obtains free vibration solutions for a cantilevered parallelepiped. Although it is widely accepted, the omission of transverse normal stress is well justified in Kirchhoff–Love thin-plate theory and higher-order thick-plate models; the transverse normal stress effects and thickness {{extent to which the}} thick-plate models apply as the thickness increases are practically unknown. The inconsistency of assuming constant transverse normal displacement through thickness for thick-plate models is also addressed. The paper concludes that for a <b>rectangular</b> <b>parallelepiped</b> with thickness exceeding a certain limit, there is considerable discrepancy if transverse normal stress is neglected. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
