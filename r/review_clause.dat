The case was highly acclaimed as a case that confirmed Australia as an “arbitration-friendly” country. This article examines the tension between the interest in finality and enforcement of arbitral awards, and the interest in a quality award. The first interest would generally argue against contractual expansion of judicial <b>review</b> <b>clauses</b> in the arbitration agreement; by contrast the second interest would support a contractual mechanism for the review of arbitral awards and contractually expanded judicial <b>review</b> <b>clauses.</b> By enforcing contractually expanded judicial <b>review</b> <b>clauses,</b> the interests of the “winner” (with an interest in finality and enforcement) and the shared interests of both parties in a quality award (irrespective of them being winner or loser) will be protected. This article argues that Australia may be arbitration-friendly {{from the point of view}} that arbitral awards will be enforced, but that it may only be fully “arbitration-friendly” if there is the possibility to enforce contractually expanded <b>review</b> <b>clauses.</b> A country that protects both the interest in finality and enforcement of arbitral awards and the interest in the quality of arbitral awards, and will further give full effect to the meaning of party autonomy in the context of arbitration as a contractual form of dispute resolution, will be a truly arbitration-friendly country...|$|R

40|$|The essay {{addresses}} whether party {{preference for}} more intrusive court {{review of the}} facts and law of an aribitral award will (or should) be respected in national arbitration law. The recent U. S. Supreme Court decision in Hall Street rules that expanded review clauses are not enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act. The essay argues, however, that expanded review of an international arbitral award should still be possible in the U. S. if the parties draft the arbitration clause carefully. For that purpose the parties should include an expanded <b>review</b> <b>clause</b> and should place the arbitral seat in a State that allows expanded review—for example, California. They should also expressly provide that the arbitration be governed by that State’s arbitration law. A respondent seeking to subject an unfavorable award to expanded review could then file for set-aside in the State courts of the seat. Even if the award creditor were to remove to federal court, the essay argues that a federal court should apply the State arbitration law, which, {{in the case of}} California, allows expanded review when the parties expressly provide for it.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the traditional, upward-only rent <b>review</b> <b>clauses</b> in English commercial leases can be replaced by rent indexation. Analysis of the existing literature found widespread criticism of upward-only rent reviews. Most importantly, they represent a disadvantage for tenants and an advantage for landlords. Contrary to this, analysis of the qualitative data, gathered through semi-structured interviews with professionals, showed that property market forces have shifted. This leaves tenants in a stronger negotiation position. A clear trend towards shorter leases and break options as opposed to rent review mechanisms. The evidence within the study suggests that the Codes of Leasing Practice have not had a significant impact on the flexibility of commercial leases. The findings of the study indicate that the Government should not legislate against upward-only rent reviews as this could have major negative impacts on the property market. Indexation was found to be a fair and reasonable option for both landlords and tenants. However, the exclusive use of indexation in commercial leases would lead to a distortion of the property market as the determination of market rents and values would be impossible. The principal conclusion of this dissertation was that the self-adjustment of the market, which led to a higher flexibility in commercial leases, made a restriction of upward-only rent reviews unnecessary. Moreover, rent indexation is a well-established rent review mechanism in England – a tool whereby both parties can benefit. An exclusive use of indexation in commercial leases though seems most unlikely...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to examine and analyse how a {{transfer}} pricing adjustment is made and how related parties should handle price adjustments from a customs perspective in Sweden. The examination includes describing the valuation methods available for transfer pricing and customs valuation with regards to related parties. In addition, the differences in connection to the valuation are described and analysed. Goods imported to Sweden must be cleared through customs: the importer presents a customs declaration to the Swedish Customs and pays customs duty. The customs duty is calculated using a customs value and customs valuation is the system that enables the importer to establish correct customs values on imported goods. Transfer pricing is the determination of prices on transactions taken place between companies belonging to the same group and has a direct effect on the income tax payable. There are six customs valuation methods that are hierarchically applied and six transfer pricing methods that are applied somewhat differently. There are similarities between the methods {{and most of the}} customs valuation methods have a corresponding transfer pricing method, or vice versa. Even if there are similarities, many factors make reconciliation of the methods difficult. Such factors are the different time for assessing the value and that the customs valuation methods are applied in a strictly hierarchical way with no possibility to choose the most suitable method. Customs duties and transfer pricing both share the same valuation concept, although interpreted differently, being that the value shall be based on the price that the parties would arrive at under open market conditions. However, relevant values on the same transaction differ significantly due to trying to be in accordance with respective rules. The differences in expectations and the conflicting interests on the outcome of the valuation lead to problems in the tax field. As a conclusion, customs valuation and transfer pricing can undeniably be described as “the two opposing and necessary sides of the same ‘coin’, whose respective values unavoidably affect the whole balance of a system of closely connected valuation”. In order for related parties to use the transaction value method, which is the superior customs valuation method, the price must not have been influenced due to their relationship. If one of two tests prescribed by law can prove that the relationship has not influenced the price, the related parties can use the transaction value method to establish the customs value. If the transaction value, for some reason cannot be used, the importer has to address other options on to how to establish the customs value. The conclusion of this master’s thesis is that related parties should include a price <b>review</b> <b>clause</b> in their contract or pricing policy. The company should notify the Swedish Customs about the provisional price and make an incomplete customs declaration. When information enabling the calculation of the customs value is available, the importer should file a complementary declaration. As an alternative, the importer should declare an open claim to the Swedish Customs arguing that the transaction value cannot be applied and, as a consequence thereof, explain in the customs value declaration why the applied customs value is correct. This thesis provides three recommendations concerning {{how to deal with the}} complications of customs valuation and transfer pricing. The first recommendation is that rules and recommendations surrounding transfer pricing and customs valuation should, to the extent possible, be harmonised. The second recommendation is that co-operation between the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Customs must improve, for example through advance pricing arrangements for both transfer pricing and customs purposes, documentation requirements, and joint audits. The third recommendation is that related parties should take the same care and documentation approach for customs purposes as it does for transfer pricing. Importing companies should make a price <b>review</b> <b>clause</b> in their contract before the importation and present an incomplete customs declaration. This way, in case of adjustments, the related party is able to uphold an arm’s length standard on the price and has the possibility to use the preferred transaction value for customs purposes, if that is desirable...|$|E
40|$|UK {{commercial}} property lease structures {{have come under}} considerable scrutiny {{during the past decade}} since the property crash of the early 1990 s. In particular, tenants complained that the system was unfair and that it has blocked business change. Government is committed, through its 2001 election manifesto, to promote flexibility and choice in the {{commercial property}} lettings market and a new voluntary Commercial Leases Code of Practice was launched in April 2002. This paper investigates whether occupiers are being offered the leases they require or whether there is a mismatch between occupier requirements and actual leases in the market. It draws together the substantial data now available on the actual terms of leases in the UK and surveys of corporate occupiers' attitude to their occupation requirements. Although the data indicated that UK leases have become shorter and more diverse since 1990, this is still not sufficient to meet the current requirements of many corporate occupiers. It is clear that the inability to manage entry and exit strategies is a major concern to occupiers. Lease length is the primary concern of tenants and a number of respondents comment on the mismatch between lease length in the UK and business planning horizons. The right to break and other problems with alienation clauses also pose serious difficulties for occupiers, thus reinforcing the mismatch. Other issues include repairing and insuring clauses and the type of <b>review</b> <b>clause.</b> There are differences in opinion between types of occupier. In particular, international corporate occupiers are significantly more concerned about the length of lease and the incidence of break clauses than national occupiers and private-sector tenants are significantly more concerned about leasing in general than public-sector occupiers. Proposed solutions by tenants are predictable and include shorter leases, more frequent breaks and relaxation of restrictions concerning alienation and other clauses. A significant number specify that they would pay more for shorter leases and other improved terms. Short leases would make many of the other terms more acceptable and this is why they are the main concern of corporate occupiers. Overall, the evidence suggests that there continues to be a gap between occupiers' lease requirements and those currently offered by the market. There are underlying structural factors that act as an inertial force on landlords and inhibit the changes which occupiers appear to want. Nevertheless, the findings raise future research questions concerning whether UK lease structures are a constraining factor on UK competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{breeding}} utilizes {{the advantages}} characterizing F 1 plants in a targeted manner: Vigour, uniformity, and {{a combination of}} all dominant traits of the parental lines. It gives breeders secure licences, as farmers can not save seed from hybrid varieties with a view to replanting. Regarding rye, the current advantages of hybrid varieties are primarily the higher yields but also improved resistances to lodging and sprouting. However, farmers can only benefit from higher yields if the limited market for organic rye in Switzerland can be expanded. The currently available hybrid rye varieties have higher susceptibility to leaf rust and ergot infections. The criticism of hybrid breeding and hybrid varieties concerns four areas: Firstly, the area of intrinsic quality: There are concerns, especially in the biodynamic movement, that continued inbreeding and pollen sterility as part of the breeding process will lead to losses regarding the more subtle ripening and nutritional qualities. This poses the question of adequate research methods. There is still considerable need for research. Secondly, the area of socio-economics: The fact that seed from hybrid varieties can not be saved and replanted leads to greater dependence on breeders and seed producers {{on the part of the}} farmers. At present this is not regarded as a problem in Switzerland as most farmers purchase new seed every year in any case but in the long term it renders agriculture liable to corruption. Thirdly, the ethical field: Some people have concerns regarding the breeders’ intervention into the flowering biology of the relevant cereal species. These interventions are at variance with the basic ethical-philosophical tenets of organic agriculture. Moreover, the fact that the hybrid varieties can not be saved and replanted effectively constitutes “patent protection” and promotes the ethically questionable change in meaning of seed from a cultural asset to a mere means of production. Fourthly: Hybrid varieties of self-sterile plants (e. g. rye) are genetically more vulnerable to environmental influences which were not considered during selection. This point is less relevant as regards self-fertile plants (oilseed rape, barley, wheat) as even today’s pureline varieties are already very uniform. It must be noted that amongst all hybrid varieties which are based on male sterility many so-called “different” varieties may share the same cytoplasm. As the criticisms regarding dependencies and genetic vulnerability only concern the future and the ethical concerns are not shared by everyone, it is the quality issue which is of particular relevance regarding the pending decision on whether or not to ban hybrid varieties in organic bread cereal production in Switzerland. Further research is essential. However, if one is to wait for the relevant results before taking a decision, this will certainly be too late. It would be more realistic to integrate a <b>review</b> <b>clause</b> into a potential decision to refrain from the use of hybrid varieties. Abstaining from the use of hybrid varieties in organic bread cereal production in Switzerland would give a clear signal to upstream and downstream sectors (breeders/trade and consumers respectively) that organic farming strives to consider long-term and future aspects of independence, quality, and diversity and that it would be ready to forego current agronomic advantages to this end. This would need to be clearly communicated to the trade sector when it comes to discussions on market prices. ...|$|E

40|$|Like {{other regions}} of the world, the EU is {{developing}} biofuels in the transport sector to reduce oil consumption and mitigate climate change. To promote them, it has adopted favourable legislation since the 2000 s. In 2009 it even decided to oblige each Member State to ensure that by 2020 the share of energy coming from renewable sources reached at least 10 % of their final consumption of energy in the transport sector. Biofuels are considered the main instrument to reach that percentage since the development of other alternatives (such as hydrogen and electricity) will take much longer than expected. Meanwhile, these various legislative initiatives have driven the production and consumption of biofuels in the EU. Biofuels accounted for 4. 7 % of EU transport fuel consumption in 2011. They have also led to trade and investment in biofuels on a global scale. This large-scale expansion of biofuels has, however, revealed numerous negative impacts. These stem from the fact that first-generation biofuels (i. e., those produced from food crops), of which the most important types are biodiesel and bioethanol, are used almost exclusively to meet the EU’s renewable 10 % target in transport. Their negative impacts are: socioeconomic (food price rises), legal (land-grabbing), environmental (for instance, water stress and water pollution; soil erosion; reduction of biodiversity), climatic (direct and indirect land-use effects resulting in more greenhouse gas emissions) and public finance issues (subsidies and tax relief). The extent of such negative impacts depends on how biofuel feedstocks are produced and processed, the scale of production, and in particular, how they influence direct land use change (DLUC) and indirect land use change (ILUC) and the international trade. These negative impacts have thus provoked mounting debates in recent years, with a particular focus on ILUC. They have forced the EU to re-examine how it deals with biofuels and submit amendments to update its legislation. So far, the EU legislation foresees that only sustainable biofuels (produced in the EU or imported) can be used to meet the 10 % target and receive public support; and to that end, mandatory sustainability criteria have been defined. Yet they have a huge flaw. Their measurement of greenhouse gas savings from biofuels {{does not take into account}} greenhouse gas emissions resulting from ILUC, which represent a major problem. The Energy Council of June 2014 agreed to set a limit on the extent to which firstgeneration biofuels can count towards the 10 % target. But this limit appears to be less stringent than the ones made previously by the European Commission and the European Parliament. It also agreed to introduce incentives for the use of advanced (second- and third-generation) biofuels which would be allowed to count double towards the 10 % target. But this again appears extremely modest by comparison with what was previously proposed. Finally, the approach chosen to take into account the greenhouse gas emissions due to ILUC appears more than cautious. The Energy Council agreed that the European Commission will carry out a reporting of ILUC emissions by using provisional estimated factors. A <b>review</b> <b>clause</b> will permit the later adjustment of these ILUC factors. With such legislative orientations made by the Energy Council, one cannot consider yet that there is a major shift in the EU biofuels policy. Bolder changes would have probably meant risking the collapse of the high-emission conventional biodiesel industry which currently makes up the majority of Europe’s biofuel production. The interests of EU farmers would have also been affected. There is nevertheless a tension between these legislative orientations and the new Commission’s proposals beyond 2020. In any case, many uncertainties remain on this issue. As long as solutions have not been found to minimize the important collateral damages provoked by the first generation biofuels, more scientific studies and caution are needed. Meanwhile, it would be wise to improve alternative paths towards a sustainable transport sector, i. e., stringent emission and energy standards for all vehicles, better public transport systems, automobiles that run on renewable energy other than biofuels, or other alternatives beyond the present imagination...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the public {{procurement}} law applicable where UK contracting authorities seek to adjust the provisions of existing contracts. This study aims firstly to identify the law applicable to contract adjustments and secondly to establish how that law is applied in practice. In order to achieve the first objective, chapter 2 of this study set out the substantive law applicable to contract adjustments (including that arising from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 and 2015, and case law) and chapters 3, 4, and 5 consider respectively the content of that law specifically in the cases of <b>review</b> <b>clauses,</b> adjustments upon operation of law, and other adjustments. The second objective is met through considering the findings of relevant case law and also through undertaking empirical research.

Data was collected through semi-structured questionnaires from private practice lawyers who advise contracting authorities on adjustments to those contracts within the scope of this research and contracting authorities themselves. Chapter 7 then sets out the findings of that empirical research. In the concluding chapter 8 the findings of the research are set out including an explanation of the ambiguities identified in the existing legal framework, and an articulation of the overall approach taken by contracting authorities when adjusting contracts, which suggests that a pragmatic approach (including assessment of likelihood of successful procurement law challenge) is taken to best enable the attainment of the contracting authorities’ procurement objectives.

Raich—have shown a strong preference for facial challenges, in sharp contrast to the Court’s traditional inclination toward as-applied review. This article explores several possible rationales for the Court’s use of facial <b>review</b> in Commerce <b>Clause</b> cases, and concludes that the soundest explanation lies in an understanding of the Clause’s meaning that incorporates a requirement of appropriate legislative purpose...|$|R
25|$|The High Court of Australia {{has held}} that the Constitution of Australia restricts the ability of legislatures to {{insulate}} administrative tribunals from judicial <b>review</b> using privative <b>clauses.</b> Similarly, in India ouster clauses are almost always ineffective because judicial review is regarded {{as part of the}} basic structure of the Constitution that cannot be excluded. The position in Singapore is unclear. Two cases decided after Anisminic have maintained the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, and it is not yet known whether the courts will eventually adopt the legal position in the United Kingdom. The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, suggested in a 2010 lecture that ouster clauses may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts, and may thus be void. However, he emphasized that he was not expressing a concluded view on the matter.|$|R
50|$|In December 1995, {{he gained}} notoriety for his 18-hour filibuster-like {{protest against the}} Mike Harris government's Omnibus Bill 26. When Curling was ordered {{expelled}} from the legislature refusing for to vote, he was ordered by the speaker to leave the chamber. He refused to leave his seat, and a knot of fellow Liberal and NDP opposition members formed a cordon around him to prevent his physical removal. The standoff lasted throughout the night and into {{the next morning when}} the house was adjourned. Reports stated that when legislature staff saw Frances Lankin, NDP MPP and a former prison guard, among the cordon, they backed off. Curling claimed his protest was meant to highlight a lack of public consultation in the Harris government's bill. The incident led to a discussion amongst the party house leaders and an agreement was reached to <b>review</b> the bill <b>clause</b> by clause.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} pages present the Forensic Examination Accreditation Program specific requirements. The policies, procedures {{and activities of}} organizations performing forensic inspections must meet these requirements. Management system documentation and supporting records must be available for the assessor’s <b>review.</b> Requirements (<b>clauses)</b> that include {{the need for a}} written policy, procedure or arrangement have a thick, black border. Inspection Body (IB) Instructions: This checklist must be completed and submitted as part of the application for accreditation in order to help both the IB and assessor(s) prepare for the assessment. Correct completion of this checklist may save a significant amount of assessment time and cost. Complete the document reference identifiers in the checklist's second column (labeled "Reference") for all requirements within a thick, black border. The appropriate “reference ” must identify the document (quality manual, laboratory manual, SOPs, etc) and include a “locator ” to facilitate identification of the appropriate portion(s) of the relevant document (page number, section number, etc.) The management system documentation and supporting records must be available for the assessor's review. A 2 LA Assessor Instructions: Review the IB’s documented management system to verify compliance with the applicable requirements. Assess to verify that the documented management system is indeed implemented as described. Place a tick mark in the yes (Y), no (N), or not applicable (NA) space for each checklist item.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first {{empirical}} analysis of appeal waivers clauses in plea agreements by which defendants waive their rights to appellate and postconviction review. Based on interviews and an analysis of data coded from 971 randomly selected cases sentenced under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the study's findings include (1) in {{nearly two-thirds of the}} cases settled by plea agreement, the defendants waived their rights to review; (2) the frequency of waiver varies substantially among the circuits, and among districts within circuits; (3) the government appears to provide some sentencing concessions more frequently to defendants who sign waivers than to defendants who do not, including agreeing to "C" pleas (binding sentencing terms), downward departures, safety-valve credits, and a variety of stipulations; (4) many defendants who waive their rights to <b>review</b> obtain <b>clauses</b> in their agreements that limit their exposure to unexpected negative results at sentencing; (5) some defendants appear to receive neither greater certainty nor leniency in return for signing wide-open and unlimited waivers of their rights to review; (6) three-quarters of the defendants who waived appeal also waived collateral review, and of these, fewer than one-third preserved the right to raise a claim of ineffective assistance; and (7) waivers have been enforced to bar a variety of claims, including claims of ineffective assistance at sentencing and assertions of constitutional violations under Blakely and Booker. The observed trend of increased use of stipulations combined with no review raises the risk that sentences not in compliance with the law can proliferate without scrutiny. The uneven practice of trading sentencing concessions for waivers among cases and courts also suggests that waivers are undercutting efforts to advance consistency in federal sentencing...|$|R
500|$|The {{constitutionality}} of the fix has been much debated, however, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never directly ruled on it. Critical <b>review</b> of the <b>clause</b> begins with {{a study of the}} terms in the plain language of the clause: [...] "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time ...." [...] All of the terms have been at issue in past controversies and many of the terms have been well-settled. Historically, the excluded class of individuals affected by the clause has not been an issue: all scholars have agreed that the clause refers exclusively to all members of Congress. The clause uses the verb [...] "elected". If a senator serving under an appointment to fill a vacancy in an unexpired term accepted a nomination to federal office before the expiration of his or her term, this might be an issue.|$|R
40|$|Rail {{systems are}} {{frequently}} subject to disturbances (such as power failures, door malfunctioning and signal problems, {{to mention a}} few) that affect the service quality. During a disruption, the system controller makes corrective actions {{in order to minimize}} its impact on service quality. However, in a situation where the system performance is subject to financial incentives and penalties, the controller is expected to make control decisions that minimize the financial impact of the disruption which will depend on structure of the incentive and penalty provisions. This thesis <b>reviews</b> the incentive/penalty <b>clauses</b> included in Tren Urbano's Operations and Maintenance Contract for on-time performance, and discusses how they are likely to affect the decisions made by the contractor when a disruption occurs in the system. The control decisions resulting from the contractor's point of view will be compared to the optimal control decisions that minimize the negative impacts of the disruption on the level of service. This comparison will be used to develop a proposal for revised contract terms to address the contractor's interests along with both the owner'...|$|R
40|$|Scholars, lawyers, and, indeed, {{the public}} at large {{increasingly}} worry about what purposive presidential inaction in enforcing statutory programs means {{for the rule of law}} and how such discretionary inaction can fit within a constitutional structure that compels Presidents to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. 2 ̆ 2 Yet those who have recognized the problem have been hesitant to assign a role for the court in policing the constitutional limits they articulate, mostly because of the strain on judicial capacity that any formulation of Take Care <b>Clause</b> <b>review</b> would cause. In this Article, I argue that courts still can and do constrain presidential nonenforcement discretion, and that they are far better situated to do so when they operate under the rubric of conventional administrative law. Often caricatured as categorically deferential to questions of enforcement discretion, the law of agency inaction is in fact nimble enough to constrain the most egregious instances of executive overreach in nonenforcement, and unique doctrinal features, such as the doctrine of finality, give courts a safety valve to control strains on judicial capacity...|$|R

40|$|This article, whose {{materials}} are extracted from a wider {{project on the}} doctrinal and humanitarian significance of the 1899 / 1907 Martens <b>Clause,</b> <b>reviews</b> the strengths and limitations of competing interpretations and judicial applications of this Clause. It identifies four distinct, if interrelated, approaches to defining its meaning and scope assessing each in turn. We take issue with recent scholarship that restricts its applicability in various ways that deny {{its status as a}} separate and distinct legal principle of direct and independent applicability to organized atrocities against civilians. We also dispute the view that this Clause is best interpreted as an aide to judicial interpretation, rather than as an independent source of international criminal law, by showing that this interpretation is inconsistent with a number of important cases whose authority appears to be well established and unobjectionable. Furthermore, the moral imperatives that clearly shape the language of the Clause and have been realized in many of its accumulated judicial applications, positively require this measure to be interpreted and applied as a freestanding legal norm—albeit one that has to operate as supplement for, rather than alternative to, other more specific legal rules and principles...|$|R
