5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, {{and take}} 14 to 49 days to germinate. In {{the absence of}} further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|A fast-growing and {{attractive}} plant, Banksia speciosa grows readily {{in a sunny}} location in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia serrata and B.integrifolia to enable cultivation in these areas. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1830. Banksia speciosa is an important cut flower crop. It {{was one of several}} species considered for commercial cropping in Tenerife, and trials showed that seedlings were moderately tolerant to salinity.|$|E

5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract did not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
5|$|B. sceptrum is principally {{used in the}} {{cut flower}} industry, with the {{immature}} spikes being commonly sold in florists around Australia. It is occasionally grown in gardens as its bright flower spikes are prominent, but requires a Mediterranean (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it is sensitive to dieback. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to germinate. A dwarf form is in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it {{may be reluctant to}} flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also <b>require</b> <b>any</b> regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes {{five to six}} years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0â€“7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{but these}} are hard to obtain. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 37 to 40 days to germinate. Propagation by cutting has not been attempted, but might be possible, since the closely related B.cuneata has been propagated this way, albeit with unpredictable results. The plant should be grown in deep, acidic to neutral sand at a sheltered site. It is recommended to prune it when young, to encourage branching.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not <b>require</b> <b>any</b> treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
