In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
