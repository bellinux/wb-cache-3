During set construction for the police station and the house in the film, the producer and the director wanted to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> coconut trees. However, art director Vivek managed to erect those sets without cutting down any trees.|$|E

However, it gets <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> processes which some found burdensome, such as atmospheric maneuvering, and Marine guards defending aboard ships.|$|E
25|$|Most likely, the Arabian {{physicians}} became {{familiar with}} the Graeco-Roman and late Hellenistic medicine through direct contact with physicians who were practicing in the newly conquered regions rather than by reading the original or translated works. The translation of {{the capital of the}} emerging Islamic world to Damascus may have facilitated this contact, as Syrian medicine was part of that ancient tradition. The names of two Christian physicians are known: Ibn Aṯāl worked at the court of Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. The caliph abused his knowledge in order to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> of his enemies by way of poisoning. Likewise, Abu l-Ḥakam, who was responsible for the preparation of drugs, was employed by Muawiah. His son, grandson, and great-grandson were also serving the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphate.|$|E

500|$|In the 14th century, Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury {{continued}} the building. He had an uneasy {{relationship with the}} citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge. The [...] high three-storey gatehouse, which dates from 1341, has a bridge over the moat. The entrance was protected by a heavy gate, portcullis and drawbridge, operated by machinery above the entrance, and spouts through which defenders could pour scalding liquids onto any attacker. The drawbridge was still operational in 1831 when it was closed after word was received that the Palace of the Bishop of Bristol was subject to an arson attack during the Bristol riots. These took place after the House of Lords rejected the second Reform Bill. The proposal had aimed to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> of the rotten boroughs and give Britain's fast growing industrial towns such as Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Bradford and Leeds greater representation in the House of Commons; however there was no rioting in Wells. The water which filled the moat flowed from the springs in the grounds which had previously chosen its own course as a small stream separating the cathedral and the palace and causing marshy ground around the site. The moat acted as a reservoir, controlled by sluice gates, which powered watermills in the town.|$|E

Dawson tells MacLeod, [...] "Darius... the great general who became a monk. I hope the Immortal who killed him rots in hell."

[...] Dawson admits this when he surprises Horton armed with an axe and a gun, waiting for MacLeod. MacLeod finally stabs Horton with his sword.|$|E
2500|$|Britain {{issued a}} [...] at the {{beginning}} of the Civil War on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognised as a belligerent but it was too premature to recognise it as a sovereign state. The United States Secretary of State, William Seward, threatened to treat as hostile any country which recognised the Confederacy. Britain depended more on American corn than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain's economic interest. Palmerston ordered reinforcements sent to the Province of Canada because he was convinced the North would make peace with the South and then invade Canada. He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, but 15 months later he felt that, [...] "the American War... has manifestly ceased to have any attainable object as far as the Northerns are concerned, except to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> more thousand troublesome Irish and Germans. It must be owned, however, that the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides have shown courage and endurance highly honourable to their stock".|$|E
