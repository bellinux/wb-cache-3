These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the reporting requirements in the country they are based or if they are large enough they may produce them under International Financial <b>Reporting</b> <b>Standards</b> (IFRS), an example of this is the UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E
5|$|The International Financial <b>Reporting</b> <b>Standards</b> (IFRS) are {{standards}} and interpretations {{developed by the}} International Accounting Standards Board, which are principle-based. IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the European Union, Australia, and Hong Kong. The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based. Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is {{partly responsible for the}} number of scandals that the United States has suffered. The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.|$|E

2500|$|Most funds use an {{independent}} accounting firm to audit {{the assets of}} the fund, provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the fund's financial statements. The year-end audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the International Financial <b>Reporting</b> <b>Standards</b> (IFRS). The auditor may verify the fund's NAV and assets under management (AUM). Some auditors only provide [...] "NAV lite" [...] services, meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather th{{an independent}} assessment.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the law was a provision that allowed the SEC to force a company's CEO or CFO to disgorge any executive compensation (such as bonus pay or proceeds from stock sales) earned within a year of misconduct that results in an earnings restatement. [...] However, according to Gretchen Morgenson of The New York Times, such clawbacks have actually been rare, {{due in part to the}} requirement that the misconduct must be either deliberate or reckless. [...] The SEC did not attempt to claw back any executive compensation until 2007, and as of December 2013 had only brought 31 cases, 13 of which were begun after 2010. [...] However, according to Dan Whalen of the accounting research firm Audit Analytics, the threat of clawbacks, and the time-consuming litigation associated with them, has forced companies to tighten their financial <b>reporting</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Hurt cosponsored the Balanced Budget Amendment, {{which did}} not pass the House of Representatives in November 2011. Hurt said of the bill, “By passing a Balanced Budget Amendment, Congress will be {{required}} to spend no more than it takes in, reining in out of control spending once and for all” Hurt also sponsored the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act that would exempt private equity funds advisers from certain registration and <b>reporting</b> <b>standards.</b> In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act which would “protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions.” [...] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee. Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create the jobs that the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E
