25|$|State Route 555 (SR 555) is a , northsouth <b>running</b> <b>state</b> {{highway that}} passes through four {{counties}} in southeastern Ohio. State Route 555's southern terminus {{is at the}} concurrency of US 50, SR 7 and SR 32 (James A. Rhodes Appalachian Highway) in the unincorporated community of Little Hocking in extreme southwestern Washington County. Its northern terminus is at SR 60 in Wayne Township, just outside Zanesville. The route passes through primarily rural portions of Washington, Morgan, Perry, and Muskingum counties, connecting unincorporated villages along the way. Its emergence into southern Zanesville at the route's northern end takes the route into a more suburban setting before it terminates.|$|E
25|$|The {{sudden death}} of Ci'an in April 1881 brought Cixi a new challenge. Ci'an had taken little {{interest}} in <b>running</b> <b>state</b> affairs, but was the decision-maker in most family affairs. As the consort of the Xianfeng Emperor, she took seniority over Cixi, despite being two years her junior. Some believe that rumours began circulating at court {{to the effect that}} Cixi had poisoned Ci'an, perhaps {{as a result of a}} possible conflict between Cixi and Ci'an over the execution of the eunuch An Dehai in 1869 or a possible will from the late Xianfeng Emperor that was issued exclusively to Ci'an. Because of a lack of evidence, however, historians are reluctant to believe that Ci'an was poisoned by Cixi, but instead choose to believe that the cause of death was a sudden stroke, as validated by traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E
500|$|Rush Street runs north–south {{and in a}} north-northwest {{direction}} (see map in external links). It runs north–south at 65 {{east from}} 400 north at its southern terminus at Kinzie Avenue to 800 north at Chicago Avenue between Michigan Avenue to the east at 100 east and Wabash Avenue to the west at 44 east. On {{the north side of}} Chicago it runs straight on a slight diagonal to the street grid. By the time it travels three blocks north to Delaware Place at 900 north, it intersects Wabash. It then continues on a diagonal for four more blocks where it intersects the north–south <b>running</b> <b>State</b> Street (the centerline between east and west) at Cedar Street which runs at 1120 north. [...] It is crossed by Ohio Street and Ontario Street which feed from and to the Kennedy Expressway to the west.|$|E
40|$|The need of {{studying}} infinite computations has been emphasized in recent years, e. g., see (Vardi and Wolper, 1994). By infinite computations, one means the computations done by some programs that create non-terminating processes or {{very long time}} running processes. For such programs, the computations done by them usually go through infinite sequences of <b>running</b> <b>states</b> (or configurations), unlike finite computations in which only finite sequences of <b>running</b> <b>states</b> are involved...|$|R

500|$|Borah {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1936, the first from Idaho to do so. His candidacy was opposed by the conservative Republican leadership. [...] Borah praised Roosevelt for some of his policies, and deeply criticized the Republican Party. [...] With only 25 Republicans left in the Senate, Borah saw an opportunity to recast the Republican Party along progressive lines, as he had long sought to do. [...] He was opposed by the Republican organization, which sought to dilute his strength in the primaries by <b>running</b> <b>state</b> favorite son candidates {{in order to ensure}} a brokered convention. Despite being easily the leading primary vote-getter, Borah managed to win only a handful of delegates and took a majority of them in only one state, Wisconsin, where he had the endorsement of Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr. Borah refused to endorse the eventual Republican nominee, Kansas Governor Alf Landon, leading some to believe he might cross party lines and support Roosevelt. Ultimately, as he had four years earlier, he chose to endorse neither candidate. Borah was on the ballot that fall in Idaho, seeking a sixth term in the Senate. For {{the first time since the}} people had been given the right to elect senators, the Democrats ran a serious candidate against him, Governor C. Ben Ross. [...] Although Idahoans overwhelmingly voted for Roosevelt, who won all states but Maine and Vermont, Borah still took over 60 percent of their votes in his re-election bid.|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} system’s principal {{responsibility is}} in controlling {{the execution of}} processes. This includes determining the interleaving pattern for execution and allocation of resources to processes. One part of designing an OS is to describe the behaviour {{that we would like}} each process to exhibit. The simplest model is {{based on the fact that}} a process is either being executed by a processor or it is not. Thus, a process may be considered to be in one of two states, RUNNING or NOT RUNNING. When the operating system creates a new process, that process is initially labeled as NOT RUNNING, and is placed into a queue in the system in the NOT <b>RUNNING</b> <b>state.</b> The process (or some portion of it) then exists in main memory, and it waits in the queue for an opportunity to be executed. After some period of time, the currently RUNNING process will be interrupted, and moved from the <b>RUNNING</b> <b>state</b> to the NOT <b>RUNNING</b> <b>state,</b> making the processor available for a different process. The dispatch portion of the OS will then select, from the queue of NOT RUNNING processes, one of the waiting processes to transfer to the processor. The chosen process is then relabeled from a NOT <b>RUNNING</b> <b>state</b> to a <b>RUNNING</b> <b>state,</b> and its execution is either begun if it is a new process, or is resumed if it is a process which was interrupted at an earlier time.|$|E
