5|$|From 1978, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{depreciation}} {{was fixed}} with a tablita, an active crawling peg {{that was based}} on a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of depreciation. The announcements were repeated on a rolling basis to create an environment in which economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation. Inflation gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100%.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his many}} successes, {{during the last}} twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh {{measures}} he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed. In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{took over the}} three national mints: the Charlotte Mint in North Carolina, the Dahlonega Mint in Georgia, and the New Orleans Mint in Louisiana. During 1861, the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage, the latter half dollars. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union. In New Orleans the Confederacy used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars. US coinage was hoarded {{and did not have}} any general circulation. U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10, as were British sovereigns, French Napoleons and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> Confederate money was paper and postage stamps.|$|E
25|$|Interest rate parity and Covered {{interest}} arbitrage: The {{simple concept}} that two similar investments {{in two different}} currencies ought to yield the same return.

IRP basically provides the math to calculate a projected or implied forward <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> This calculated rate is not and cannot be considered a prediction or forecast, but rather is the arbitrage-free calculation for what the exchange rate is implied to be in order for it to be impossible to make a free profit by converting money to one currency, investing it for a period, then converting back and making more money than if a person had invested in the same opportunity in the original currency.|$|E

In his defence, Mr Harman said he {{had every right to}} mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was [...] "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," [...] out of the realm for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> K+/H+ <b>exchange</b> through bilayer lipid {{membranes}} (BLM) {{induced by}} nigericin {{was measured by}} the method of pH gradient offset according to Antonenko, Yu.

It was shown that under the conditions of high potassium ion concentration the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nigericin-mediated K+/H+ <b>exchange</b> increased with an increase in the concentrations of such buffer compounds as citric acid and MES. The concentration dependence was different for citrate and MES. The buffer concentration effect was absent at low potassium ion concentrations. Citrate increased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> K+/H+ <b>exchange</b> being added to the side of BLM where the K+ concentration was higher and had no effect at the opposite side. At High KCl and citrate concentrations, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> K+/H+ <b>exchange</b> was about 6 times lower in D 2 O when compared to H 2 O solutions. It is concluded that under certain experimental conditions the overall <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the K+/H+ <b>exchange</b> induced by nigericin is determined by the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> proton dissociation from nigericin at the membrane—water interface...|$|R
