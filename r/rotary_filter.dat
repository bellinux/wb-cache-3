The first type allows the solid particles, i.e. the residue, to be collected intact; the second type does not permit this. However, the second type is less prone to clogging due to the greater surface area where the particles can be trapped.

40|$|Funded by the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management, EM- 31, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{partnered with}} SpinTek Filtration{trademark} {{to develop a}} filter disk that would {{withstand}} a reverse pressure or flow during operation of the rotary microfilter. The ability to withstand a reverse pressure and flow eliminates a potential accident scenario that could have resulted in damage to the filter membranes. While the original welded filter disks {{have been shown to}} withstand and reverse pressure/flow in the static condition, the filter disk design discussed in this report will allow a reverse pressure/flow while the disks are rotating. In addition, the laminated disk increases the flexibility during filter startup and cleaning operations. The new filter disk developed by SRNL and SpinTek is manufactured with a more open structure significantly reducing internal flow restrictions in the disk. The prototype was tested at the University of Maryland and demonstrated to withstand the reverse pressure due to the centrifugal action of the <b>rotary</b> <b>filter.</b> The tested water flux of the disk was demonstrated to be 1. 34 gpm in a single disk test. By comparison, the water flux of the current disk was 0. 49 gpm per disk during a 25 disk test. The disk also demonstrated rejection of solids by filtering a 5 wt % Strontium Carbonate slurry with a filtrate clarity of less the 1. 4 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) throughout the two hour test. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has been working with SpinTek Filtration{trademark} to adapt the rotary microfilter for radioactive service in the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex. One potential weakness is the loose nature of the membrane on the filter disks. The current disk is constructed by welding the membrane at {{the outer edge of the}} disk. The seal for the center of the membrane is accomplished by an o-ring in compression for the assembled stack. The remainder of the membrane is free floating on the disk. This construction requires that a positive pressure be applied to the <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> tank to prevent the membrane from rising from the disk structure and potentially contacting the filter turbulence promoter. In addition, one accident scenario is a reverse flow through the filtrate line due to mis-alignment of valves resulting in the membrane rising from the disk structure. The structural integrity of the current disk has been investigated, and shown that the disk can withstand a significant reverse pressure in a static condition. However, the disk will likely incur damage if the filter stack is rotated during a reverse pressure. The development of a laminated disk would have several significant benefits for the operation of the <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> including the prevention of a compromise in filter disk integrity during a reverse flow accident, increasing operational flexibility, and increasing the self cleaning ability of the filter. A laminated disk would allow the filter rotor operation prior to a positive pressure in the filter tank. This would prevent the initial dead-head of the filter and prevent the resulting initial filter cake buildup. The laminated disk would allow rotor operation with cleaning fluid, eliminating the need for a recirculation pump. Additionally, a laminated disk would allow a reverse flow of fluid through the membrane pores removing trapped particles...|$|E

40|$|THE HIGH {{moisture}} content of mill mud (typically 75 – 80 % for Australian factories) results in high transportation {{costs for the}} redistribution of mud onto cane farms. The high transportation cost relative to the nutrient value of the mill mud results in many milling companies subsidising {{the cost of this}} recycle to ensure a wide distribution across the cane supply area.

This paper reports on {{one part of a}} process to pelletise mud and ash, aimed at making mud and ash more attractive to growers across entire mill districts. The full process is described in a separate paper. The part described in this paper involves re-constituting mud cake from the filter station at Tully Mill and processing it in a decanter centrifuge. The material produced by re-constituting and centrifuging is drier and made up of separate particles. The material needs to mix easily with boiler ash, and the mixture needs to be fed easily into a flue gas drier to be dried to low moisture. The results achieved with the particular characteristics of Tully Mill <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>filter</b> cake are presented. It was found that an internal rotor with a 20 º beach was not adequate to process re-constituted <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>filter</b> mud. A rotor with a 10 º beach worked much more successfully. A total of four tonnes of centrifuged mud with a moisture content ranging from 60 % to 65 % was produced. It was found that the torque, flocculant rate and dose rate had a statistically significant effect on the moisture content. Feed rate did not have a noticeable impact on the moisture content by itself but torque had a much larger impact on the moisture content at the low feed rate than at the high feed rate. These results indicated that the moisture content of the mud can most likely be reduced with low feed rate, low flocculant rate, high dose rate and high torque. One issue that is believed to affect the operation of a decanter centrifuge was the large quantity of long bagasse fibres in the <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>filter</b> mud.

The completion of this test satisfied a key milestone for the EM technology development program and technology readiness for deployment by Savannah River Remediation in the Small Column Ion Exchange and Sludge Washing processes at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) contracted SpinTek Filtration to fabricate a full scale 25 disk <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> and perform a 1000 hour endurance test with a simulated SRS sludge. Over 1500 hours of operation have been completed with the filter. SpinTek Filtration fabricated a prototypic 25 disk <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> including updates to manufacturing tolerances, an updated design to the rotary joint, improved cooling to the bottom journal, decreases in disk and filter shaft hydraulic resistances. The filter disks were fabricated with 0. 5 {micro} pore size, sintered-metal filter media manufactured by Pall Corporation (M 050). After fabrication was complete, the filter passed acceptance tests demonstrating rejection of solids and clean water flux with a 50 % improvement over the previous filters. Once the acceptance test was complete, a 1000 hour endurance test was initiated simulating a sludge washing process. The test used a simulated SRS Sludge Batch 6 recipe. The insoluble solids started at 5 wt% and were raised to 10 and 15 wt% insoluble solids to simulate the concentration of a large volume tank. The filter system was automated and set up for 24 hour unattended operation. To facilitate this, process control logic was written to operate the filter. During the development it was demonstrated that the method of starting and stopping the filter can affect the build up of filter cake on the disks and therefore the performance of the filter. The filter performed well with the simulant. Very little drop in production was noticed between the 5 and 10 wt% insoluble solids feed. Increasing to 15 wt% had a more pronounced impact due to the rheology of the feed. Acid cleaning was used to clean the filter disks in-situ and restore filtration rate to almost 90 % of the initial clean disk rate. Eighty liters of 0. 2 M nitric acid in conjunction with water rinses were used to clean the filter in less than 2 hours. Filter testing was completed after 1000 hours of operation were performed on the final filter assembly configuration. The total run time for the testing was over 1500 hours.

40|$|SRS is {{currently}} developing and testing several processes to treat high level radioactive liquid waste. These processes include the Integrated Salt Disposition Process (ISDP), the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF), and the Small Column Ion Exchange Process (SCIX). Each {{of these processes}} has a solid-liquid separation process that limits its throughput. SRNL researchers identified and tested the rotary microfilter as a technology to increase solid-liquid separation throughput. The testing showed significant improvement in filter flux with the rotary microfilter over the baseline crossflow filter (i. e., 2. 5 - 6. 5 X during scoping tests, as much as 10 X in actual waste tests, and approximately 3 X in pilot-scale tests). SRNL received funding from DOE EM- 21, and subsequently DOE EM- 31 to develop the rotary microfilter for high level radioactive service. The work has included upgrading the rotary microfilter for radioactive service, testing with simulated SRS waste streams, and testing it with simulated Hanford waste streams. While the filtration rate is better than that obtained during testing of crossflow filters, the authors believe the rotary microfilter throughput can be improved by using a better filter membrane. The rotary microfilter membrane is made of stainless steel (Pall PMM 050). Previous testing, funded by DOE EM- 21, showed that asymmetric filters composed of a ceramic membrane {{on top of a}} stainless steel support produced higher filter flux than 100 % stainless steel symmetric filters in crossflow filter tests. In that testing, the Pall Accusep and Graver filters produced 13 - 21 % larger filter flux than the baseline 0. 1 {micro}m Mott filter. While the improvement in flux is not as dramatic as the improvement of the <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> over a crossflow filter, a 13 - 21 % increase could reduce the lifetime of a 30 year process by 4 - 6 years, with significant cost savings. Subsequent <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> testing showed the Pall PMM 050 stainless steel filter membrane produced higher flux than the Mott filter media in bench-scale and pilot-scale testing. The Accusep and Graver filter media were not evaluated in that testing, because they are not available as flat sheets. The Accusep filter was developed at ORNL and licensed to Pall Corporation.

Preferred Features: The evaluation unit comprises a circuit. Adjustment is provided by sources of controlled voltages, controlling in turn, gains of the amplifiers. The evaluation unit is a computer including the summer. It multiplies the measured signals by stored gain parameters. A dispersive element, e. g. a prism (4) or grating, splits the measurement beam spatially. The detection cell includes adjacent detectors, each connected to a signal amplifier. The modulator is a spectral switch, selecting set spectral regions of the beam, with a detector (7). It is e. g. a <b>rotary</b> <b>filter</b> wheel. Alternatively, an interferometer is included with a beam splitter forming two optical paths, and a mirror adjusted by an actuator.

The implementation of the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) amendments of 1990 have affected every source of air pollution in the U. S. including cotton gins. The goal of this project was to develop guidelines, that will help cotton ginners comply with FCAA amendments at reasonable cost. Several alternate abatement strategies were proposed for removing particulate from cotton gin exhausts. Emission factors from these abatement strategies were estimated. The cost of investing in these strategies was estimated. The reduction in emissions, achieved by installing a better abatement strategy were calculated. The costs per tonne of reduction in emissions when changing from one abatement strategy to a more efficient strategy were estimated. Gins with a ginning capacity from less than 10 bales per hour to greater than 35 bales per hour were analyzed. These figures help in defining the "economic reasonableness" of investing in a particular strategy. The performance of <b>rotary</b> drum <b>filters</b> was evaluated using a small scale model at different inlet loadings of fine dust only and fine dust and trash combinations. Their performance was compared with cyclones and preseparator cyclone systems. Results from these tests suggest that cyclone systems are more efficient and less expensive than <b>rotary</b> drum <b>filters</b> in controlling particulate from cotton gin exhausts...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} operating parameters of disc filters are {{the height of}} the slurry tank, agitation and the intensity and rotation speed of the disc as these will determine the cake formation and drying times. It is important to continuously agitate the slurry in order to prevent sedimentation of the solids. Excessively high agitation intensity may affect cake formation or change the particle size distribution of the product. One of the most commonly used agitators for filtration using vacuum disc filters is an oscillating cradle-type agitator located {{in the bottom of the}} basin, which requires fairly high rotation speeds to form homogeneous slurry. For processing rapidly settling high concentration slurries, bottom-feed <b>rotary</b> disc <b>filters</b> are usually used.|$|R
50|$|The basic use of {{the rotary}} airlock feeder is as an airlock {{transition}} point, sealing pressurized systems against loss of air or gas while maintaining a flow of material between components with different pressure and suitable for air lock applications ranging from gravity discharge of <b>filters,</b> <b>rotary</b> valves, cyclone dust collectors, and rotary airlock storage devices to precision feeders for dilute phase and continuous dense phase pneumatic convey systems.|$|R
