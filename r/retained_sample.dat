40|$|The present {{research}} is aiming {{to investigate the}} influence of the context of learning implementation intentions over the efficiency of the intervention. 73 participants enrolled for participation in this study. They learned a behavioral self-regulation strategy meant to help them implement their intentions to increase fruit consumption. The participants were randomized in one of the three experimental conditions: ego-depletion, control, hopelessness. All the participants, regardless of the experimental condition they were assigned to, where given a presentation on implementation intentions. They all designed "if-then" plans to increase fruit consumption. The pretest results concerning fruit consumption within the 48 hours before participation showed that approximately half of the participants already eat more than three fruits within the last 48 hours before pretest. Hence we decided to exclude them from the analysis, because they would benefit less from implementing an implementation intention strategy as they are already eating at least two fruits / day as a minimum intake. The preliminary analyses made on the <b>retained</b> <b>sample</b> showed that there are {{no significant differences between the}} three experimental conditions regarding a change in quantity, calories or pieces of fruit from fruit intake. Even though the results are not statistically significant, in this pilot study we have noticed a descriptive trend suggesting that the ego-depletion effect might be less intense and transitory because the fruit intake (quantity, calories and pieces), at 96 hours after the experiment, seems to be almost the same as it was in pretest...|$|E

40|$|A capacitively coupled {{contactless}} conductivity detector cell {{was designed}} and constructed suitable for standard HPLC 1. 6 mm o. d. (1 / 16 ``) tubing and columns. Bode plots were acquired {{in order to determine}} the optimum input frequency for the new detector cell, with three feedback resistors of increasing resistance (1 M Omega, 3. 3 M Omega and 4. 7 M Omega) alternately fitted to maximize sensitivity. To evaluate the new detector geometry, a 190 mm x 0. 381 mm i. d. (1. 59 mm o. d.) column packed with Dionex OmniPac 8. 5 mu m PAX- 100 anion exchange resin was used, with an eluent of 0. 5 mM sodium benzoate containing 2 methanol, pumped at 20 mu L min(- 1), with detection taking place `on-column`. Standard analytical performance criteria were used to compare the test detector with a commercially available TraceDec (CD) -D- 4 capillary (360 mu m o. d.) detector, with the new detector cell matching the performance of the commercial instrument in terms of linearity, sensitivity and reproducibility. In `on-column` detection mode, the detector cell could be moved during (or between) chromatographic runs along the length of the packed column bed, to shorten the effective length of the column and thus reduce the retention time of strongly <b>retained</b> <b>sample</b> components, whilst maintaining the resolution of weakly retained components. In addition, the detector could also be applied to the evaluation of the stationary phase packing homogeneity by physically scanning the entire length of the micro-bore column with the moveable detector cell...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{subject of}} this paper is the concept of 'demonstrative concept', which has been {{introduced}} in philosophy by John McDowell in Mind and World. The analysis presented in the article has a reconstructive and a critical character. Its reconstructive drive may be viewed as required by the concise mode the philosopher adopted to present his theoretical innovation and comprehends an effort to make clear: (i) {{what is the difference between}} the temporal conditions necessary (a) to give conceptual status to the color shade we have before our eyes and (b) to our possession of ordinary concepts; (ii) the sui generis character of the universality proper to demonstrative concepts and the uniformity of their relations to what they are concepts of; (iii) the equivalence of their semantical regime to that which is proper to concepts of measurement standards; (iv) the very singular function performed by memory in the constitution and possession of demonstrative concepts. Now, the critical character of the paper firstly lies in the remark that there is a kind of inconsequence in the way McDowell conceives the employment of those concepts, namely in his refusal to admit that even though it is natural to say 'I see the shade in my mind's eye', it would be a mistake to think that when we recognize a color shade as being the same as the one we have seen before there is an inner comparison of it with the <b>retained</b> <b>sample.</b> The second of the paper critical points is the warning that, considering the complex constitution process of demonstrative concepts and its exacting semantic, it seems impossible to take them as coextensive to our human experience of colors...|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} and innovative sampling system called AirCore was presented by NOAA in 2010 (Karion et al., 2010). It {{consists of a}} long (> 100 m) and narrow (< 1 cm) stainless steel tube that can retain a profile of atmospheric air. The captured air sample has then to be analyzed with a gas analyzer for trace mole fraction. In this study, we introduce a new AirCore aiming at improved resolution along the vertical with the objectives to: (i) better capture the vertical distribution of CO 2 and CH 4, (ii) provide a tool to compare AirCores and validate the estimated vertical resolution achieved by AirCores. This AirCore-HR (high resolution) consists of a 300 m tube, combining 200 m of 1 / 8 in. (3. 175 mm) tube and a 100 m of 1 / 4 in. (6. 35 mm) tube. This new configuration allows to achieve a vertical resolution of 300 m up to 15 km and better than 500 m up to 22 km (if analysis of the <b>retained</b> <b>sample</b> is performed within 3 hours). The AirCore-HR was flown {{for the first time}} during the annual StratoScience campaign from CNES in August 2014 from Timmins (Ontario, Canada). High-resolution vertical profiles of CO 2 and CH 4 up to 25 km were successfully retrieved. These profiles revealed well defined transport structures in the troposphere (also seen in CAMS-ECMWF high resolution forecasts of CO 2 and CH 4 profiles) and captured the decrease of CO 2 and CH 4 in the stratosphere. The multi-instruments gondola from the flight carried two other low-resolution AirCore-GUF that allowed to perform direct comparisons and study the underlying processing method used to convert the sample of air to greenhouse gases vertical profiles. In particular, degrading the AirCore-HR derived profiles to the low resolution of AirCore-GUF yields an excellent match between both sets of CH 4 profiles, and shows a good consistency between vertical structures of CO 2 and CH 4. These results fully validate the theoretical vertical resolution achievable by AirCores. Finally, the uncertainties associated with the measurements are assessed, yielding an average uncertainty below 3 ppb for CH 4 and 0. 25 ppm for CO 2 with the major source of uncertainty coming from the potential loss of air sample on the ground and the choice of the starting and ending point of the collected air sample inside the tube. In an ideal case where the sample would be fully retained, {{it would be possible to}} know precisely the pressure at which air was sampled last and thus to improve the overall uncertainty to about 0. 1 ppm for CO 2 and 2 ppb for CH 4...|$|E
