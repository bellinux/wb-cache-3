50|$|The <b>relascope</b> has a {{sight hole}} {{on the back and}} a clear window at the front to allow the user to sight through the tool. There are three light inlet holes which are used to light the scale. This {{is one of the major}} {{problems}} with the <b>relascope,</b> the way this instrument is designed it cannot be used when light is at a minimum. This is not a problem in a similar piece of equipment called the tele-relascope. This instrument differs from the <b>relascope</b> in that the tele-relascope is an electronic laser based version.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Relascope</b> {{can also}} be used to find the {{distance}} from a tree (range). This is done in the same manner as when one uses a transit using a set of trigonometric formulae based on height and angle. The <b>Relascope</b> is not commonly used for this because of its difficulty and the amount of time it takes to do this.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Relascope</b> {{is often}} used for point sampling. This is done by using the set spacing marked in the <b>Relascope</b> to gauge whether a tree is {{in or out of}} the stand. When one says the tree is IN or OUT they mean does it fill the space between the lines on the scale in the <b>Relascope</b> if it does than this tree is IN if it doesn't than this tree is OUT (Figure 1). If the tree is IN this means that it is counted as basal area within one's plot. To figure out what this trees basal area is all one has to do is {{multiply}} the number of trees by the basal area factor which is based on the width of one's gauge.|$|E
50|$|Importantly, {{the bottom}} edge of the prism must be roughly {{parallel}} to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in forestry today because, the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other angle gauges when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center, and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking forest inventory are clinometers, Biltmore sticks, <b>relascopes,</b> and Diameter Tapes.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{national}} forest programs is to lead and steer forest policy {{development and implementation}} processes in an inter-sectoral way (FAO 2006). National forest monitoring systems contribute to forest programs through monitoring forest changes and forest services over time (FAO 2013). To do so, they generally collect and analyze forest-related data and provide knowledge and recommendations at regular intervals. The collection of forest-related data and their analyses have continually evolved with technological and computational advances (Kleinn 2002). For instance, ground measurements, such as diameter or height measurements, which were typically measured with measuring tape or forest compasses and <b>relascopes,</b> are now enhanced with new technologies, such as laser range finders. Furthermore, remote sensing is being increasingly used to improve ground sampling strategies (Maniatis and Mollicone 2010), to calculate forested land area and area changes (INPE 2006; INPE 2008; Hansen et al. 2013), and to detect many variables of interest such as forest fires, pest outbreaks, or trees outside forests (Barducci et al. 2002). The use of remotely sensed data together with ground-based observations has gained {{a lot of attention}} for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with forests, particularly in the context of REDD+ (GOFC-GOLD 2010; GFOI 2014). During the last decades, the amount of information collected during forest inventories has thus grown rapidly and has, in turn, improved our ability to survey and manage many services such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration, or recreation. However, national forest monitoring approaches remain very heterogeneous from one country to another, and many national systems have still not taken the full advantage of newly operational technologies, despite an increasing availability of free, or at least less costly, data. This is probably because the use of these technologies to assess forest structural properties is, for the most part, used by only a few specialists and is largely confined to the research sector. The objective {{of this paper is to}} raise awareness by presenting, in a comprehensible way, some existing and promising technologies for supporting national forest monitoring...|$|R

50|$|Lou Grosenbaugh {{realized}} {{the importance of}} Bitterlich's work and wrote a number of articles describing the method. Soon a host of devices from angle gauge, to <b>relascope,</b> to sampling prism were developed.

5000|$|Walter Bitterlich ( [...] ; February 19, 1908 - February 9, 2008) was a world-renowned forest scientist. A notable {{contributions}} of his to the forestry profession was {{the invention of}} the <b>relascope</b> used in forest inventories. The Society of American Foresters (SAF) declared him [...] "the world's most famous Ranger".|$|E
50|$|The <b>relascope,</b> {{invented by}} Walter Bitterlich, is a multi-use {{instrument}} for forest inventory. It is primarily {{used to find}} height of a tree, basal area of a tree and diameter of a tree anywhere along the bole. This instrument is used mostly for applications involving variable radius sample plots in a forest survey.|$|E
50|$|A {{variable}} size plot is {{more dependent}} {{of the size}} of the trees. The tract is measured on a series of points and the trees are tallied for being in or out depending on their size and location relevant to the plot center. Usually an angle gauge, wedge prism or <b>Relascope</b> are used to gather data for this type of plot. This allows for a very quick estimate of the volume and species of a given tract.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Relascope</b> is {{very similar}} to the angle gauge and the wedge prism in that {{it can be used to}} find the basal area of a tree from a point {{depending}} on the basal area factor in a variable radius sampling method. The main difference in this instrument though is that it has multiple uses as described previously. Some other advantages over similar devises in that it accounts for the slope one is from the tree giving a more accurate measurement than similar tools.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Relascope</b> is used {{by looking}} {{through the hole in}} the front of the instrument. When one looks through this hole they will see several scales that are used for {{different}} measurements on the bottom half of one's view, and on the top half one will see the tree that they are looking at. There are three scales for height of the tree used depending on the distance one is from the tree, five scales for diameter and two scales for basal area used depending on desired basal area factor.|$|E
50|$|Tree {{height is}} another {{use of this}} instrument. It does this by using several {{weighted}} wheels that spin based on {{the position of the}} instrument. The readings off of this scale will give the height of the tree based on your position from the tree. When taking height one measures either 66 or 120 feet from the tree this is the reason for the multiple scales in the <b>relascope.</b> When one stands at this distance they look first {{at the top of the}} tree or at the highest point on the bole that they want to measure and record the number from the height dial inside the scope, then one looks at the bottom of the tree this will give you a positive or negative number you take this number and subtract it from the first number one recorded this is one's height of the tree. This is very similar to the way a clinometer is used.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantification}} of coarse woody debris {{in terms of}} the total length of down logs of various types is presented. The method combines <b>relascope</b> and line intersect sampling theory. Estimation is based on a count of logs using a <b>relascope</b> instrument along a survey line. In costÂ­ efficiency comparisons with line intersect and circular plot sampling, the proposed method showed promising results.

30|$|In {{addition}} {{the expected}} costs, measured with time consumption {{as a function}} of plot size are needed for optimization. In fixed-radius plots the number of trees in a plot is proportional to plot area, but the time needed to check the borderline trees is proportional to the perimeter (Zeide 1980). In <b>relascope</b> plots, time consumption is inversely proportional to the fixed angle defined by the <b>relascope</b> factor. Although Kulow (1966) and Grosenbaugh & Stover (1957) compared the coefficient of variation using both fixed-radius and <b>relascope</b> plots, they did not compare the overall efficiencies of these two types of plots related to the time spent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Point <b>relascope</b> {{sampling}} and transect <b>relascope</b> sampling were recently proposed as methods for {{the inventory of}} downed coarse woody debris. By only counting logs with a <b>relascope</b> device, the total length squared (with point <b>relascope</b> sampling) or the total length (with transect <b>relascope</b> sampling) of downed logs in an area can be estimated. For estimates of other variables, such as volume, additional measurements on the sampled logs are required. In this article, two-phase approaches to the methods are presented that makes use of the estimates from fast counts of logs as auxiliary data. The presented approaches serve two purposes: (i) to improve {{the efficiency of the}} methods and (ii) to avoid the bias that is likely to occur if careful checks of whether or not doubtful logs should be counted are neglected. Each two-phase design was compared with a single-phase design in terms of the standard error obtained for a given inventory cost. The two-phase designs decreased the standard errors with ca. 17 - 18 % for points and 10 - 15 % for lines.

30|$|We studied two {{different}} subsample tree selection strategies. The strategy of measuring all large trees along with trees {{close to the}} plot center produced, on average, from 0.5 to 1.5 subsample trees in the different variations of the concentric plots, while the <b>relascope</b> selection strategy produced from 1.4 to 1.6 subsample trees. Although the difference {{may seem to be}} small, the strategies differed quite a lot with respect to measurement time. On the other hand, the differences in relative RMSE of volume were not large. Both the strategies acknowledge that the largest trees have largest variation in the volume estimates (Fig.Â  3), which makes them more attractive as subsample tree candidates. So, the <b>relascope</b> strategy with a larger <b>relascope</b> factor could have been more efficient still. The model was estimated from all the trees measured from the test area, and it therefore produced zero mean error for the whole area, but not necessarily within each diameter class. However, possible bias is implicitly accounted for in the simulations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this article, {{the effect}} of sloping terrain on {{estimates}} in point and transect <b>relascope</b> sampling (PRS and TRS, respectively) is studied. With these inventory methods, a wide angle <b>relascope</b> is used either from sample points (PRS) or along survey lines (TRS). Characteristics associated with line-shaped objects on the ground are assessed, e. g., the length or volume of downed logs. In their basic forms, the methods only work in flat terrain, and thus bias is incurred under sloping conditions. Two different possibilities to correct for bias due to slope are presented. The first one involves using a slightly modified <b>relascope</b> device and making a measurement of the angle of inclination of each sampled object. The second involves applying correction factors based on the steepness of the terrain in the area surveyed. However, it is shown that moderate slopes cause only limited bias and in such cases there is little need to adjust the measurement procedures or apply correction factors...|$|E
30|$|A more marked change {{occurred}} when {{the relative importance of}} losses compared to costs was reduced to 0.01 for all variables (EquationÂ  2). In that case, the optimal fixed-radius plot radius was 3 Â m, the optimal <b>relascope</b> factor 3 Â m 2 /ha with a maximum radius 6 Â m, and for concentric plots the optimal radii were 5 / 3 Â m with the diameter limit of 15 Â cm. In this case, the concentric plot had the smallest CPL (6.14) but the <b>relascope</b> plot was very close (6.18). That means that for all plot types, the optimal plot size was the smallest considered. When the weight of losses was increased compared to costs (weight 0.2 for all variables), the optimal radius for the fixed-radius plot was 8 Â m, the optimal <b>relascope</b> factor was 1 Â m 2 /ha with a maximum radius of 10 Â m, and the optimal concentric plot had radii of 11 / 7 Â m with a diameter limit 15 Â cm. It also had the smallest CPL (36.69).|$|E
30|$|<b>Relascope</b> plots {{were most}} {{efficient}} for volume and basal area, {{but not as}} efficient for stems per ha. For stems per ha, fixed-radius plot were optimal. When the weight for stems per ha is increased enough, the fixed-radius plot becomes optimal overall. If we considered an inventory purely for stems per ha or basal area, subsample trees would not be needed at all. In fixed sized plots, measuring the diameters would neither be necessary except for borderline trees. Subsample tree selection strategies would thus be irrelevant for such an inventory. However, if the subsample tree measurement costs were removed, and the measuring cost of each tally tree would be reduced (some time {{would be needed to}} record the species and check the borderline trees), the conclusion would still be the same: <b>relascope</b> plot type is the best for basal area and fixed-radius plot is the best for stems per ha. While in principle there are no advantages in using fixed radius over variable radius (Stage & Rennie 1994), in <b>relascope</b> plots the effective plot size for small trees constituting most of the stems per ha is so small that the <b>relascope</b> plot type is very inefficient for stems per ha. Concentric sample plots were a good compromise between efficiency and accuracy. It also turned out that the optimal plot radius in the tested area was somewhat smaller than the one used in current Finnish NFI, 9 m.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} plot type (fixed-radius plots, a combination of two concentric plots with a varying diameter limit, and <b>relascope</b> plots with varying maximum radius), different plot size (varying radii or <b>relascope</b> factor) and two different strategies for measuring subsample trees within plots (either all trees with d 1.3 [*]>[*] 25 Â cm and all trees within 1 Â m from the plot center, or with <b>relascope</b> factor 5 Â m 2 /ha). We examined three different variables, volume, basal area and stems per ha {{in order to reach}} a compromise solution that would be suitable for many other variables as well. We did not include class variables such as forest/non-forest classification or forest site or type classification, although these are important variables in forest inventory. In plot-level considerations, a very small plot or even a point would be optimal for many of these variables. Thus, including these variables to the calculations would make more sense if the whole design were optimized rather than just the plot type and size.|$|E
40|$|Introduction As {{a part of}} {{the project}} "Updating of the Finnish National Forest Inventory using Remote Sensing Data", we have studied and {{developed}} methods for assessing the performance of stand volume updating models on the basis of data from remeasured <b>relascope</b> plots. The general setting of our study can be defined as follows. Suppose we wish to test a given model, M, designed to update stand volumes from time t 1 to time t 2. Furthermore, suppose that, at time t 1, a set of sample plots is established and a <b>relascope</b> sample, S 1 i, is measured in each plot, i= 1, [...] .,n, including trees that have reached the breast height (1. 3 m) with inclusion probabilities proportional to the (breast height) basal area. Then a (usually rough) estimator of the time t 1 mean volume of growing stock per unit area in the stand containing plot i is given by the standard formula v k 1 1 1 # (1) where q is the <b>relascope</b> factor, v 1 k is the (time t 1) volume of tree k, and b 1 k its (time t 1) ba...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze optimal sample plot type and size with a {{simulation}} study and explore the relative effects of different factors on optimal plot measurement strategy in the special conditions of North Lapland. The study region is partially located close to the northern timberline, where clustered spatial patterns of trees challenge the planning of an efficient forest inventory. The studied plot types were fixed-radius plots with varying radii, a combination of two concentric plots with varying radii and varying diameter limits for the larger radius, and <b>relascope</b> plots with varying <b>relascope</b> factor and maximum radii. The forest characteristics concerned were volume, basal area and stems per ha. The class variables such as forest/non-forest were excluded from the study.|$|E
40|$|Abstract New {{sampling}} methods {{have recently been}} introduced that allow estimation of downed coarse woody debris using an angle gauge, or <b>relascope.</b> The theory behind these methods is based on sampling straight pieces of downed coarse woody debris. When pieces deviate from this ideal situation, auxiliary methods must be employed. We describe a two-stage procedure where the <b>relascope</b> is used to select pieces of downed coarse woody debris in the first stage. If the pieces so chosen on the first stage have multiple branches and detailed estimates are required for the entire piece, then a second stage sample is advocated using the randomized branch technique. Both techniques are reviewed and an example is given examining possible surrogate variables for the second stage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{critical}} length sampling for {{estimating the}} volume of downed coarse woody debris is presented. Using this method, {{the volume of}} downed wood in a stand can be estimated by summing the critical lengths of down logs included in a sample obtained using a <b>relascope</b> or wedge prism; typically, the instrument should be tilted 90 Â° from its usual orientation in sampling live trees. The critical length of a downed tree is {{the length of the}} log section large enough in diameter to be counted from the selected sample point. A simulation study was conducted to compare critical length sampling with diameter <b>relascope</b> sampling and perpendicular distance sampling. For the population studied, diameter <b>relascope</b> sampling tended to have the smallest variance but exhibited a small design-bias. By combining critical length sampling with critical height sampling-a method previously described for estimating the volume of standing trees-the total volume of dead wood in a stand can be estimated using the same basic principle. One use of the combined method might be in rapid in-place inventories where a quick estimate of the volume of dead wood is needed for biodiversity management purposes. The combined critical length/height method provides a relatively simple means for obtaining such estimates...|$|E

30|$|We {{assumed that}} {{diameter}} on tally trees {{is measured in}} two directions. Here we tested two subsample tree selection strategies. In the first one (fixed strategy or S 1), tally trees with d 1.3 [*]>[*] 25 Â cm were measured as subsample trees, along with all tally trees closer than 1 Â m to the plot center. The assumption here is that large trees are more important subsample trees than small trees, as they contribute more to the plot volume and the variance of their volume estimates is {{higher than that of}} small trees (see discussion below). In the second strategy (<b>relascope</b> strategy or S 2) the subsample trees were selected using a <b>relascope</b> factor 5 Â m 2 /ha, also assuming that large trees are more important than small trees. We assumed that the volume of the subsample trees could be measured error free (in fact there is error but it is assumed negligible), while for tally trees we assumed an error.|$|E
30|$|Forest {{site type}} {{and the degree}} {{paludification}} were assessed in the field. For easier modeling, forest site type was converted into site index (dominant height at 100 Â years) as follows (Vuokila and VÃ¤liaho, 1980): OMaT (mesotrophic herb-rich) 30 Â m; OMT (herb-rich) 27 Â m; MT (mesic) 24 Â m; VT (sub-xeric) 21 Â m; CT (xeric) 18 Â m. Intermediate values (e.g. MT+ and MT-, i.e., fertile and poor mesic) were given intermediate numerical values (25 Â m and 23 Â m). Afterwards, latitude of the site was obtained from a geographical map, and altitude of the stand was obtained from an elevation map. The basal area of canopy trees was measured separately for each species using <b>relascope.</b> The minimum, mean and maximum diameters of each species present in the canopy were measured from the <b>relascope</b> plot. Three trees per species were measured for diameter: the smallest, the largest, and the basal area median tree.
