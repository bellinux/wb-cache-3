5|$|Graph {{theory is}} at its most {{powerful}} in network synthesis when {{the elements of the}} network can be represented by real numbers (one-element-kind networks such as <b>resistive</b> networks) or binary states (such as switching networks).|$|E
5|$|The <b>resistive</b> Joule {{heating effect}} {{employed}} in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of <b>resistive</b> electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|Revision 1.2 of the {{specification}} {{was released}} in 2010. Several changes are made and limits are increased including allowing 1.5A on charging downstream ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5A, and allowing a maximum current of 5A. Also, support is removed for charging port detection via <b>resistive</b> mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in <b>resistive</b> random access memories.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be <b>resistive</b> but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to <b>resistive</b> terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections at the ends of the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a <b>resistive</b> termination.|$|E
25|$|A capacitor's {{summarized}} <b>resistive</b> losses may be specified {{either as}} ESR, as a dissipation factor(DF, tan δ), or as quality factor (Q), depending on application requirements.|$|E
25|$|Highly <b>resistive</b> ROs can be {{operated}} at AC voltages exceeding 200 V {{and used as}} low-power AC or DC relays, e.g., to control electroluminescent indicators.|$|E
25|$|Motor {{losses are}} mainly due to <b>resistive</b> losses in windings, core losses and {{mechanical}} losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.|$|E
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, experts {{speculate}} that non-volatile RAM types like PCM (phase-change memory), RRAM (<b>resistive</b> random-access memory), or MRAM (magnetoresistive random-access memory) could replace DDR4 SDRAM and its successors.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of intrinsic (spin-transfer torque) and extrinsic (<b>resistive</b> switching) mechanisms naturally {{leads to a}} second-order memristive system described by the state vector x=(x1,x2), where x1 describes the magnetic state of the electrodes and x2 denotes the <b>resistive</b> state of the MgO barrier. In this case the change of x1 is current-controlled (spin torque {{is due to a}} high current density) whereas the change of x2 is voltage-controlled (the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to high electric fields). The presence of both effects in a memristive magnetic tunnel junction led {{to the idea of a}} nanoscopic synapse-neuron system.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the thermal}} {{electrical}} noise {{continues to be}} related to <b>resistive</b> response in many more generalized electrical cases, {{as a consequence of the}} fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Below a variety of generalizations are noted.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of electrical charges produces {{a magnetic field}} (see electromagnetism). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least <b>resistive</b> path, often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically, where faults, ore bodies, or ground water offers a less <b>resistive</b> path. One theory suggests that lodestones, natural magnets encountered in ancient times, were created in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Results of the {{summarized}} <b>resistive</b> {{losses of}} a capacitor may be specified either as {{equivalent series resistance}} (ESR), as dissipation factor (DF, tan δ), or as quality factor (Q), depending on the application requirements.|$|E
25|$|In {{a purely}} <b>resistive</b> AC circuit, {{voltage and current}} {{waveforms}} are in step (or in phase), changing polarity {{at the same instant}} in each cycle. All the power entering the load is consumed (or dissipated).|$|E
25|$|In other circuits, like {{filament}} heater circuits in {{vacuum tube}} electronics where the load {{is almost entirely}} <b>resistive,</b> smoothing circuitry may be omitted because resistors dissipate both AC and DC power,so no power is lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all <b>resistive</b> losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the dielectric losses in the dielectric oxide layer.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{circuits}} containing dominantly <b>resistive</b> loads (incandescent lamps, heating elements) have a {{power factor}} of almost 1.0, but circuits containing inductive or capacitive loads (electric motors, solenoid valves, transformers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and others) {{can have a}} power factor well below 1.|$|E
25|$|According to Chua all <b>resistive</b> {{switching}} memories including ReRAM, MRAM and phase-change memory {{meet these}} criteria and are memristors. However, {{the lack of}} data for the Lissajous curves over a range of initial conditions or over a range of frequencies, complicates assessments of this claim.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} the <b>resistive</b> plate chamber {{particle}} detectors in the Large Hadron Collider. It is {{also used}} for other types of particle detectors, e.g. some cryogenic particle detectors. It can be used as an alternative to sulfur hexafluoride in magnesium smelting as a shielding gas.|$|E
25|$|To provide heat more efficiently, an {{electrically}} driven {{heat pump}} {{can raise the}} indoor temperature by extracting energy from the ground, the outside air, or waste streams such as exhaust air. This can cut the electricity consumption to as little as 35% of that used by <b>resistive</b> heating.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} dipole sound source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a sharp edge setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally cylindrical tube of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The streamlines clearly are distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified. The red streamlines in the tube are now augmented by the oscillatory flow in the tube, a superposition of <b>resistive</b> and reactive dipole flow and <b>resistive</b> acoustic flow.|$|E
25|$|This {{property}} {{can lead}} to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the <b>resistive</b> ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.|$|E
25|$|Impedance is the {{opposition}} to the flow of alternating current (AC) in a complex system. A passive complex electrical system comprises both energy dissipater (resistor) and energy storage (capacitor) elements. If the system is purely <b>resistive,</b> then {{the opposition}} to AC or direct current (DC) is simply resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all <b>resistive</b> losses of the capacitor. These are the supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes and the dielectric losses in the dielectric film. The largest share of these losses is usually the dissipative losses in the dielectric.|$|E
25|$|Chua applied {{this model}} to empirically-observed phenomena, {{including}} the Hodgkin–Huxley {{model of the}} axon and a thermistor at constant ambient temperature. He also described memristive systems in terms of energy storage and easily observed electrical characteristics. These characteristics might match <b>resistive</b> random-access memory relating the theory to active areas of research.|$|E
25|$|Thick film {{resistors}} {{became popular}} during the 1970s, and most SMD (surface mount device) resistors today are of this type. The <b>resistive</b> element of thick films is 1000 times thicker than thin films, but the principal difference {{is how the}} film {{is applied to the}} cylinder (axial resistors) or the surface (SMD resistors).|$|E
25|$|Because {{electrical}} power {{is equal to}} voltage times current, the relatively low voltages in existing DC systems imply relatively high currents. If the DC power in the contact wire is to be supplied directly to the DC traction motors, minimizing <b>resistive</b> losses requires thick, short supply cables/wires and closely spaced converter stations.|$|E
25|$|Resistors (and other {{elements}} with resistance) oppose {{the flow of}} electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called Joule heating (after James Prescott Joule), also called ohmic heating or <b>resistive</b> heating.|$|E
25|$|A quench is an {{abnormal}} termination of magnet operation {{that occurs when}} part of the superconducting coil enters the normal (<b>resistive)</b> state. This can occur because the field inside the magnet is too large, {{the rate of change}} of field is too large (causing eddy currents and resultant heating in the copper support matrix), or a combination of the two.|$|E
25|$|As current-limiting {{devices for}} circuit protection, as {{replacements}} for fuses. Current through the device causes {{a small amount}} of <b>resistive</b> heating. If the current is large enough to generate more heat than the device can lose to its surroundings, the device heats up, causing its resistance to increase. This creates a self-reinforcing effect that drives the resistance upwards, therefore limiting the current.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{corrosion}} {{the fuel}} {{system must be}} made of suitable materials, electrical wires must be properly insulated and the fuel level sensor must be of pulse and hold type, magneto <b>resistive</b> or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low concentration of contaminants and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.|$|E
25|$|To prevent some {{of these}} adverse {{physiological}} effects, the station is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced <b>Resistive</b> Exercise Device) which enables various weightlifting exercises which add muscle but do not compensate for or raise astronauts' reduced bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends {{at least two hours}} per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors (CCR) {{consist of}} a solid cylindrical <b>resistive</b> element with embedded wire leads or metal end caps to which the lead wires are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E
25|$|The op-amp is {{one type}} of {{differential}} amplifier. Other types of differential amplifier include the fully differential amplifier (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op-amps), the isolation amplifier (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to common-mode voltages that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and negative-feedback amplifier (usually built from one or more op-amps and a <b>resistive</b> feedback network).|$|E
25|$|The primary payload of STS-131 was the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo. The MPLM {{was filled}} with food and science {{supplies}} for the International Space Station (ISS). The MPLM also carried {{the third and final}} Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), Window Orbital Research Facility (WORF), one Crew Quarters Rack, the Muscle Atrophy <b>Resistive</b> Exercise (MARES) rack, Resupply Stowage Racks (RSRs), as well as Resupply Stowage Platforms (RSPs).|$|E
