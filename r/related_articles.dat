Ethington that spoke glowingly about both versions of the encyclopedia describing it as [...] "one of the finest collective works (with 633 listed authors) of North American historical scholarship of our era". [...] They praised it for its breadth and coherence. [...] The online version was noted for its meticulous hyperlinking. [...] The online review was cursory {{in the sense that}} it did not realize the expansion of the online version. [...] However, the review notes that the online version provides [...] "powerful and substantive" [...] interactive resources that are not possible in the print edition. [...] The review is especially respectful of the cartographic contributions, which it describes in detail. [...] It dismisses the alphabetical structure of the online version as an unnecessary complication. [...] The review also complains about biographical omissions that necessitate extensive navigation to <b>related</b> <b>articles.</b> [...] The review felt some of the online foibles left open the possibility that the production might get overshadowed by future ventures that leverage the electronic possibilities more fully.|$|E
