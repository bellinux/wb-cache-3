5|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the dive bomber, each with crews {{of two or}} three men. Wartime {{experience}} showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> and the development of more powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the consolidation of the two types of bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier's air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group to be increased.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
5|$|The coup-de-main {{force had}} been {{followed}} closely by the pathfinders of the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, tasked with marking out the drop-zones and landing-zones {{to be used by}} the rest of the division. However, due to a combination of heavy cloud cover and poor navigation, only one pathfinder team was dropped correctly. The aircraft carrying the remainder had to make between two and three runs over their respective drop-zones before their teams jumped. Pathfinders assigned to DZ N were dropped wide, and did not manage to get to the drop-zone for thirty minutes. The team assigned to DZ K accidentally dropped onto DZ N without realising their error, and set up <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> and markers that caused a number of airborne troops to drop in the wrong area. A pathfinder team belonging to 9th Parachute Battalion, assigned to mark out the drop-zone area for the unit tasked with destroying the Merville artillery battery, was all but wiped out when an air-raid by RAF Avro Lancaster heavy bombers missed the artillery battery itself and bombed the area the team was in.|$|E

25|$|With two of {{its three}} {{pathfinder}} teams operating their <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> to mark the drop zones, the British 2nd Brigade did somewhat better. From about 04:50, half of the 4th Battalion, one company of the 5th Battalion, {{and most of the}} 6th Battalion, totaling two-thirds of the brigade, landed in their drop zone. Most of the rest were scattered over an area nine miles northeast and northwest of Le Muy, around Fayence.|$|E
25|$|Danes, Norwegians, and Inuit were {{recruited}} into a sledge patrol {{to search for}} additional Axis weather reporting stations along the coast. Sledge expeditions also rescued Allied airmen making forced landings on the Greenland ice cap. Coast Guard work parties built range lights, shore markers and LORAN <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> to aid navigation. Northland landed 41 men with thirty tons of equipment to establish a high-frequency direction finding station on Jan Mayen in November 1942.|$|E
25|$|Cali's {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} had no functional radar to monitor the 757, {{as it had been}} blown up in 1992 by the terror group FARC. Cali's approach uses several <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> to guide pilots around the mountains and canyons that surround the city. The airplane's flight management system already had these beacons programmed in, and should have, in theory, told the pilots exactly where to turn, climb, and descend, all the way from Miami to the terminal in Cali.|$|E

25|$|Mk. VIII {{was also}} {{designed}} to use <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> for long-range homing on ground-based transponders. In {{this case the}} system {{was intended to be}} used with responders operating on the same frequency as the radar, as opposed to the Lucero which had its own frequencies. Since the dish had to be pointed downwards to see the transponder on the ground, the transponder sent out its response on a slightly different frequency so that it could be distinguished from the ground return.|$|E
25|$|After the {{accident}} Linjeflyg resumed service to Ängelholm with Douglas DC-3 aircraft. The airline changed its procedures regarding landing at Ängelholm, making more strict policies {{in regard to}} minimum visibility. Both <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> were moved to the conventional civilian locations. Flight 277 was the seventh loss of a Convair CV-240 family aircraft. At {{the time it was}} deadliest and now remains the fifth-deadliest accident of the type. The accident remains the deadliest aviation accident in Sweden. Linjeflyg would suffer one other fatal accident, Flight 618 in 1977, although it was a wet lease operated by Skyline.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the {{experimental}} Mk. VII units were beginning to arrive, the definitive Mk. VIII production version was being explored. One of the most pressing problems was the need to greatly reduce the size {{and complexity of the}} radar packaging, which almost completely filled the Beaufighter's rear section. Another issue was the desire to start using the new Sutton tubes for switching, which was expected to greatly increase the range of the system. Also desired was some way to use IFF and <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> with the AIS systems, as previous transponders had been deliberately designed to listen and respond on the original AI Mk. IV frequencies around 193MHz.|$|E
50|$|An amateur <b>radio</b> {{propagation}} <b>beacon</b> is a <b>radio</b> <b>beacon,</b> {{whose purpose}} is {{the investigation of}} the propagation of radio signals. Most <b>radio</b> propagation <b>beacons</b> use amateur <b>radio</b> frequencies. They can be found on LF, MF, HF, VHF, UHF, and microwave frequencies. Microwave beacons are also used as signal sources to test and calibrate antennas and receivers.|$|R

25|$|For mission safety, {{weeks before}} the manned mission on LK lander, an LK-R lander in {{unmanned}} L3 lunar expedition complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers {{would be sent to}} the Moon for preliminary study of surface around LK-R and LK sites, for work as <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> for precision landings of LK-R and LK, and for visual estimate of status of them. LK-R used as a reserve escape craft in case of disability to start from Moon of LK and Lunokhods used by cosmonaut for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular research. This manned version of Lunokhod were additionally equipped with oxygen stock with hose socket, standing pads and manual control for the cosmonaut in front part.|$|E
25|$|While {{stationed}} in Hawaii, Maitland sought {{permission from the}} Chief of the Air Service to organize a flight between Hawaii and the mainland. Not until December 1926, however, was he granted authorization. Others had also {{been working on the}} project, including 1st Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger, former Chief of the Instrument Branch at McCook Field. Hegenberger had overseen the development of a number of navigation instruments that would make the trip feasible but like Maitland had also been transferred to Hawaii, where his repeated written requests for a transpacific flight were likewise refused. In 1926 Hegenberger returned to McCook, where he helped test a navigation system using signals from low-frequency <b>radio</b> <b>beacons.</b> The transpacific flight from California to Hawaii was then approved to demonstrate the difficult task of navigating to a small island using the beacons as a navigational aid.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Alice {{characterized}} the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars {{as they pass}} behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere {{and its effects on}} the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of <b>radio</b> <b>beacons.)</b> Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.|$|E

25|$|The bulk of {{the report}} was {{dedicated}} to the navigational aids at Fornebu. The report underlined that false signals from the radio beacon were an important underlying cause. It noted that the beacon for runway 01 interfered with that for 06 and that up to three false signals could be transmitted. The commission recommended airlines enforce routines which ensured that multiple systems for determining position and bearing always be used, as a single system would never be reliable. It also recommended an extra radio beacon be installed in Drammen to aid approach to runway 06 and that airlines in the meantime not rely solely on <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> during approach to 06. The report also looked at the work-flow at the air traffic control. The airport had a radar system installed, but this was used solely for monitoring traffic and was not seen as a navigational aid. The commission commented that air traffic control could have prevented the accident had it recognized that the aircraft was on the wrong path and alerted the pilots. Sufficient equipment was installed, {{but there were no}} instructions for such activity.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the media}} hype {{described}} above, {{it appears that}} the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light. Such plans never came to fruition, as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete. By 1929 the Baltimore Sun reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable. In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. Leader cable systems appear to have been obsoleted by the refinement of radio direction finding and the placement of <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> (low-power radios broadcasting an identifiable signal) at strategic locations. They are analogous to lighthouses, but can be [...] "seen" [...] in all weather, and are used for navigation {{in the same way as}} regular lighthouses. The first successful application of these <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> as [...] "radio fog signals" [...] were three stations installed near New York in 1921. In 1924, there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped. By 1930, an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Arts declared that [...] "wireless aids and echo sounding have superseded [...] ". [...] Today, more modern navigation tools such as radar, GPS, and lighted buoys help ships navigate Ambrose Channel.|$|E
