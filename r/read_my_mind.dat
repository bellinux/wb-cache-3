500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Alanna Nash {{also gave}} the album {{positive}} feedback, viewing the album to have [...] "enough boiling rhythms and brooding melodies {{to reflect the}} anger and disillusionment {{of the middle class}} in the '90s", calling the track [...] "She Thinks His Name Was John" [...] to be the best example of that idea. The song was eventually spawned as a single and was considered controversial for its storyline, which described a woman who contracts AIDS from a one-night stand. Due to its subject matter, the song garnered less of a response from radio and peaked at No. 15. <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> became another major seller for McEntire and her label, selling three million copies by 1995 and certifying at 3Ã— Multi-Platinum from the RIAA.|$|E
500|$|Her eighteenth studio {{release was}} 1994's <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind.</b> The album spawned five major hit singles onto the Billboard Country chart, {{including}} the No. 1 single [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter". The further releases ("Till You Love Me", [...] "Why Haven't I Heard from You", and [...] "And Still") became Top 10 singles {{on the same}} chart, with [...] "Till You Love Me" [...] also reaching No. 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, a chart {{that she had not}} previously entered. The album itself reached No. 2 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Charlotte Dillon of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, calling it [...] "another wonderful offering of songs performed by the gifted country singer Reba McEntire". Dillon also felt that the album's material had [...] "a little soul, a little swing, and some pop, too".|$|E

5000|$|After {{spending}} {{months in}} Barbados, Stone travelled to Nassau, Bahamas, {{to meet up}} with Saadiq, who produced the entire album. [...] "Raphael is the most incredible musician I've ever met in my whole life", Stone said. [...] "Musically, I feel like he <b>reads</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> I'll give him a look and he'll know exactly what I want." [...] The two spent two months in Nassau recording at Compass Point Studios, followed by the album's mixing at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.|$|R

By 1977 Richards had relocated to the UK again. His 1978 album, Whiskey Sundown, appeared in December and from late that year {{into the next}} year he toured Europe as the support act for Dolly Parton, including shows in London. His next album, The Thing is ...?, appeared in January 1981 and was followed by If You Could <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> in December the following year. On 17 February 1983 Digby Richards died of pancreatic cancer, aged 42.|$|E
2500|$|Lightfoot {{was signed}} to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 {{and had a}} major hit in the United States with his {{recording}} of [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". It had sold over one million copies by early 1971, and was awarded a gold disc. The song was originally featured on his 1970 album Sit Down Young Stranger, which did not sell well. After {{the success of the}} song, the album was re-released under the new title If You Could <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind.</b> It reached No.5 nationally and the success of the song represented a major turning point in Gordon Lightfoot's career.

"Over 131 years, 404 {{men have}} been accorded to the honour of wearing the baggy green cap, arguably the most {{significant}} and recognizable symbol in Australian team sport," [...] wrote Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Glenn Mitchell. [...] "Many today would have hung their head in sadness while others would have turned and in their grave. What happened today in Nagpur was at odds with team sport is all about. May it never be allowed to happen again." [...] The barrage of Ponting's decision continued, with then Australian leading Test run-scorer (since overtaken by Ponting) saying on Fox Sports, [...] "I don't {{know what to make}} of this. They go into the tea break on a high and come out worrying about over-rates. I am glad Ricky can't <b>read</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> right now because he is not going to like it." [...] Ponting later admitted that Border's comment was the one that hurt him the most, despite News Limited reporter Jon Pierik describing his captaincy as a [...] "joke", while Malcolm Conn from The Australian wrote it was his [...] "worst day as national captain". Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference.|$|E

During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) public hearings, Dearboy said he was forcefully enlisted into the NPFL, in 1992, while searching for his girlfriend in Grand Bassa County. Three witnesses said that Dearboy raped a young woman and murdered several men, women, and children in Grand Bassa County during the civil war. Dearboy denied the accusation leveled against him. Dearboy expressed penitence {{for his role in the}} rebel movement, saying: [...] "The past is what no one is in control of. No one is <b>reading</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> except God.

60|$|Now as I <b>read</b> this book, <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> {{following}} {{step by step}} the author's advance {{upon the}} citadel of privilege, I was forced to admit that his main thesis was right. Unrestricted individual ownership of the earth I acknowledged to be wrong and I caught some glimpse of the radiant plenty of George's ideal Commonwealth. The trumpet call of the closing pages filled me {{with a desire to}} battle for the right. Here was a theme for the great orator. Here was opportunity for the most devoted evangel.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a sad}} change when, {{leaving the}} {{brilliant}} <b>reading</b> room where <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> had {{been in contact with}} these masters of scientific world, I crept back to my minute den, there to sit humped and shivering (my overcoat thrown over my shoulders) confronting with scared resentment the sure wasting of my little store of dollars.

6000|$|Captain Wawn is crystal-clear on one point: He {{does not}} approve of missionaries. They obstruct his business. They make [...] "Recruiting," [...] {{as he calls it}} ("Slave-Catching," [...] as they call it in their frank way) a trouble when it ought to be just a picnic and a {{pleasure}} excursion. The missionaries have their opinion about {{the manner in which the}} Labor Traffic is conducted, and about the recruiter's evasions of the law of the Traffic, and about the traffic itself--and it is distinctly uncomplimentary to the Traffic and to everything connected with it, including the law for its regulation. Captain Wawn's book is of very recent date; I have by me a pamphlet of still later date--hot from the press, in fact--by Rev. Wm. Gray, a missionary; and the book and the pamphlet taken together make exceedingly interesting <b>reading,</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R

60|$|Mr. Somerville {{perceived}} {{that the question}} was embarrassing, and, with his invariable good breeding, immediately resumed the conversation, without waiting for a reply. He took care, however, to turn {{it in such a}} way as to draw from me an account of the whole manner in which I had been educated, and the various currents of <b>reading</b> into which <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> had run. He then went on to discuss, briefly but impressively, the different branches of knowledge most important to a young man in my situation; and to my surprise I found him a complete master of those studies on which I had supposed him ignorant, and on which I had been descanting so confidently.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Aryeh for his reading of b. Sanh. 74 a- 75 a. The mark of a good <b>reading,</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> {{is that it does not}} merely explain a text, but {{suggests}} further creative interaction with it; and Aryeh 2 Ì† 7 s reading has done this for me. I will focus my remarks on the chief line to which Aryeh drew our attention (his line # 25, in my translation) : 2 Ì† 2 so also must (s) he be slain rather than he transgress. 2 Ì† 2 Just as the textual crux of *t/yehareg* provided Aryeh with the kind of uncertainty into which a wedge that opens the text for interpretation can be fit, lines 24 and 25 both share a grammatical indeterminacy that prompts further reflection. But bear with me a moment on my way to the Sanhedrin text; as a student primarily of the Tanakh, not the Talmud, I have a biblical errand to run before I can get there...|$|R

6000|$|While I was {{brooding}} {{over these}} plans Karema <b>read</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> {{perhaps because it}} was her own, perhaps by help of her strange arts, which I do not know.
