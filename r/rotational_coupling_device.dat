Based {{on this new}} standard a comparison with available loading standards for trailer <b>coupling</b> <b>devices</b> is performed and an optimized design of a trailer <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> is proposed. The derived loading standard is based on results of a public opinion poll in 2005 with 1200 trailer <b>coupling</b> <b>device</b> users.

40|$|To {{investigate}} a simple triatomic system, various measurements {{were performed to}} elucidate the excitation mechanisms of the (He-H 2 /D 2) + quasimolecule. These include total cross section measurements of the magnetic substates of the He(33 P) level populated in He+-H 2, He+-D 2 and He 2 +-He collisions and the He(31 P) level populated in He+-H 2 and He+-D 2 collisions. ^ The cross sections show an oscillatory behavior which {{suggests that there are}} long range interactions of the quasimolecular states (Rosenthal oscillations). The nature of the oscillatory structure is dependent upon the details of the potential curves of the (He-H 2 /D 2) + complex. Use of the quasidiatomic model allows construction of diabatic states that enable the identification of the dominant excitation channels. ^ In addition to oscillatory structure, the m 1 = ± 1 cross sections exhibit an isotope shift both in relative velocity dependence and in the magnitude of the cross section for population of He(31 P) and He(33 P) in He+-H 2 /D 2 collisions. Similar shifts are predicted by theories of <b>rotational</b> <b>coupling</b> in ion-atom collisions and result from differences in the projectile trajectories for the different target masses. The shift in relative velocity dependence which we observe is smaller than expected for ion-atom collisions. Extension of the ideas inherent in ion-atom <b>rotational</b> <b>coupling</b> to those of ion-molecule collisions enables interpretation of the smaller shift as being the result of a diffuse molecular target. ^ To further test whether the observed isotope shift is the result of <b>rotational</b> <b>coupling,</b> a series of coincidence measurements were conducted on the He+-H 2 /D 2 collision system in which the scattered neutral He was measured in coincidence with the polarized 3889 A radiation from the He(33 P → 23 S) transition. By using the appropriate scaled projectile velocities as found in the total cross section measurements, comparisons of results obtained for He+-H 2 collisions were made with He+-D 2 collisions. This ensures similar projectile trajectories and hence similar probabilities of <b>rotational</b> <b>coupling.</b> Recognition of the isotope shift as a signature of <b>rotational</b> <b>coupling</b> permits identification of the dominant quasimolecular excitation mechanisms. ...|$|R
