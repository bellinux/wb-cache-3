2500|$|In the 1980s, {{there was}} a {{backlash}} against industrial kitchen planning and cabinets with people installing a mix of work surfaces and free standing furniture, led by kitchen designer Johnny Grey and his concept of the [...] "unfitted kitchen". Modern kitchens often have enough informal space to allow for people to eat in it without having to use the formal dining room. Such areas are called [...] "breakfast areas", [...] "breakfast nooks" [...] or [...] "breakfast bars" [...] if the space is integrated into a kitchen counter. Kitchens with enough space to eat in are sometimes called [...] "eat-in kitchens". During the 2000s, flat pack kitchens were popular for people doing DIY renovating on a budget. The flat pack kitchens industry {{makes it easy to}} put together and mix and matching <b>doors,</b> <b>bench</b> tops and cabinets. In flat pack systems, many components can be interchanged.|$|R

The flooring {{will be the same}} baldozas mosaicos or machuca tiles, specially baked featuring the same design. Wooden <b>doors</b> and <b>benches</b> made of yakal, featuring sculpted banyan tree leaves. The windows handcrafted and baked by Kraut Art Glass with modern and symmetrical design. Chandeliers and ceiling murals commissioned pro bono to our very own Hermes Alegre, with the best visual artists in the Philippines. These works were made possible by the generous donations of a few family in Vinzons such as the Altar with Italian granite flooring. The church's pulpit was also restored using the wooden materials which survived the fire that gutted it 3 years ago.|$|R

5000|$|Mikita and {{teammate}} Bobby Hull {{were the}} most formidable forward duo of the 1960s, notorious for using sticks with curved blades. Such sticks gave a comparative advantage to shooters versus goaltenders. As a result, the NHL limited blade curvature to ½" [...] in 1970. Mikita reportedly began the practice after his standard stick got caught in a <b>bench</b> <b>door,</b> bending the blade before he hit the ice; he soon was borrowing a propane torch from team trainers to create a deliberate curve.|$|R
5000|$|A Hire Car version, the FL1 {{was also}} made, which had four full <b>doors,</b> a <b>bench</b> front seat, column gear-change and an umbrella-type {{handbrake}} handle. The two occasional seats faced forward. A 'driveaway' chassis-cab was also supplied to outside coachbuilders. Several shooting brake ('woodie' [...] ) bodies were made, {{as well as}} newspaper vans for the three London evening papers, the Star, News and Standard. A number of hearse bodies were also mounted on FL1 chassis by such coachbuilders as Simpson and Slater, Alpe and Saunders, Arthur Mulliner and Woodall Nicholson. Undoubtedly the most remarkable body built on an FX3 chassis belonged to Armenian oil magnate Nubar Gulbenkian. Built by London coachbuilders FLM Panelcraft, it was an open-drive town car, with carriage lamps and wickerwork decoration on the body sides. It was powered by a Ford six cylinder engine.|$|R

40|$|Aims of {{the study}} : {{the aim of the}} present study was to explore the {{interest}} of inertial load-velocity and load-power relationships for establishing resistance training zones. Materials and methods : 35 subjects went twice at the laboratory. The first session was used to determine bench press one repetition maximal (1 RM) while the second session was used to determine load-velocity and load-power relationships by the means of an inertial dynamometer. For each subject four major training zones (maximal velocity, power-velocity, strength-power, maximal strength), defined from the 1 RM, were compared to the corresponding training zones defined from inertial load-velocity and load-power relationships. Results: training zones defined from the 1 RM are significantly different (p< 0, 001) from the ones based on load-velocity and load-power relationships. According to load-power and load-velocity relationships results, maximal <b>bench</b> press <b>velocity</b> should be trained from 0 to 23 % of the 1 RM; power-velocity should be trained from 25 to 54 % of the 1 RM; strength-power should be trained from 54 to 82 % of the 1 RM and maximal strength should be trained with superior loads. Such muscular profiles defined with inertial dynamometers allow a more acute and individualised prescription for power-velocity resistance training. Peer reviewe...|$|R
500|$|There {{are seven}} Norse-era houses at Jarlshof, {{although}} {{no more than}} two were in use at one time. There were several outbuildings, including a small square structure with a large hearth that may have been a sauna and which was later replaced by two separate outhouses. The largest house from this period is a [...] by [...] rectangular chamber with opposing <b>doors,</b> timber <b>benches</b> along the long sides, and a hearth in the centre. Unlike the earlier structures that had conical thatched roofs, those of the Norse buildings had ridged timber frames. At a later period this large structure was also used to shelter domesticated animals (at which stage it had a paved centre and animal stalls along the sides) and later still may have become an outbuilding. The door to the byre puzzled archaeologists as it appeared to be too narrow to admit a cow. The mystery was solved when a byre door was excavated at Easting on Unst which had a narrow base similar to Jarlshof's but which widened out to become cow-shaped. Another outbuilding has been interpreted as a corn-drying room. Later houses were built at 90 degrees to the longhouse and these are of a type and size that is similar to croft houses that were common in Shetland until the mid-19th century.|$|R
40|$|Quality {{control and}} {{monitoring}} of perishable goods during transportation and delivery services {{is an increasing}} concern for producers, suppliers, transport decision makers and consumers. The major challenge is to ensure a continuous ‘cold chain’ from producer to consumer in order to guaranty prime condition of goods. In this framework, the suitability of ZigBee protocol for monitoring refrigerated transportation has been proposed by several authors. However, up to date there was not any experimental work performed under real conditions. Thus, the main objective of our experiment was to test wireless sensor motes based in the ZigBee/IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol during a real shipment. The experiment was conducted in a refrigerated truck traveling through two countries (Spain and France) which means a journey of 1, 051 kilometers. The paper illustrates the great potential {{of this type of}} motes, providing information about several parameters such as temperature, <b>relative</b> humidity, <b>door</b> openings and truck stops.

40|$|My {{presentation}} {{deals with}} announcements {{of death and}} funerals distributed all over Bulgarian locations. For instance, they are situated on trees, lampposts, <b>doors,</b> kiosks or <b>benches</b> and foreigners often ask why {{there are so many}} postings for wanted criminals — because they look like such postings because necrologies contain photographs of the deceased, as well as his name, year and place of birth and death. The main purpose of these announcements is overruled and they are the place for poetry, images and the most incredible decorations — flowers, saints, etc. On the other hand, Bulgarian necrology is the most free place for expression. One can do it by oneself, print and announcement and distribute it across the city. So, in a certain sense, in this kind of necrology, we may find a conflict between formal an informal discourse.

The station closed in October 1876, but was reopened by the LIRR in June 1878 as [...] "Hyde Park Central" [...] station, only to be abandoned on April 30, 1879. The station was reopened again as [...] "Stewart Manor Station" [...] in 1909, and included such features as a [...] "foot subway", crossing gates at New Hyde Park Road, and an [...] "SW Cabin" [...] for controlling manual block signals between Floral Park and Garden City. In 1915, {{the station was}} a flag stop. The entrances to the [...] "foot subway" [...] which can be found east of Roosevelt Street on both Manor Road and Plaza Road, were remodeled at some point, and the station in general was remodeled in 2006.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of kinematics and kinetics {{from the upper}} body musculature in shoulder flexion (bench press) and extension (bench pull) movements were performed across loads of 10 - 100 % 1 RM. Twelve elite male sailors with extensive strength-training experience participated in the study. 1 RM strength and force were greater in the <b>bench</b> press, while <b>velocity</b> and power output were greater for the bench pull across the range of loads. Pmax for both mean and peak power occurred at a significantly (p< 0. 000) higher relative load in the bench pull (78. 6 ± 5. 7 % and 70. 4 ± 5. 4 % of 1 RM) than the bench press (53. 3 ± 1. 7 % and 49. 7 ± 4. 4 % of 1 RM).

50|$|A clear way {{of seeing}} this is to {{consider}} the doors, which, {{in the frame of}} the garage, close for the brief period that the ladder is fully inside. We now look at these events in the frame of the ladder. The first event is the front of the ladder approaching the exit door of the garage. The door closes, and then opens again to let the front of the ladder pass through. At a later time, the back of the ladder passes through the entrance door, which closes and then opens. We see that, as simultaneity is <b>relative,</b> the two <b>doors</b> {{did not need to be}} shut at the same time, and the ladder did not need to fit inside the garage.|$|R
50|$|This {{station is}} {{noteworthy}} because the station building is on ground {{level and the}} single side platform is located 10.1 m below, inside a tunnel. The platform level is closed unless a local train is scheduled to arrive because of the strong winds generated by high pressure difference between the tunnel and the ground level. Passengers alighting at this station cannot loiter. They must leave the platform level within 2 minutes or PA system with monitoring camera will ask the passengers to leave immediately. There are two automatic doors, one on the ground level and another at the platform level. The automatic door on the ground level is locked, preventing access to the platform level, until the train driver remotely unlocks the door. The two automatic doors never open at the same time, again, to avoid creating strong winds caused by pressure gradient. There is an underground waiting room between the two <b>doors</b> with wooden <b>bench,</b> timetable, and a suggestion box. Above ground, the waiting room features tatami and is air-conditioned.|$|R
50|$|South of the Sahara {{it was a}} {{different}} story. Wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. The foundation stone of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Uganda was laid in January 1958, and it was dedicated on January 13, 1961. The building is more than 130 feet (39 m) high, and over 100 meters in diameter at the base. The green dome is made of fixed mosaic tiles from Italy, and the lower roof tiles are from Belgium. The walls of the temple are of precast stone quarried in Uganda. The colored glass in the wall panels was brought from Germany. The timber used for making the <b>doors</b> and <b>benches</b> was from Uganda. The 50 acre property includes the House of Worship, extensive gardens, a guest house, and an administrative center. Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum and then chairman of the central regional National Assembly Ali Nakhjavani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bahá'ís through Uganda and Kenya including seeing three regional conferences on the progress of the religion, staying in homes of fellow believers, and other events. She talked to audiences about the future of African Bahá'ís and their role in the religion. She visited Africa again on several trips from 1969 to 1973. In Ethiopia she was received by Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the chronic effects on strength and power of performing complex versus traditional set training over eight weeks. Fifteen trained males were assessed for throw height, peak velocity, and peak power in the bench press throw and one-repetition maximum (1 -RM) in the bench press and bench pull exercises, before and after the eight-week programme. The traditional set group performed the pulling before the pushing exercise sets, whereas the complex set group alternated pulling and pushing sets. The complex set training sessions were completed in approximately half the time. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was monitored during both test sessions in an attempt to determine if it was affected as a result of the training programme. Although there were no differences in the dependent variables between the two conditions, bench pull and bench press 1 -RM increased significantly under the complex set condition and peak power increased significantly under the traditional set condition. Effect size statistics suggested that the complex set was more time-efficient than the traditional set condition with respect to development of 1 -RM bench pull and <b>bench</b> press, peak <b>velocity</b> and peak power. The EMG activity was not affected. Complex set training would appear to be an effective method of exercise with respect to efficiency and strength developmen...|$|R
