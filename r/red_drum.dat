Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), <b>red</b> <b>drum</b> (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

500|$|Streptococcus iniae is {{a species}} of Gram-positive, sphere-shaped {{bacterium}} belonging to the genus Streptococcus. Since its isolation from an Amazon freshwater dolphin in the 1970s, S.iniae {{has emerged as a}} leading fish pathogen in aquaculture operations worldwide, resulting in over US$100M [...] in annual losses. Since its discovery, S.iniae infections have been reported in at least 27 species of cultured or wild fish from around the world. Freshwater and saltwater fish including tilapia, <b>red</b> <b>drum,</b> hybrid striped bass, and rainbow trout are among those susceptible to infection by S.iniae.

500|$|Biscayne Bay is {{a shallow}} lagoon with little {{vertical}} density or salinity gradient {{due to its}} lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals {{on the west side}} and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as <b>red</b> <b>drum.</b> Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is {{at the southern end of}} the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. [...] The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.|$|E

2500|$|Saltwater flyfishing is {{typically}} done with heavier tackle {{than that which}} is used for freshwater trout fishing, both to handle the larger, more powerful fish, and to accommodate the casting of larger and heavier flies. Salt water fly fishing typically employs the use of wet flies resembling baitfish, crabs, shrimp and other forage. However, saltwater fish can also be caught with poppers and other surface lure {{similar to those used}} for freshwater bass fishing, though much larger. Saltwater species sought and caught with fly tackle include: bonefish, redfish or <b>red</b> <b>drum,</b> permit, snook, spotted sea trout, tuna, dorado (mahi-mahi), sailfish, tarpon, striped bass, salmon, giant trevally and marlin. Offshore saltwater species are usually attracted to the fly by [...] "chumming" [...] with small baitfish, or [...] "teasing" [...] the fish to the boat by trolling a large hookless lure (Billfish are most often caught using this latter method).|$|E

Based on the reference weight-length relationship, a <b>red</b> <b>drum</b> that is 400 mm long {{is expected to have}} a weight of 655 grams. The condition index for that fish is its actual weight divided by its expected weight times one hundred percent, or (616g/655g)x100% = 94%. The fish in this example is below its expected weight, and a scientist might then look for more information to find out if other <b>red</b> <b>drum</b> in the area are also below expected weight. If <b>red</b> <b>drum</b> in the study area tend to be below expected weight, then the scientist might further investigate why this might be.|$|E
5000|$|... "Come On" [...] did {{not appear}} in Billboard magazine's R&B record chart, but gained a higher profile due to Jimi Hendrix. The song {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} songs played by Hendrix, starting with high school bands at the Spanish Castle music club south of Seattle. [...] In 1968, he recorded [...] "Come On - Part One" [...] with the Jimi Hendrix Experience for their third album, Electric Ladyland. Hendrix follows King's rhythm guitar parts, but performs the song at a faster tempo, giving the song a more rock feel. Bassist Noel <b>Redding</b> and <b>drummer</b> Mitch Mitchell also provide a more driving rhythm, which adds emphasis during Hendrix's guitar solo. It was the last song recorded for Electric Ladyland. [...] According to Redding, [...] "that was done to fill out the album ... We just played it live and they took it".|$|R

At the time Hendrix was performing under the name [...] "Jimmy James". In September, Chandler convinced James to accompany him to Britain, which was made possible {{with the help of}} Michael Jeffery, who suggested that he revert to his actual name, and later suggested naming the band the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In Britain, Chandler recruited bassist Noel <b>Redding</b> and <b>drummer</b> Mitch Mitchell as {{the other members of the}} Experience.

Redding had been a guitar player until that time, but played bass in the band. The name [...] "The Jimi Hendrix Experience" [...] was coined by their business manager Michael Jeffery. The first official appearance of [...] "The Jimi Hendrix Experience" [...] (invited by French singer Johnny Hallyday) was at the Novelty in Évreux, France, on October 13, 1966.
