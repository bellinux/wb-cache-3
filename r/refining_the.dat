5|$|A {{new kind}} of {{pollution}} entered the lower Saw Mill in 2003 when a Yonkers sugar refinery spilled hydrochloric acid into the river. Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro brought criminal environmental charges against American Sugar <b>Refining,</b> <b>the</b> plant owner, which was forced to pay a $20,000 fine; make a $100,000 donation to Riverkeeper, a regional environmental organization {{that focuses on the}} Hudson and its tributaries; and give one ton (800kg) of sugar to Westchester Food-PATCH, a local nonprofit that supplies food to other nonprofits.

On 19 December 1903 Det Norske Kvælstofkompagni was founded, followed by Det Norske Aktieselskap for Eletrokemisk Industri (today Elkem) in 1904; both were in part owned by the Wallenberg family, Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Young {{became an}} {{industrial}} research chemist, {{working in the}} lacquer industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became {{an assistant professor of}} chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum <b>refining.</b> <b>The</b> project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E
5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} well, {{there were signs}} that would ultimately lead to its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued <b>refining</b> <b>the</b> design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in <b>refining</b> <b>the</b> wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus <b>refining</b> <b>the</b> classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was <b>refining</b> <b>the</b> difficulty levels.|$|E
5|$|With their {{timeframe}} extended, {{the development}} team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and local network. The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} fit on the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time <b>refining</b> <b>the</b> gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E

5|$|Their {{partnership}} {{continued with}} 2014's Bayonetta 2, which sparked controversy {{for being a}} Wii U exclusive when its predecessor is a multi-platform title. According to executive producer Atsushi Inaba, the company worked with Sega to create the game's sequel. It was later cancelled {{in the middle of}} the game's development until Nintendo offered to work with the company to revive it and fund the project. Sega only served as the game's advisor. Inaba added that Nintendo did not actively interfere with the game's development, and compared its role to that of an observer. Kamiya, who originally did not expect a sequel to the game, served as the game's supervisor. Replacing Kamiya as the game's director is Yusuke Hashimoto. Hashimoto focused on <b>refining</b> <b>the</b> original's combat, and extending the game's replay value. Bayonetta 2 received critical acclaim on its launch, with several gaming publications awarding the game a perfect score. Though Nintendo did not comment on the game's sales, the title sold only 38,828 copies in Japan in its first week of release, faring much worse than the original. It became the seventh best-selling retail game in the UK in its first week of release, but sales declined significantly in the second week.|$|E
