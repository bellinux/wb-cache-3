The Renaissance induced {{a new kind of}} social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of {{the painting}}'s commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: [...] "During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them." ...|$|E

I am deeply honored to present the Heberden Ora-tion. William Heberden, Sr, possessed certain qual-ities that were unique in his era. His iconoclastic view of the contemporary state of the art and of medical authoritarianism sharpened his ability to discern what was novel in clinical settings.

He slipped into the middle of the room, but it was only to find her occupying his former position near the wall, and still, in spite of his disguise, watching him through <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> dancers. The persecution began to grow intolerable; he felt a kind of angry curiosity mingling now with the vague dread that had hitherto oppressed him. Finello's advice recurred to his memory; and he determined to make the woman unmask at all hazards. With this intention he returned to the supper-room in which he had left his friends.|$|E

Wide mirrors, glistening bottles, paintings of nude women, <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> polished glasses, a brawny, villainous barkeeper, with three attendants, all working fast, a line of rough, hoarse men five deep before the counter--all these things constituted a scene that had the aspects of a city and yet was redolent with an atmosphere no city ever knew. The drinkers were not all rough men. There were elegant black-hatted, frock-coated men of leisure in that line--not directors and commissioners and traveling guests of the U. P. R., but gentlemen of chance. Gamblers! ...|$|E

He stopped at last before a factory and looked tentatively up at the windows. Through the opened panes came the constant click of sewing machines, the smell of cloth, the vision of many heads bent over their work. He stood where he was for a time and watched. The place was like a hive of industry. <b>Row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> girls were there, seated side by side, round-shouldered, bending over their machines, looking neither to the right nor to the left, struggling to keep up to {{time to make sure}} of the wage which was life or death to them. It was nothing to them that above the halo of smoke the sky was blue; or that away beyond the murky horizon, the sun, which here in the narrow street seemed to have drawn all life from the air, was shining on yellow cornfields bending before the west wind. Here there was simply an intolerable heat, a smell of fish and a smell of cloth.|$|E

60|$|David {{passed out}} of the little garden, crossed the strip of park, and, taking the wheel, drove slowly round by the longer route to Broomleys. He passed before {{the front of the}} Abbey--a mansion of the dead, with <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> closed blinds, masses of {{smokeless}} chimneys, and patches of weeds growing thick in the great sweep before the house. Even with its air of pitiless desertion, its severe, semi-ecclesiastical outline, its ruined cloisters empty to the sky on one wing, its unbroken and gloomy silence, the place had its atmosphere. David slackened the speed of his car, paused for a moment and looked back at the little creeper-covered cottage {{on the other side of}} the moat. So those two had faced one another through the years--the Abbey, silent, magnificent, historical, with all the placid majesty of its countless rows of windows; its chapel, where Mandeleys for generations had been christened and buried,--at its gates the little cottage, whose garden was filled with spring flowers, and from whose single stack of chimneys the smoke curled upwards. Even while he watched, Richard Vont stood there upon the threshold with a great book under his arm.|$|E

50|$|The upright pile of Turkish rugs usually {{falls in}} one direction, as knots are always pulled down before {{the string of}} pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> knots {{on top of each}} other. When {{touching}} a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. The pile in Turkish carpets is usually between 2 and 4 mm thick. Coarse nomadic rugs like the Yürük rugs, can be as thick as 12 mm. A special bedding carpet called yatak may reach a pile thickness of 20 to 25 mm.|$|E

Traditional Sivas carpets were distinguished by their dense and short, velvet-like pile in elaborate designs which are characteristic for a [...] "town manufactory". The main border is typically composed of rows of three carnations, held together by a stem. Zara, 70 km east of Sivas, has an Armenian colony which produces rugs in a characteristic design composed of <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> vertical stripes extending over the entire field. Each stripe is filled with elaborate floral arabesques. The pile is clipped very short so that the detailed patterns can be clearly seen.|$|E
50|$|The upright pile of oriental rugs usually {{inclines}} in one direction, as knots {{are always}} pulled downwards before {{the string of}} pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling <b>row</b> <b>after</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> knots {{on top of each}} other. When passing one's hand over a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. Prayer rugs are often woven “upside down”, as becomes apparent when the direction of the pile is assessed. This has both technical reasons (the weaver can focus on the more complicated niche design first), and practical consequences (the pile bends {{in the direction of the}} worshipper's prostration).|$|E
50|$|The row {{on which}} the {{stitches}} crossed over each other {{is known as the}} turning <b>row.</b> <b>After</b> the turning <b>row,</b> several plain rows are worked, followed by another turning row.

25|$|The weaver needs {{a number}} of {{essential}} tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; {{and a pair of}} shears for trimming the pile <b>after</b> a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> knots, or a small number <b>of</b> <b>rows,</b> have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn <b>after</b> each <b>row</b> <b>of</b> knots is completed.|$|R

A perimeter fence ran around the rest of the pitch to keep supporters off the playing surface. Walking to the game would have been very different from today.
