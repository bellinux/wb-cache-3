5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia affects {{both the}} {{expression}} and reception of language. Both two most common types, expressive aphasia and <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> affect speech perception to some extent. Expressive aphasia causes moderate difficulties for language understanding. The effect of <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> on understanding {{is much more}} severe. It is agreed upon, that aphasics suffer from perceptual deficits. They usually cannot fully distinguish place of articulation and voicing. As for other features, the difficulties vary. It {{has not yet been}} proven whether low-level speech-perception skills are affected in aphasia sufferers or whether their difficulties are caused by higher-level impairment alone.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with transcortical sensory aphasia, in {{principle}} the most general and potentially {{among the most}} complex forms of aphasia, may have similar deficits as in <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> but their repetition ability may remain intact.|$|E
50|$|A {{fascinating}} corollary of {{this has}} come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to Expressive and <b>Receptive</b> <b>aphasias</b> in hearing populations. These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca's area and the semantic functions of Wernicke's area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.|$|R
50|$|Wernicke {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} conduction aphasia in his landmark 1874 monograph, Der Aphasische Symptomenkompleks: Eine Psychologische Studie auf Anatomischer Basis. He {{was the first to}} distinguish the various aphasias in an anatomical framework, and proposed that a disconnection between the two speech systems (motor and sensory) would lead to a unique condition, distinct from both expressive and <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasias,</b> which he termed Leitungsaphasie. He did not explicitly predict the repetition deficit, but did note that, unlike those with Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasics would be able to comprehend speech properly, and intriguingly, would be able to hear and understand their own speech errors, leading to frustration and self-correction.|$|R
5000|$|Wernicke's aphasia: The eponymous {{term for}} <b>receptive</b> or sensory <b>aphasia.</b> It is the {{inability}} to understand speech, or to produce meaningful speech, caused by lesions to the posterior superior temporal gyrus.|$|R
25|$|There are two {{different}} kinds of aphasic patients: Expressive Aphasia (also known as Broca's Aphasia) and <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> (also known as Wernicke's Aphasia). There are three distinctive dimensions to phonetics: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing.|$|E
25|$|In all {{of these}} ways, TSA {{is very similar to}} a more {{commonly}} known language disorder, <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia.</b> However, transcortical sensory aphasia differs from <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> in that patients still have intact repetition and exhibit echolalia, or the compulsive repetition of words. Transcortical sensory aphasia cannot be diagnosed through brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as the results are often difficult to interpret. Therefore, clinicians rely on language assessments and observations to determine if a patient presents with the characteristics of TSA. Patients diagnosed with TSA have shown partial recovery of speech and comprehension after beginning speech therapy. Speech therapy methods for patients with any subtype of aphasia are based on the principles of learning and neuroplasticity. Clinical research on TSA is limited because it occurs so infrequently in patients with aphasia that {{it is very difficult to}} perform systematic studies.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{damage to}} Broca's area and/or to {{neighboring}} {{regions of the}} left inferior frontal lobe are often categorized clinically as having Expressive aphasia (also known as Broca's aphasia). This type of aphasia, which often involves impairments in speech output, can be contrasted with <b>Receptive</b> <b>aphasia,</b> (also known as Wernicke's aphasia), named for Karl Wernicke, which is characterized by damage to more posterior regions of the left temporal lobe, and is often characterized by impairments in language comprehension.|$|E
5000|$|Wernicke's area ( [...] or [...] ), {{also called}} Wernicke's speech area, {{is one of}} the two parts of the {{cerebral}} cortex linked, since the late nineteenth century, to speech (the other is Broca's area). It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language (in contrast to Broca's area that is involved in the production of language). It is traditionally thought to be in Brodmann area 22, which is located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right handed individuals and 60% of left handed individuals). Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in <b>receptive,</b> fluent <b>aphasia.</b> This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike non-fluent aphasia, in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, telegraphic manner.|$|R

25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> {{in which}} the patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and {{effortless}} with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate {{if they try to}} replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E
2500|$|The term 'agnosia' [...] {{comes from}} the Ancient Greek á¼€Î³Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎ¯Î± (agnosia), [...] "ignorance", [...] "absence of knowledge".

[...] He noted that individuals with <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> did not possess the ability to understand speech or repeat words. [...] He believed that <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> was due to lesions of the posterior third of the left superior temporal gyrus. [...] Due to these lesions, Wernicke believed that individuals with <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> had a limited deafness for certain sounds and frequencies in speech.|$|E
2500|$|Individuals with <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> may {{speak in}} long {{sentences}} {{that have no}} meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new [...] "words" [...] (neologisms). For example, someone with <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> may say, [...] "You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round {{and take care of}} him like you want before", meaning [...] "The dog needs to go out so I will take him for a walk". They have poor auditory and reading comprehension, and fluent, but nonsensical, oral and written expression. Individuals with <b>receptive</b> <b>aphasia</b> usually have great difficulty understanding the speech of both themselves and others and are, therefore, often unaware of their mistakes. Receptive language deficits usually arise from lesions in the posterior portion of the left hemisphere at or near Wernicke's area.|$|E
40|$|Caloric {{vestibular}} stimulation (CVS) {{is commonly}} used to diagnose brainstem disorder but its therapeutic application is much less established.

40|$|Abstract: The {{assessment}} of the level and content of consciousness in brain-damaged patients relies {{to a large extent}} on behavioral assessment techniques. The limited behavioral repertoire displayed by vegetative and minimally conscious states requires the use of highly sensitive and reliable behavioral assessment methods, allowing the detection of subtle changes in behavior and associated level of consciousness. This situation is further complicated when patients with such disorders of consciousness have underlying deficits in the domain of communication functions, such as aphasia. The present paper examines the consequences of <b>receptive</b> and/or productive <b>aphasia</b> on the already limited behavioral repertoire presented in these patients and discusses a number of behavioral and neuroimaging assessment procedures designed to: (1) detect the presence of aphasia in patients with disorders of consciousness, and (2) reliably assess the level of consciousness of brain-damaged patients while taking into account the existence of receptive and/or expressive language deficits. The combined use of behavioral and neuroimaging assessment techniques appears to be particularly promising for disentangling impaired consciousness and aphasia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnostic and {{therapeutic}} instrumentation {{of the lower}} gastrointestinal tract {{has been reported to}} result in bacteremia and endocarditis. No such case has been reported in persons with a history of rectal foreign body insertion despite its potential for greater trauma. Case presentation A 58 -year-old male was admitted with confusion and inability to speak. His past history was notable for hospitalization to extract a retained plastic soda bottle from the rectosigmoid two years prior. On examination, he was febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive. There was an apical pansystolic murmur on cardiac examination. He had a mixed <b>receptive</b> and expressive <b>aphasia,</b> and a right hemiparesis. On rectal examination he had perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed infarction of the occipital and frontal lobes. Transesophageal Echocardiography of the heart revealed vegetations on the mitral valve. All of his blood culture bottles grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. He was successfully treated for bacterial endocarditis with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The rectum is frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus and trauma to its mucosa can lead to bacteremia and endocarditis with this organism. In the absence of corroborative evidence such as presented here, it is difficult to make a correlation between staphylococcal endocarditis and anorectal foreign body insertion due to patients being less than forthcoming Conclusion There is a potential risk of staphylococcal bacteremia and endocarditis with rectal foreign body insertion.
