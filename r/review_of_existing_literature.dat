50|$|As {{alarming}} as {{the findings}} {{at the various}} sites were, {{there was very little}} published material on the subject of frog deformities. Therefore, the researchers could not conclude that there was anything out of the ordinary, simply because they didn't know what the baseline rate of these deformities were. A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> on the subject showed that although deformities were a known phenomenon, there was no precedent for the variety or the rate of deformity that was being observed.|$|E

5000|$|Marco Bertamini {{criticized the}} Swami et al. study {{for using a}} picture of the same person with {{digitally}} altered leg lengths which he felt would make the modified image appear unrealistic. Bertamini also criticized the Swami study for only changing the leg length while keeping the arm length constant. After accounting for these concerns in his own study, Bertamini's study which used stick figures also found a preference for women with proportionately longer legs than men. When Bertamini investigated the issue of possible sexual dimorphism of leg length, he found two sources that indicated that men usually have slightly proportionately longer legs than women or that differences in leg length proportion may not exist between men and women. [...] Following this <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> on the subject, he conducted his own calculations using data from 1774 men and 2208 women. Using this data, he similarly found that men usually have slightly proportionately longer legs than women or that differences in leg length proportion may not exist between men and women. These findings made him {{rule out the possibility that}} a preference for women with proportionately longer legs than men is due proportionately longer legs being a secondary sex characteristic of women.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this {{investigation}} were adequate {{in terms of the}} evaluation criteria set used here because, in a particular project, {{only a limited number of}} land qualities need be selected for use in evaluation (FAO 1993). In this investigation, the evaluation criteria were selected taking into consideration the crop requirements regarding local conditions. In this MCE, the factors were selected based on agronomic knowledge of local experts and <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature.</b> Such an approach produced valuable information on the relative importance of the factors under evaluation and could be a useful precedent for future studies of rice and other crops. This investigation also provides general alternatives for local farmers in the area of agricultural land management of a particular crop.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to enhance the {{knowledge}} of High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) -Performance relationship by presenting a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> and suggesting a comprehensive framework for education industry. Design/methodology/approach: A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> is presented followed by its critical assessment. A conceptual framework is then provided in order to determine the HPWS-Performance relationship in education industry. Findings: Existing HPWS-Performance literature has mostly focused on manufacturing sector ignoring the service sector especially the education industry, the authors suggest that this relationship be determined in this neglected sector while considering the "industry-specific" mediating and contingent factors which may have an effect on this relationship. The authors provide an integrated framework to measure the effect of HPWS on performance. Research limitations/implications: The provided framework is yet to be tested empirically but can be used as a model for future research. Originality/value: The paper provides an overview of HPWS-Performance literature and provides a framework based on "industry-specific" factors for education industry for empirical testing.  </p...|$|E
