40|$|A computationally-efficient {{method for}} {{evaluating}} friction in molecular <b>rotary</b> <b>bearings</b> is presented. This method estimates drag from fluctuations in molecular dynamics simulations via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This is effective even for simulation times short {{compared to a}} bearing's energy damping time and for rotation speeds comparable to or below typical thermal values. We apply this method to two molecular <b>rotary</b> <b>bearings</b> of similar size at 300 K: previously studied nested (9, 9) /(14, 14) double-walled carbon nanotubes and a hypothetical rotary joint consisting of single acetylenic bonds in a rigid diamondoid housing. The acetylenic joint has a rotational frictional drag coefficient of 2 × 10 ^- 35 kg m^ 2 /s. The friction for the nested nanotubes is 120 times larger, comparable to values reported by previous studies. This fluctuation-based method could evaluate dissipation {{in a variety of}} molecular systems with similarly rigid and symmetric bearings.

50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} <b>rotary</b> <b>bearings</b> for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>bearings</b> hold {{rotating}} components such as shafts or axles within mechanical systems, and transfer axial and radial loads {{from the source}} of the load to the structure supporting it. The simplest form of bearing, the plain bearing, consists of a shaft rotating in a hole. Lubrication is often used to reduce friction. In the ball bearing and roller bearing, to prevent sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability and performance. The term [...] "bearing" [...] is derived from the verb [...] ""; a bearing being a machine element that allows one part to bear (i.e., to support) another. The simplest bearings are bearing surfaces, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, roughness and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices installed into a machine or machine part. The most sophisticated bearings for the most demanding applications are very precise devices; their manufacture requires some of the highest standards of current technology.|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to improve in vitro simulations of sideways falls on the proximal femur. An in vitro setup was developed that allowed exploring a range of loading directions (+/- 90 ° internal–external rotation; 0 °– 50 ° adduction). To enable accurate control of the loading conditions (direction and magnitude of all load components applied to the femur), the setup included a number of low-friction linear and <b>rotary</b> <b>bearings.</b> The setup was instrumented with an axial and a torsional load cell, three displacement transducers and a rotation transducer to monitor the most significant components of load/displacement during testing. The strain distribution was measured on the bone surface (16 triaxial strain gauges, 2, 000 Hz). Fracture was recorded with a high-speed camera. The setup was successfully tested on a cadaveric femur non-destructively (12 loading configurations) and destructively (15 ° internal rotation; 10 ° adduction). All measurements were highly repeatable (the displacements of the femoral head varied by < 2 % between repetitions; the tilt in the frontal plane by < 0. 05 °; and strain varied on average 0. 34 % between repetitions). The displacement of the femoral head varied by over 50 % when the same force was applied in different directions.

40|$|A common {{disturbance}} {{encountered in}} rotor operations is the sinusoidal disturbance caused by mass unbalance.

To help regulate the rotor and reject this disturbance, many researchers have investigated the use of Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs) and digital control as a viable replacement for the traditional <b>rotary</b> journal <b>bearing.</b> The non-contact nature of AMBs allows for greater speeds and opens the possibility for new applications.

40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{technology}} {{allows the}} fabrication of small mechanical systems in silicon using standard micro-fabrication pro- cesses. MEMS techniques have found wide acceptance in such devices as ac- celerometers, micro-mirrors, resonators, probes, and micro-tweezers {{to name a}} few. Though small linear motions are common in MEMS applications, few devices exhibit reliable rotary motion. This work explores several methods of fabricating <b>rotary</b> <b>bearings</b> using micro-balls as the support mechanism. Micro-ball bearings have several advantages over other MEMS bearing tech- nologies in that they provide robust mechanical support, require no external control systems, and basic designs require very few fabrication steps. Ball cages or retainers are common in macro-scale bearings, providing uniform spacing between the balls. Several cage designs are proposed and explored in this work: a radial ball bearing with an integrated ball cage, a dual-row style cage, and ve unique cage geometries integrated into silicon micro-turbines (SMTs.) Also, {{an example of a}} curved or angular contact race- way is presented as an example of this type of raceway geometry in MEMS devices. Each is presented with a discussion of the design considerations and fabrication process. This is followed by a characterization of the performance of each design. These studies found that the integrated cage in the radial ball bearing performs well at speeds ranging up to 20 000 RPM. Minimal wear was ob- served after 6 hours of continuous testing. However, the solder bond in the cage was a common failure point in these devices, limiting the reliability and longevity. The dual groove style cage was designed to eliminate the solder bond. However, the higher frictional forces between the ball and the cage in this design resulted in higher losses during operation. Taking into account the higher losses and the added complexity of the design, it seems unlikely that this approach would be appropriate for further study. However, the design does represent a novel approach for releasing multi-wafer rotary structures and is presented here as example of this technique. Testing of the cage de- signs for the SMTs indicated that a full ring design (a full annulus with holes for the balls) performed the best of the 5 cage geometries. However, these devices do not perform as well as cage-less designs for high speed applications due to higher ctional forces and increased raceway wear at the interface be- tween the ball and the raceway edge. Finally, the curved raceway has shown excellent performance up to 2500 RPM with normal loads up to 40 mN in tribometer testing. SMTs with this raceway desing were also tested for over 10 million revolutions and at speeds over 70 000 RPM.
