2500|$|When Marty {{arrives in}} 1885, the DeLorean's fuel line is pierced by an arrow during an Indian attack. He and Doc patch it {{and attempt to}} use whiskey as a <b>replacement</b> <b>fuel,</b> since {{commercial}} gasoline is not yet available; the test fails, destroying the fuel injection and ignition systems and leaving the car unable to travel under its own power. Its final trip, from 1885 to 1985, is propelled by a steam locomotive that has Doc's version of [...] "Presto Logs" [...] (pressed wood treated with anthracite) added to the boiler to provide the extra power needed to push the car up to 88mph; once this speed is reached, the Mr. Fusion unit provides the power required to activate the flux capacitor and make the jump through time. Doc replaces the 1955-style wheels with cast iron train wheels that fit on the track rails. [...] He uses the old tires and a wooden support to cushion the locomotive's [...] "cow catcher" [...] and the car's rear end. [...] Since {{each of the three}} [...] "Presto Logs" [...] fire at different intervals with increasing power, Doc installs a boiler temperature gauge on the DeLorean's dashboard to indicate when the car will experience a sudden burst of acceleration.|$|E

40|$|In this report, {{alternative}} and <b>replacement</b> <b>fuels</b> are defined {{in accordance with}} the EPACT. Section 301 of the EPACT defines alternative fuels as: methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 % or more (or such other percentage, but not less than 70 %, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, by rule, to provide for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions) by volume of methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols with gasoline or other fuels; natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials; electricity (including electricity from solar energy); and any other fuel the Secretary determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits. The EPACT defines <b>replacement</b> <b>fuels</b> as the portion of any motor fuel that is methanol, ethanol, or other alcohols, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal-derived liquid fuels, fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials, electricity (including electricity from solar energy), ethers, or any other fuel the Secretary of Energy determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.

50|$|Leonard G.

5000|$|The water gas shift {{reaction}} {{was discovered by}} Italian physicist Felice Fontana in 1780. It was not until much later that the industrial value of this reaction was realized. Before the early 20th century, hydrogen was obtained by reacting steam under high pressure with iron to produce iron, iron oxide and hydrogen. With the development of industrial processes that required hydrogen, such as the Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis, a less expensive and more efficient method of hydrogen production was needed. [...] As a resolution to this problem, the WGSR was combined with the gasification of coal to produce a pure hydrogen product. As the idea of hydrogen economy gains popularity, the focus on hydrogen as a <b>replacement</b> <b>fuel</b> source for hydrocarbons is increasing.|$|E

Being petroleum-poor but coal-rich, Germany used the Fischer–Tropsch process during World War II to produce ersatz (<b>replacement)</b> <b>fuels.</b> Fischer–Tropsch production accounted for an estimated 9% of German war production of fuels and 25% of the automobile fuel.|$|R

50|$|Jet fuel is {{very similar}} to diesel fuel, and in some cases, may be burned in diesel engines. The {{possibility}} of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas, and the lack of a <b>replacement</b> <b>fuel</b> with similar performance, has left aircraft designers and pilot's organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft. As a result, a few aircraft engine manufacturers, most notably Thielert and Austro Engine, have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel. This technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required. Jet fuel is available in most places in the world, whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of general aviation aircraft. A diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine. However, very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities. Diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today, even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the Junkers Jumo 205 family had been used during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|The {{survivors}} finally recover a <b>replacement</b> <b>fuel</b> cell, {{setting a}} second to overload and destroy the mine, {{before returning to the}} Marion. Once on board they witness the explosion on the planets surface. As the group heads to the medical bay to treat the wounded and gather supplies, they are attacked by the remaining Xenomorph and Lachance is killed. A revived Sneddon chases after the creature, eventually cornering it in a hold where she blows herself up as the Chestburster inside her begins to hatch, killing the adult Xenomorph as well. With time running out before the Marion enters LV-178s atmosphere and breaks up, Hoop and Kasyanov place Ripley in the ships med pod to treat her wounds. Tormented by recurring nightmares of her daughter Amanda Ripley being attacked by the Xenomorphs, Ripley also begs to have her memories of recent events wiped, and Hoop reluctantly complies. Kasyanov also enters the med pod to heal her own injuries, but Ash takes over and has the machine kill her.|$|E
5000|$|Avgas is {{currently}} available in several grades with differing maximum lead concentrations. Because tetraethyllead {{is an expensive}} and polluting ingredient, the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum. Historically, many post-WWII developed, low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels; a suitable unleaded <b>replacement</b> <b>fuel</b> {{has not yet been}} developed and certified for most of these engines. , numerous certificated reciprocating-engine aircraft require high-octane (leaded) fuels. Teledyne-Continental Motors states: [...] "Current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded ASTM D910 fuels. In such fuels, the lead acts as a lubricant, coating the contact areas between the valve, guide, and seat. The use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear {{due to the lack of}} lead. The result can be remarkable, with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours." [...] Lycoming has also provided a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with them. A number of their engines are not compatible with unleaded fuel according to their chart.|$|E
50|$|According to the Foundation, {{outdated}} regulations prevent drivers {{from making}} simple modifications to their engines {{that would enable}} their cars to run on alternatives fuels, hence threatening oil's monopoly over the transportation fuel market. Updating these regulations to allow for current vehicles to modify their engines would allow for a near-term, widespread expansion of fuel choice for drivers. Ethanol, methanol, natural gas and electric cars are seen as viable <b>replacement</b> <b>fuels</b> to compete against oil in an open market. No one fuel is explicitly favored over the others but most people believe methanol made from natural gas holds the most promise to break oil's monopoly.|$|R

The focus of this investigation is to find fuels that have short hypergolic ignition delays, high specific impulse, and desirable storage properties. The resulting hypergolic fuel/oxidizer combination would be highly desirable for virtually any high energy-density applications such as small but powerful gas generating systems, attitude control motors, or main propulsion. These systems would be implemented on platforms ranging from guided bombs to replacement of environmentally unfriendly existing systems to manned space vehicles...|$|R
