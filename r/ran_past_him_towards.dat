6000|$|She <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> {{and when}} he had put the lantern down, was {{standing}} at the window. She turned quickly to him. [...] "Take me away from here! Let me come with you!" ...|$|R
60|$|The bishop, being {{a privileged}} guest, and {{a cousin of}} his hostess, {{deliberately}} turned his back upon her and escaped from the conversation. The Duchess looked <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>towards</b> Saton, who was sitting a few places down the table.|$|R
60|$|Now {{again he}} saw the gypsy. She <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> half-a-score of men, armed with staves and pikes, at her heels. At first {{he thought they were}} chasing her. but they were {{following}} her as a leader. Her eyes sparkled as she waved them to the square with her arms.|$|R
6000|$|The gentleman was a {{scrupulously}} polite person. He looked {{with alarm}} at the ghastly {{face of the}} cook as she <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> making for the kitchen stairs. [...] "I'm afraid I intrude on you at an unfortunate time," [...] he said to Benjulia. [...] "Pray excuse me; I will call again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was frightened}} by the earnestness of his manner, and <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> to the window through which she was {{accustomed}} to hand the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again.|$|R

5000|$|Another one of Homurabi's five [...] "children" [...] in the manga. Implied to {{have been}} {{involved}} in the death of Ryuko. He had briefly met Kengo in the past when a young Akira and Kengo <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> on their way to school. He is also the one who murdered Ryuko by the order of Homurabi.|$|R
60|$|He {{would have}} stopped her by barring the way, he even thought of dismounting, {{thinking}} mayhap that she had left something behind at the cottage, and cursing his men for allowing her to return alone, but quick as a flash of lightning she <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> dragging her hood closer over {{her face as she}} ran.|$|R
60|$|Déroulède {{had sprung}} to his feet. In {{a moment he}} had thrust his own {{happiness}} into the background at sight of the poor child's obvious suffering. He went quickly towards her, and would have spoken to her, but she <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> up to Madame Déroulède, {{as if she were}} beside herself with some unexplainable terror.|$|R
6000|$|Without a {{word they}} entered the room, closing and bolting the door behind them. Then Dick leapt on Basil as a wolf leaps, and held him fat, while Hugh <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and threw wide the door of that chamber in which Eve had lain sick. It was empty. Back he came again and in a terrible voice, said: ...|$|R
50|$|Trip crawls {{out of the}} van, {{peers into}} the other car and calls to the driver (who is {{standing}} {{with his back to}} him). The driver glances at Trip, and <b>runs</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> down the street, One beginning to be played. Trip retrieves the gas tank, the map and a doll with a noose around its neck from the van, which The Memory Remains is played to. He wanders down a street, and a police horse drags a dead officer across his path. People <b>run</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> ignoring him, followed by police cruisers (one of which is ablaze). Emerging {{in the middle of a}} street, Trip realizes he is between a motionless group of rioters and riot police. The rioters then become rowdy, and when the police throw tear gas they swarm over them. Stunned by the violence, Trip stands in front of a window (which then shatters).|$|R
6000|$|... "One of {{the boys}} who came on those midnight serenadings became my hero--remember, I was only {{seventeen}} and he was twenty! We used to meet on the street--and oh! how it shook me. My heart fluttered so I could not speak, and at first I had to <b>run</b> <b>past</b> <b>him.</b> After a time I got composed enough to speak to him"-- ...|$|R
60|$|I was on {{the heels}} of him in less than ten minutes, though I must confess the fellow could walk amazingly. In half an hour I had <b>run</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> {{and at the end of}} the hour, such was my {{slashing}} gait, he was a mere black dot in my rear, and appeared to be sitting on one of the rails, thoroughly used up.|$|R
60|$|A housemaid on the {{staircase}} {{and the second}} nursemaid on the nursery landing above shared Sir Isaac's eagerness to hear her answer. But they did not hear her answer, for Lady Harman with a movement that was all too reminiscent of her mother's in the garden, swept <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>towards</b> {{the door of her}} own room. He followed her and shut the door on the thwarted listeners.|$|R
60|$|As Almayer {{approached}} the throng a man {{ran out and}} rushed <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>towards</b> the settlement, unheeding his call to stop and explain {{the cause of this}} excitement. On the very outskirts of the crowd Almayer found himself arrested by an unyielding mass of humanity, regardless of his entreaties for a passage, insensible to his gentle pushes as he tried to work his way through it towards the riverside.|$|R
25|$|Bryant {{was near}} the exit, {{preventing}} others from attempting to <b>run</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and escape. Bryant moved across the café towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up. He {{was shot in the}} arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.|$|R
6000|$|One day, then, the old diplomatist entered Lady Clavering's drawing-room, just as {{the latter}} quitted it, evidently in a high state of indignation, and <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> {{up the stairs to}} her own apartments. [...] "She couldn't speak to him now," [...] she said; [...] "she was a great deal too angry with that--that--that little, wicked"--anger choked the rest of the words, or {{prevented}} their utterance until Lady Clavering had passed out of hearing.|$|R
60|$|The {{hatchway}} was not open, but {{smoke was}} coming up thick and fast all around it. A half-dozen men were around a donkey-engine that stood a little forward of the hatch, and others were pulling at hose. The captain was rushing here and there, giving orders. I did not hear anything he said. No one said anything to us. Rectus {{asked one of the}} men something, as he <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> but the man did not stop to answer.|$|R
60|$|John {{made his}} way along, until {{he came to the}} end of the next street, and then paused. Already, three or four active figures had <b>run</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> at the top of their speed, and he wished to be the last to retreat. He stayed till he heard the tramp of troops coming down--driven out by the {{spreading}} flames--and then sprang across the end of the road and dashed along at full speed, still keeping close to the line of tents.|$|R
50|$|His <b>past</b> led <b>him</b> <b>towards</b> being {{nominated}} for the prestigious post of the chairman, Public Accounts Committee. He spoke against the sugar scandal and other issues that the then-current government was having.|$|R
50|$|On August 18, 1948, Fratianno {{used his}} wife and {{daughter}} to set up Cohen at his haberdashery store. Luckily, Cohen was washing his hands in the bathroom, a weird fetish he had of germs, after shaking Fratianno's hands. As Fratianno left, he signaled Dragna gang members and they rushed into the store. Frank Bompensiero stuck a sawed-off shotgun in Rothman's face and ordered him {{to get back into the}} shop. As two other hitmen <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> Rothman swung at the shotgun causing it to go off obliterating his face, killing him instantly.|$|R
50|$|The video {{features}} Noel {{filming a}} video where he walks {{down a street}} and a woman <b>runs</b> <b>past</b> <b>him.</b> Upon catching up with the woman, Noel notices that {{she is wearing a}} sleeveless top and gives her his coat. He then walks past a clothes shop where he takes a denim jacket from a rail and puts it on. He then sees a man drop a large case, which he opens to reveal a guitar. Noel then enters a building where a band is and performs the song whilst being watched by the man.|$|R
60|$|He {{was about}} to obey when a young; man, small and agile, <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> from behind, heedless of the panic. Stopping {{at the foot of}} the bank he dropped on one knee, resting his {{revolver}} in the hollow of his left arm. It, was Jack Brinsmade. At the same time two of the soldiers above lowered their barrels to cover him. Then smoke hid the scene. When it rolled away, Brinsmade lay on the ground. He staggered to his feet with an oath, and confronted a young man who was hatless, and upon whose forehead was burned a black powder mark.|$|R
5000|$|Even in 1945, the {{inhabitants}} of the Quintons believed that phantom black dogs roamed the area and were a harbinger of death. It is claimed that, soon after Walton's murder, a black dog was found hanging from a tree close to the murder scene, while Fabian himself wrote that he encountered a black dog while walking at dusk on Meon Hill. The dog <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and shortly afterwards he met a local boy walking in the same direction. He asked the boy if he was looking for his dog, but when Fabian mentioned the animal's colour, the boy turned a deathly pale and fled in the opposite direction.|$|R
60|$|How quiet it was! There were far-off voices, {{but they}} seemed {{suppressed}} and hurried. Through the window he {{saw one of the}} teamsters <b>run</b> rapidly <b>past</b> <b>him</b> with a strange, breathless, preoccupied face, halt a moment at one of the following wagons, and then run back again to the front.|$|R
60|$|He {{found the}} cold, grey cloud {{wilderness}} rising <b>towards</b> <b>him</b> with a wide, slow steadiness. As he sank down {{among them the}} clouds ceased to seem the snowclad mountain-slopes they had resembled heretofore, became unsubstantial, confessed an immense silent drift and eddy in their substance. For a moment, when he was nearly among their twilight masses, his descent was checked. Then abruptly the sky was hidden, {{the last vestiges of}} daylight gone, and he was falling rapidly in an evening twilight through a whirl of fine snowflakes that streamed <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>towards</b> the zenith, that drifted in upon the things about him and melted, that touched his face with ghostly fingers. He shivered. His breath came smoking from his lips, and everything was instantly bedewed and wet.|$|R
50|$|Ash {{finds out}} that Will can in fact walk that he killed Texas and Anna so she locks herself in the {{bathroom}} so that he doesn't hurt her. As she's screaming for help, Will kicks down the door. She <b>runs</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> {{in an attempt to}} escape but Will quickly grabs her, pins her to the floor and tries to strangle her. He's stopped however as Dodger interrupts them, and Ash quickly gets to her feet and says she hates Will. An explosion from Ste and Doug's leaving party below then erupts into the Kane's flat. As Will gains consciousness and runs over to Ash and tells her he's sorry and that he loves her, but it's too late as she dies in his arms, as she told him {{that he is going to}} hell.|$|R
50|$|On August 1, 2010, gunfire erupted at the station, {{sending a}} group of people running for cover as they were chased by a gunman on the platform. Police arrived at 10:32pm (EST). The gunman and the group were gone, but police {{recovered}} three spent bullet casings at the scene, and one bullet projectile {{at the base of the}} steps leading to the platform. One of the railings of the steps was struck by one of the bullets. A witness who had been walking about 50 feet behind the group on the platform stated he saw another man <b>run</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and fire three or four shots into the group. No one was shot or injured. The gunman, was described as being in his late teens, 5-foot-8, wearing blue jeans and a black T-shirt.|$|R
50|$|She springs {{into action}} remembering {{she had found}} the Thieves and Saints {{production}} company address and drives there only to be stopped by her Therapist who has been looking for her, fearing she is not mentally well. She <b>runs</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> into the building and {{to the floor of}} the Thieves and Saints writer's office. A 60's dressed secretary sits in a small lobby staring at a phone and asks how Sam is doing. Sam goes through the only door in the room and finds herself in a vacuous room - on one side extending to infinite black and the other with spools feeding into a typing machine. She exits the other side which takes her back into the secretary's office and has the same short conversation as if on a repeating loop.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger {{and witness}} Aaron Li-Hill said that upon {{boarding}} the streetcar he initially noticed Yatim {{sitting at the}} back, across {{from a group of}} teenage girls. [...] He later heard giggling {{from the back of the}} streetcar followed by a scream, then saw Yatim brandishing a knife as the girls <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> toward the front doors. According to witness Jessica Doyle, another passenger on the streetcar, Yatim seemed irate, mentally unstable, and oblivious to her presence as he walked directly past her aboard the streetcar. Doyle reported that as he walked past her, Yatim was holding his exposed genitals in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. According to Melody Garcia, another passenger, Yatim [...] "took his penis out with one hand and a knife in another." ...|$|R
50|$|His {{favourite}} ploy was, {{having taken}} a mark, {{to walk back}} and pretend to be preparing to do a drop kick, {{the man on the}} mark would jump into the air as Foote approached and, he would continue running towards the man on the mark, bounce the ball, and <b>run</b> straight <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> giving him the opportunity to deliver the ball much further up the ground.|$|R
6000|$|One day he {{had wandered}} a {{considerable}} way into the forest, {{and was about to}} turn to retrace his steps homeward, when he was surprised to hear some creature crashing through the woods <b>towards</b> <b>him.</b> It could not have been startled by himself, else it would have run away from him. Stepping behind a tree, he strung his bow, called Brownie close to his heel, and waited. A few seconds later a deer dashed close <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> but, as his belt was already hung round with game, and home was still far distant, he did not shoot. Besides, he was curious to know what had startled the deer. A few minutes revealed that, for suddenly the sound of footsteps was heard; then the bushes opposite were parted, and a boy, or youth just emerging from boyhood, <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> at full speed, with an arrow sticking through his left sleeve. He was unarmed, and gasped like one who runs for his life. Catching sight of the prince as he passed the tree that had concealed him, the boy doubled like a hare, ran up to Bladud, and, grasping one of his hands, cried--"O! save me!--save me!-- from robbers!" [...] in the most agonising tones.|$|R
5000|$|His {{affection for}} the <b>past</b> directs <b>him</b> <b>towards</b> his mother tongue - Kajkavian language. The most notable work of Domjanić is thus Kajkavian poem {{collection}} Kipci i popevke, and the poems [...] "Fala" [...] and [...] "Popevke sam slagal", both set to music by Vlaho Paljetak. Croatian composer Ivana Lang has {{in a similar manner}} set to music several Domjanić's poems. His lyrical expression, idyllic and sentimental, abounds both by the picturesqueness and musicality.|$|R
500|$|Barney {{was born}} in 1876 in Dayton, Ohio, to Albert Clifford Barney and Alice Pike Barney. Her mother was of French, Dutch and German ancestry and her father {{was the son of}} a wealthy {{manufacturer}} of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish. When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where Oscar Wilde happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour. [...] Wilde scooped her up as she <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him</b> fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, where their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously, despite, years later, her husband's disapproval. She later studied under Carolus-Duran and James McNeill Whistler. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|R
2500|$|Evans later {{asserted}} that the tow truck was a ruse. He claimed police snipers were already {{in the area and}} targeting him and his followers for assassination. These snipers fired on Evans and his followers first, he said. He claimed he was nowhere near the tow truck when shots were fired. [...] Instead, he said, he had left his home and was walking on west on Auburndale Avenue toward the Lakeview Tavern (a few feet around the corner to the south) when he heard shots [...] "coming {{from the end of the}} street". A man <b>ran</b> <b>past</b> <b>him.</b> Evans said he ran north to Beulah in time to see the tow truck operator running toward E. 123rd Street. He said he heard submachine gun fire, and said he assumed this was the blast which killed Leroy Mansfield Williams. Evans admitted that he fired several shots from his carbine, but the weapon then jammed. He fled into the home at 1384 Lakeview Road.|$|R
