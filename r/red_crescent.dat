5|$|The Lion and Sun is an officially {{recognized}} but currently unused {{emblem of}} the International Red Cross and <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> Movement.

5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E

5|$|On September 4, 1980, {{the newly}} proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iran {{replaced}} the Red Lion and Sun with the <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent,</b> consistent with most other Muslim nations. Though the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran {{has in the}} past reserved the right to take it up again at any time; the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{international}} institutions have their seats in Switzerland, {{in part because of}} its policy of neutrality. Geneva is the birthplace of the Red Cross and <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> Movement and the Geneva Conventions and, since 2006, hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland {{is one of the most}} recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|After Prapiroon dissipated, the {{regional}} Disease Prevention and Control Center of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas.

The International Red Cross and <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12-month span. Reconstruction in the areas devastated by Prapiroon began shortly after the typhoon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} International Red Cross and <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> Movement, the UN often takes {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works {{to protect the rights of}} refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.|$|E

The appeal asked for repair supplies {{and to improve}} the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the affected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks. The government-controlled media broadcast system guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses {{in the weeks after}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
5|$|Some navies operate ocean-going {{hospital}} {{ships to}} lend medical assistance in high casualty situations like wars or natural disasters. These hospital ships fulfill {{the criteria of}} an ambulance (transporting the sick or injured), although the capabilities of a hospital ship are more on par with a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. In line with the laws of war, these ships can display a prominent Red Cross or <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> to confer protection under the appropriate Geneva convention. However, this designation has not always protected hospital ships from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The International Federation of Red Cross and <b>Red</b> <b>Crescent</b> Societies made {{an appeal}} for almost 6million Swiss francs ($4.8million, 2006USD) to assist {{stricken}} {{families in the}} PRC.

50|$|The female of {{the common}} Mormon is polymorphic. In the Indian Subcontinent, it has three forms or morphs. These are as follows:Form cyrusThis form {{is similar to the}} male, differing in that it always has {{strongly}} marked <b>red</b> <b>crescents.</b> It is the least common of the three forms. It is normally abundant where the common rose or crimson rose do not occur, such as in Himachal Pradesh around Shimla; although a few specimens of form romulus have also been caught alongside.Form stichiusThis female form {{of the common}} Mormon mimics the common rose very closely. This is the commonest form wherever the common rose flies.Form romulusThis female form mimics the crimson rose and is common over its range. It is not such a close mimic as the previous form being duller than its model. It is easy to differentiate the mimics from models by the colour of their body—the models are red-bodied and the mimics are black-bodied.|$|R
50|$|She {{is perhaps}} {{best known as the}} creator of the Algerian flag. While there is some dispute over who exactly {{designed}} green and white with <b>red</b> star and <b>crescent</b> symbol, Émilie is generally credited as having sewed the first version of the flag.|$|R
