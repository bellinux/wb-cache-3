In this paper, we explore the feedback problem of a N-stage <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator.</b> This paper proposes a more rigorous approach to analyze the <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator.</b> It can be approximated that the feedback system of a <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator</b> can be a nonlinearLur’e problem.

With this Lur’e problem, the describing-function method is used to determine the oscillation frequency of the <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator.</b> A new formula will be presented. It can be also observed that if N (number of inverters) is large enough, the proposed formula will approach the conventional formula. Moreover, with describing function method, a “necessary condition”for the existence of fundamental mode and higher order modes of oscillations are presented.

40|$|Phase {{noise is}} one of the most {{restricted}} specifications in oscillators, especially <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators.</b> Phase noise will exhibit large fluctuations around its nominal value due to the increased process variation with technology scaling. These fluctuations will cause some fabricated <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators</b> not to meet the phase noise constraint and, hence, result in yield loss. This yield loss is expected to become worse especially for sub- 90 -nm technology nodes. In this paper, an analytical model for the phase noise variability in <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators</b> is proposed. The proposed model has been verified using Monte Carlo SPICE simulations for an industrial 65 -nm CMOS technology and is found in good agreement. The model shows that for the commonly used differential-pair-based <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators,</b> the main contribution in phase noise variability comes from the differential pair tail transistor. It also shows that the phase noise variability is reduced as the supply voltage increases. These results can be used to mitigate the phase noise variability and improve the yield through proper sizing of the tail transistor or higher supply voltage...|$|E
