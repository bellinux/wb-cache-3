40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the progressive attenuation field (PAF), {{a method to}} speed up computation of digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) images during intensity-based 2 D- 3 D registration. Unlike traditional attenuation fields, a PAF is built on the fly as the <b>registration</b> <b>proceeds.</b> It does not require any precomputation time, nor does it make any prior assumptions of the patient pose that would limit the permissible range of patient motion. We use a cylindrical attenuation field parameterization, which is better suited for medical 2 D- 3 D registration than the usual two-plane parameterization. The computed attenuation values are stored in a hash table for time-efficient storage and access. Using a clinical gold-standard spine image dataset, we demonstrate a speedup of 2 D- 3 D image registration {{by a factor of}} four over ray-casting DRR with no decrease of registration accuracy or robustness...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} three volumetric registration methods in terms of technique, user-friendliness and time requirements. CT and SPECT data from 11 patients were interactively registered using: a 3 D method involving only affine transformation; a mixed 3 D- 2 D non-affine (warping) method; and a 3 D non-affine (warping) method. In the first method representative isosurfaces are generated from the anatomical images. <b>Registration</b> <b>proceeds</b> through translation, rotation, and scaling in all three space variables. Resulting isosurfaces are fused and quantitative measurements are possi-ble. In the second method, the 3 D volumes are rendered co-planar by performing a oblique projection. Corresponding landmark pairs are chosen on matching axial slice sets. A polynomial warp is then applied. This method has undergone extensive validation and {{was used to evaluate}} the results. The third method employs visualization tools. The data model allows images to be localized within two separ [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an approach for building 3 -D city models for virtual environments from multiple 3 -D data sets acquired from different viewpoints by light striping. The raw data sets are represented as single valued parametric surfaces called the 3 -D profile maps. The profile maps are registered {{to the same}} coordinate system by an iterative surface matching algorithm developed previously. The <b>registration</b> <b>proceeds</b> hierarchically from low to high resolution and all the data sets are matched simultaneously but an initial registration {{is assumed to be}} known. After having segmented each map by a region growing algorithm, the maps are integrated into a piecewise planar surface model by merging compatible segments in the overlapping areas. The borders of the segments are also traced on the parametric domains of the maps as a step for building a wireframe model. Test results are shown {{in the case of a}} scale model of an urban area digitized in laboratory conditions. 1 Introduction The paper [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Authorities in Tuv aimag (province), near Ulaanbaatar, {{routinely}} denied registration to churches. There {{are currently}} no churches {{registered in the}} aimag, and several churches were again denied registration during the reporting period. A nongovernmental organization (NGO) filed a formal complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in May 2007 concerning the refusal by Tuv aimag authorities to register Christian churches. In June 2007 the Commission wrote to the Tuv aimag legislative body stating that the body's actions were {{in violation of the}} Constitution. Until the past year, almost all mosques throughout the country were registered as branches of one central Islamic organization. However, during the reporting period the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs clarified that each mosque needed to seek additional approvals from local authorities in their areas. This separate <b>registration</b> generally <b>proceeded</b> smoothly. However, one mosque in Darkhan-Uul aimag was told that the aimag legislature had approved its application, but it did not receive documentation, leaving it unable to register with the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs.|$|R

40|$|There exist many {{techniques}} for {{the measurement of}} micro and nano surfaces and also several conventional ways to represent the resulting data, such as pseudo color or isometric 3 D. This paper addresses the problem of building complete 3 D micro-object models from measurements in the submicrometric range. More specifically, it considers measurements provided by an atomic-force microscope (AFM) and investigates their possible use for the modeling of small 3 D objects. The general approach for building complete virtual models requires to measure and merge several data sets representing the considered object observed under different orientations, or views. A straightforward application of this scheme fails when acquisition methods for micro-objects, due to physical constraints, cannot provide the required positioning information for aligning the different views. The presented approach proposes to use an a posteriori software registration procedure that aligns views by registering common overlapping parts. It relies on the sole intrinsic properties of the object geometry and does not require additional measurements The actual <b>registration</b> process <b>proceeds</b> in two steps: a first rough interactive alignment of the views, followed by their automatic matching. Such generated 3 D models offer new possibilities {{for the analysis of}} micro-objects by visualization or measurement in 3 D space. First experiments are presented which demonstrate, among others, the successful alignment of three AFM views of a Ni-polymer substrate (used to fix particles) by geometric matching. The final goal of this work is to build complete virtual models of submicroscopic objects, for instance quartz particles measuring about 1 - 3 µm...|$|R
40|$|Background: Effective {{partnership}} between Aboriginal Health Workers and non Aboriginal {{health care providers}} is critical in reducing the health inequity facing Aboriginal Australians. Many factors can obstruct successful workplace partnerships causing them to be damaging and unproductive. Understanding the elements of best practice in forming and maintaining successful working partnerships between Aboriginal Health Workers and non Aboriginal health professionals is essential. Objectives: To systematically review the qualitative evidence on the lived experience of interprofessional collaboration between Aboriginal Health Workers and non Aboriginal health professionals delivering care to Aboriginal Australians, with the view of identifying the perceived skills, knowledge, attitudes, management practices and institutional policies that enable successful interprofessional partnership. Methods: A three-step search strategy, following the Joanna Briggs Institute method was used to find published and unpublished qualitative studies meeting set inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal and data extraction were completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instruments. Results: Following the search and appraisal process, thirteen qualitative papers met the inclusion criteria for this review. From these studies, 436 findings were extracted and aggregated to form 40 categories. Seven meta syntheses were derived from the categories with key themes relating to the benefits of effective partnership for the practitioner, the health service and the Aboriginal community, negative experiences {{as a result of}} a disabling work environment, and empowering factors at the organisational, workforce and interpersonal/practitioner level which enable successful partnership. Conclusions: Workplace culture and environments impact on the experiences of Aboriginal Health Workers and non Aboriginal clinicians working in collaborative clinical arrangements. When Aboriginal Health Worker's and non Aboriginal clinicians are empowered to work in a successful clinical partnership, through an enabling workplace, there is a great benefit experienced by both the practitioners, the Aboriginal community and the health service. When the workplace is a disabling environment to successful interprofessional partnership, this undermines the capacity of the Aboriginal Health Worker and non Aboriginal clinician to perform their roles within a partnership, resulting in negative experiences for the clinician, Aboriginal Health Worker and Aboriginal client. Implications: Aboriginal Health Workers need to be supported in their roles by both the non Aboriginal workforce and employing organisation to deliver care that addresses the cultural, social, and preventative health needs of clients alongside the biomedical needs. When embarking on collaborative work arrangements, Aboriginal Health Workers and non Aboriginal health care providers need training in each other’s roles, responsibilities of delegation of care, mentoring and supervision, and cultural competency development. Aboriginal engagement in health service delivery, planning and decision making at both the local and organisational level is vital. Aboriginal Health Workers need access to debriefing and cultural supervision to help negotiate the professional, personal and cultural obligations attached to their role. Aboriginal Health Workers need a work environment and space that provides a culturally safe place to work, that includes culturally competent managers, visual displays representing Aboriginal culture and an overarching organisational culture committed to interprofessional partnership and Aboriginal cultural competency for all staff. Aboriginal Health Workers also need access to quality training that is aligned with clearly articulated career development pathways that are adequately resourced, and delivered by a locally accessible educator. From a workforce perspective, further implementation of the career structure and governance around Aboriginal Health Worker <b>registration</b> <b>proceeds</b> to assist with the professional recognition of the role.

40|$|ResumoDe acordo com alguns autores, as faces consideradas belas apresentam-se em Proporção Divina, ou seja, na relação de 1 : 0, 618. Esta pesquisa investiga se essa proporção manifesta-se nas faces de pessoas selecionadas por avaliadores, utilizando, para tal, o critério de beleza. A amostra inicial foi composta por 104 pessoas, previamente selecionadas e separadas em grupos M (masculino) e F (feminino), sendo realizados, de cada participante, dois registros fotográficos (A e B). A partir do registro fotográfico A, obtiveram-se fotografias (frontal e lateral), que foram submetidas ao exame por um grupo de avaliadores. De posse dos valores atribuídos, foram identificados os sujeitos que comporiam a amostra final, assim constituída: subgrupos M 1 e F 1 (10 pessoas com valor numérico maior) e M 2 e F 2 (10 pessoas com valor numérico menor), totalizando uma amostra final de 80 fotografias (frontais e laterais) a partir do registro fotográfico B. Prosseguiuse com a análise facial propriamente dita. Os dados obtidos foram comparados com a Proporção Divina, observando-a em apenas duas das proporções avaliadas. Assim, pode-se afirmar que a Proporção Divina não está associada à percepção da beleza no contexto desta pesquisa.
