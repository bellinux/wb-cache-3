500|$|In 2016, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov {{commented on}} the global {{significance}} of the match, saying: I think the <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> look at these matches probably {{was not so much}} the chess factor but to the political element, which was inevitable because in the Soviet Union, chess was treated by the Soviet authorities as a very important and useful ideological tool to demonstrate the intellectual superiority of the Soviet communist regime over the decadent West. That’s why the Spassky defeat [...] was treated by {{people on both sides of}} the Atlantic as a crushing moment in the midst of the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Nation of Ulysses' {{music was}} noisy and manic, {{but they also}} had a strong free-jazz influence. The group {{embodied}} {{a rejection of the}} 1960s and 1970s music and styling by rejecting drug use and advocating that punk youth dress nicely and sensibly. To this end, the liner notes of 13-Point Program to Destroy America states the band's aim [...] "To dress well, as clothing and fashion, are the only things which we -- the kids -- being utterly disenfranchised, have any control over." [...] Much of the band admitted to not knowing how to play their instruments well, stating [...] "All you need is a concept. There's no <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> have to sound like Led Zeppelin." ...|$|E
500|$|A pop, electro-rock, and disco song, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] {{opens with}} Gaga's vocals over a keyboard, singing the line: [...] "There ain't no <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> and me should be alone tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby." [...] According to MTV's Jocelyn Vena, the song's {{production}} evokes the [...] "late '80s, early '90s adult-contemporary pop, when big choruses were {{the norm for}} songs." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard stated the song [...] "leans upon sunny electronica" [...] that sounds big on the chorus, where Gaga sings [...] "I'm {{on the edge of}} glory and I'm hanging on a moment of truth". Evan Sawdey of the website PopMatters found several rock elements in the composition of the song. Vena also felt that what made the song stand out from others on the radio was the saxophone solo by Clemons {{right in the middle of}} the track, as Gaga belts out, [...] "I'm on the edge with you." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy said that the musical composition is a mixture of loud-sounding electric guitars and club-beat influenced synths. The song and album ends with a long coda, with the sound of the saxophone fading out.|$|E

500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose the <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was {{so that no}} matter what they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was a great big question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{have called}} the Sci-Fi Dine-In more notable for being an {{attraction}} than a food destination. One reviewer from The Guardian compares the Sci-Fi Dine-In to Epcot's Coral Reef Restaurant, writing that both restaurants [...] "are great settings" [...] where [...] "eating is awful". Sehlinger and Testa consider the prices too high, and the food too simple, although they praise the Reuben sandwich and the ribs. Schultz writes that the food is simple {{and that some of}} the beers are decent. The book DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Walt Disney World Resort & Orlando also states that the food is more expensive than it is worth. Ed Bumgardner of the Winston-Salem Journal shared this opinion as well, specifically singling out the restaurant's roast beef sandwich as a ripoff, despite calling it delicious. Peggy Katalinich of the Tampa Bay Times writes that, although the food is mediocre, [...] "Who cares? Food is besides the point". She goes on to argue that the prices are low, particularly for sandwiches. In Frommer's Walt Disney World and Orlando 2012, Laura Lea Miller expresses disappointment that the menu no longer contains the playful item names it once did. She writes positively of the atmosphere, but considers the food mediocre. In the book Walt Disney World Resort: Also Includes Seaworld and Central Florida, Corey Sandler writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In is [...] "a must-see eatery... for adults and adventurous kids" [...] and that [...] "the food is appropriate for a drive-in theater—very ordinary, but that's not really the <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> came".|$|E

500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus {{with the aid of}} Armato, James, and Devrim Karaoglu. [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was {{intended}} for the media, regarding [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some <b>reason</b> <b>you</b> can't love them anymore, you have to take your feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take care of it. And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids and their kids ... Every generation has a cycle that'll carry on for the rest of eternity", she concluded. Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball's [...] "Four Walls" [...] from the album The Day Has Come (2006) for Breakout, titled [...] "These Four Walls". The twelfth and final track is a remixed version of the hit [...] "See You Again", referred to as the Rock Mafia Remix and the 2008 Remix; [...] "See You Again" [...] was originally released on the Meet Miley Cyrus disc of Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus.|$|E
