40|$|Abstract Education is {{a social}} {{institution}} and is subject to change in response to social dynamics. Because the teacher can provide the much needed quality control devices through student assessment, he/she {{can be seen as}} the manager, motivator or at best, the managing director and chief executive officer of the educational system. However, the Nigerian teacher is incapacitated in many areas due to the nature of environment he/she operates. The most meaningful information for improving instruction and providing clear and useful feedback to learners is collected daily in the classroom through classroom assessment of the learners. There is a direct relationship between appropriate classroom assessment techniques and higher student achievement, to the extent that when practiced effectively, can improved student learning. The academic imperative is for teachers to renovate their professional competence and capacity to be able to respond to the dynamics of classroom assessment. This paper therefore, discussed the status of Nigerian teacher and learning today, areas of capacity building for teachers to be able to respond to challenges of classroom assessment, the relationship between classroom assessment and improved student learning.

Such reinvented education should be based on appropriate assessment practices. The paper posits that the type of education that will ensure the transmission of techno-scientific skills, citizenship values and entrepreneurship should be anchored on well articulated teachers that are competent in delivery techniques and knowledgeable in comprehensive approaches to assessment. The current realities portray the teachers of basic education as half-baked in knowledge base and in pedagogical and communication skills. A revolution in assessment practices of teachers and teacher educators is canvassed while continuing professional development is critically important for serving teachers to retain their utility value. The modern model of assessments being advocated entails the use of individual assessment, group assessment, self-assessment, and peer-assessment in addition to the conventional paper-and-pencil tests.

Secondly, if Environmental Education were introduced in schools, to investigate the possibilities that it would create with regards to an awareness of local environmental issues. Thirdly, when projects are initiated at schools, to investigate the benefits to both teachers and learners. Lastly, to investigate the assumption that for any implementation of Environmental Education to be effective, teachers’ needs should taken care of, in terms of training through workshops as a way of helping them to adapt accordingly. An extensive literature review was undertaken to examine core areas of Environmental Education and the current curricula to establish where the emphasis of Environmental Education lay. The theoretical framework constructed from the review concluded with the premise that the issue of Environmental Education is of immense importance as reported in the NEEP-GET Project.

A number of overseas radio and television projects on formal teaching have been studied with the aim to determine which general tendencies could be singled out on these projects. From these projects particular conclusions have been drawn on the following: viability; resistance against such projects; other media that have been used with radio and television; target groups which could be reached; changes which would have to be effected in the conventional education programme; contact with groups of experts; possible ways to implementation and the role of research. A number of conclusions were reached, amongst others the following: radio and television have to be implemented in formal education in the RSA as soon as possible; radio and television programmes in formal education must initially be aimed selectively at those target groups where the greatest need for such programmes exist; producers of programmes for formal education must co-operate with experts. in relevant fields of study; provision has to be made for the training and <b>retraining</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> who will employ radio and television programmes.

40|$|M. Ed. Outcome Based Education (OBE) also {{referred}} to as curriculum 2005 has been implemented since 1998 in South Africa. Recent research done in OBE indicates that there are many varied reasons for the little progress in the implementation of OBE. Among the reasons and criticisms levelled against OBE is the training programme for 'teachers which is often said to be hurried and the complex terminology that is used in the workshops. This is the third year since the inception of OBE and the <b>retraining</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> in South Africa, but results indicate that very little progress has been achieved. Teachers confess that they become more confused in the workshops and that the terminology used is complex to them. As a result they are unsure of whether they are implementing OBE successfully in their classrooms or not. The focus of this study was on whether adult education principles had been incorporated in the training of teachers in OBE. Since teachers are adult learners it becomes important therefore that principles of adult education be incorporated in the training for effective teaching and learning to take place in these workshops. This study was conducted with a sample of five clusters of schools undergoing OBE training in the Alberton district. The findings indicated that adult education principles were generally not employed in these OBE training workshops. Facilitators were not well trained on how to approach the teaching and learning of adults, thus there was confusion and little understanding of OBE by teachers. The study concludes with a number of recommendations among which the training of facilitators on content and on the skills and knowledge of planning, organising and approaching adult teaching and learning are of importance...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{democracy}} in South Africa necessitated a radical transformation in education. It was recognised from the outset that the revision of History education was an activity {{that had to be}} accorded special consideration if the renaissance of education in South African public schools was to become a reality. Yet, precisely {{at a time when the}} nurturing of historical consciousness, especially among the youth, is so urgent an undertaking, the subject History is increasingly being judged as lacking in utilitarian purpose, and is deemed irrelevant and meaningless. A strong need is thus felt among History educationists to strengthen History studies because of its importance not only in itself but also because a knowledge of the past is crucial to an understanding of the present. In a South African educational context this thesis attempts to make a contribution to this worthwhile endeavour. It investigates the nature, functions, changing modes and historical role of historical consciousness in the writing and teaching of History in South Africa; proposes a heightened interest in adopting an outcomes-based approach to the teaching of history; and advocates an historical consciousness approach to the teaching of History to learners in the Further Education and Training phase (schools), within the framework of the above-mentioned Outcomes-based Education system. It recommends, among others, the training and <b>retraining</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> in the historical consciousness approach; the adoption of a fresh methodology; and the revamping and strengthening of the content and scope of the present curriculum to accommodate the new historical consciousness approach. The thesis concludes with a set of recommendations which could serve as a basis for the nurturing of historical consciousness in the South African History classroom. Educational StudiesD. Ed.

40|$|M. Ed. This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to examine the feasibility of teaching English to rural black teachers by distance education. It argues that the <b>retraining</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> {{is central to the}} reconstruction program of the ANC government and that English, as medium of instruction in most schools, is an area of weakness that needs to be addressed. It claims that failure to tackle this language issue creatively will contribute to the continued failure to achieve educational goals in South Africa. While it recognises the inability of formal institutions to cope with the enormous task of teacher retraining programmes, it seriously questions the effectiveness of teaching communicative competence by distance education. It claims that distance education does not achieve parity with conventional provision either in quality, quantity or status. It therefore {{sets out to}} find some of the 'missing links' to successful language learning and teaching in existing distance systems and to offer suggestions and recommendations for future consideration. A critical discussion of the literature on distance education, learning theories and adult second language learning, provides {{the context in which the}} training of black teachers is situated. The theoretical debates highlight the deficiencies in many of our existing language programmes and illustrate the need to implement the concept of mediated learning in the development of distance language study courses. The dissertation proposes the thesis that autonomous learning, which is central to the concept of both open and distance systems, conflicts with the general characteristics of black teachers who are products of the Bantu Education system. It emphasises the need to recognise these barriers to learning and advises the creation of a distance learning context in South Africa which exhibits a greater 'continuity of concern' (Sewart, 1978) by providing for a two-way dialogue through both tutor-learner and learner-learner interaction. The dissertation therefore deals with two prime concerns: the need to equip underqualified black teachers with communicative competence in English, which will facilitate learning in the classroom and the difficulty of teaching a skills based course at a distance (see also fig. 1 on p. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{realization}} that standards were falling and interest of science among learners in many countries was waning, {{a good number of}} research studies and policy reviews have been commissioned internationally, regionally and even locally to avert the situation. The government of Kenya attaches a lot of importance to education as exemplified by a good proportion of the allotment of the Government‟s expenditure on learning and teaching resources and in particular to Science education. This paper examines instructional intervention strategies which affect the teaching and learning processes based on a study of science education in Baringo Central District in Kenya. It is also concerned with establishing whether teachers‟ intervention in learning can boost science performance given the adequate instructional resources. An empirical study design was adopted for this investigation. The research instrument used was the questionnaire which was categorized into two: one for the students and another for the teachers. Respondents were divided into homogenous subgroups and stratified random sampling was used to identify three schools where three science teachers and a total of 36 students, 12 from each school were involved. The findings were analyzed using a descriptive approach for quantitative data while interpretative approach was employed for the qualitative data respectively.
