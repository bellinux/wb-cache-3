5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the <b>reflexive</b> form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E

40|$|Subjects with Broca's aphasia {{have been}} shown to display {{difficulties}} in on-line and off-line tasks involving personal pronouns and <b>reflexives.</b> Off-line tasks have indicated more errors with pronouns than with <b>reflexives</b> while the reverse has been found in on-line studies. In the present off-line study, the comprehension of sentences containing personal pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> is examined in a group of 10 agrammatic participants. Results indicate that subjects had difficulties with both pronouns and <b>reflexives,</b> particularly with <b>reflexives</b> in sentences that contained a quantificational antecedent, as well as with pronouns in exceptional case marking constructions. It is argued that the low performance that subjects exhibited as a group in pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> indicates two distinct impairments, one that concerns coreference and one that concerns A-dependencies, the latter being a manifestation of a general processing failure to link positions. Poor performance on exceptional case marking constructions compared to simple transitive sentences is claimed to be interpreted within theories for reference assignment that distinguish between the two sentence types.

40|$|This paper, {{in light}} of the notion of ‘minimal discourse-internal protagonist’, sets out to {{formulate}} as its analytic framework a pragmatic principle governing anaphora patterns and then explores the functions of third-person <b>reflexives</b> in Chinese discourse. The findings are in order. First, in Chinese, simplex <b>reflexives</b> are basically logophoric, whereas complex <b>reflexives</b> serve primarily to highlight and contrast discourse entities. Secondly, {{there are two types of}} constructions in Chinese in terms of anaphoric production: one is known as single-fold anaphora and the other as dual or multifold anaphora. And thirdly, our proposed pragmatic principle can very well capture the uses of <b>reflexives</b> in Chinese discourse. </p...|$|R
40|$|Research on Binding Theory {{shows that}} the syntactically-conditioned {{complementarity}} normally exhibited by pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> breaks down in certain syntactic environments, including possessorless picture-NPs (e. g. picture of {her/herself}). We report two psycholinguistic experiments which investigate what kinds of factors influence how pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> in picture-NPs are interpreted, given that their antecedents are not determined by Binding Theory. The {{results show that the}} interpretation of pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> in picture-NPs is governed by multiple factors. On the one hand, we corroborated the results of prior work which found that pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> are subject to opposing syntactic and semantic biases (Kaiser et al. 2009). However, on other hand, we provide evidence of shared biases: Both pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> dislike referentially underspecified antecedents, namely the indefinite existential ‘someone’ and wh-expressions. This pattern seems to fit well with claims that both forms prefer to pick out the antecedent whose point-of-view is being represented (Kuno 1987, Tenny 2003), assuming that referentially underspecified antecedents are not good point-of-view anchor...|$|R

The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several <b>reflexive</b> or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E

In Chinese, {{there are two types of}} long-range third-person reflexives: simplex and complex. They are ziji and Pr-ziji (pronoun morpheme and ziji), respectively. The relationship between these <b>reflexives</b> and the antecedents is logophoric. The distance between the <b>reflexives</b> and their antecedents can be many clauses and sentences apart. Ziji is used logophorically.Example 9) a. shows that the Chinese ziji can be used as a locally bound anaphor, as well as a long-distance logophor.|$|R

40|$|Binding theory (e. g., Chomsky, 1981) {{has played}} a central role in both {{syntactic}} theory and models of language processing. Its constraints are designed to predict that the referential domains of pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> are nonoverlapping, that is, are complementary; these constraints are also thought to play a role in online reference resolution. The predictions of binding theory and its role in sentence processing were tested in four experiments that monitored participants’eye movements as they followed spoken instructions to have a doll touch a picture belonging to another doll. The instructions used pronouns and <b>reflexives</b> embedded in picture noun phrases (PNPs) containing possessor phrases (e. g., Pick up Ken. Have Ken touch Harry’s picture of himself). Although the interpretations assigned to pronouns were generally consistent with binding theory, <b>reflexives</b> were frequently assigned interpretations that violated binding theory. In addition, the timing and pattern of eye movements were inconsistent with models of language processing that assume that binding theory acts as an early filter to restrict the referential domain. The interpretations assigned to <b>reflexives</b> in PNPs with possessors suggest that they are binding-theory-exempt logophors, a conclusion that unifies the treatment of <b>reflexives</b> in PNPs...|$|R
