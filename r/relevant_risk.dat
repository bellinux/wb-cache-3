5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a <b>relevant</b> <b>risk</b> to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} precautionary strategies of constitutional design and interpret-ation. In many contexts, constitutional actors and theorists justify rules {{of constitutional law}} as precautionary measures against various political risks, including the abuse of power by incumbent officials, dictatorship, majoritarian oppression, and biased adjudi-cation. After providing an analytic taxonomy of such arguments, I examine criticisms of constitutional precautions offered by early proponents of national power such as Hamilton, Marshall and Story, and by New Dealers such as Frankfurter and Jackson. These critics argued that precautionary constitutionalism might be futile, might jeop-ardize other values, and might even prove perversely self-defeating, if and because the precautions create or exacerbate the very risks they were intended to prevent. Accordingly, these critics argued for a “mature position ” that requires constitutional rulemakers to consider all <b>relevant</b> <b>risks</b> of action and of inaction. I identify a strictly negative but nonetheless valuable function of that approach: by laundering out one-sided arguments and placing all <b>relevant</b> <b>risks</b> before constitutional rulemakers, the mature position improves the process of constitutional design and interpretation. Disciplines such as decision theory and game theory, welfare economics, pol-itical science, and psychology have all contributed to a well-structured set of insights that go {{under the heading of}} “risk analysis”. In what follows, I will begin to arbitrage the insights of risk analysis into constitutional law and theory. Whereas ordinary risk regulation usually addresses “first-order risks ” arising from the natural environment, the market, or technology, I will understand constitutions as devices for regulating “second-order risks ” that arise from the allocation of power across institutions; I will call these “political ” risks. 2 On thi...|$|R
