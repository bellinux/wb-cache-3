The question is whether k or more transitions can be saved by replacing <b>regular</b> <b>transitions</b> with failure transitions.

The production of a blend of antibiotics by B. gladioli, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin and two new antimicrobial compounds, the macrolide lagriene and the isothiocyanate sinapigladioside, likely mediate this defensive role. In addition to vertical transmission, these insect symbionts can be exchanged via the host plant and retain the ability to initiate systemic plant infection {{at the expense of}} the plant’s fitness.

40|$|Motor rituals in {{the context}} of animals in the wild, in captivity, in a model of obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder (OCD), in normal humans, and in OCD patients, involve repetitive performance and share analogous form, resulting in confusion between stereotyped, compulsive, and normal behavior. We proposed that durable coupling between rituals and specific locations/objects, and <b>regular</b> <b>transitions</b> between these locations/objects, form a contextual framework for studying rituals. In either animal behavior or OCD patients, rituals are analyzed in five steps: (1) identifying key locations/objects at which rituals are displayed; (2) listing types of movements, acts, or actions displayed at these locations/objects; (3) scoring transitions between locations/objects; (4) scoring order of the set of acts at each location/object; (5) quantifying repetitions across and within locations. By using this approach, it is possible to compare entirely different compulsive rituals, to discriminate locations with compulsive rituals, and to uncover spatiotempral components in OCD patients. The results of this analysis may then serve in characterizing, treating, and assessing the efficacy of treatments in OCD patients.

The model allows for the closed form evaluation of the sound speed in the cavitating mixture, with <b>regular</b> <b>transition</b> to the sonic speed in the liquid at zero void fraction. Numerical integration from the saturation conditions then leads to the barotropic relation for the cavitating/fully-wetted flow, depending on the value of the pressure. Speed of sound curves for three different liquids are shown (water, LOX and LN 2), highlighting the influence of thermal effects at different temperatures. The model is then applied to the numerical simulation of cavitation on axisymmetric headforms and 2 D hydrofoils. The results are compared with available experimental data with the purpose of assessing the potential of the proposed model for engineering simulation of more complex cavitating flows with special emphasis on liquid propellant rockets applications, where thermal effects are often of crucial importance...|$|E

40|$|Let S be {{a string}} of length n with {{characters}} from an alphabet of size σ. The subsequence automaton of S (often called the directed acyclic subsequence graph) is the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting all subsequences of S. A straightforward construction shows that the size (number of states and transitions) of the subsequence automaton is O(nσ) and that this bound is asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we consider subsequence automata with default transitions, that is, special transitions to be taken only if none of the <b>regular</b> <b>transitions</b> match the current character, and which do not consume the current character. We show that with default transitions, much smaller subsequence automata are possible, and provide a full trade-off between {{the size of the}} automaton and the delay, i. e., the maximum number of consecutive default transitions followed before consuming a character. Specifically, given any integer parameter k, 1 < k ≤σ, we present a subsequence automaton with default transitions of size O(nk_kσ) and delay O(_k σ). Hence, with k = 2 we obtain an automaton of size O(n σ) and delay O(σ). On the other extreme, with k = σ, we obtain an automaton of size O(n σ) and delay O(1), thus matching the bound for the standard subsequence automaton construction. Finally, we generalize the result to multiple strings. The key component of our result is a novel hierarchical automata construction of independent interest. Comment: Corrected typo...|$|R
40|$|The wake of {{a sphere}} {{undergoes}} a number of symmetry-breaking transitions as it changes from laminar to turbulent. This paper concentrates on the "rst two transitions. At Re" 212 a <b>regular</b> <b>transition</b> occurs, when the wake develops a spectacular two-tailed structure consisting of two trailing streamwise vortices. During the second transition at Re" 272 the #ow undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. In this case there is a complex interaction between the trailing vortices leading to the periodic shedding of vortex loops. Both these transitions are shown to be supercritical (or nonhysteretic). Landau models are constructed for both transitions and the coe$cients determined. The visual impression of an apparently sudden bifurcation to the two-tailed wake is shown {{to be due to}} the focal nature of the trailing vortices, which draws dye into the cores, even if their net circulation is small. A precursor to the second transition to the periodic wake is strong kinking of the trailing vortices about 1 diameter downstream {{from the back of the}} sphere.

The existing genetic mineral deposit classifications has developed and embraced the genetic classification of ore-forming processes in accordance with system theory, structured taxons revealing the nature of the processes and the basis- information source of these processes. The base involved the developed model system of ore mineralization- ore formations (geological formations with syngenetic mineralization) within poly-component and mono-component subformations; for convergent mineralization- geological types of deposits. The latter, as well as non-convergent subformations has accumulated all data about initiating and conditioning ore formation within wide-scaled geological processes. The geological mineralization types within ore formations and subformations are included in the genetic classification of ore-forming processes.

Regular model checking {{is a form of}} symbolic model checking for parameterized and infinite-state systems whose states can be represented as words of arbitrary length over a finite alphabet, in which regular sets of words are used to represent sets of states. We present LTL(MSO), a combination of the logics MSO and LT L as a natural logic for expressing temporal properties to be verified in regular model checking. In other words, LTL(MSO) is a natural specification language for both the system and the property under consideration. LTL(MSO) is a two-dimensional modal logic, where MSO is used for specifying properties of system states and transitions, and LT L is used for specifying temporal properties. In addition, the first-order quantification in MSO can be used to express properties parameterized on a position or process. We give a technique for model checking LTL(MSO), which is adapted from the automata-theoretic approach: a formula is translated to a Büchi <b>regular</b> <b>transition</b> system with a regular set of accepting states, and regular model checking techniques are used to search for models.
