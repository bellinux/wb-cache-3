40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that blood shows {{considerable}} peroxidase-like enzymatic activity and therefore in the presence of hydrogen peroxide will give highly coloured products with certain substrates and, in particular, with amines such as benzidine. The carcinogenic nature of benzidine, however, dictates a search for a satisfactory alternative substrate such as phenolphthalein which is believed to be non-carcinogenic. This study, designed to ascertain the relative merits of using benzidine and phenolphthalein as <b>reagents</b> in <b>indicator</b> tests for blood, centers primarily on the sensitivity, stability and specificity of the two substrates. Despite the fact that the three-stage phenolphthalein presumptive test for blood appears to be somewhat less sensitive than the conventional benzidine test, results indicate that it has several advantages in terms of specificity and stability. Results also indicate that the enzyme peroxidase, which is widely distributed in plants, does not contribute to false positive results in the three-stage phenolphthalein indicator test for bloodstains.

40|$|This work {{details the}} {{synthesis}} of some useful organic molecules: (I) 9 -Methylfluorene was tested as an indicator in the titration of commonly used organometallic <b>reagents.</b> This <b>indicator</b> is readily prepared in three steps from fluorenone. In THF solution the deprotonated indicator is red and exhibits a sharp endpoint. The highly basic reagents sec-butyllithium and tert -butyllithium can be titrated in ether solution, where {{the color of the}} deprotonated indicator is yellow. (II) A branched, polyethylene glycol based linker for peptide ligands was designed and synthesized. The linker needed to be water soluble, to be stable under both acidic and basic conditions, to have amine and carboxyl termini for use in solid phase peptide synthesis, and to have an attachment site for a fluorescent marker. The polyethylene glycol linker was designed with a carboxyl terminus and two amine termini that can be differentially protected to facilitate selective deprotection and reaction with three peptides or two peptides and a fluorescent tag. (III) A molecule containing a linear polyethylene glycol linker with beta-alkoxyamide moiety was synthesized and its pH stability determined using an HPLC method. Stability was assayed in 5 mM buffers at pH 4, 7, and 9 over 24 hours. No decomposition in these solutions was detected. The linker was then subjected to 10 mM acid or base solution and analyzed over 24 hours. Again, no decomposition was observed...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a sequential injection system for the ammonium determination in transitional and coastal waters with a wide salinity range. Estuarine waters are rather complex matrices as their characteristics change considerably along the salinity gradient, as well as the ammonium levels. The developed system effectively solves these issues by converting ammonium into ammonia and using a gas diffusion unit (GDU) for matrix removal. The ammonium determination in a wide quantification range (0. 1 – 5. 0 mg L− 1) was obtained with small changes in the protocol sequence and was applied, not only to estuarine samples, but also well water samples (low salinity) and coastal waters (higher salinity). Spectrophotometry was the chosen detection system to measure the absorbance change in the bromothymol blue acid base indicator caused by the diffusion of ammonia through the GDU. Additionally, the developed system used a green chemistry approach, as there was no <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent</b> consumption per determination, still maintaining a good precision (relative standard deviation lower than 2 %) and a low detection limit, 27 μg L− 1 (1. 5 μM) ...|$|R

He {{stated that the}} concept of occult blood detection is generally cred-ited to Van Deen, who in 1864 used gum guaiac, as an <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent.</b> Boas was the first to demonstrate its value for the detection of bowel malignancy (12) and Greegor was the first to stimulate interest in screening with the guaiac test (13). The guaiac FOBTs (GT) detect the peroxidase activity of heme either as intact hemoglobin or free heme. In the presence of heme and a developer (hydrogen peroxide) guaiac acid is oxidized producing a blue color. In screening for colorectal neoplasms a true positive GT is one which indicates bleeding from a colon cancer or polyp. All other positive results are considered to be false positive. Heme is present in red meat and peroxidase activity is present in fresh fruits and vegetables such as radishes, turnips and broccoli. These foods, therefore, have the potential to produce false-positive results. Some reports suggest that delay-ing development of GT cards for at least three days will decrease the number of false positives due to plant peroxidases and obviate the need for diet restriction o...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} acquire more {{alginate}} lyase-excreting microbes, {{a simple and}} efficient screening method needs to be developed. As an easy and convenient testing method, plate assay associated with constrain condition is traditionally used for bacteria screening. A number of alginate degrading strains were isolated by plate assay using different <b>reagents</b> as enzyme-producing <b>indicator</b> (e.g., cetyl pyridinium chloride, ruthenium red, calcium chloride, ethanol) (Gacesa and Wusteman 1990; Baron et al. 1994; Takeshita et al. 1991; Huang et al. 2013). Generally, a clear zone would occur around the alginate lyase-excreting colony after using the chromogenic agents. These qualitative methods {{make it possible to}} visualize the enzyme activity and can be applied to detect alginate lyase produced by bacterial colonies. However, the indistinct border and long reaction time of existing methods make the judgment of clear zones fairly difficult and inconvenient. The existing methods are still low efficient for revealing alginate lyase-excreting microbes at large scale. Recently, Sawant et al. (2015) reported that Gram’s iodine was an excellent chromogenic agent for revealing alginate lyase-producing colonies on agar plates. According Sawant’s result, Gram’s iodine could form distinct clear zones around the alginate degrading microbial colonies within 2 – 3  min. It was more effective than other chromogenic agents.|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of evidences shows that {{bacterial}} biofilm lifestyle is comparatively more common than the planktonic one and that biofilm {{plays a crucial role}} in human health. The enumeration of the actual number of bacteria in biofilm is still a great challenge for microbiologist. The standardized method of colony forming unit (CFU) count is not reliable to quantify bacteria in biofilm. In the absence of a validated method to count bacteria in biofilm, BioTimer Assay (BTA) is presented here. BTA allows to count bacterial biofilm adherent on surfaces and employs an appropriate <b>reagent</b> containing an <b>indicator</b> able to switch as a consequence of bacterial metabolism in biofilm. The time required for indicator switch, induced by microbial metabolism, is correlated to the initial number of bacteria (N 0) through a genus-specific correlation line described by the following equation t = log(1 +a=N 0) =k where k is growth rate and a {{is a function of the}} metabolic product responsible for the reagent switching. Moreover, BTA does not require any manipulation of samples and has been applied to count bacteria in biofilm adherent to several polymers, to verify microbiological quality of foods and to detect the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm. BTA, providing a reliable, sensitive, rapid and easy-to perform method, could be considered a useful tool in counting bacteria in biofilm also adherent on nano-structured particles to be in vivo administere...|$|R
40|$|Background: The two {{available}} {{drugs for}} treatment of T. cruzi infection, nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZ), have potential toxic side effects and variable efficacy, contributing to their low rate of use.

40|$|Abstract. Cowdria ruminantium is the {{etiologic}} agent of heartwater, a tick-transmitted foreign animal disease with considerable potential for {{entrance into the}} USA. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) was developed to detect serologic responses to C. ruminantium infection. The cELISA utilized a recombinant form of the C. ruminantium major antigenic protein (MAP-l) as the antigen and an anti-MAP- 1 monoclonal antibody as the competing <b>indicator</b> <b>reagent.</b> Experimental antisera to C. ruminantium and {{a wide variety of}} related ehrlichial organisms were used to evaluate cELISA reactivity. Only sera against C. rumin ntium, Ehrlichia canis, E. chaffeensis, and a recently discovered cervine ehrlichia-like organism reacted positively in the cELISA. Specificity of the cELISA was 299. 5 % in a survey of 1, 774 southeastern US and Puerto Rican slaughter cattle sera but was only 85 % in a group of 79 hunter-killed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from the southeastern USA. Reference true-positive and cELISA false-positive sera were further analyzed by end point titrations using the cELISA and by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests for reactivity with C. ruminantium, E. canis, and E. chaffeensis antigens. True heartwater-positive sera were significantly more reactive using the cELISA and C. ruminantium IFA procedures (P < 0. 05), whereas false-positive sera were significantly more reactive with the antigens used in the E. chaffeensis IFA procedure (P < 0. 05).
