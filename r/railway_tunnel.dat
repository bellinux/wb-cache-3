5|$|In 1984, the {{government}} {{decided to build}} a second <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> and a second road tunnel to alleviate traffic congestion in the Cross Harbour Tunnel resulting in Eastern Harbour Crossing, the first railway-road tunnel in Hong Kong. The tunnel enabled Kwun Tong Line's extension to Quarry Bay, with an additional stop, Lam Tin, built in the middle. The new MTR station, opened on 8 November 1989, caused an influx of population into Lam Tin.|$|E
5|$|The militants {{responsible}} for the murders were tried and executed in Damascus by Djemal Pasha in September 1915; the incident later {{became the subject of}} a 1916 investigation by the Ottoman Parliament led by Artin Boshgezenian, the deputy for Aleppo. After Marzbed's release from the court, he worked under a false Ottoman identity for the Germans in Intilli (Amanus <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel).</b> He escaped to Nusaybin, where he fell from a horse and died shortly before the armistice.|$|E

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program (CalMod) is a $1.9billion {{project that}} will add a {{positive}} train control (PTC) system and electrify {{the main line}} of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley, as well as transition from its current diesel-electric locomotive powered trains to electric multiple units (EMU). According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution and noise, and facilitate a future <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> (the Downtown Rail Extension) into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations).|$|E
5|$|The TVR {{line would}} {{dominate}} the transportation of coal throughout the Rhondda's industrial history, and its monopoly {{was a point}} of contention, as with no rivals the colliery owners could not negotiate for haulage rates. Several {{attempts were made to}} break the monopoly including the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda {{at the head of the}} Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales Dock. To achieve this rail link the Rhondda Tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi; at the time the longest <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Wales.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications, Ronald Bye, and officially taken into use on 1 June. When it opened, {{it was the}} eighth-longest <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Norway, {{although}} since 2005 {{it has been the}} thirteenth-longest. The tunnel cost 625million Norwegian krone(NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170million. At first, the tunnel was used by commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used the tunnel and turned at Skøyen. Oslo Central Station was taken into use on 26 November 1986. On 27 May 1989, Oslo West Station was closed and all traffic transferred to OsloS.|$|E
5|$|More than 150 {{years after}} its creation, the {{original}} main line {{has been described by}} an historian as one of the masterpieces of railway design. Working westwards from Paddington, the line crosses the valley of the River Brent on Wharncliffe Viaduct and the River Thames on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, which at the time of construction was the largest span achieved by a brick arch bridge. The line then continues through Sonning Cutting before reaching Reading after which it crosses the Thames twice more, on Gatehampton and Moulsford bridges. Between Chippenham and Bath is Box Tunnel, the longest <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> driven by that time. Several years later, the railway opened the even longer Severn Tunnel to carry a new line between England and Wales beneath the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} Orient Express {{came from}} two sources: Fleming had {{returned}} from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew {{of the story of}} Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E

5|$|The {{west side}} of the walls include nine towers, rising upwards towards the {{south-west}} corner. Two of the towers were significantly affected by 19th-century developments; one was converted into an entrance way for the Bangor Road in 1827, whilst another suffered a deep fissure caused by subsidence from the excavation of the Chester to Holyhead <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> in 1845, and had to be underpinned in 1963. One of the remaining merlons on this stretch of the walls' battlements has a stone finial on top, a design originally used along all of the town walls. The western wall originally extended out to the river Conwy itself, ending in a round tower, but this has since been lost; a similar spur arrangement was seen at Chester and Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights) posthumously. Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the Cold War. The plot of From Russia, with Love uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had {{its roots in the}} wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot device of spies on the Orient Express was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> south of Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tunnel's shuttle trains carrying cars and lorries between Folkestone and Calais, the decision to build a <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> opened up the possibility of through passenger and freight train services between places further afield. British Rail and SNCF contracted with Eurotunnel to use half the tunnel's capacity for this purpose. In 1987 Britain, France and Belgium set up an International Project Group to specify a train to provide an international high-speed passenger service through the tunnel. France had been operating high-speed TGV services since 1981, and had begun {{construction of a new}} high-speed line between Paris and the Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord; French TGV technology was chosen {{as the basis for the}} new trains. An order for 30 trainsets, to be manufactured in France but with some British and Belgian components, was placed in December 1989. On 20 June 1993, the first Eurostar test train travelled through the tunnel to the UK. Various technical difficulties in running the new trains on British tracks were quickly overcome.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{operation}} {{experiences of}} Japanese and European high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{indicate that the}} train fire {{is the most dangerous}} disaster. The design and study on disaster prevention and rescue of the high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> both aim at it. In this article, several topics are discussed. First, the train fire cases in <b>railway</b> <b>tunnels</b> are collected and the factors are analyzed. Second, present research works on the fireproofing of train, the fire scene in tunnel, the fireproofing of the tunnel lining, smoke control and the evacuation are generalized. The shortcomings of the domestic study are shown. In the end, possible research fields are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{border between}} the Reich and Yugoslavia was {{unsuitable}} for motorised operations. Due to the short notice of the invasion, {{the elements of the}} invading German 2nd Army that would make up LI Infantry Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps had to be transported from Germany, German-occupied France and the Nazi puppet Slovak Republic, and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas in time for 6 April. In the area of responsibility of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski, the XLIX Mountain Corps was significantly delayed, and did not start pushing forward until 8 April. On the following day, the Germans advanced on Celje. In response to withdrawals on the right flank of the 7th Army, 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and Mountain Detachment Triglavski fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river on 9 April. Elements of XLIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the Karawanks <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> near Jesenice, and the Italians made several attacks on the weakened sector of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{during the}} {{operation}} approximately 4,000 men {{and more than}} 600tons of equipment and supplies were dropped by the Americans at Sukchon and Sunchon on 20 October and the days that followed, including twelve 105mm howitzers, 39 jeeps, 38 1/4-ton trailers, four 90mm antiaircraft guns, four 3/4-ton trucks, as well as ammunition, fuel, water, rations, and other supplies. Although sound in concept, the operation may have had more chance of success had a complete airborne division been employed. The following morning US 1/187 RCT captured the high ground north of Sukchon and established a blocking position on the main highway running north. However, strong North Korean rearguard forces held the next line of hills to the north. While at Sunchon, American troops from US 2/187 RCT had heard reports {{that a number of}} American prisoners had been murdered nearby by their North Korean captors as the KPA retreated. It became apparent that the train carrying the prisoners north from Pyongyang had halted in a <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> on the 20th to conceal itself as US 187 RCT jumped into the area, and that while there, many of the men aboard had been shot by the North Korean soldiers guarding them as they waited for their evening meal. Sixty-six bodies were later recovered, {{as well as those of}} seven more who were found to have died of disease or malnutrition. Twenty-three starving and emaciated American survivors were found nearby; however, many were badly wounded and two later died. The American paratroopers were subsequently ordered to return to Pyongyang.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April, the Germans {{continued}} their advance, and {{all elements of}} both divisions of LI Infantry Corps had finally unloaded in Graz. In view of German success, the Italian 2nd Army in north-eastern Italy accelerated its preparations and issued orders for its V and XI Corps to conduct preliminary operations aimed at improving their starting positions for the planned attack on Yugoslavia. In the meantime, the 7th Army continued rapidly withdrawing its right wing, while withdrawing its centre and keeping the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski in place on its left flank. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska continued to withdraw south from Ptuj through Krapina towards Zagreb, while the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and Mountain Detachment Triglavski fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river. Units of LI Infantry Corps crossed the Drava along the line Maribor—Ptuj and further east, and continued to expand their bridgehead south of Maribor. Elements of XLIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the Karawanks <b>railway</b> <b>tunnel</b> near Jesenice and expanded their bridgehead at Dravograd. Italian units made several attacks on the weakened sector of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and against Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski, and Detachment Lika took up positions on the coast. On the same day, the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at Cerklje was again attacked by German aircraft.|$|E
