5|$|In 1976, {{the court}} heard the {{original}} proceedings in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, {{a case that}} challenged several Missouri state regulations regarding abortion.

5|$|The {{right to}} privacy is not {{explicitly}} identified in the U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E

25|$|The Court {{held that}} a right to privacy existed and {{included}} {{the right to have}} an abortion.

25|$|In McGee v. The Attorney General (1974), the Supreme Court {{found that}} {{provisions}} of Articles 40 and 41 guaranteed {{a right to}} marital privacy, and that contraception on prescription could not be prohibited to a married couple. In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the United States Supreme Court come a similar result, before finding for a general <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> in the first trimester in Roe v. Wade (1973). The Eighth Amendment in 1983 gave constitutional protection {{to the life of}} the unborn, and therefore prohibiting abortion. This had been partly to guard against the Supreme Court finding the same right that their American counterparts had.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Blackmun {{authored}} the Court's {{opinion in}} Roe v. Wade, invalidating a Texas statute {{making it a}} felony to administer an abortion in most circumstances.

Both decisions {{were based on the}} right to privacy announced in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and remain the primary basis for the constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> in the United States. Roe caused an immediate uproar, and Blackmun's opinion made him a target for criticism by opponents of abortion, receiving voluminous negative mail and death threats over the case.|$|E

The plurality opinion, signed jointly by three justices appointed by Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, ignited {{a firestorm of}} criticism from conservatives. Kennedy had stated at least as early as 1989 that, in order to uphold precedent, he might not vote to overturn Roe.

500|$|In the Ethics of Liberty, Rothbard explores issues {{regarding}} children's rights {{in terms of}} self-ownership and contract. These include support for a woman's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion,</b> condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children, and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children {{have the right to}} run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a [...] "flourishing free market in children". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces, while [...] "superficially monstrous", will benefit [...] "everyone" [...] involved in the market: [...] "the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing".|$|E
2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> was not unlimited, Justice Blackmun, {{speaking for the}} Court, created a trimester framework to balance the fundamental <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> with the government's two legitimate interests: protecting the mother's health and protecting the [...] "potentiality of human life." [...] The trimester framework addressed when a woman's fundamental <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> would be absolute, and when the state's interests would become compelling. In the first trimester, when {{it was believed that}} the procedure was safer than childbirth, the Court left the decision to abort completely to the woman and her physician. From approximately {{the end of the first}} trimester until fetal viability, the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother would become [...] "compelling." [...] At that time, the state could regulate the abortion procedure if the regulation [...] "reasonably relate to the [...] "preservation and protection of maternal health." [...] At the point of viability, which the Court believed to be in the third trimester, the state's interest in [...] "potential life" [...] would become compelling, and the state could regulate abortion to protect [...] "potential life." [...] At that point, the state could even forbid abortion so long as it made an exception to preserve the life or health of the mother. The Court added that the primary right being preserved in the Roe decision was that of the physician to practice medicine freely absent a compelling state interest – not women's rights in general. In 1992, however, the plurality of Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter, and Anthony Kennedy made a subtle move away from the physician's-rights approach of Roe and toward a patient's-rights approach in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. The plurality in Casey, explicitly confirming that women had a constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> and further upholding the [...] "essential holding" [...] of Roe, stated that women had a right to choose abortion before viability and that this right could not be unduly interfered with by the state. They asserted that this right was rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
