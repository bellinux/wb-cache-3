40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the concentration of mercury in fish consumed in Marabá, Brazil which is located close to the Serra Pelada gold mines. Methods: Fish species which have great economic impact on the city of Marabá were selected for study in a pilot research programme. The species sampled were collected from fish sold at the Feira da 28, were from the species Cichla spp, Mylossoma spp and Pimelodus spp. The samples were processed through the Allegra method. Results: The measured mercury concentrations were Cichla spp. I (0. 750 kg) 600 μg/kg, Cichla <b>spp.</b> <b>II</b> (1. 254 kg) 1000 μg/kg, Cichla spp III (2. 750 kg) < 2000 μg/kg; Mylossoma spp I (1. 300 kg) 100 μg/kg, Mylossoma <b>spp</b> <b>II</b> (2. 100 kg) < 300 μg/kg; Pimelodus spp I (0. 850 kg) 100 μg/kg, Pimelodus <b>spp</b> <b>II</b> (1. 050 kg) < 300 μg/kg. Conclusions: The concentrations of mercury in the fish samples analysed exceed the limits for consumption established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian government. The semi quantitative Allegra method for determination of mercury in environmental samples is confirmed as a suitable alternative for environmental monitoring programs which are relevant to public health. More study is needed on the use of mercury and its by-products which can contaminate fish in the Amazon...|$|R

40|$|The European cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cerasi (Diptera: Tephritidae), {{is a major}} pest of {{cherries}} in Europe and parts of Asia.

Knowledge about an insect pest on molecular, genetic and population levels facilitates the development of environmentally friendly control methods. In this study, we present the development of 13 microsatellite markers for R. cerasi, through cross-species amplification. These markers have been used for the genotyping of 130 individuals from five different sampling sites in Greece. Our results indicate that (i) cross-species amplification is a versatile and rapid tool for developing microsatellite markers in Rhagoletis <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> the microsatellite markers presented here constitute an important tool for population studies on this pest, and (iii) there is clear structuring of natural European cherry fly populations...|$|R
40|$|Most {{information}} systems fail {{to achieve their}} objectives {{for a variety of}} reasons including over budget, out of scope and inability to fulfill the stakeholders’ and users’ expectations. Researchers have different perspectives and use multiple definitions and measurement methods to evaluate the effectiveness and the success of {{information systems}} due to their complexity and subjectivity. This study used HOT-fit (Human, Organization, Technology and fit) Evaluation Framework to evaluate the effectiveness or the success of a Malaysian Electronic Government application, namely Project Monitoring System (PMS) as the case study. The data collection methods used in this qualitative research include in-depth interview, observation and document analysis. This study shows that PMS has not achieved the expected effectiveness level and there were misfits among human, organization and technology factors.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cell-bound microcystins on the survival time and feeding rates of six Daphnia clones belonging to five common species was studied. To do this, {{the effects of}} the microcystin-producing Microcystis strain PCC 7806 and its mutant, which has been genetically engineered to knock out microcystin synthesis, were compared. Additionally, the relationship between microcystin ingestion rate by the Daphnia clones and Daphnia survival time was analyzed. Microcystins ingested with Microcystis cells were poisonous to all Daphnia clones tested. The median survival time of the animals was closely correlated to their microcystin ingestion rate. It was therefore suggested that differences in survival among Daphnia clones were due to variations in microcystin intake rather than due to differences in susceptibility to the toxins. The correlation between median survival time and microcystin ingestion rate could be described by a reciprocal power function. Feeding experiments showed that, independent of the occurrence of microcystins, cells of wild-type PCC 7806 and its mutant are able to inhibit the feeding activity of Daphnia. Both variants of PCC 7806 were thus ingested at low rates. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that (i) sensitivity to the toxic effect of cell-bound microcystins is typical for Daphnia <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> Daphnia <b>spp.</b> and clones may have a comparable sensitivity to microcystins ingested with food particles, (iii) Daphnia spp. may be unable to distinguish between microcystin-producing and -lacking cells, and (iv) the strength of the toxic effect can be predicted from the microcystin ingestion rate of the animals...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the application of}} an oligonucleotide microarray to (i) specifically detect Cryptosporidium <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> differentiate between closely related C. parvum isolates and Cryptosporidium species, and (iii) differentiate between principle genotypes known to infect humans. A microarray of 68 capture probes targeting seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 190 -bp region of the hsp 70 gene of Cryptosporidium parvum was constructed. Labeled hsp 70 targets were generated by PCR with biotin- or Cy 3 -labeled primers. Hybridization conditions were optimized for hybridization time, temperature, and salt concentration. Two genotype I C. parvum isolates (TU 502 and UG 502), two C. parvum genotype II isolates (Iowa and GCH 1), and DNAs from 22 non-Cryptosporidium sp. organisms were used to test method specificity. Only DNAs from C. parvum isolates produced labeled amplicons that could be hybridized to and detected on the array. Hybridization patterns between genotypes were visually distinct, but identification of SNPs required statistical analysis of the signal intensity data. The results indicated that correct mismatch discrimination could be achieved for all seven SNPs for the UG 502 isolate, five of seven SNPs for the TU 502 isolate, and six of seven SNPs for both the Iowa and GCH 1 isolates. Even without perfect mismatch discrimination, the microarray method unambiguously distinguished between genotype I and genotype II isolates and demonstrated the potential to differentiate between other isolates and species on a single microarray. This method may provide a powerful new tool for water utilities and public health officials for assessing point and nonpoint source contamination of water supplies...|$|R
40|$|To advance our {{understanding}} of the processes that govern the assembly of palm communities and the local coexistence of numerous palm species, we here synthesize available information in the literature on species diversity and growth-form composition in palm communities across the Americas. American palm communities surveyed had 4 - 48 (median 16) species in study plots covering 0. 09 - 7. 2 ha. Climate, soils, hydrology, and topography are the main factors determining palm community species richness. Tropical lowland terra firme rain forests are the most species-rich whereas forests that are inundated or grow on sandy soils or in areas with seasonal climate have much fewer species. Palm communities in the central-western Amazon and in Central America are significantly richer than the average region and those in the Caribbean significantly poorer in species. As for branching, the 789 species of tropical American palms belong to Corner's model (solitary, 268 species, 33 %), Tomlinsons model (cespitose, 521 species, 66 %) and Schoute's model (dichotomous branching, three species, < 1 %). We assigned the species to eight different growth forms: (i) Large tall-stemmed Palms (102 <b>spp),</b> (<b>ii)</b> Large-leaved medium-short-stemmed Palms (31 spp), (iii) Medium-sized Palms (95 spp), (iv) Medium/Small Palms with Stout Stem (42 spp), (v) Small Palms (423 spp), (vi) Large acaulescent Palms (28 spp), (vii) Small acaulescent Palms (56 spp), and (viii) Climbing Palms (12 spp). The eight growth forms are differently represented in the palm communities, and the categories Small Palms and Large tall-stemmed Palms dominate the communities both in terms of species richness and in number of individuals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To date, only few {{compounds}} {{targeting the}} AI- 2 based quorum sensing (QS) system are known. In the present study, we screened cinnamaldehyde and substituted cinnamaldehydes {{for their ability}} to interfere with AI- 2 based QS. The mechanism of QS inhibition was elucidated by measuring the effect on bioluminescence in several Vibrio harveyi mutants. We also studied in vitro the ability of these compounds to interfere with biofilm formation, stress response and virulence of Vibrio spp. The compounds were also evaluated in an in vivo assay measuring the reduction of Vibrio harveyi virulence towards Artemia shrimp. Results Our results indicate that cinnamaldehyde and several substituted derivatives interfere with AI- 2 based QS without inhibiting bacterial growth. The active compounds neither interfered with the bioluminescence system as such, nor with the production of AI- 2. Study of the effect in various mutants suggested that the target protein is LuxR. Mobility shift assays revealed a decreased DNA-binding ability of LuxR. The compounds were further shown to (i) inhibit biofilm formation in several Vibrio <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> result in a reduced ability to survive starvation and antibiotic treatment, (iii) reduce pigment and protease production in Vibrio anguillarum and (iv) protect gnotobiotic Artemia shrimp against virulent Vibrio harveyi BB 120. Conclusion Cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives interfere with AI- 2 based QS in various Vibrio spp. by decreasing the DNA-binding ability of LuxR. The use of these compounds resulted in several marked phenotypic changes, including reduced virulence and increased susceptibility to stress.

40|$|The endemic bovid Myotragus, {{from the}} Plio-Pleistocene {{deposits}} of Majorca, underwent {{a significant reduction}} in relative brain size, especially affecting the vision and locomotor centres. These important modifications allow the hypothesis that, under altered conditions in predator free insular environments, functional demands on neural performance are reduced, allowing a reduction in brain structures and associated sense organs. This is suggested, for example, by the small orbits and reduced visual brain structures of Myotragus balearicus Bate, 1909. These changes, which parallel those shown by domesticated animals, have been interpreted as an adaptive response to insular environmental conditions, in particular to a lack of interspecific competitors and predators. Results obtained from analysis of the smallest Cretan deer (Candiacervus ropalophorus de Vos, 1984, and Candiacervits <b>spp.</b> <b>II)</b> are not as outstanding as it is in Myotragus, and apparently run counter to the fact that dwarfed insular artiodactyls living in environments without any predation pressure would be characterised by a proportional decrease in brain volume as a rule. Brain/body mass proportion of the smallest Candiacervus species provides evidence that this endemic deer underwent only minor changes in the relative size of brain after its geographic isolation. On the other hand, orbit and foramen magnum size are proportionally reduced. Accordingly, different evolutionary process likely affected brain and sense organs changes of these endemic artiodactyls. Other factors, nature of available niches, interspecific competition, maybe island size and time from isolation, would {{have played a role in}} the possible differential evolution of insular ruminants in addition to the change in adaptive strategy for a more efficient energy use under the free-predators environmental conditions of the insular ecosystem.

This study, focused on Southwest Spain, in order to bring new insights into (i) the epidemiology of Dirofilaria <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> the species of Culicid vectors possibly involved in their transmission and (iii) the genetic variability of those potential vectors. A total of 881 adult female mosquitoes from 11 different species, were captured during 2012 – 2013, and detection of filarioid DNA was attempted by PCR using specific primers (ITS- 2 and COI), followed by DNA sequencing. In a single Culex pipiens specimen D. immitis DNA was detected both in the head-thorax and abdomen sections. Filarioid nematode DNA was also detected in eight additional Cx. pipiens specimens also in both the thorax and the abdomen, but analysis of sequence data did not allow unambiguous assignment of any of the obtained sequences to a previously defined species. All Cx. pipiens with filarioid DNA were individually analysed by CQ 11 to discriminate between pipiens, molestus, and hybrid forms. Besides, rDNA ITS- 2 sequence analysis revealed the presence of haplotype H 1 and H 2 of Cx. pipiens. To our knowledge this study revealed, for the first time in Spain, the occurrence of likely mature infection of D. immitis in Cx. pipiens, as well as with other yet uncharacterized nematodes, supporting its role as a potential vector of these filarids.

40|$|Cyanobacteria are {{a source}} of potent toxins among which the {{microcystin}} (a hepatotoxic peptide encoded by the mcy gene cluster of Microcystis spp.) is a frequent cause of poisoning in inland waters worldwide. Although the molecular basis of microcystin production is known, its role is still unknown. It was suggested that microcystin production have a metabolic cost that could be offset by some benefit (e. g. protection from grazing). We check that: i) microcystin-producing and non-producing strains occurs simultaneously in the Microcystis <b>spp.</b> blooms, <b>ii)</b> evolutionary forces (mutation, genetic drift) control frequencies of microcystin production and non-production strains, and iii) microcystin producing strains have diminished fitness compared with non-producing strains. We employ evolutionary game theory to explain the maintaining of microcystin-producing genotypes in natural populations of Microcystis spp. A two-strategy (to produce or not microcystin), two-players game of cooperators (microcystin-producing genotypes) and cheaters (non-producing genotypes) explains the coexistence of both genotypes in the same bloom. A bloom composed mostly by the microcystin-producing “cooperators ” genotype, the “temptation of defection ” (increase of non-producing genotypes) is counteracted by kin selection, which enable that natural selection can favour the cooperators.

40|$|Pramod Mahajan (Mentor) Antibiotics {{are vital}} in {{fighting}} bacterial infections and are necessary in effectively raising livestock in close quarters and high numbers. They {{are widely used}} and relatively little restrictions are placed on their use. Misdiagnosis and overuse has led to bacteria evolving resistance mechanisms to avoid {{the effects of the}} antibiotics. These bacteria propagate easily and transfer their resistance genes to other, antibiotic sensitive bacterial strains in certain aquatic systems. Such inter- and intraspecies transfer of antibiotic resistance is a major environmental and health risk. Therefore, we investigated the Camp Creek in Iowa to determine (i) the extent of antibiotic resistance in Enterobacter <b>spp.</b> and (<b>ii)</b> beef cattle ranching as a potential source contributing to the antibiotic resistant bacteria at this site. Greater bacterial loads were identified in samples from upstream of the cattle ranch suggesting they are not contributing bacteria or selective pressures for antibiotic resistance to the creek. We tested Enterobacter spp. for resistance against tetracycline, penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and streptomycin and found resistance to all except the last two drugs. All isolates tested also exhibited multidrug resistance. Further {{research is needed to determine}} specific mechanisms of the multidrug resistant phenotype. Samples stored in liquid broth in the absence of any antibiotic lost resistance to tetracycline after 12 weeks, suggesting an extrachromosomal location for this trait.

The presence of Pfiesteria spp. and {{the complexity of}} the microbial assemblage in the bioassay were assessed by molecular approaches. Cell-free water from bioassays that yielded significant fish mortality failed to show ichthyocidal activity. Histopathological examination of moribund and dead fish failed to reveal the skin lesions reported elsewhere. Fish larvae within “cages” of variable mesh sizes were killed in those where the pore size exceeded that of Pfiesteria dinospores. In vitro exposure of fish larvae to clonal P. piscicida indicated that fish mortality was directly proportional to the dinospore cell density. Dinospores clustered around the mouth, eyes, and operculi, suggesting that fish health may be affected by their direct interaction with skin, gill epithelia, or mucous surfaces. Molecular fingerprinting revealed the presence of a very diverse microbial community of bacteria, protists, and fungi within bioassay aquaria containing environmental sediments. Some components of the microbial community were identified as potential fish pathogens, preventing the rigorous identification of Pfiesteria spp. as the only cause of fish death. In summary, our results strongly suggest (i) that this aquarium bioassay format, which has been extensively reported in the literature, is unsuitable to accurately assess the ichthyocidal {{activity of}} Pfiesteria <b>spp.</b> and (<b>ii)</b> that the ichthyocidal activity of Pfiesteria spp. is mostly due to direct interactions of the zoospores with fish skin and gill epithelia rather than to soluble factors...|$|R

Except for Ziziphus mauritiana, {{the effectiveness of}} arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on growth and mineral nutrition of Ziziphus spp. is not known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the mycorrhizal dependency (MD) of Ziziphus spp. in greenhouse conditions. [br/] Materials and methods - Three isolates of AMF were used: Rhizophagus irregularis isolate IR 27, Funneliformis mosseae isolate DAOM 227131 and Rhizoglomus intraradices isolate DAOM 197198, on seven species of Ziziphus: Z. mauritiana, Z. lotus, Z. spina-christi, Z. mucronata, Z. amphibia, Z, abyssinica and Z. sphaerocarpa. Plants were grown in nursery receiving 20 g portions of a crude inoculum of AMF. The experiment was set up as a 4 x 7 factorial design consisting of three AMF, one control (disinfected soil without inoculum) and seven Ziziphus spp. Results and discussion - Inoculation by AMF significantly improved growth and mineral nutrition of Ziziphus spp., particularly the P nutrition. Mycorrhizal dependency values of Ziziphus spp. declined with AMF in the following order: R, irregularis (69. 51 %), R. intraradices (63. 58 %) and R mosseae (52. 45 %). Total length of AMF hyphae in soil samples from inoculated treatments was significantly higher in all Ziziphus <b>spp.</b> with <b>II,</b> intraradices combinations. The differences of MD among the tested Ziziphus spp. seem {{to be due to}} differences in the development of hyphal length in the soil and in P uptake by the external hyphae.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays {{a central}} role in activation of first-line defenses of a host against foreign organisms. To determine whether Brucella infection modulated TNF-alpha production, we measured the biological activity of this cytokine in supernatants of U 937 cell-derived macrophages and of fresh human monocytes infected with Brucella spp. Neither the smooth nor rough Brucella strains used induced any measurable TNF-alpha excretion upon infection. On the contrary, as reported before for other gram-negative bacteria, phagocytosis of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli was followed by a rapid and transient induction of TNF-alpha release, suggesting an involvement of this cytokine in some autocrine process. As expected, the Brucella strains tested survived and/or multiplied within U 937 -derived macrophages, whereas E. coli was rapidly eliminated after phagocytosis. Immunoglobulin G opsonization of E. coli strains enhanced their intracellular killing and strongly potentiated TNF-alpha secretion. Immunoglobulin G opsonization of Brucella strains, in contrast, did not lead to TNF-alpha production, although their rate of intracellular multiplication was reduced. Killed brucellae, however, promoted a significant excretion of TNF-alpha from U 937 -derived macrophages into cell culture supernatants. We finally demonstrated that pretreatment of U 937 -derived macrophages with exogenous TNF-alpha significantly inhibited intracellular multiplication of Brucella spp. These results and experiments performed on fresh human monocytes or with isolated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed that (i) differences in TNF-alpha production observed during macrophage infection by Brucella spp. and E. coli were not due to differences in LPS structure but resulted from active inhibition of TNF-alpha production by a specific process linked to Brucella <b>spp.</b> and (<b>ii)</b> the capacity of Brucella spp. to use pathways avoiding TNF-alpha production during infection may be considered a major attribute of virulence...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB), a {{group of}} {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) organisms that metabolize sugars into primarily lactic acid, have traditionally been used for the fermentation and preservation of various foods and beverages. There is increasing interest in the genetic manipulation of LAB to improve existing characteristics or introduce novel, industrially pertinent phenotypes. However, because these bacteria have food-related applications, their genetic modification requires the use of food-grade genetic engineering tools. LAB plasmids, self-replicating extrachromosomal DNA molecules, can be used to derive food-grade cloning vectors. The rationale of this research was to develop a food-grade cloning vector using a lactobacilli cryptic plasmid and to investigate its cloning and expression properties. The main objectives were to (i) screen Lactobacillus <b>spp.</b> for plasmids, (<b>ii)</b> isolate and characterize a plasmid, and (iii) use the plasmid replicon to construct a cloning vector and express heterologous genes in various hosts. This {{is the first step in}} the development of a new family of food-grade cloning vectors for the genetic modification of lactobacilli...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} land use and crop management on soybean rhizobial communities, 280 nodule isolates were trapped from 7 fields with different land use and culture histories. Besides the known Bradyrhizobium japonicum, three novel genospecies were isolated from these fields. Grassland (GL) maintained a higher diversity of soybean bradyrhizobia than the other cultivation systems. Two genospecies (Bradyrhizobium spp. I and III) were distributed widely in all treatments, while Bradyrhizobium sp. II was found only in GL treatment. Cultivation with soybeans increased the rhizobial abundance and diversity, except for the soybean monoculture (S-S) treatment. In monoculture systems, soybeans favored Bradyrhizobium sp. I, while maize and wheat favored Bradyrhizobium sp. III. Fertilization decreased the rhizobial diversity indexes but did not change the species composition. The organic carbon (OC) and available phosphorus (AP) contents and pH were the main soil parameters positively correlated with the distribution of Bradyrhizobium <b>spp.</b> I and <b>II</b> and Bradyrhizobium japonicum and negatively correlated with Bradyrhizobium sp. III. These results revealed that different land uses and crop management could not only alter the diversity and abundance of soybean rhizobia, but also change interactions between rhizobia and legume or nonlegume plants, which offered novel information about the biogeography of rhizobia.

40|$|Essential {{steps in}} the uptake and {{catabolism}} of the plant tumor metabolites nopaline and octopine in Agrobacterium spp. are performed by proteins encoded in the nopaline catabolic (noc) and octopine catabolic (occ) regions of Ti plasmids. We investigated the opine activation of the genes by using (i) promoter studies of Agrobacterium <b>spp.</b> and (<b>ii)</b> analysis of the promoter interaction with the regulatory proteins NocR (noc) and OccR (occ). The noc region contained two nopaline-induced promoters (Pi 1 [noc] and Pi 2 [noc]) and one autogenously regulated promoter (Pr [control of NocR expression]). Pi 2 and Pr overlapped and were divergently oriented (Pi 2 [noc]). DNA binding studies and DNase I footprints indicated that NocR bound specifically to single binding sites in Pi 1 [noc] and Pi 2 /Pr[noc] and that Pi 2 and Pr were regulated from the same binding site. The binding was independent of the inducer nopaline, and nopaline caused small changes in the footprint. The promoters in the noc and occ regions shared sequence motif and contained the sequence T-N 11 -A, which is characteristic for LysR-type-regulated promoters. The occ region contained one octopine-induced and one autogenously regulated promoter (Pi/Pr[occ]) in the same arrangement as Pi 2 /Pr[noc] in the noc region. Promoter deletions indicated that sequences flanking the OccR binding site determined the extent of induction, although they did not bind OccR. The promoter bound OccR in the absence and presence of octopine. The opine caused {{a change in the}} mobility of the DNA-protein complex with the complete promoter. The resected fragments did not reveal this opine-induced shift, and it was also not detectable with the DNA-NocR complexes with the two promoters of the noc region...|$|R
40|$|The {{zoogeography}} and systematics of the Mysis relicta species {{group were}} elucidated in an allozyme survey of populations across northern Europe and North America. The North American populations are here {{identified as an}} independent species (sp. IV), distinct from the three previously recognized European M. relicta group taxa (spp. I–III). The geographical pattern of gene frequency variation in North America supports a late-glacial colonization by separate eastern and western refugial stocks of sp. IV. In Europe, sp. III is known from a single subarctic lake, while both <b>spp.</b> I and <b>II</b> are widespread. They coexist in the Baltic Sea, but their lacustrine distributions are largely different. Species I accounts for most Fennoscandian populations and those in Poland and Germany whereas sp. II lives in Ireland, parts of southwestern Scandinavia, and Karelia. With the paleohydrographical reference, the distributions suggest that both species survived the last glaciation in proglacial lakes east of the Scandinavian Ice. Subsequent distributional differentiation was influenced by environmental variations; the dispersal of sp. II in southwestern Scandinavia was facilitated by a broader euryhalinity than that in sp. I and other stenohaline "glacial relief" crustaceans. The Irish populations may represent a distinct refugial stock within sp. II...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCampylobacter {{species are}} one of the leading causes of {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. This twofold study was sought to: i) develop and optimize four single-tube multiplex PCR (mPCR) assays for the detection of six virulence (ciaB, dnaJ, flaA, flaB, pldA and racR), three toxin (cdtA, cdtB and cdtC) and one antibiotic resistance tet(O) genes in thermophilic Campylobacter <b>spp.</b> and <b>ii)</b> apply and evaluate the developed mPCR assays by testing 470 previously identified C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari isolates from agricultural water. In each mPCR assay, a combination of two or three sets of primer pairs for virulence, antibiotic resistance and toxin (VAT) genes was used and optimized. Assay 1 was developed for the detection of dnaJ, racR and cdtC genes with expected amplification sizes of 720, 584 and 182 bp. Assay 2 generated PCR amplicons for tet(O) and cdtA genes of 559 and 370 bp. Assay 3 amplified cdtB ciaB, and pldA genes with PCR amplicon sizes of 620, 527 and 385 bp. Assay 4 was optimized for flaA and flaB genes that generated PCR amplicons of 855 and 260 bp. The primer pairs and optimized PCR protocols did not show interference and/or cross-amplification with each other and generated the expected size of amplification products for each target VAT gene for the C. jejuni ATCC 33291 reference strain. Overall, all ten target VAT genes were detected at a variable frequency in tested isolates of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. where cdtC, flaB, ciaB, cdtB, cdtA and pldA were commonly detected compared to the flaA, racR, dnaJ and tet(O) genes which were detected with less frequency. The developed mPCR assays are simple, rapid, reliable and sensitive tools for simultaneously assessing potential pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance profiling in thermophilic Campylobacter spp. The mPCR assays will be useful in diagnostic and analytical settings for routine screening of VAT characteristics of Campylobacter spp. as well as being applicable in epidemiological studies by providing information that could be related to the risk of human infection...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus spp. {{and related}} {{bacteria}} form {{a large group}} of organisms which are associated with bovine intramammary Infections (IMI). Some of them are the well-known mastitis pathogens Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, there are a considerable number of these gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci (PNC) with unclear mastitic pathogenicity such as Aerococcus viridans which make the conventional diagnostics of PNC difficult. One diagnostic, API 20 Strep (API, Biomerieux) is recommended which, as a phenotypic assay, involves a series of miniaturized biochemical tests. Recently, preference is given to genotypic identification methods. In particular, sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene allows highly reproducible and accurate identification of bacteria and permits discovery of novel, clinically relevant bacteria. As a consequence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to compare identification of IMI-associated PNC by the API method as well as by sequencing of their 16 S rRNA gene (16 S). Furthermore, the correlation of these bacteria to bovine chronic mastitis and their phylogeny was investigated. 102 PNC isolated from single quarter milk samples were identified by API and 16 S sequencing. Considering Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and Streptococcus agalactiae, both methods generated fully concordant results. In contrast, a very high disconcordance was observed for most of the other PNC, in particular Enterococcus spp., Aerococcus viridans and the viridans streptococci were shown as apathogenic. Lactococcus garvieae was found to be an opportunistic pathogen causing IMI during late lactation. In addition, PNC isolated from milk were frequently observed together with other bacteria, in particular with Staphylococcus spp. In these cases, the levels of somatic cell counts (SCC) were determined by the specific PNC present in the sample. Considering PNC phylogeny based on 16 S sequencing, 3 major clusters were observed. They included all the common mastitis pathogens (cluster I), the Lactococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Aerococcus <b>spp.</b> (cluster <b>II)</b> and all the viridans streptococci (cluster III) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{study of}} zooplankton from surface waters and depth-stratified sampling at selected {{sites in the}} Iceland Sea was conducted during the years 2006 – 2008. The abundance of mesozooplankton was low during winter, when animals were mostly confined to the colder (∼ 0 °C) and deeper (∼ 200 – 1000 m) layers, and peaked during late summer (∼ 11 – 18 g dry weight m− 2, ∼ 300 000 – 400 000 ind. m− 2), when animals resided mainly above the 50 – 100 -m depth range. Diversity was greatest near the shelf edges and least in the central Iceland Sea. Around 32 % of mesozooplankton variability was explained by six variables [longitude, year 2008, temperature, bottom depth, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and salinity]. Three main mesozooplankton communities were identified: (i) an Atlantic community in the east, with Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus <b>spp.</b> most abundant, (<b>ii)</b> an Arctic community at high latitudes, {{with large numbers of}} C. hyperboreus and C. glacialis, and (iii) a community with coastal affinities at lower latitudes, with large numbers of Temora longicornis and Acartia spp. Longitude and Chl a explained ∼ 43 % of macrozooplankton variability (euphausiids and amphipods).

40|$|The genome {{sequence}} of the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) is an important resource providing a reference for comparative genomics studies and future sequenced rosaceous species and has great utility {{as a model for}} the development of markers for mapping in the cultivated strawberry Fragaria ×ananassa Duchesne ex Rozier. A set of 152 microsatellite simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs was developed and mapped, along with 42 previously published but unmapped SSRs, permitting the precise assignment of 28. 2 Mbp of previously unanchored genome sequence scaffolds (13 % of the F. vesca genome sequence). The original ordering of F. vesca sequence scaffolds was performed without a physical map, using predominantly SSR markers to order scaffolds via anchoring to a comprehensive linkage map. This report complements and expands resolution of the Fragaria spp. reference map and refi nes the scaffold ordering of the F. vesca genome sequence using newly devised tools. The results of this study provide two signifi cant resources: (i) the concurrent validation of a substantial set of SSRs associated with these previously unmapped regions of the Fragaria <b>spp.</b> genome and (<b>ii)</b> the precise placement of previously orphaned genomic sequence.

40|$|Type III {{secretion}} systems (T 3 SS) of pathogenic and symbiotic Gram negative bacteria allow direct {{interactions with}} eukaryotic cells. Saprophytic fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. harbouring T 3 SS genes (T 3 SS+) {{have been more}} frequently encountered in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil, which suggests a possible interaction between these bacteria and rhizospheric eukaryotes. Our objectives were to compare, (i) the effect of mycorrhizal and of non-mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula on the occurrence and diversity of T 3 SS+ fluorescent Pseudomonas <b>spp.</b> and (<b>ii)</b> the diversity of T 3 SS+and T 3 SS- bacterial genotypes. Fluorescent pseudomonads from (i) the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal roots of M. truncatula Jemalong J 5 (wild-type, Myc+ Nod+) and TRV 48 (mutant Myc+ Nod-), (ii) the rhizosphere of non-mycorrhizal roots of TRV 45 (mutant Myc- Nod-), and (iii) the corresponding bulk soil were isolated. Pseudomonas spp. strains harbouring T 3 SS genes were identified by PCR targeting a conserved hrcRST DNA fragment. Genotypic diversity of fluorescent pseudomonads {{has been described by}} a whole cell rep-PCR fingerprinting method (BOX-PCR) and 16 S rRNA sequencing. For T 3 SS+ strains the polymorphism of hrcRST has been assessed by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. The occurrence of T 3 SS+ fluorescent pseudomonads was significantly higher in the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal (J 5 and TRV 48) than in that of non-mycorrhizal roots (TRV 45) or in the bulk soil. Four distinct hrcRST genotypes were described, two of which were specifically described for strains associated with mycorrhizal roots. Compared to hrcRST negative fluorescent pseudomonads, T 3 SS+ strains displayed specific BOX-PCR genotypes that were all ascribed to the phylogenetic group of P. fluorescens on the basis of 16 S rRNA gene identity. Mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula clearly influence the population structure of root associated fluorescent pseudomonads in a different way than non-mycorrhizal roots. The occurrence of particular genotypes of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. harbouring T 3 SS genes was highly increased in the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal roots suggesting that T 3 SS might be implicated in cellular interactions between fluorescent pseudomonads and arbuscular mycorrhizae...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Poor {{solubility}} and toxicity severely {{hinder the}} clinical use of amphotericin B (AmB), {{in spite of}} its attractive chemotherapeutic properties. Water-soluble complexes of AmB and polyvinylpyrrolidone (AmB-PVP) could display lower cytotoxicity while maintaining antifungal activity. METHODS: AmB-PVP [with PVP of 10, 24 and 40 kDa (AC 1, AC 2 and AC 4) ] were compared with free AmB for (i) activity against Candida spp. (five albicans; nine non-albicans) and Aspergillus <b>spp.</b> (four strains), (<b>ii)</b> haemolysis of sheep red blood cells, and (iii) release of lactate dehydrogenase from J 774 macrophages [with further comparison with free PVP and a liposomal formulation of amphotericin (AmBisome) ]. RESULTS: MICs and MFCs of AC 1, AC 2 and AC 4 against Candida spp. and of AC 2 and AC 4 against Aspergillus spp. were similar to those of AmB (and even lower for some Candida strains). Killing kinetics (24 h) were also similar. Haemolytic activity of AC 2 and AC 4 was 2 -fold lower than that of free AmB. Cytotoxicity of AC 2 towards J 774 macrophages was 8 -fold lower, and that of AC 4 5 -fold lower than that of AmB and not significantly different from that of AmBisome. The lower cytotoxicity of AC 2, AC 4 was correlated with a lower cellular accumulation of amphotericin. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the lower toxicity of AmB-PVP was not owing to significant change in the monomeric/polymeric forms ratio of the drug. CONCLUSIONS: AmB-PVP complexes compared favourably with AmB for antifungal activity, were less haemolytic and cytotoxic than AmB, and show a similar cytotoxicity profile to AmBisome...|$|R
40|$|Insular environments provide ideal natural {{conditions}} to study disease ecology, especially emerging diseases, due to clear differentiation between local and long-distance transmission. Such environments {{are of particular}} interest regarding tick-borne pathogens (TBP), since animal exchange with the mainland (along with any ticks they carry) is limited, and because such locations could lie on migratory routes for birds carrying ticks. Therefore both tick species and TBP may display different prevalence than those observed on the continent. As such, an epidemiological survey was performed on Belle-Ile-en-Mer, an {{island off the coast}} of Western France, in order to estimate the prevalence of tick species and the microorganisms they carried. Three tick species, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, and Haemaphysalis punctata were collected at five different sites in 2010 and 2011. All ticks were tested for pathogen's and symbiont's DNA by (i) PCR for Anaplasma spp., Borrelia <b>spp.,</b> Rickettsia spp.; (<b>ii)</b> real-time PCR for Francisella tularensis, Francisella-like endosymbionts (FLE) and Coxiella spp. and (iii) PCR-RLB for Babesia-Theileria spp. Pathogen DNA detected in D. marginatus including Bombe spp. (18 %), Rickettsia spp. (13 %) which was identified as R. slovaca, Babesia spp. (8 %), and Theileria spp. (1 %). Pathogens detected in D. reticulatus including Rickettsia spp. (31 %) identified as R. raoulti, Francisella-like endosymbiont (86 %), and Babesia spp (21 %). Pathogens detected in H. punctata including Rickettsia spp. (1 %) identified as R. aeschlimannii, FLE (0. 4 %), Babesia spp. (18 %), and Theileria spp. (7 %). Anaplasma spp., F. tularensis, or Coxiella spp. were not detected in any of the collected ticks. This study represents the first epidemiological survey of the insular Belle-Ile-en-Mer environment. It demonstrated the presence of expected pathogens, consistent with reports from island veterinarians or physicians, as well as unexpected pathogens, raising questions about their potential introduction through infected animals and/or their dispersion by migratory birds...|$|R
