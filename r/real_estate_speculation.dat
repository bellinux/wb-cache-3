40|$|Fluctuations {{of house}} and stock prices have an {{important}} effect on household wealth and, consequently, on household consumption patterns. The literature has found that house price variations have a stronger effect on households’ consumption patterns than stock market variations, although results are not fully conclusive. In this paper I analyze the effects of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and stock market fluctuations on self-reported life-satisfaction levels of around 400, 000 Western European citizens from 1975 to 2002. There are two main findings. First, in line with research on the link between financial wealth and consumption, only <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> variables display a strong and robust effect on happiness, while stock market price changes have a negligible effect. Second, house price increases generate a temporary rise in life-satisfaction due to the capital gain and to the higher borrowing capacity, but also a permanent negative effect due to the lower affordability of houses. Therefore, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>speculations</b> increase life-satisfaction only in the short term, while in the medium-long term the negative effect connected to the lower affordability of houses prevails...|$|R

25|$|Tax {{choice is}} {{the theory that}} taxpayers should have more control with how their {{individual}} taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>speculation,</b> business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.|$|E

In 1884 scandal hit the family bank when one of Amos' sons, John Chester Eno, president of the bank, embezzled millions of dollars and then fled to Canada to avoid prosecution.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of participatory urban design in Belgrade, namely of the series of recent unsolicited activities that has contributed to setting up a specific micro environment in the neighbourhood of Savamala. Its main aim is to promote bottom-up urban development, surpass current profit-oriented trends, and benefit from sociospatial contradictions as opportunities for creativity and participation. The Savamala neighbourhood {{is among the most}} important landmarks in Belgrade. Endowed with rich historical heritage and extraordinary spatial potential, Savamala is now a traffic bottleneck with intense pollution, urban noise and socio-spatial conflicts. In order to set up an engine for urban development, several streams of participatory activities have been launched by NGOs and IOs, such as: online campaigns and networking, informal research activities, pop-up events and instant actions for societal progress and bottom-up economic activities. The Actor-network theory (ANT) methodological approach demystifies the circumstances of participation and the role of various actors in building pathways of urban transformations in Savamala, while the Multi-agent system (MAS) proposes the framework for tracing their behaviour at the neighbourhood level. A complex post-socialist framework presents a challenge for these participatory activities to provide opportunities for urban transformations, based on social interest rather than on <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>speculations.</b> In the lack of official strategies and institutionalised support, the MAS-ANT method involves estimating whether an economy of social exchange could contribute to improving the quality of life and functionality of urban systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{essence of}} this thesis {{is based on}} the fact that {{downtown}} waterfronts are special urban areas in a city. These areas offer unique opportunities for providing cultural and recreational public amenities to urban life. The important difference between water as a natural resource and water as an urban amenity lies in the relationship of water with the urban form. In downtown waterfronts two opposite forces confront each other. From the landside urban land use. transportation network and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>speculations</b> compete against the waterside forces of water related activities and the right of public to use the waterfront for recreation and other activities. Finding the balance between these two forces is the key to successful use of downtown waterfronts. This thesis examines the prospect of finding a balance for the development of Boston's downtown waterfront. The problems and potentials of Boston's waterfront is analyzed first to form the basis for evaluating the existing and proposed development plans on the waterfront. The results of more than two decades of development activities have left Boston's waterfront short of the balance which makes the difference between the waterfront as an enjoyable public area and the waterfront as an overbuilt extension of downtown urban fabric. The implications of the existing and proposed developments are analyzed to assess the future of Boston's waterfront. The synthesis of this analysis identifies the major concerns for the present and future development activities and formulates the directions and guidelines for developments. These guidelines are proposed as broad based outlines and illustrated examples of critical spot are provided as images of developments following the guidelines. by Mohammad Iqbal Hossain. Thesis (M.
