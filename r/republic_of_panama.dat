50|$|Panama, {{situated}} in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus <b>of</b> <b>Panama,</b> has {{for most of its}} history been culturally linked to South America. <b>Panama</b> was part <b>of</b> the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came {{under the jurisdiction of the}} newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, <b>Panama</b> became part <b>of</b> a successor state, the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Colombia in 1886. As part <b>of</b> the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> Colombia, <b>Panama</b> State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession <b>of</b> <b>Panama</b> on 3 November 1903.
