40|$|Delivering {{multimedia}} {{services to}} <b>roaming</b> <b>subscribers</b> raises significant challenges for content providers. There {{are a number}} of reasons for this; however, the principal difficulties arise from the inherent differences between the nature of mobile computing usage, and that of its static counterpart. The harnessing of appropriate contextual elements pertaining to a mobile subscriber at any given time offers significant opportunities for enhancing and customising service delivery. Dynamic content provision is a case in point. The versatile nature of the mobile subscriber offers opportunities for the delivery of content that is most appropriate to the subscriber 2 ̆ 7 s prevailing context, and hence is most likely to be welcomed. To succeed in this endeavour requires an innate understanding of the technologies, the mobile usage paradigm and the application domain in question, such that conflicting demands may be reconciled to the subscriber 2 ̆ 7 s benefit. In this paper, multimedia-augmented service provision for mobile subscribers is considered in light of the avail- ability of contextual information. In particular, context-aware precaching is advocated as a means of maximising the possibilities for delivering context- aware services to mobile subscribers in scenarios of dynamic contexts...|$|R

25|$|Count 3: Modification {{of mobile}} roaming agreement. Previously, {{there were no}} roaming {{agreements}} between mobile operators – subscribers from one operator {{were not allowed to}} use services on another operator's network, thus limiting the growth of the mobile industry. Under the Thaksin government, roaming was allowed, with roaming fees deducted from the revenue that AIS and other operators had to share with TOT and other state enterprises. Essentially, TOT helped AIS shoulder the costs of its <b>subscribers</b> <b>roaming</b> on the mobile networks of other operators. This reduced TOT and CAT's income while benefiting the operators. However, the judges ruled that it while benefited AIS, it did so to the benefit of AIS's new owners (Temasek Holdings) rather than Thaksin, and hence was not an abuse of power.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} management domains {{as a means of}} specifying and controlling the services a subscriber is entitled to use in an international cellular network. The Pan European Cellular Network is made up of multiple network vendors in different countries offering a variety of services. Domains provide the means of grouping network resources or subscribers in order to specify service access policy. We explain how such a system {{can be used in a}} hypothetical environment which permits <b>roaming</b> of mobile <b>subscribers</b> between networks in different countries, while a call is in progress. The paper discusses accounting issues in such an environment and describes the mechanisms needed to cater for roaming during a call.

INTRODUCTION The concept of a Management Domain 1 as a means of grouping objects for management purposes has been identified in a number of papers [Sloman 89, DO [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} penetration of wireless communications systems, customers are expecting {{the same level}} of service, reliability and performance from the wireless communication systems as the traditional wire-line networks. Due to the dynamic environment, such as the <b>roaming</b> of mobile <b>subscribers,</b> maintaining a high radio frequency (RF) availability {{is one of the most}} challenging aspects in wireless network management. To date, in wireless network management, a call is dropped when the channel it uses goes down. In order to increase system end-to-end availability, an RF channel recovery scheme is proposed in this paper. When an RF channel fails, the channel is replaced by another working channel and the call continues. The methods to replace failed RF channels of ongoing calls and to handle channel failures of handoff and new calls are investigated. Markov reward models are developed to compare system availability and performance. Automated generation and solution of Markov reward models is facilitated by a version of stochastic Petri nets that we call stochastic reward nets. The results show that the recovery scheme reduces the dropped calls and the blocked calls significantly under both light and normal traffics. ...|$|R
