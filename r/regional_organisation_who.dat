5000|$|In the {{preamble}} of the resolution, the Council recalled initiatives since January 1993 to improve co-ordination between the United Nations and <b>regional</b> <b>organisations.</b> It emphasised that {{the contribution of}} <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> could complement {{the work of the}} United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. The capacity of <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> was to be strengthened and the Council acknowledged the resolve of the 2005 World Summit to increase the role of <b>regional</b> <b>organisations.</b> [...] A decision to establish at Peacebuilding Commission was also welcomed.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} will assess the extent, if any, to which <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> are developing and/or maintaining peace and security. Which is primarily {{the role of}} the UN under Article 2 of the Charter. Regionalism is a three tier system. At the top is the UN with the key <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> located in the middle and nation states at the bottom. Assuming that <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> do of course operate some level of peace maintenance, one must then consider if this at the appropriate level? Furthering the debate, this research approaches the consideration of delegation – should <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> be strengthened {{at the expense of the}} UN and states? Or perhaps the UN should be strengthened in order to ensure its work-ability in light of previous research that would suggest it is not as effective as it might be or indeed as was envisaged in 1945. In order to consider the above issues, this {{research will}} identify what the consequences are of <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> acting outside of the international law arena; and most importantly, if one is to decide that <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> or the UN should be strengthened, how can the UN Charter be amended to reflect the progression of international law...|$|R

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>organisations</b> {{have been}} {{mushrooming}} {{since the turn}} of the century. <b>Regional</b> <b>organisation</b> is attractive because it offers flexible responses to the challenges of globalisation. However, the uncertainty with respect to <b>regional</b> <b>organisation</b> is endemic since governments tend to postpone or renege on ambitious plans for far-reaching regionalisation, not knowing what its implications would be. When a <b>regional</b> <b>organisation</b> engages in a common market project, then the question of the ratio of benefits against costs becomes so highly relevant that constitutional decision-making is called for. A new structure for economic regulation must be designed and enforced, the consequences of which spill over into other state regulations. A regional trading block must devise and run a minimum of common institutions in order to qualify as an organisation. In a maximum approach, a <b>regional</b> <b>organisation</b> takes over public competences from the participating nation-states. Regionalism is on its way to becoming a new interdisciplinary field in the social and economic sciences.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 16 years the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) {{has gone from}} just a Southeast Asian {{organisation}} to leading three <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> in East Asia and the Asia Pacific. This thesis explains why this occurred, providing three main reasons. The first is ASEAN’s experience; it is the oldest functioning <b>regional</b> <b>organisation</b> in Asia and thus a good candidate to lead other <b>regional</b> <b>organisations.</b> The second reason is the trans-Pacific Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum: the events around APEC’s founding drove the creation of East Asian led <b>regional</b> <b>organisations.</b> This resulted in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which as its name suggests is ASEAN led. As well, APEC’s unpopular actions during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) drove the creation of another East Asian organisation led by ASEAN, ASEAN Plus Three (A+ 3). The third reason relates to ASEAN’s long time focus on preserving state sovereignty, {{which has led to}} ASEAN building up a notable level of expertise dealing with threats to sovereignty. As well as this, East Asian regionalism has largely been driven by threats to sovereignty. These two facts made ASEAN an organisation well-suited to lead <b>regional</b> <b>organisations</b> in East Asia...|$|R
