5|$|Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds {{under its}} bark. Regeneration from root suckers {{has also been}} recorded.

5|$|On 18 April 2007 it was {{announced}} that Scooch had been signed to the Warner Bros. label.

5|$|To access these songs, after {{lowering}} the restraint, on the screen, riders must push {{and hold the}} logo of the ride for approximately ten seconds.

5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and <b>release</b> <b>their</b> seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E

5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids <b>release</b> <b>their</b> {{eggs into}} the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to <b>release</b> <b>their</b> offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E

5|$|At 16:00 on 30 January, {{a flight}} of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group, based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, {{attacked}} the force towing Chicago. Fighter aircraft from Enterprise shot down eight of them, {{but most of the}} Japanese aircraft were able to <b>release</b> <b>their</b> torpedoes before crashing. One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit Chicago, sinking her.|$|E
5|$|At first, the Japanese bombers {{appeared}} {{to be trying to}} approach and attack Enterprise but turned toward Chicago after six Enterprise CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the 751AG aircraft as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from Chicagos escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers were shot down before they could <b>release</b> <b>their</b> ordnance. Six more were shot down moments later, but not before they dropped their torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy <b>release</b> <b>their</b> seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E

5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and <b>release</b> <b>their</b> energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one‚Äînot only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and <b>release</b> <b>their</b> songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its <b>release,</b> <b>their</b> fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E
