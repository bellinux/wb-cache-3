40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the practice-effects on motor skill transfer {{and the associated}} <b>representational</b> <b>memory</b> changes that occur during the within-practice and between-practice phases. In two experiments, participants produced extension-flexion movements with their dominant right arm for a limited or prolonged practice session arranged in either a single- or multi-session format. We tested the ability of participants to transfer the original pattern (extrinsic transformation) or the mirrored one (intrinsic transformation) to the non-dominant left arm, 10 min and 24 h after the practice sessions. Results showed that practice induces rapid motor skill improvements that are non-transferable irrespective {{of the amount of}} acquisition trials. Furthermore, the extrinsic component of the skill develops early and remains the dominant coding system during practice. Conversely, we found distinct between-practice memory changes: a limited practice induces an off-line development of the extrinsic component, whereas a prolonged practice session subserves the off-line development of the intrinsic component (experiment 2). We provided further evidence that the long-term representation of the motor skill also depends {{on the nature of the}} practice session itself: the parsing of practice into multiple sessions narrows the effector-transfer capacities in comparison to a single session (experiment 1). These findings yield theoretical and practical implications that are discussed in the context of recent motor skill learning models...|$|E

40|$|The {{particular}} ways {{in which}} theatre functions as a medium of cultural memory and trauma relief, have been widely debated over the years. This article outlines how theatrical master-narratives ‘working through’ cultural traumas are ‘productions’ of a dominant <b>representational</b> <b>memory</b> regime. The representational logic and the preconceived cathartic effect of Aristotle’s Poetics is foundational for this form of theatre memory. Its classical dramatic aesthetic founds tradition and safeguards continuity and identity {{at the cost of}} a-presentational modes of coping with traumas and at the cost of differential perspectives. These theatrical master-narratives ‘working through’ cultural traumas function in an inclusive as well as an exclusive way. With Marketplace 76 Needcompany ‘narrates’ how a community deals with violence, catastrophe, loss, sadness and traumatic experiences in a very particular way. Instead of providing a unilateral master-narrative, the performance offers a kaleidoscope of sideway glances (Žižek) on violence and trauma. Jan Lauwers in that way moves beyond the strictures of a poetics of representation and inaugurates what I call an embodied poetics of failure. The postdramatic aesthetic of Marketplace 76 presents corporeal intensities that testify of the failure to fully comprehend or narrate a traumatic experience. In spite of their efforts, the characters do not ‘work through’ their traumatic past heroically. The performance does not entail a cathartic effect (Aristotle), but contains the potential to produce a shock to thought (Deleuze) that is expressive of so-called ‘inspeakable’ violent or traumatic events. Stuttering, stumbling, falling and vanishing bodies are in that sense the ‘bodies that matter’. This embodied poetics of failure also entails an ethical perspective; it dismantles the differential distribution of precarity at work in a unilateral master-narrative ‘working through’ cultural traumas...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} modular {{account of}} memory segregates visual associative memory and visual perception, {{with the former}} underpinned by the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and the latter by posterior visual regions. By contrast, the <b>representational</b> account of <b>memory</b> envisages visual associative memory as a perceptual-mnemonic continuum that can be traced from early visual cortex to anterior MTL structures. In this thesis, we tested these fundamentally different memory models by using a novel between-group design with young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls, each of whom have their respective strengths and weaknesses in memory and perception. Specifically, grapheme-colour synaesthetes possess enhanced perceptual mechanisms, allowing them to experience black letters, words or digits as inherently coloured. They also show enhanced early visual cortex sensitivity in response to non-synaesthesia inducing stimuli (Barnett et al., 2008) as well as enhanced memory for verbal and visual stimuli.

40|$|Infants {{begin to}} {{coordinate}} their actions into means-end sequences at eight to nine months of age, as indicated by their willingness to search for objects that are occluded, and by their ability to use supports to pull distant objects within reach. However, the occurrence of perseverative responses like the A-not-B error {{through the end of}} the first year suggests an inflexibility in means-end actions, in that infants fail to respond on the basis of context-specific information, but rather respond on the basis of previously rewarded action. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate two antithetical explanations of infant search errors [...] one that attributes errors solely to repeated motor experience, and one that invokes the notion of <b>representational,</b> or working <b>memory</b> to describe means-end search. ^ Nine-, twelve-, and eighteen-month-old infants were tested on a violation of expectation search procedure. Infants were given repeated practice pulling down a screen to retrieve a toy. After several trials, a second identical screen was surreptitiously inserted behind the first, forcing infants to adapt their search behavior to the novel layout in order to successfully retrieve the toy. Infants at the three ages were tested on an 2 ̆ 7 opaque 2 ̆ 7 condition, in which both of the screens were opaque and covered with an identical checkerboard pattern. Nine- and twelve-month-olds were also tested in two control conditions. In the 2 ̆ 7 transparent 2 ̆ 7 control condition, the two screens were fitted with plexiglass windows, thus eliminating the need to represent the existence of the toy. In the 2 ̆ 7 no-toy 2 ̆ 7 control condition, the screens were opaque, but no toys were hidden and subjects were simply given a series of trials with one screen and then tested with two screens. ^ The results supported the working <b>memory,</b> <b>representational</b> account of infant search. In the opaque condition, most nine-month-olds searched for the toy behind the second cover. Twelve-month-olds, however, were less likely than the nine-month-olds to pull down both screens, and frequently persisted in their efforts to find the toy behind the first screen. Infants in the two control conditions did not have this difficulty extending their action to the second screen. Eighteen-month-olds quickly solved the double-cover problem, rapidly pulling down both screens. The poorer performance of the twelve-month-olds suggests that they accurately represented the location of the toy where they had seen it hidden (behind the first screen), and thus failed to consider the second screen as a possible hiding location for the toy. ...|$|R
40|$|Spaced {{learning}} with time to consolidate {{leads to more}} stabile memory traces. However, {{little is known about}} the neural correlates of trace stabilization, especially in humans. The present fMRI study contrasted retrieval activity of two well-learned sets of face-location associations, one learned in a massed style and tested on the day of learning (i. e., labile condition) and another learned in a spaced scheme over the course of one week (i. e., stabilized condition). Both sets of associations were retrieved equally well, but the retrieval of stabilized association was faster and accompanied by large-scale changes in the network supporting retrieval. Cued recall of stabilized as compared with labile associations was accompanied by increased activity in the precuneus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral temporal pole, and left temporo-parietal junction. Conversely, <b>memory</b> <b>representational</b> areas such as the fusiform gyrus for faces and the posterior parietal cortex for locations did not change their activity with stabilization. The changes in activation in the precuneus, which also showed increased connectivity with the fusiform area, are likely to be related to the spatial nature of our task. The activation increase in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, might reflect a general function in stabilized memory retrieval. This area might succeed the hippocampus in linking distributed neocortical representations...|$|R
40|$|Turnbull & McGeorge (1998) asked a {{group of}} {{participants}} if they had bumped into anything recently and if so, on what side? Results reflected a trend towards bumping on the right. This tendency to bump into objects on the right has since been observed in a naturalistic setting (Nicholls, Loftus, Meyer, & Mattingley, 2007). But rather than an interesting quirk of statistics these studies, and many others have captured a phenomenon called pseudoneglect (Bowers and Heilman, 1980). It represents a subtle yet consistent bias in our spatial attention towards the left half of space {{and away from the}} right which results in the pattern of bumping or other lateralised errors seen in the spatial attention literature (See Jewell & McCourt, 2000). Furthermore, this bias does not just impact the perceptual sphere; it also crosses into the <b>representational,</b> impacting our <b>memory</b> for visual information (Bisiach & Luzatti, 1987). But whether this is consistent in individuals who are trained in an accuracy based sport remains unknown. The current research sought to examine perceptual and representational pseudoneglect effects in {{a group of}} expert archers compared to neurologically healthy controls.

40|$|International audienceThe working {{hypothesis}} {{of the paper}} is that motor images are endowed with the same properties {{as those of the}} (corresponding) motor representations, and therefore have the same functional relationship to the imagined or represented movement and the same causal role in the generation of this movement. The fact that the timing of simulated movements follows the same constraints as that of actually executed movements is consistent with this hypothesis. Accordingly, many neural mechanisms are activated during motor imagery, as revealed by a sharp increase in tendinous reflexes in the limb imagined to move, and by vegetative changes which correlate with the level of mental effort. At the cortical level, a specific pattern of activation, that closely resembles that of action execution, is observed in areas devoted to motor control. This activation might be the substrate for the effects of mental training. A hierarchical model of the organization of action is proposed: this model implies a short-term memory storage of a 'copy' of the various <b>representational</b> steps. These <b>memories</b> are erased when an action corresponding to the represented goal takes place. By contrast, if the action is incompletely or not executed, the whole system remains activated, and the content of the representation is rehearsed. This mechanism would be the substrate for conscious access to this content during motor imagery and mental training...|$|R

In Experiment 1, {{we found that}} presentation of a mask 3 s before onset of a reference Gabor patch caused a selective, spatial frequency dependent interference in a subsequent discrimination task. However, a 10 s interval abolished this masking effect. In Experiment 2, the mask {{was associated with a}} second spatial frequency discrimination task so that a representation of the mask had to be coded into short-term perceptual memory. This experiment was performed to assess whether absence of masking in the 10 s condition of Experiment 1 might be due to decay of the mask information in the perceptual or the <b>memory</b> <b>representational</b> domain. The presence of this second discrimination task now caused similar interference effects on the primary discrimination task at both the 3 s and 10 s interstimulus intervals (ISI) conditions. Finally, to test the robustness of the masking effect, the nature of the secondary masking task was changed from a spatial frequency discrimination task to an orientation discrimination task in Experiment 3. The masking effect was now abolished in both the 3 and 10 s ISI conditions. Together, the results from these experiments are consistent {{with the idea of a}} two-level perceptual memory mechanism. The results also suggest that stimulus representations during a perceptual discrimination task are shared between the perceptual and memory representation domains in a task-dependent manner...|$|R

J., & Saksida, L. M. Memory, perception, and the ventral visual-perirhinal-hippocampal stream: Thinking outside of the boxes. Hippocampus, 17, 898 – 908, 2007]. We tested this account using a novel between-group design with young grapheme-color synesthetes, older adults, and young controls. We investigated how the disparate sensory-perceptual abilities between these groups translated into associative memory performance for visual stimuli that do not induce synesthesia. ROI analyses of the entire ventral visual stream showed that associative retrieval (a pair-associate retrieved {{in the absence of a}} visual stimulus) yielded enhanced activity in young and older adults' visual regions relative to synesthetes, whereas associative recognition (deciding whether a visual stimulus was the correct pair-associate) was characterized by enhanced activity in synesthetes' visual regions relative to older adults. Whole-brain analyses at associative retrieval revealed an effect of age in early visual cortex, with older adults showing enhanced activity relative to synesthetes and young adults. At associative recognition, the group effect was reversed: Synesthetes showed significantly enhanced activity relative to young and older adults in early visual regions. The inverted group effects observed between retrieval and recognition indicate that reduced sensitivity in visual cortex (as in aging) comes with increased activity during top–down retrieval and decreased activity during bottom–up recognition, whereas enhanced sensitivity (as in synesthesia) shows the opposite pattern. Our results provide novel evidence for the direct contribution of perceptual mechanisms to visual associative memory based on the examples of synesthesia and aging...|$|R

40|$|Episodic memory, {{the ability}} to store and {{retrieve}} information from our past, {{is at the very}} heart of human experience, underpinning our identity and relationship with the world. Episodic memory is not a unitary phenomenon: in dual-process theory, researchers draw a distinction between familiarity, a rapid and automatic sense of oldness to a previously encountered stimulus ("I know that face"), and recollection, the reactivation of additional context from a particular episode ("We met at the York conference"). A fundamental objective in the study of human memory is to ground recollection and familiarity in neural terms. This requires accurately measuring the contribution of each from behavioural data, which in turn relies on an accurate characterisation of recollection. This thesis introduces a novel source retrieval task to demonstrate that recollection has two critical, and fiercely contested, properties: it is thresholded, i. e. it can fail completely, and successful recollection is graded, i. e. it varies in strength. The consequences of this characterisation are explored. Firstly, familiarity and recollection are functionally separable retrieval mechanisms. Secondly, the models currently used to measure the contribution of each are generally flawed, and a corrected model is described which better fits, and explains, the extant data. Finally, the frequency of recollection is shown to be dissociable from its strength, a result which links behavioural data more strongly than before to a neurocomputational account of episodic memory, and which suggests a relationship between the <b>representational</b> overlap of <b>memory</b> traces and their retrieval. This thesis necessitates a change in the way behavioural memory data is modelled, and consequently the interpretation of evidence underpinning neuroanatomical accounts of memory experience. Significantly, however, it also moves the field beyond a long-running debate and provides a deeper dual-process framework with which to address outstanding questions about the relationship between, and neural basis of, episodic memory processes.

40|$|First {{published}} online 18 June, 2014 Whether out {{of historical}} interest, romantic {{identification with the}} colonized or as models for contemporary counter-insurgency experts, the mass violence of insurgency and counter-insurgency in the post-war decolonization of the European empires has long exerted an intense fascination. In the main, the dramas in French Algeria and British Kenya in the 1950 s have dominated the scene, overshadowing the equally violent events that unfolded in the Dutch, Belgian and Portuguese empires. Colonial counterinsurgency and mass violence is the first book in English to treat the intense conflict {{that occurred during the}} ‘Indonesian revolution’—the decolonization struggle of the Dutch East Indies between 1945 and 1949. This case is particularly significant as the first episode of post-war colonial violence, indeed one with global reverberations. International opinion was ranged against the Dutch, and the nascent United Nations condemned its euphemistically termed ‘police actions’ to reclaim the archipelago from Indonesian nationalists after defeat by the Japanese in 1942. As this book makes clear, however, intra-Indonesian violence was no less prevalent, as rival independence visions vied for control and villagers were caught between the fronts. Taking a multi-perspectival approach, eighteen authors examine the origins of the conflict as well as its <b>representational</b> and <b>memory</b> dimensions. Colonial counterinsurgency and mass violence will appeal to scholars of imperial history, mass violence and memory studies alike. [...] 1.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the representation of}} left-wing political violence in Italian and German films from 2000 to 2010 drawing on postmodernism theory, film genre, memory studies and gender theory. It considers filmic texts and paratexts, historiography and political discourses to offer a comparative analysis of the mnemonic dynamics in new millennial Italy and Germany. This thesis looks at why the experience of revolutionary terrorism in the 1970 s reappears {{at the turn of}} the new millennium in a cluster of fiction films, which innovate and sometimes challenge previous paradigms. It reads this revival in connection with industrial trends and historical events, such as the end of old ideologies, the early release of former terrorists and 9 / 11. The memory of left-wing terrorism has found new lifeblood in the new millennium because there are ample resonances with contemporary social issues, such as political activism and global fears of international terrorism. Focusing on eight case studies, I argue that the memory of left-wing terrorism unfolds beyond and across temporal and spatial boundaries, reactivated by present-day occurrences and through contacts with other traumatic memories. The notion of ‘interconnected memory’ is fundamentally conceived as a nexus of multiple meanings, the fruit of past recollections, and movements between different socio-historical dimensions and generational <b>memories.</b> <b>Representational</b> strategies and narrative trends are also explored to shed light on crossnational forms of memorialising political violence and its legacy. The first part analyses how postmillennial films deal with the possibility of forgiveness, here interpreted as an approach to normalise the past through narratives of pacification or exclusion. It highlights the figure of the teenager as a metaphor for the changing memory of terrorism, generational conflicts and the implications of 1970 s violence for young generations. Moreover, it discusses the depiction of female terrorists and the containment strategies adopted to mitigate the anxiety for terrorist acts perpetrated by violent women. The second part of this thesis is concerned with the risks of forgetting and more precisely on an aesthetic normalisation of the terrorist discourse through popular genres and a more commercial style. It comments on the hyper-authenticity and retro aesthetics in biopics about notorious terrorist groups, and the spectacularisation of violence via the thriller and heritage film genre. It also investigates how contemporary comedies satirise the phenomenon of anarchist revolts and political kidnappings to reflect on present-day social problems...|$|R
40|$|Drawing is a {{spontaneous}} activity in childhood. Various drawing assessments are currently used {{in education and}} health fields to assess aspects of children’s cognitive and emotional development from either a developmental or a clinical perspective. Recent research has shown a need for further studies on drawing assessments. The Person House Tree drawing (PHT) assessment was developed by McAllen from a developmental perspective based on the pedagogy of Rudolf Steiner and has been used without rigorous research to support its application. Drawing {{has been shown to}} assess various aspects of cognitive development related to <b>representational</b> thought, working <b>memory,</b> spatial ability and children’s fine motor skills. McAllen proposed that the PHT drawing of the person typifyied the child’s cognitive representation of their body geography; features related to spatial awareness established spatial ability; and execution of the drawing demonstrated fine motor ability. This study aimed to conceptualise elements of children’s drawings in a systematic way to identify the features of the PHT drawing that were significant for typical and atypical children, aged from five to ten years of age in mainstream education. Plus assess the ability of the PHT drawing assessment to predict the likelihood of a child being atypical. The initial part of the study involved the development of a scoring system for the PHT drawing assessment. A pilot study was conducted to refine the scoring system and establish face validity for the PHT scoring system. The inter-rater reliability was investigated and shown to be strong (Cohen’s Kappa 0. 83). Next the PHT drawing assessment was administered to 546 children aged from five to ten years in mainstream education in public schools in the Australian Capital Territory. A teacher checklist was used to identify children as typical or atypical in the data sample. Atypical children were identified by the teacher as receiving or requiring additional resources to learn and participate in school. The data were analysed with SPSS 17 software using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure and followed by a logistic regression. The results established between 28 to 69 statistically significant features for the Person (58), the House (28), the Tree (35) and the complete PHT drawing (69) for typical children and seven to ten statistically significant features for the Person (10), the House (7), the Tree (9) and the complete PHT drawing (9) for atypical children. The final model from the logistic regression analysis showed discrete sets of 13 to 18 features for the Person (18), the House (13), the Tree (14) and the complete PHT drawing (18) that had robust predictive validity for identifying the likelihood that a child was atypical. The results of this study found that typical children showed more complex body geography, increased spatial awareness and more numerous fine motor skills demonstrated in their PHT drawing compared to their atypical peers. The results give strong support for the PHT drawing and the scoring system developed in this study {{to be used as a}} screening instrument by both teachers and other professionals to predict the likelihood of a child being atypical...|$|R
