5|$|The {{molecule}} <b>ritonavir,</b> {{marketed as}} Norvir, was {{developed as a}} protease inhibitor and used to target HIV infection. However, {{it has been shown}} to inhibit proteasomes as well as free proteases; to be specific, the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome is inhibited by <b>ritonavir,</b> while the trypsin-like activity is somewhat enhanced. Studies in animal models suggest that <b>ritonavir</b> may have inhibitory effects on the growth of glioma cells.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and <b>ritonavir</b> delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, <b>ritonavir,</b> and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of <b>ritonavir,</b> a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, <b>ritonavir,</b> St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|Nevirapine is a {{substrate}} for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant {{administration of}} drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include <b>ritonavir,</b> fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ritonavir</b> or lopinavir/ritonavir greatly {{increase}} plasma concentrations of oxycodone in healthy human volunteers due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Rifampicin greatly reduces plasma concentrations of oxycodone due to strong induction of CYP3A4. There {{is also a}} case report of fosphenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer, dramatically reducing the analgesic effects of oxycodone in a chronic pain patient. Dosage or medication adjustments may be necessary in each case.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} drug {{interactions}} can occur between MDMA and other drugs, including serotonergic drugs. MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like <b>ritonavir</b> (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Concurrent use of MDMA high dosages with another serotonergic drug {{can result in}} a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in people who took MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix).|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is {{extensively}} metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 {{and to a}} lesser extent CYP3A4. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, <b>ritonavir,</b> itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.|$|E
25|$|Asthenia (Greek: ἀσθένεια, lit lack of {{strength}} but also disease) {{is a medical}} term referring to {{a condition in which}} the body lacks or has lost strength either as a whole or in any of its parts. It denotes symptoms of physical weakness and loss {{of strength}}. General asthenia occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as tuberculosis and cancer), sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart, lungs or kidneys, and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland. Asthenia may be limited to certain organs or systems of organs, as in asthenopia, characterized by ready fatiguability. Asthenia is also a side effect of some medications and treatments, such as <b>Ritonavir</b> (a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment), vaccines such as the HPV vaccine Gardasil and fentanyl patches (an opioid used to treat pain).|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, <b>ritonavir</b> and {{nefazodone}} {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|Ketoconazole and Itraconazole have a {{profound}} effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia and renal failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, [...] fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, [...] rifampicin, <b>ritonavir,</b> and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on Atripla.|$|E
2500|$|Protease inhibitors {{block the}} viral {{protease}} enzyme necessary to produce mature virions upon budding from the host membrane. [...] Particularly, these drugs prevent the cleavage of gag and gag/pol precursor proteins. [...] Virus particles {{produced in the}} presence of protease inhibitors are defective and mostly non-infectious. Examples of HIV protease inhibitors are lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and <b>ritonavir.</b> Darunavir and atazanavir are currently recommended as first line therapy choices. Maturation inhibitors have a similar effect by binding to gag, but development of two experimental drugs in this class, bevirimat and vivecon, was halted in 2010. [...] Resistance to some protease inhibitors is high. Second generation drugs have been developed that are effective against otherwise resistant HIV variants.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{behind this}} welcome observation was not directly known, but {{later it was}} determined that <b>ritonavir</b> inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. Normally, this enzyme metabolizes saquinavir to an inactive form, but with the <b>ritonavir</b> inhibiting this enzyme, the saquinavir blood plasma levels increased considerably. Additionally, <b>ritonavir</b> also inhibits multidrug transporters, although to a much lower extent.|$|E
50|$|Lopinavir was {{developed}} by Abbott {{in an attempt to}} improve on the HIV resistance and serum protein-binding properties of the company's earlier protease inhibitor, <b>ritonavir.</b> Administered alone, lopinavir has insufficient bioavailability; however, like several HIV protease inhibitors, its blood levels are greatly increased by low doses of <b>ritonavir,</b> a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4. Abbott therefore pursued a strategy of co-administering lopinavir with sub-therapeutic doses of <b>ritonavir,</b> and lopinavir is only marketed as a co-formulation with <b>ritonavir.</b> It is the first multi-drug capsule to contain a drug not available individually.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ritonavir</b> is {{manufactured}} as Norvir by AbbVie, Inc.. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved <b>ritonavir</b> on March 1, 1996, {{making it}} the seventh approved antiretroviral drug and the second approved protease inhibitor in the United States.
