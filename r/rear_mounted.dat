5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
25|$|The Chevrolet Corvair is {{a compact}} car {{manufactured}} by Chevrolet for model years 1960–1969. It {{was the only}} American-designed, mass-produced passenger car to use a <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> air-cooled engine.|$|E
25|$|The AC-35 had {{side-by-side}} seating {{with a small}} baggage compartment. The fuselage was {{a combination}} of steel tube in front, and wood construction in the tail with fabric covering overall. The engine was <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> with a shaft driven forward propeller. The vehicle had three equal size wheels (two in front, one in the rear). The rear wheel was shaft driven from the engine and the front wheels provided steering.|$|E

25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with autopilot, autothrottle and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, VFR and IFR flights, and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known icing conditions, extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Datsun {{released}} the locally produced 180B in October 1972 as a four-door sedan in Deluxe and GL trims, and a two-door SSS coupe. The engine fitted was the 1.8-liter L18 engine paired to a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission; Datsun upgraded the SSS to a five-speed manual in 1975. Over the base Deluxe, GL models added: vinyl roof, radio with separate speaker, upgraded interior upholstery and trim, cut-pile interior carpeting, chrome exhaust extension, <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> GL badge, and whitewall tyres. In early 1974, wrap-around front indicators, new tail-lights and cabin trim changes heralded a range-wide facelift, while a fully imported (not locally manufactured) luxury GX sedan arrived in November 1974.|$|E
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} <b>rear,</b> <b>mounted</b> {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E

2500|$|The Amitron was {{designed}} to minimize power loss by keeping down rolling resistance, wind drag resistance, and vehicle weight. The prototype was a snub-snouted three-passenger urban area vehicle or city car with an overall length of only [...] Among its unique automobile design features were passenger seats that had air filled cushions, rather than conventional polyurethane (foam rubber). The car did not feature conventional body side doors, but the canopy of the vehicle was hinged up and backward ("clamshell type" [...] on <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> pivots) for entry and egress.|$|E
50|$|A key {{structural}} {{weakness of}} front-mounted support is the shear stress {{placed on the}} mounting rails and {{the leading edge of}} the equipment. As a result, 4-post racks have become common, with such racks featuring a mirrored pair of <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> posts. Since the spacing between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>mounting</b> posts may differ between rack vendors and/or the configuration of the rack (some racks may incorporate front and rear rails that may be moved forwards and backwards, i.e. APC SX-range racks), it's common for equipment that features 4-post mounting brackets, to have an adjustable rear bracket.|$|R

2500|$|Single Action Release Personal Equipment Lowering Equipment (SARPELS) – The Force Recon {{operators}} {{are equipped with}} a complete equipment lowering system for both LLSL and MFF parachute operations. It allows them carry various configurations of all their individual mission-essential equipment, usually contained within their Flyer's Kitbag. SARPELS provides easy access to their weapons and equipment upon parachute landing and has a single-action release capability. It can be front or <b>rear</b> <b>mounted,</b> whichever is preferred. Once they have descended to about [...] above the surface, they use the SARPEL to release their gear (weapons/kitbag), dropping it below them while still attached to their harness by a [...] rope. It is used to minimize injuries in landing due to heavy load of equipment. The parachustists must maneuver themselves {{in order not to}} drop onto their gear during parachute landing falls.|$|E

2500|$|The Tracker {{carried an}} {{internal}} torpedo bay {{capable of carrying}} two lightweight torpedoes or one nuclear depth charge. [...] There were six underwing hard points for rocket pods and conventional depth charges or up to four additional torpedoes. [...] A ventrally-mounted retractable radome for AN/APS-38 radar and a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) AN/ASQ-8 mounted on an extendable <b>rear</b> <b>mounted</b> boom were also fitted. [...] Early model Trackers had an Electronic Surveillance Measures (ESM) pod mounted dorsally just aft of the front seat overhead hatches and were also fitted with a smoke particle detector or [...] "sniffer". [...] Later S-2s had the sniffer removed and had the ESM antennae moved to four rounded extensions on the wingtips. A 70-million-candlepower searchlight was mounted on the starboard wing. The engine nacelles carried JEZEBEL sonobuoys in the rear (16 in early marks, 32 in the S-2E/G). [...] Early Trackers also carried 60 explosive charges, dispensed ventrally {{from the rear of}} the fuselage and used for active sonar (JULIE) with the AN/AQA-3 and later AQA-4 detection sets, whereas the introduction of active sonobuoys (pingers) and AN/AQA-7 with the S-2G conversion saw these removed. Smoke dispensers were mounted on the port ventral surface of the nacelles in groups of three each.|$|E
