40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two simple {{mathematical}} models to describe human behavior {{in reaction to}} deadlines. When a real commitment (e. g. money) is involved, {{as in the case}} of a payment deadline, the expected reaction is to postpone it as close as possible to the deadline to minimize the risk of loosing the value. For low risk commitments this tendency is still present but expected to be looser. In order to test these predictions in a quantitative way, we performed data analysis for the total number of <b>registrations</b> and <b>fee</b> <b>payments</b> vs. time for the recent scientific conference "Statphys 23 ", comparing it with the data of another conference in order to recover universal features. Two related models respectively for registrations (weak engagement) and <b>fee</b> <b>payment</b> (strong engagement) are then introduced which are able to explain in a simple way both behaviors, and which show an excellent agreement with real data...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the item}} is {{pre-paid}} with the normal postage rate {{and an additional}} charge known as a <b>registration</b> <b>fee.</b> Upon <b>payment</b> of this <b>fee</b> the sender is given a receipt, and (usually) a unique numbered registration label is affixed to the letter. As the letter travels from post office to post office and through any sorting office, {{it has to be}} signed for on a ledger. This process is completed when the letter is delivered and the receiver signs for the item. With computerization and barcode technology, much of the logging once done manually has become simpler and leads to greater options for the sender and receiver alike to access the status of their shipment via the internet. Many postal authorities provide tracing information for registered items on their website.|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> for same-sex {{unions and}} the number of registered gay couples in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. In contrast to the other 15 German states, in Baden-Württemberg each administrative district decides independently about the level of <b>registration</b> <b>fees.</b> Consequently, there is not only considerable variation of the number of registered gay couples across the individual administrative units, but also among the <b>registration</b> <b>fees,</b> which we seek to explain by relying on theories of public administration, policy analysis and political economy. Our findings show that the varying levels of <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> for same-sex unions are primarily determined by the preferences of parties in the regional legislative committees. In this way, we can demonstrate that the definition of <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> is politicised, which contradicts the legal principles of equivalency and cost recovery...|$|R

This finding of no difference survives scrutiny for several possible confounds. Thus, professional ethicists seem no less likely to free ride in this context than do philosophers not specializing in ethics.

If <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> can be levied, moral hazard can be overcome. The <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> determines the participation threshold of sellers and extracts them, whereas (lower) transaction fees provide incentives for good behavior.
