The system is also {{designed to prevent}} overfilling or manual override of the fueling system. David Juleff of Shaw Development, LLC [...] was the design engineer that tailored an aerospace non-pressurized <b>refuel</b> <b>system</b> to be first introduced on the Caterpillar D11 track type tractor in 1998. A number of non pressure fueling systems are available in OEM and retrofit applications from FloMeg, Shaw Delelopment, Hydrau-Flo®, FastFillSystems http://fastfillsytems.com and others ...|$|E

Most large earthmoving and mining vehicles with diesel fuel tanks over 150 gal {{are equipped with}} fast <b>refueling</b> <b>systems.</b> Fast <b>refueling</b> <b>systems</b> utilize an automatic shut off fuel nozzle, receiver and level control device. Fast <b>refuel</b> <b>systems</b> operate by connection of a fill nozzle to the vehicle's fuel tank and a source mounted pump delivers fuel into the tank at rates up to 150 gal per minute.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{a finite}} element model of an {{in-flight}} aircraft <b>refueling</b> <b>system</b> is developed. The model is a first attempt to describe the dynamics of a probe-and-drogue <b>refueling</b> <b>system</b> commonly used by Navy aircraft. The purpose of this work {{is to develop a}} model of the drogue system to be able to study control and sensor system requirements for an autonomous <b>refueling</b> <b>system.</b> This work is intended as a first introduction to an automated in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>system</b> with special concentration on the modeling of a probe-and-drogue in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>system</b> for aircrafts. An understanding of what is an in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>system</b> and its significance and influence to the advancement of a aircraft is first presented. The main character of the system, such as mass, stiffness, damping effect is found from visual observation of an actual drogue system. While changing these parameters, the responses with different outside forces added on the system, such as impulse response, step response can be controlled. If the modeling response is stable, it is possible to simulate the simplified real outside force, such as exponential increases force used to simulate wind interaction effects in the model predicting the overall system response...|$|R

50|$|Non-{{pressure}} <b>refuel</b> <b>systems</b> operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a shut-off valve. When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized <b>refueling</b> <b>systems</b> do not require tank pressurization for automatic nozzle shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R
