5|$|At {{the funeral}} of the tenor Adolphe Nourrit in Paris in 1839, Chopin made a rare {{appearance}} at the organ, playing a transcription of Franz Schubert's lied Die Gestirne (D. 444). On 26 July 1840 Chopin and Sand were present at the dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> Berlioz's Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale, composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution. Chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition.|$|E
5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of The Tempest to the UK. It was staged as a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> a Noh drama, with a {{traditional}} Noh theatre {{at the back of}} the stage, but also using elements which were at odds with Noh conventions. In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E
5|$|Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium {{hotel bar}} twice, on 1 November (when the {{poisoning}} took place), and earlier, on 16 October. Trails left by Lugovoy and Kovtun started on 16 October, {{in the same}} sushi bar where Litvinenko was poisoned later, but at a different table. It was assumed that their first meeting with Litvinenko was either a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> the future poisoning, or an unsuccessful attempt at the poisoning.|$|E
30|$|<b>Rehearsals</b> {{were part}} <b>of</b> the {{original}} TLP model. However, the model included <b>rehearsals</b> <b>of</b> VBDs, not facilitation of the math tasks. Because the curriculum was so new to these TLs, {{as was the}} approach of teaching with tasks, we added <b>rehearsals</b> <b>of</b> “Doing the Math” in both TLP 1 – 1 and TLP 2 – 1.|$|R

5|$|Enormous crowds {{could be}} {{accommodated}} at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks attracted {{an audience of}} 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many {{of the best known}} musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.|$|E
5|$|Ravel {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> The Rite of Spring. Stravinsky later said that Ravel {{was the only person}} who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

25|$|Oudrid was {{particularly}} prolific {{also as a}} bandmaster during the 1850s and early 1860s, having conducted the orchestra at Teatro Real, where renowned tenors such as Roberto Stagno (1840–1897) and Enrico Tamberlik (1820–1889) premiered, {{as well as the}} orchestra of Teatro de la Zarzuela.

This was his final public appearance.|$|E

The play moves {{beyond the scope}} of what the reader sees in Hamlet; {{characters}} resembling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of English courtiers, foreshadowing their true fate. Rosencrantz does not quite make the connection, but Guildenstern is frightened into a verbal attack on the Tragedians' inability to capture the real essence of death. The stage becomes dark.|$|E
25|$|Mutual aid {{is often}} erroneously {{understood}} as simply {{the exchange of}} support. Mutual aid is better conceptualized as multidimensional with at least 10 types of processes or activities that occur amongst and between members, including: sharing data, the dialectic process, discussion of taboo topics, the {{all in the same}} boat phenomenon, developing a universal perspective, mutual support, mutual demand (including confrontation), <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> new skills, individual problem solving, and the strengths in numbers phenomenon (Gitterman, 2004; Shulman, 2006; Steinberg, 2004).|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the first}} {{operations}} to recapture Burma took place in Arakan. To gain bases for the aircraft necessary to supply Fourteenth Army in its attack {{through the heart of}} the country, two offshore islands, Akyab and Ramree, had to be captured. Akyab was virtually undefended when British forces came ashore, so it effectively provided a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> amphibious assault doctrine for the forces in theatre. However, Ramree was defended by several thousand Japanese. The clearing of the island took several days, and associated forces on the mainland longer to clear out. Following these actions, XV Corps was greatly reduced in numbers to free up transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army.|$|E

25|$|Moss {{performed}} the shots featuring Trinity {{at the beginning}} of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1950s, {{department}} store heiress and {{wife of the}} publisher of the Los Angeles Times, Dorothy Buffum Chandler became the de facto leader of the orchestra's board of directors. Besides leading efforts to create a performing arts center for the city that would serve as the Philharmonic's new home, and would eventually lead to the Los Angeles Music Center, she and others wanted a more prominent conductor to lead the orchestra; after Wallenstein's departure, Chandler led efforts to hire then Concertgebouw Orchestra principal conductor, Eduard van Beinum as the LAPO music director. The Philharmonic's musicians, management and audience all loved Beinum, but in 1959, he suffered a massive heart attack while on the podium during a <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> the Concertgebouw Orchestra and died.|$|E
25|$|From September to December 2008, she {{appeared}} as Mrs Johnstone in the long-running UK tour of Willy Russell's musical Blood Brothers, succeeding Linda Nolan who left due to illness. The {{producer of the}} show, Bill Kenwright {{had been trying to}} persuade Webb to play the role for around 20 years and she was only free by chance. As Nolan was ill, she had just {{a week and a half}} to rehearse, around half the time normally expected for the <b>rehearsal</b> <b>of</b> such a tour. Birmingham-born Niki Evans was playing the role in the West End at the time, so while the tour visited Birmingham, Webb briefly took over in the London production to allow Evans to play her home city.|$|E
