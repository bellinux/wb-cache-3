50|$|The <b>rusty</b> <b>parrotfish</b> (Scarus ferrugineus) is {{a species}} of fish found on coral reefs in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Persian Gulf. It is {{generally}} common. It measures up to 41 cm in length. While the terminal phase is multicoloured, the initial phase, which frequently is seen in groups, is overall brownish with a yellow tail.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} shows that small non-territorial terminal-phase males of the <b>rusty</b> <b>parrotfish</b> Scarus ferrugineus are reproductively active and are {{comparable}} with initial-phase males in behaviour, rates of participation during group-spawning and success in streaking into pair spawning. Large territorial terminal-phase males defend contiguous territories for several hours during the morning where they pair spawn with initial-phase females...|$|E
40|$|Temporal {{trends in}} {{growth of the}} <b>rusty</b> <b>parrotfish</b> Scarus ferrugineus were studied on a {{southern}} Red Sea fringing reef that experiences seasonal changes in environmental conditions and benthic algal resources. Length increment data from tagging and recapture were compared among periods and sexes and modelled using GROTAG, a von Bertalanffy growth model. The growth pattern of S. ferrugineus was highly seasonal with a maximum occurring between April and June and a minimum between December and March. Body condition followed the seasonal variation in growth, increasing from April to June and decreasing from December to March. The season of maximum growth coincided with high irradiation, temperature increases and peak abundance of the primary food source, the epilithic algal community. There was a decline in growth rate during summer (July to October) associated {{with a combination of}} extreme temperatures and lowered food availability. There were strong sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and life-history traits. Terminal-phase (TP) males achieved larger asymptotic lengths than initial-phase individuals (IP) (L-infinity 34. 55 v. 25. 12 cm) with growth coefficients (K) of 0. 26 and 0. 38. The TPs were growing four times as fast as IPs of similar size. Three individuals changed from IP to TP while at liberty and grew eight times faster than IPs of similar size, suggesting that sex change in S. ferrugineus is accompanied by a surge in growth rate. The SSD in S. ferrugineus thus coincided with fast growth that started during sex change and continued into the TP. Faster growth during sex change suggests that the cost associated with sex change is limited...|$|E
