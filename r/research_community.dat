Janet's minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. At least 1,023deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8million in damages. The name Janet was later retired from the Atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to its significance to the scientific <b>research</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

In this paper, we present preliminary results based on ACA to analyze and visualize <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> {{in the area of}} technology-enhanced learning, focusing on publicly available citation and conference information provided through CiteseerX and DBLP. We describe our approach to collecting, organizing and analyzing appropriate data, as well as the problems which have to be solved in this process. We also provide a thorough interpretation of the TEL research clusters obtained, which provide insights into these <b>research</b> <b>communities.</b> The results are promising, and show the method’s potential as regards mapping and visualizing TEL <b>research</b> <b>communities,</b> making researchers aware of the different <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> relevant for technology enhanced learning, and thus better able to bridge communities wherever needed...|$|R

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the <b>research</b> <b>community.</b> These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E

40|$|Tectonic activities, {{tropical}} climate, {{and vulnerability}} of the societies have frequently caused major disasters in Southeast Asia. In order to better promote activities in disaster relief and restoration in Southeast Asia, <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> should promptly gather and assemble disaster-related as well as area-related information, and provide it through websites on the internet. This approach of the <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> would be efficient and rational if considering the limited time particularly in the relief stage and the relative strength of the <b>research</b> <b>communities.</b> An important point in gathering, assembling, and providing information is to keep close communication/collaboration with both implementing organizations and supporting people for avoiding isolation in the relief and restoration activities. Based on this approach, a webpage was launched in the official website of the Center for Southeast Asia Studies, Kyoto University on 9 th of May 2008, {{to respond to the}} disaster caused by Cyclone Nargis which was landed on the Ayeyarwady Delta area of Myanmar on 2 nd through 3 rd of May 2008. Contents of the webpage presumably covered at the time most of the primary information of Cyclone Nargis and its disaster, including information both of the scientific analysis of Cyclone Nargis and of the physical environment of the Ayeyarwady Delta; however, an issue remained in describing socio-economic, political background of the area which should be particularly useful for activities by organizations with the lack of familiarity with the area. Providing the area description well-organized and useful for activities in disaster relief and restoration is a rational, significant task for the <b>research</b> <b>communities,</b> by recognizing that they have long accumulated information and knowledge of the area. Another issue uncovered was that networking between <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> and implementing agencies is necessary. Through the network, not only local latest information is timely conveyed from the implementing agencies to the <b>research</b> <b>communities,</b> but also information useful for activities in disaster relief and restoration is effectively provided from the <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> to the implementing agencies. Launching and managing a website of a disaster may require a substantial workload, but the <b>research</b> <b>communities</b> would be able to contribute to the society through providing information useful for activities in disaster relief and restoration. Importantly, opportunities of providing such information could bring valuable feedbacks for research...|$|R
