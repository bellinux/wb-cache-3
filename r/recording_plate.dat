A specularly reflecting (or shiny) surface reflects the light in only one direction at each point on its surface, so in general, most of the light will not be incident on the recording medium.

Photonic crystal {{template}} can be fabricated by holographic lithography in photoresist. A {{method for}} enhancing {{the quality of}} holographic photonic crystal template is mentioned in this paper. Because light energy is absorbed by photoresist while propagating through the material, the exposure decreases with {{the depth of the}} photoresist layer. In order to compensate for the light energy losing in exposure process, the <b>recording</b> <b>plate</b> is flipped to let the interference beams incident on the side of glass substrate instead of the surface of the material. During the development, the etching is proceeding quickly into {{the lower part of the}} material while the structure on the surface is maintained. Experimentally, face centered cubic lattice structures were fabricated in the AZ- 4620 positive photoresist using an Ar+ laser with wavelength of 458 nm.

The aim was {{of this study was}} to assess whether forced myocardin expression in iPSC-MSCs could further enhance their transdifferentiation to cardiomyocytes and improve their electrophysiological properties for cardiac regeneration. Myocardin was overexpressed in iPSC-MSCs using viral vectors (adenovirus or lentivirus). The expression of smooth muscle cell and cardiomyocyte markers, and ion channel genes was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence staining and patch clamp.

Overexpression of myocardin in iPSC-MSC enhanced the expression of SCN 9 A and CACNA 1 C, but reduced that of KCa 3. 1 and Kir 2. 2 in iPSC-MSCs. Moreover, BKCa, IKir, ICl, Ito and INa.

40|$|Interferometry {{has always}} been a {{powerful}} tool to diagnose the response of liquids, when changes of status parameters (e. g. temperature or concentration) induce modifications in their optical properties. Interferometric measurements are based on the ability to measure variations, around a reference configuration, in the optical path length or the refractive index. Investigations done so far on heat convection driven by capillary forces, indicate that the observation of both the bulk phase and of the free surface, is instrumental for the understanding of the physical mechanisms steering the heat transfer phenomena in 'weightless liquids'. When used in space application, conventional interferometers suffer of some fundamental drawbacks, because of the severe requirements in terms of mechanical stability of the optical elements. Holographic interferometry removes the most stringent limitations of classical interferometry, but requires precise positioning of the <b>recording</b> <b>plate,</b> with accuracy better than half a wavelength. The superior feature of an Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometer (ESPI) is that it enables real time correlation fringes to be recorded by a video camera and displayed on a television monitor, without recourse to any form of photographic processing or plate relocation. This comparative ease of operation allows the technique of ESPI to be extended to considerably more complex problems of deformation analysis and measurement of refractive index modulation. Since it basically works as a time differential interferometer, measurements can always be referred to a well known configuration and condition of the test sample, reducing or even eliminating the requirements on mechanical stability. This paper describes how double-path ESPI are accommodated within the optical diagnostics of a microgravity payload, Fluid Physics Facility (FluidPac), due for launch in 1998 on the Russian retrievable capsule FOTON. The two-ESPI layout permits one to observe and quantify the deformation of the free surface of a liquid subjected to a thermal gradient. Motions induced by the convective flows in the bulk phase can be monitored at the same time. The main features of the ESPI are presented together with design outlines and optical performances.

40|$|Functional mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) derived from human induced {{pluripotent}} stem cells (iPSCs) may represent an unlimited cell source with superior therapeutic benefits for tissue regeneration to somatic tissue, such as bone marrow (BM) -derived MSC. In {{the first part of this}} project, I investigated whether the differential expression of ion channels in iPSC-MSCs was responsible for their higher proliferation capacity than that of BM-MSCs. The expression of ion channels for K+, Na+, Ca 2 + and Cl- currents was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The functional role of these ion channels were then verified by patch clamp experiments to compare the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-MSCs versus BM-MSCs. I detected significant mRNA expression of ion channel genes including KCa 1. 1, KCa 3. 1, KCNH 1, Kir 2. 1, SCN 9 A, CACNA 1 C and Clcn 3 in both human iPSC-MSCs and BM-MSCs; while Kir 2. 2 and Kir 2. 3 were only observed in human iPSC-MSCs. Furthermore, I identified five types of currents (BKCa, IKDR, IKir, IKCa and ICl) in iPSC-MSCs, while only four of them (BKCa, IKDR, IKir and IKCa) were observed in BM-MSCs. The rate of cell proliferation was 1. 4 fold faster in iPSC-MSCs as compared to BM-MSCs. Interestingly, the proliferation rate of human iPSCMSCs was significantly reduced when inhibiting IKDR with shRNA and hEAG 1 channel blockers, 4 -AP and astemizole. Though to a lesser extent, the proliferation rate of human BM-MSCs also decreased by IKDR blockage. These results demonstrated that hEAG 1 channel plays a crucial role in controlling the proliferation rate of human iPSC-MSCs but to a lesser extent in BM-MSCs. Next, I examined whether forced expression of a transcription factor- myocardin in iPSC-MSC using viral vectors (adenovirus or lentivirus) can further enhance their trans-differentiation to cardiomyocytes and improve their electrophysiological properties for cardiac regeneration. My results on RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining revealed that myocardin induced the expression of several cardiac and smooth muscle cell markers, including α-MHC, cTnT, GATA 4, α-actinin, and cardiac MHC, smooth muscle cell markers MYH 11, calponin, and SM α-actin, but not the more mature cardiac markers such as β-MHC and MLC 2 v in iPSC-MSCs. These findings indicate that forced expression of myocardin in iPSC-MSC resulted in partial trans-differentiation into cardiomyocytes phenotype. Furthermore, I also discovered that myocardin altered the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-MSCs when examined by RT-PCR and patch clamp experiments. Forced expression of myocardin in iPSC-MSC enhanced the expression of Kv 4. 3, SCN 9 A and CACNA 1 C, but reduced that of KCa 3. 1 and Kir 2. 2 in iPSC-MSCs. Moreover, BKCa, IKir, ICl, Ito and INa. TTX were detected in iPSC-MSC with ectopic expression of myocardin; while only BKCa, IKir, ICl, IKDR and IKCa were noted in iPSC-MSC transfected with green florescence protein. Furthermore, as measured by multi-electrode arrays <b>recording</b> <b>plate,</b> the conduction velocity of the neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes cocultured iPSC-MSC monolayer was significantly increased after ectopic expression of myocardin. Taken together, I have demonstrated that hEAG 1 channel is important in the regulation of iPSC-MSC proliferation and forced expression of myocardin in iPSC-MSC resulted in their partial transdifferentiation into cardiomyocytes phenotype and improved the electrical conduction during integration with mature cardiomyocytes. published_or_final_versionMedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
