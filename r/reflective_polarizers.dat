40|$|The optical {{performance}} of the <b>reflective</b> <b>polarizer</b> was investigated over three kinds of direct-lit backlights and/or different configurations of the optical sheets. The optical gain factor achieved by using the <b>reflective</b> <b>polarizer</b> increased as the diffuse nature of the optical sheet was enhanced, because of the more efficient polarization conversion. In addition, the gain factor decreased substan-tially in flat-lamp backlights compared to tubular-lamp backlights, which was ascribed to the high loss factor during the polarization recycling process due to the complex structure and large area of flat lamps. All these results suggested that reducing the loss factor of the backlight {{is very important for}} efficient polarization conversion and thus high optical gain of the <b>reflective</b> <b>polarizer...</b>|$|R

50|$|For a non-ELP {{backlight}} {{to produce}} even lighting, which {{is critical for}} displays, the light is first passed through a lightguide - a specially designed layer of plastic that diffuses the light {{through a series of}} unevenly spaced bumps. The density of bumps increases further away from the light source according to a diffusion equation. The diffused light then travels to either side of the diffuser; the front faces the actual LCD panel, the back has a reflector to guide otherwise wasted light back toward the LCD panel. The reflector is sometimes made of aluminum foil, a simple white-pigmented surface, or, as in the 3M Vikuiti ESR, hundreds of polymer layers alternating between a low and high refractive index. Between the lightguide and the LCD panel is usually placed a <b>reflective</b> <b>polarizer</b> film which vastly increases efficiency by repeatedly reflecting any unpolarized light back, which would otherwise be absorbed by the LCD's rear polarizer.|$|R

30|$|Plasmonic metasurfaces have {{attracted}} much attention in recent years owing to many promising prospects of applications such as polarization switching, local electric field enhancement (FE), near-perfect absorption, sensing, slow-light devices, and nanoantennas. However, many problems in these applications, like only gigahertz switching speeds of electro-optical switches, low-quality factor (Q) of plasmonic resonances, and relatively low figure of merit (FOM) of sensing, severely limit the further development of plasmonic metasurface. Besides, working as nanoantennas, it is also challenging to realize both local electric FE exceeding 100 and near-perfect absorption above 99 %. Here, using finite element method and finite difference time domain methods respectively, we firstly report a novel optically tunable plasmonic metasurface based on the hybridization of in-plane near-field coupling and out-of-plane near-field coupling, which provides a good solution to these serious and urgent problems. A physical phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency is obtained by the destructive interference between two plasmon modes. At the same time, ultrasharp perfect absorption peaks with ultra-high Q-factor (221.43) is achieved around 1550  nm, {{which can lead to}} an ultra-high FOM (214.29) in sensing application. Particularly, by using indium-doped CdO, this metasurface is also firstly demonstrated to be a femtosecond optical <b>reflective</b> <b>polarizer</b> in near-infrared region, possessing an ultra-high polarization extinction ratio. Meanwhile, operating as nanoantennas, this metasurface achieves simultaneously strong local electric FE(|Eloc|/|E 0 |[*]>[*] 100) and a near-perfect absorption above 99.9 % for the first time, which will benefit a wide range of applications including photocatalytic water splitting and surface-enhanced infrared absorption.|$|R
40|$|We propose ultra-broadband <b>reflective</b> and {{absorptive}} <b>polarizers</b> in {{the visible}} range using multi-scaled Ag nano wire-slit arrays. The nano arrays can be tuned from reflective to absorptive by incorporating Ag wires/strips with different lengths/widths.

The Ag nano wire-slit arrays are realized experimentally by using a simple two-times shadowing vapor deposition method. They exhibit broadband transmission difference, in good agreement with simulations. The multi-scaled Ag nano wire-slit array has potential applications as broadband linear polarizers and anti-reflective materials in both optics and photovoltaics. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite {{more than}} ten years of R&D in antiferroelectric liquid crystal {{displays}} (AFLCDs), this very promising technology has not yet reached the market. The main reason for this is the bad dark state due to light leakage from imperfections of the LC alignment and from the pretransitional effect. We have found that both problems are eliminated by using AFLC materials with substantially 45 ° tilt angle in the surface stabilized AFLC geometry. The performance of conventional AFLCDs will be considerably enhanced with this kind of material, and furthermore, 45 ° AFLCs have a unique potential for both <b>reflective</b> mode and <b>polarizer</b> free displays. In the surface-stabilized antiferroelectric liquid crystal (SSAFLC) geometry the smectic layers of a SmCa * liquid crystal are perpendicular to the cell glass plates and the helical superstructure, intrinsic of a bulk sample, is suppressed by surface action. Ideally this leaves us with a structure where the long axes of the molecules tilt away + and –θ from the smectic layer normal in adjacent layers (anticlinic order) and the director n is everywhere confined to the plane of the cell, cf. Fig 1. x...|$|R
40|$|Chiral nematic liquid {{crystals}} (CLCs) can spontaneously arrange into helical structures with periodicities of a {{few hundred}} nanometers with a certain pitch (P) and corresponding periodic refractive index profile. As such they exhibit a reflection band for a certain wavelength interval ∆λ (= ∆nP) with P and ∆n the birefringence. Since the photonic band gap (PBG) can be controlled by external stimuli (electricity, heat, light, elasticity), CLCs are potentially interesting in order to enable new applications: photonic information technology, lab-on-a-chip devices and switchable optical devices such as biosensors, reflectors, <b>polarizers,</b> <b>reflective</b> displays and tunable lasers. [1] In this work, a wavelength shift of the photonic band gap of 141 nm is obtained by electrical switching of a partially polymerized chiral liquid crystal with response times of 50 µs and 20 µs for switching on and off. The method features high stability and reflectivity in the photonic band gap without any noticeable degradation or disruption. The device consists of a mixture of photo-polymerizable liquid crystal, non-reactive nematic liquid crystal and a chiral dopant that has been polymerized with UV light. The influence of the amplitude and the frequency of the applied voltage on the width and the depth of the reflection band are investigated. By selecting the appropriate chiral dopant concentration, it is possible to make devices for different operation wavelengths. Compared to previously reported work, we have drastically improved the contrast and the switching speed of the device and the tuning range of the photonic bandgap...|$|R
40|$|Optical cavities, which {{generally}} consist of an optically transparent medium with wavelength-scale thickness, {{have been widely}} used in various areas ranging from lasers and modulators to sensors and filters. A trivial optical absorption in the cavity allows incident light to constructively interfere with reflected light many times without serious loss, thus being able to create a resonance at a certain wavelength. However, a traditional optical cavity has faced challenges in achieving an angle-insensitive property, thereby dramatically limiting their applications {{in a wide variety of}} fields. In this dissertation, we present several demonstrations, all based on optical nanocavities featuring strong resonance behaviors in highly absorbing media with the ultra-thin cavity thickness (< 30 nm) as compared to the wavelength of incident light, which is distinctly different from the conventional optical cavity systems. We firstly demonstrate angle invariant (up to 70 °) transmissive and reflective structural color filters with high-color-purity exploiting a concept described above. We also present a new photovoltaic (PV) scheme incorporating novel optical design (ultra-thin cavity) and electrical design (dopant-free amorphous silicon) to create colored semitransparent PV cells, which could be harmoniously integrated with interiors and exteriors of the buildings, such as facades, windows, ceilings, and walls. This enables large surfaces of architectures to be efficiently utilized to generate the electric power. ~ 3 (2) % of power conversion efficiency with desired reflective (transmissive) colors that are insensitive to the angle of incidence and the polarization state of incident light is achieved. To improve the power conversion efficiency of the colored PV cells, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a spectrum splitting method and microcavity-integrated PV scheme, both of which show ~ 4 % of power conversion efficiency. Lastly, we describe how our strategy could be applied to other applications, such as perovskite PV cells, broadband visible absorbers, and low <b>reflective</b> wire grid <b>polarizers.</b> The presented approach could open door to numerous applications, such as energy-efficient ultra-thin colored display technologies and decorative building-integrated PV...|$|R
