5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, <b>restricted</b> distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is <b>restricted</b> to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is <b>restricted</b> to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is <b>restricted</b> to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is <b>restricted</b> to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is <b>restricted</b> to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E

40|$|Stress {{is often}} {{associated}} with binge eating. A critical component of the control of stress is the central norepinephrine system. We investigated how dietary-induced binge eating alters central norepinephrine and related behaviors. Young male Sprague Dawley rats received calorie deprivation (24 h) and /or intermittent sweetened fat (vegetable shortening with sucrose; 30 min) twice a week for 10 weeks. The groups were <b>Restrict</b> Binge (calorie deprivation/sweetened fat), Binge (sweetened fat), <b>Restrict</b> (calorie deprivation), and Naive (no calorie deprivation/no sweetened fat). Dietary-induced binge eating was demonstrated by <b>Restrict</b> Binge and Binge, which showed an escalation in 30 -min intake over time. Feeding suppression following nisoxetine (3 mg/kg; IP), a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, was not evident in <b>Restrict</b> Binge (<b>Restrict</b> Binge: 107 ± 13, Binge: 52 ± 9, Restrict: 80 ± 8, Naive: 59 ± 13 % of saline injection at 1 h). In subsequent experiments with <b>Restrict</b> Binge and Naive, <b>Restrict</b> Binge had reduced corticosterone (<b>Restrict</b> Binge: 266 ± 25; Naive: 494 ± 36 ng/ml) and less feeding suppression (<b>Restrict</b> Binge: 81 ± 12, Naive: 50 ± 11 % of non-restraint intake at 30 min) following restraint stress (1 h). Dietary-induced binge eating in <b>Restrict</b> Binge was not altered by a dorsal noradrenergic bundle lesion caused by N-(2 -chloroethyl) -N-ethyl- 2 -bromobenzylamine (DSP 4), but frontal cortex norepinephrine was positively correlated with the average 30 -min intake post-lesion (0. 69; p< 0. 01). In a separate set of animals, single-unit in vivo electrophysiological recording of locus coeruleus-norepinephrine neural activity demonstrated reduced sensory-evoked response {{as a consequence of the}} <b>Restrict</b> Binge schedule (<b>Restrict</b> Binge: 8. 1 ± 0. 67, Naive: 11. 9 ± 1. 09 Hz). These results, which suggest that a consequence of dietary-induced binge eating is to attenuate the responsiveness of the brain norepinephrine system, will further our understanding of how highly palatable foods dampen the stress neuraxis...|$|R

Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, <b>restricted</b> prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.

In addition, upset induced by teasing, depressive symptoms, BMI and negative attributional style demonstrated indirect effects on weight <b>restricting</b> behaviour through their effects on body dissatisfaction and/or weight preoccupation.

40|$|Restriction of Pseudomonas {{bacteriophage}} CB 3 {{growth on}} some Pseudomonas aeruginosa hosts was studied. On <b>restricting</b> hosts, growth of this phage was severely inhibited below 32 C and hence was temperature-sensitive. Investigation {{of this phenomenon}} revealed that <b>restricting</b> hosts were not killed {{as a consequence of}} their infection under nonpermissive conditions. The ability of some hosts to <b>restrict</b> showed segregation in sexual crosses between <b>restricting</b> and nonrestricting hosts. However, the pattern of restriction among various hosts differed with the phage in question when other phages were compared with CB 3. Temperature-shift experiments indicated that blockage of an early event in the phage lytic cycle occurred when <b>restricting</b> conditions were imposed on cells infected with CB 3. This blockage could be eliminated by holding at permissive conditions until the cold-sensitive step was bypassed or by pulsing <b>restricting</b> cells for 5 min at 37 C...|$|R

40|$|The ISO C {{standard}} C 99 {{has added}} a special keyword, named <b>restrict</b> to allow the programmer to specify non-aliasing {{as an aid to}} the compiler’s optimizer and to thereby possibly improve performance. However, it is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that the annotations are correct. Therefore, in practice, <b>restrict</b> will be useful only when the programmer’s effort is rewarded with noticeable performance improvement. To assess the performance potential of the <b>restrict</b> annotation, we automatically generated best-case <b>restrict</b> annotations for SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks by using pointer profiling. However, even though we used the best possible <b>restrict</b> annotations, we found an average program speedup of less than 1 % on average when using two state-of-the art optimizing compilers that implement the <b>restrict</b> pragma. Since the typical performance benefits do not warrant significant user effort and potential errors, we conclude that having the programmer specify non-aliasing is a bad idea...|$|R
