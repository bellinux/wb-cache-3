5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. {{the epitome}} of <b>rap</b> <b>music</b> in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead. But he has also said that BDP's approach reflected {{a feeling that the}} early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and {{out of touch with the}} streets.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and Van Halen. It was {{a major influence on}} house music, which grew out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, <b>rap</b> <b>music,</b> and jazz.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by indie {{rock bands}} and house music, Graduation marked a {{departure}} {{away from the}} ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases toward a more anthemic style of <b>rap</b> <b>music</b> that would function well while he was performing in large arenas. Toward this end, West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling from a wider spectrum of music genres. Lyrically, the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of Graduation towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West's previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).|$|E
5|$|The RKO General radio lineup {{included}} {{some of the}} highest rated, most influential popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, KHJ (AM) in Los Angeles introduced the Boss Radio variation of the top 40 format. The restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country. RKO's FM station in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters, including WOR and WXLO ("99X"); in 1983, as WRKS ("98.7 Kiss FM"), it {{became one of the first}} major stations to regularly program <b>rap</b> <b>music.</b> In 1979, RKO General created the RKO Radio Network, reportedly the first broadcasting web linked via satellite.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, {{largely due to}} the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that <b>rap</b> <b>music</b> did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E
