This paper studies the ef-fect of relationship of the size <b>range</b> and aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>range</b> on the inversion of spheroid particle size distribution by the dependent mode algorithm. The T ma-trix method and the geometric optics approximation method are used to calculate the extinction efficiency of the spheroids with different size range and aspect ra-tio range, and the inversion of spheroid particle size distribution in these differ-ent ranges is conducted. Numerical simulation indicates that a fairly reasonable representation of the spheroid particle size distribution can be obtained when the size <b>range</b> and aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>range</b> are suitably chosen.

50|$|A key {{application}} of dodging and burning {{is to improve}} contrast (tonal reproduction) in film print-making; today this is better known as tone mapping in digital photography - see high dynamic range imaging. The technical issue is that natural scenes have higher dynamic <b>range</b> (<b>ratio</b> of light to dark) than can be captured by film, {{which in turn is}} greater than can be reproduced in prints. Compressing this high dynamic range into a print either requires uniformly decreasing contrast (making tones closer together) or carefully printing different parts of an image differently so that each retains the maximum contrast - in this latter dodging and burning is a key tool.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{detection}} method of an overload application during stress cycles under constant amplitude was investigated. Also, {{the effect of a}} tensile overload was shown at three stress ratios: R = 0, - 1. 5, {{in order to understand the}} effects of R on crack propagation after an overload. At a baseline of R = 0, after an overload retardation in the crack propagation was observed. However, in the case of R = - 1. 5, the fatigue crack growth rate actually accelerated after a tensile overload. That behavior of crack propagation was tried to be detected by the information of strain waveform h; h = ε_y + 1. 2 λε_x, where, ε_y and ε_x are the local strains at the specimen axis, and λ is the strain <b>range</b> <b>ratio</b> Δε_y/Δε_x. The waveform shape of h was changed after the overloading. Also, the application of an overload can be detected by the variation of the strain <b>range</b> <b>ratio</b> λ.
