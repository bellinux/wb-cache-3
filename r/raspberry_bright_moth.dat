6000|$|But I 'm {{relapsing}} into metaphysics, [...] That labyrinth, whose clue is of {{the same}} [...] Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics, [...] Those <b>bright</b> <b>moths</b> fluttering round a dying flame; [...] And this reflection brings me to plain physics, [...] And to the beauties of a foreign dame, [...] Compared with those of our pure pearls of price, [...] Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.|$|R

60|$|After tea, Paulina's quick {{needle and}} pretty golden thimble were busily plied by the lamp-light, but her tongue rested, {{and her eyes}} seemed {{reluctant}} to raise often their lids, so smooth and so full-fringed. Graham, too, must have been tired with his day's work: he listened dutifully to his elders and betters, said very little himself, and followed with his eye the gilded glance of Paulina's thimble; {{as if it had}} been some <b>bright</b> <b>moth</b> on the wing, or the golden head of some darting little yellow serpent.|$|R
50|$|Eupseudosoma is a genus of arctiine tussock moths in the Erebidae family. The {{best known}} and most {{widespread}} species is Eupseudosoma involutum, the snowy eupseudosoma, a <b>bright</b> white <b>moth</b> which is found {{from the southern}} United States {{right down to the}} south of South America. There are a few other species found across the Americas.|$|R
50|$|Eochroa trimenii {{is a small}} (wingspan of 65 mm), <b>bright</b> pink <b>moth</b> {{with yellow}} borders and large eyespots on its wings. Males have disproportionately large antennae. Larvae are cream with {{irregular}} black stripes and short black spines and feed on various species of Melianthus. Adults appear in atutumn. They inhabit arid rocky areas and mountain passes in Africa where the host plant grows. It is the only species in the genus Eochroa.|$|R
50|$|Papaipema cerina, {{the golden}} borer <b>moth,</b> is a <b>bright</b> yellow <b>moth</b> {{of the family}} Noctuidae.Adults are on the wing from September through mid-October {{and can be found}} in patches {{throughout}} the Great Lakes region of North America. It has been recorded from Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Maine, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Ontario.Their habitats include wetlands such as emergent marsh, southern wet meadow, wet prairie, wet-mesic sand prairie, prairie fen, southern hardwood swamp, mesic southern forest and dry-mesic southern forest.|$|R
2500|$|In 1758, Carol Linnaeus first {{characterized}} {{two species}} of the genus Phalaena. Phalaena ornatrix was {{used to describe the}} paler moth specimens, and Utetheisa bella, described the <b>bright</b> pink <b>moth</b> specimens. In 1819, Hübner moved these species to a new genus, Utetheisa. [...] For nearly a century, it was difficult to determine this moth’s evolutionary history as researchers focused on external similarities (color, shape, patterns, size), rather than determining features specific to the species. This led to great confusion when trying to categorize the different subspecies. In 1960, Forbes combined both species, Utetheisa ornatrix and Utetheisa bella, into the species now known as Utetheisa ornatrix. His conclusion was also supported by Pease Jr. who, in 1966, used genetic testing and determined that any phenotypic differences were based on interspecific variation due to geographic differences (rather than intraspecific variation).|$|R
40|$|The {{hummingbird hawkmoth}} Macroglossum stellatarum {{is one of}} Europe’s most {{delightful}} insects. Active almost exclusively in <b>bright</b> daylight, this <b>moth</b> {{is not only a}} fast and aerobatic flier but also an excellent hoverer, sucking nectar from flowers {{in much the same way}} as its namesake the hummingbird. Its visual behaviour has been the subject of study since the early part of this century (Knoll, 1922), more recently with regard to visual stabilisation of flight (Kern, 1994, 1998; Kern and Varju, 1994, 1998; Farina et al., 1995) ...|$|R
50|$|When Annabel offers Mama {{the remains}} of her child, Mama {{transforms}} into her human form and sobs at the baby's death. However, when Lilly (remembering only Mama as her original parent, since she was abandoned in the woods {{for most of her}} life) calls out for her, Mama reverts to her monstrous form and takes the girls again, nearly killing Annabel and Lucas, but refraining mainly because Victoria cares about them and does not want them hurt. Annabel clings to Victoria, who asks to stay with Annabel instead of leaving with Mama, which Mama accepts. After a tearful farewell, Mama and Lilly fall off the cliff, turning into a shower of moths when they hit the branch. Mama and Lilly are shown as spirits happy to be united while embracing and smiling. Annabel and Lucas embrace Victoria, and Victoria notices a <b>bright</b> blue <b>moth</b> landing on her hand, indicating that Lilly is still with her in some form.|$|R
5000|$|Over 75% {{of males}} {{have a black}} facial [...] "mask", {{comprising}} a black forehead, cheeks, lores and higher parts of the throat. Occasionally males have a white mask. The mask {{is surrounded by a}} variable band of yellow, rusty, pink or purple. White masks are sometimes bordered by black. This colouring may only reach the lower throat or extend along the belly, {{with the rest of the}} underparts light brown or whitish with some dark stripes. The upperparts have light and dark brown longitudinal stripes, particularly at midlength, and is paler on the rump. The tail and upper wing are dark brown. The flight feathers are edged greenish or yellow. The eye has a narrow naked red ring and a brown iris. The legs are orangey in colour. The bill is <b>bright</b> <b>raspberry</b> red. Outside the breeding season, the male lacks bright colours; it has a grey-brown head with dark streaks, whitish chin and throat, and a faint light stripe above the eyes. At this time, the bill becomes pink or dull red and the legs turn flesh-coloured.|$|R
