Because the link of new buildings with existing buildings is lost. To get back that lost link should understand the existing buildings, elements and concepts. "The new arises from the old". Creative design has to flourish from existing. So that, they become stable and absorbed {{in the evolution of}} architecture. Creativity happens in the thinking process. With the use of the available materials in contemporary designs to be use in able to achieve creative design'. In this task, reuse is playing a major role. Reuse has become a trend in contemporary architecture. It has a wider sphere in the field of architecture. It varies within a large range from <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> old discarded building element to <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> whole building; <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> the idea of attractive element in modern materials to <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> planning concepts. <b>Reuse</b> in the sense briefly has two ideologies.

Until the direct reuse and indirect reuse belongs to same origin, it is necessary to understand the link between them. Are they interdependence or independence, what is the most important in architecture. Until there i s no such attention focus in the field of study, more attention will be towards indirect reuse.

40|$|This paper investigates {{macroeconomic}} {{determinants of}} the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia for the period 1999 to 2009. The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The positive effect of GDP on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged.

In this sense, the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is one <b>of</b> the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime. Two decade of economic reforms and free trade opened several opportunities that reflected in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> performance <b>of</b> the country. This paper attempts to evaluate the trends of India’s Balance <b>of</b> <b>Payments</b> and identify its emerging challenges. The discussion is broadly classified into four parts viz. i) India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> picture since 1991, ii) emerging role of invisibles and software services in balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> iii) unhealthy trends in FDI and iv) the vulnerability and challenges ahead. ...|$|R

This study focus on selected 10 Asian countries of various income levels and test the factor of political stability and economic freedom in stability <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> by using a simple econometric model with various techniques. Our empirical finding shows that political stability is more important than economic freedom in stabilizing balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Stable political regime with visionary leadership leads the nations to higher level of favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Political stability is playing major role than theoretical explanation to achieve surplus <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> hence exchange rare stability.
