40|$|Greatest axial {{dimensions}} (GALD) of phytoplankton cells, {{colonies and}} filaments etc, {{are used to}} describe the size structure of whole assemblages of species in the shallow eutrophic Loch Leven (S. E. Scotland). Two-weekly samples over the period 1979 – 1982 have been analysed to determine whether variation in size spectra show seasonal trends. Size frequency distributions are displayed using — {{for the first time in}} studies of phytoplankton assemblages — the graphical method based on <b>rankits.</b> The paper describes how individuals to be measured were chosen without bias towards any particular type. Seasonal variation in temperature and nutrient concentrations are discussed in relation to algal size structure. In spite of irregular shifts in species composition and abundance, phytoplankton assemblage size spectra (PASS) exhibit seasonal patterns. Early in the year, when temperatures are low and herbivorous zooplankton sparse, small algae (15 µm) predominate. The winter-early spring assemblages often exhibit a normal size frequency distribution. Later in the year larger algae occasionally become relatively more numerous, and skewed or polymodal frequency distributions are recorded. Increases in large algae are usually associated with Daphnia population maxima; the inter-relationship is clearly demonstrated in time-series plots of GALD isopleths and Daphnia numbers. The potential of the PASS method to further knowledge on ecological controls of phytoplankton is discussed. The investigator is compelled to include all species in a sample. The rankit-dimension graphs retain all the data, so the position of each algal measurement and its influence on the size distribution can be observed. This approach may help to identify size ranges of algae removed by a wide variety of grazing zooplankton. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide an {{empirical}} comparison of rank-based normalization methods for standardized test scores. A series of Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare the Blom, Tukey, Van der Waerden and <b>Rankit</b> approximations in terms of achieving the T score’s specified mean and standard deviation and unit normal skewness and kurtosis. All four normalization methods were accurate on the mean but were variably inaccurate on the standard deviation. Overall, deviation from the target moments was pronounced for the even moments but slight for the odd moments. <b>Rankit</b> emerged as the most accurate method among all sample sizes and distributions, thus it should be the default selection for score normalization in the social and behavioral sciences. However, small samples and skewed distributions degrade the performance of all methods, and practitioners should take these conditions into account when making decisions based on standardized test scores...|$|E

Outliers were detected based on the following: i) residual analyses using standardized residuals, studentised residuals, jackknife residuals and predicted residuals; ii) residuals plots such as the graph of predicted residuals, the Williams graph, and the <b>Rankit</b> Q-Q plot; and iii) scalar measures of influence statistics such as cook’s Di (measures {{the change in the}} estimates that results from deleting each observation), DFFITSi (measures the change in the predicted value of the dependent variable when the current case is omitted from the calculations), DFBETASj(i) (measures the influ-ence on regression coefficients), Atkinson measures, and the Covariance ratio (measure of model performance).

30|$|A {{standard}} 2 -way {{analysis of}} variance (ANOVA) design was applied to pre-treatment vegetation and fuel data, with thin and burn as factors (although treatment had not yet occurred). Treatment effects (pre-treatment minus post-treatment) were analyzed using different techniques for vegetation and fuel characteristics. Those vegetation variables where slightly different methods were employed in the pre- and post-treatment vegetation sampling (herb biomass, shrub biomass, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and basal area) were analyzed with a 2 -way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the pre-treatment value used as the covariate. Differences in canopy cover and all fuel characteristics were analyzed using a 2 -way ANOVA. All analyses met normality assumptions as analyzed by <b>rankit</b> plots of standardized residuals. Although ANOVA is relatively robust against heterogeneity of variance, it was analyzed for each variable by comparing the standardized residuals with fitted values, and where needed, a transformation to natural logarithm or square root was attempted. For pre-treatment variables, herb biomass, 1 -hr timelag, and 1000 +-hr rotten were identified as needing a transformation, but transformations did not help. For differences due to treatment, herb biomass, canopy base height, and forest floor biomass were identified as needing a transformation, and transformations were not useful in correcting the problem. The results for those variables, if significant, should be interpreted cautiously.|$|E
40|$|Winner {{selection}} by majority, in {{an election}} between two candidates, is the only rule compatible with democratic principles. Instead, when the candidates are three or more and the voters rank candidates in order of preference, there are no univocal criteria for {{the selection of the}} winning (consensus) ranking and the outcome is known to depend sensibly on the adopted rule. Building upon XVIII century Condorcet theory, whose idea was to maximize total voter satisfaction, we propose here the addition of a new basic principle (dimension) to guide the selection: satisfaction should be distributed among voters as equally as possible. With this new criterion we identify an optimal set of rankings. They range from the Condorcet solution to the one which is the most egalitarian with respect to the voters. We show that highly egalitarian rankings have the important property to be more stable with respect to fluctuations and that classical consensus rankings (Copeland, Tideman, Schulze) often turn out to be non optimal. The new dimension we have introduced provides, when used together with that of Condorcet, a clear classification of all the possible rankings. By increasing awareness in selecting a consensus ranking our method may lead to social choices which are more egalitarian compared to those achieved by presently available voting systems.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the ways}} of {{building}} and developing a better cooperative relationship between parents of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and professional staff is the inclusion of parents in support groups for parents and staff in support groups for staff. Goal: To examine the correlation {{of the level of}} cooperative relationship between the parents of people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and professional staff with the inclusion of parents in support groups for parents and staff in support groups for staff. Methodology: Respondents: parents (296) of people with severe and profound learning disabilities and staff (298) in five centres across Slovenia; Methods: descriptive statistics, test of homogeneity, the <b>rankit</b> method, one-way analysis of variance; Procedures: survey questionnaires for parents and staff. The data was processed using SPSS software for personal computers. Results: The difference between the variances of the groups (parent) found is statistically significant (F = 6. 16; p = 0. 01). Staff included in support groups have a significantly lower level of cooperative relationship with parents (f= 10; M = - 0. 12) than staff not included in these groups (f = 191; M = 0. 04). Conclusion:In contrast to theoretical findings the results indicated less successful cooperation for professional staff included in support groups. The results furthermore did not confirm any differences in the cooperative relationship of parents included in support groups and those who are not. We suggest an in-depth analysis of the workings of support groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensions}} of individuals of many phytoplankton species vary considerably during the population cycle and during long-term succession, {{as well as}} at any one point in time. Moreover, the type of size-frequency distribution also fluctuates by being, for example, normal on one occasion and variously departing from this condition on another. As a consequence, parametric and many non-parametric methods are of limited value in the statistical analysis of size data. In this paper the graphical method of Sokal and Rohlf (1969), based on rankits, has been used to assess size spectra of algal plankton. Brief consideration is given to the effects of sample preservation on algal size, the need for a random choice of individuals to be measured, and the size of measuring unit to employ. Proformas are described which enable the microscopist without computer facilities to record measurements in a manner facilitating easy tabulation with rankits in readiness for graphing. Seasonal information on size-frequency distributions for a number of algae are illustrated with rankit-dimension plots. A distinction is drawn in these results between what are usually normally, or near-normally distributed values, and those showing marked departures from the normal distribution. The tendency to follow one or other of these 2 main types of distribution appears to be largely a function of the range of values (ratio of maximum to minimum value) in the sample, with the wider-ranging populations generally departing the most from the normal. The orientation of the measured axis with respect to the plane of cell division may also affect the form of the plots, and results must be interpreted with especial care where the mono-specificity of the samples is in doubt. Some experimental results are described in order to illustrate some uses of the <b>rankit</b> graph method in investigating environmental controls of size. These results indicate also the potential ability that dense swarms of zooplankton (Daphnia and Cyclops) have for altering the length spectra of Oscillatoria and Melosira threads. ...|$|E
