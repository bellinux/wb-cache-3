The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operates daily services from Bengaluru and mysuru to Kumbakonam. On March 1, 1972, the Cholan Roadways Corporation was established by the Government of Tamil Nadu with its headquarters in Kumbakonam in order to improve transportation facilities in the districts of central Tamil Nadu. The organisation acquired the fleets of buses earlier owned by private operators – Sri Ramavilas Service, Raman and Raman Limited and Sathi Vilas. On July 1, 1997, the organization was renamed Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Kumbakonam and presently forms division no. 1 of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation. The corporation runs a reconditioning unit and a tyre <b>re-threading</b> unit in Kumbakonam. Kumbakonam is connected by rail with most important towns and cities in South India. The Mysuru- Mayiladuthurai Express connects Kumbakonam with Mysuru and Bengaluru. There are regular express trains that connect Kumbakonam with major cities in the state like Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchirapalli. There are passenger trains that connect Kumbakonam with Thanjavur, Tiruchirapalli, Chidambaram and Mayiladuthurai.|$|E

The Straight Eight format, using pre-prepared 8mm wide film, had some popularity in Europe, where Agfa manufactured their own stock. Kodak eventually introduced a magazine-loading system, but it was never as popular as spooled 8mm film and was discontinued by the early 1980s. Some manufacturers (e.g. Pentacon in East Germany) made cameras with special magazines that could be pre-loaded with 8 mm spools.

40|$|This paper subsumes the mysticism of Chinese law by {{distinguishing}} it {{from other}} bodies of law, while also rendering it transcendental {{in the contemporary}} universal legal context. It is also an attempt to romanticize Chinese constitutional law, as afertile ground {{that can be used}} to <b>re-thread</b> the fabric of Eritrean constitutional order. The root of this research is nournished by an extravagance of ideas and desires, which if applied can make the ubiquity and plasticity of the rule of law flow across what is perceived to be “unyielding” borders. Eritrea has just turned twenty-five and despite a tangled post-independence period, the country has been successful in articulating and advancing the vision of the pre-independence generation. Today, Eritrea envisages rejuvenating its governance with a new constitution that not only talks to post-independence Eritreans, but also triggers sustainable development with substantive emphasis on the rule of law. Eritrean endeavours can easily open up to the seductive appeal of the rich conceptual enigma of Chinese constitutional polity, China being one of the countries with the oldest legal traditions in the world. It is axiomatic that Chinese constitution-centred governance, which is well adorned with Chinese characteristics, is pre-eminent, for it has influenced China since 1949 to aptly rise as the world’s second largest economy. This paper illustrates that Eritrean constitutional polity can be examined through a Chinese lens, to be calibrated in such a way as to exhibit Eritrean characteristics, and still govern by the rule of law...|$|R
50|$|Maneuver:Ambesh {{maneuver}} {{not only}} prevents misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the IJV but also provides instant diagnosis of misplaced catheter. Following successful puncture of subclavian vein with a cannula/needle, {{same side of}} IJV is compressed externally by placing a sterile finger in supraclavicular fossa. The guidewire is threaded through the cannula into the subclavian vein keeping the compression on. If the operator notices resistance while inserting the guidewire, it means the guidewire is going north into the IJV. The guidewire is removed gently and <b>re-threaded</b> maintaining the pressure in the supraclavicular fossa. After successful insertion of the guidewire, pressure in fossa is released and the subclavian vein catheter is railroaded over the guidewire up to the desired length. The guidewire is removed and the catheter is now connected to the transducer and the monitor. The CVP waveform pattern {{as well as its}} value is noted. The ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa is compressed again and any change in CVP value and/or its waveform pattern is noted. If the waveform pattern is lost (becomes straight line) and or CVP value increased by more than 2 cm H2O then it is surely a misplaced subclavian vein catheter into the same side IJV. If no change occurs then this catheter is fine and can be used for CVP monitoring and drug administration. The Ambesh maneuver is quite simple, handy, inexpensive, and instant bedside technique that prevents and diagnoses misplacement of subclavian vein catheter into the IJV The maneuver is now routinely used and recommended by others to avoid the most common misplacement of subclavian vein catheter.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Māori cosmological stories, ceremonies, {{and traditional}} practices regarding menstruation in pre-colonial Māori society. I use kaupapa Māori and mana wahine as a theoretical and methodological framework, contextualising these stories within Māori cultural paradigms. This {{is important because}} menstruation has been framed within deeply misogynist, colonial ideologies in some ethnographic accounts, distorting menstrual rites and practices beyond recognition. These interpretations {{have been used to}} inform colonialist narratives of female inferiority in traditional Māori society, attempting to change Native constructs of womanhood. Such narratives have been perpetuated in contemporary literature, reinforcing powerful discourses of menstrual pollution and female inferiority. This thesis is a challenge to such representations. By examining menstrual stories located in Māori cosmologies, and investigating tribal histories, oral literatures, ceremonies and rites, I argue that menstruation was seen as a medium of whakapapa (genealogy) that connected Māori women to our pantheon of atua (supernatural beings). A study of ancient menstrual rites, recorded in tribal songs and chants, reveal that menstrual blood was used for psychic and spiritual protection. These examples unveil striking Indigenous constructs of womanhood that transform colonialist interpretations and radically challenge notions of female inferiority and menstrual pollution. I maintain in this thesis that presenting menstruation and menstrual blood as putrid is a politically motivated act of colonial violence that specifically targets the source of our continuity as Indigenous People, the whare tangata (house of humanity – womb of women). I pose the question ‘if menstrual blood symbolises whakapapa, {{what does it mean to}} present it as ‘unclean’ and how do such representations cut across the politics of tino rangatiratanga (autonomy) ?’ Through in-depth semi-structured interviews, kōrero (dialogue), and wānanga (series of conversations) with Māori women, including cultural experts, scholars, artists, and mana wahine exponents, I gather a collection of ceremonies, stories, and wisdoms that reclaim Māori spiritualities which celebrate menstruation as divine. Within the context of a colonial history of marginalisation, this work is an activist site of political resistance which takes a step towards <b>re-threading</b> the feminine strands in the spiritual fabric of our world, torn asunder by the ideological imposition of a colonial, Christian male god. I argue, that menstruation is a potent site of decolonisation, cultural reclamation, and resistance toward the perpetuation of colonial hegemony...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In this postgenomic era, {{the ability}} to {{identify}} protein–protein interactions on a genomic scale {{is very important to}} assist in the assignment of physiological function. Because of the increasing number of solved structures involving protein com-plexes, the time is ripe to extend threading to the prediction of quaternary structure. In this spirit, a multimeric threading approach has been devel-oped. The approach is comprised of two phases. In the first phase, traditional threading on a single chain is applied to generate a set of potential struc-tures for the query sequences. In particular, we use our recently developed threading algorithm, PROS-PECTOR. Then, for those proteins whose template structures are part of a known complex, we <b>re-thread</b> on both partners in the complex and now include a protein–protein interfacial energy. To perform this analysis, a database of multimeric protein structures has been constructed, the neces-sary interfacial pairwise potentials have been de-rived, and a set of empirical indicators to identify true multimers based on the threading Z-score and the magnitude of the interfacial energy have been established. The algorithm has been tested on a benchmark set comprised of 40 homodimers, 15 heterodimers, and 69 monomers that were scanned against a protein library of 2478 structures that comprise a representative set of structures in the Protein Data Bank. Of these, the method correctly recognized and assigned 36 homodimers, 15 het-erodimers, and 65 monomers. This protocol was applied to identify partners and assign quaternary structures of proteins found in the yeast database of interacting proteins. Our multimeric threading algo-rithm correctly predicts 144 interacting proteins, compared to the 56 (26) cases assigned by PSI-BLAST using a (less) permissive E-value of 1 (0. 01). Next, all possible pairs of yeast proteins have been examined. Predictions (n 2865) of protein–protein interactions are made; 1138 of these 2865 interac-tions have counterparts in the Database of Interact...|$|R
