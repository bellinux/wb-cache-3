50|$|Assigned to Division 2 of Mine Squadron 2 of the Atlantic Fleet, Swan {{completed}} {{final acceptance}} trials {{in the spring}} of 1920 and began routine operations out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in late June. These operations included buoy work and wreck salvage, and the latter duty is what brought the minesweeper into Cape Cod Bay in November of that year. On 28 November, during <b>an</b> attempt to <b>refloat</b> <b>a</b> <b>wrecked</b> oil barge, heavy seas came up quickly and cast Swan on the beach in Cape Cod Bay. The sudden disaster stranded the minesweeper on the beach and mountainous seas threatened to wreck the stricken ship. Rapid response by the Gurnet Beach Coast Guard crew saved the day, however, and the Coast Guards' heroic efforts brought all fifty-six sailors to safety through breeches buoy and surfboat.|$|R
