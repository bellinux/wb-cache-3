The null hypothesis of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Quantitative structure–activity {{relationships}} (QSARs) {{and quantitative}} structure–property relationships (QSPRs) rely on <b>regression</b> <b>equations</b> containing numerical descriptors of molecular structure. In constructing these models, highly correlated descriptors are sometimes {{excluded from the}} <b>regression</b> <b>equations.</b> Although this exclusion seems reasonable, in fact it can lead investigators to overlook significant descriptor combinations, because the small differences between highly correlated descriptors sometimes encode important structural information. Furthermore, the multicollinearity that results from employing correlated descriptors is not as serious a problem as is often assumed. Described are several examples of cases in which pairs of highly correlated, poorly performing single-parameter descriptors yield highly significant structure–property <b>regression</b> <b>equations.</b> In effect, the descriptors act synergistically and yield <b>regression</b> <b>equations</b> that model the systems examined better {{than the sum of}} the individual components.

This increase in concentration will cause an underestimation of soil respiration rate due to the additional CO2 being stored within the soil.|$|E

This measure is asymptotically distributed to be bounded below by χ 21 for usual ranges of critical region, and does not require any distributional assumption. The rational expectation hypothesis is more clearly rejected using the distance covariance metric. There is thus preliminary evidence that distributional and linearity mis-specification of the rationality hypothesis in the term structure could potentially biased toward non-rejection of an otherwise generally unsustainable hypothesis...|$|R
