40|$|We {{construct}} a three-country model that incorporates international relocation by imperfectly competitive firms and examine both {{the effects of}} each country's profit tax reduction on the consumption and welfare of all countries, and the incentive for the countries to decrease the profit tax. In such a model, both the terms of trade and international <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> offer {{the key to understanding}} the impacts of one country's profit tax policy. In particular, we note that the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> from the other two countries is positively related to the wage incomes of the third country through a shift in labour demand, and the terms-of-trade improvement is not only positively related to the wage incomes, but also negatively related to profit incomes through a shift in world consumption demand. We show that (i) in a three-country world economy, regardless of the reduction's source, the profit tax reduction of each country leads to <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> away from foreign countries toward its own economy and deteriorates the terms of trade of its economy and (ii) this becomes a 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policy {{in the sense that it}} lowers the welfare of the other foreign countries.

40|$|The {{last three}} decades have {{witnessed}} a spectacular integration of the world economy. On the one hand, {{the impact of the}} globalization on the economies is related to the activity <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> operating on a "multi-national" scale. These firms acquire subsidiaries abroad, move part of their production processes to reach new markets or to benefit from the international division of labor. In addition, trade and investment liberalization between Eastern European countries and the European Union leads to a <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> production activities within the enlarged area. This thesis carries out a thorough empirical analysis of the determinants of multinational activities in Eastern European countries. The analysis of these determinants is important since the stock of the European FDI in the transition countries of Eastern Europe has strongly increased during the nineties. It reaches 83 % of the total stock of FDI in Czech Republic, and more than 50 % of total stock of FDI in Romania. There are at least three reasons why the progressive integration of Eastern European countries into the European Union leads to a <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> activities within the enlarged area. First, the removal of internal trade barriers allows multinational firms to rationalize and concentrate production in the low-cost locations of the enlarged area. Second, integration may induce foreign firms that previously exported to the European Union to locate there to take advantage of scale economies and reach internal markets. Third, the removal of internal tariffs barriers should increase competition between firms and lead to a <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> multinational activities. These factors, which are taken from the new trade theories, are analyzed in this doctoral thesis. The aim is to study the spatial and industrial distribution of FDI in the new European Unions' members...|$|R

The ?new economic geography? world assumes mobile entrepreneurs which can relocate thus bringing agglomeration forces into play. The most significant difference between this world and the traditional one is that, at high levels of trade integration, where one country has emerged as the core and the other as the periphery, the core may have more generous social policies and higher wages than the periphery without inducing a <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> The scope to have higher wage is constrained, however, and related to the level of trade integration in a bell-shaped way...|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} {{the level of}} trade costs and the {{intensity}} of competition interact to explain the nature and intensity of trade within a given industry and the location of firms across countries. As trade costs decrease from very high to very low values, the global economy moves from autarky to two-way trade, through one-way trade from the larger to the smaller region. By exploring the intensive and extensive margins of exports, we investigate how the intensity of trade reacts to the degree of competitiveness. Furthermore, when firms are free to change location, they flow from the small to the large country, and the larger country is always a net exported on the manufactured good. Firms located in the big country have a bigger size than those located in the small one. Under one-way trade, the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> changes their attitude toward export...|$|E

Overall, employment is less concentrated in 1999 than it was in 1975. At the same time, the spatial sectoral concentration has little changed. Each industry would become concentrated in a specific part of the region, which would explain both the sectoral concentration and the overall decentralisation.

40|$|Countries {{invest in}} {{international}} infrastructure {{in an effort}} to attract firms. Acquiring the position of a hub would make this effort successful. We use a model of international trade with monopolistic competition, increasing returns to scale and transport costs to analyse policy competition through infrastructure investment. For a small or backward country the strategic effect of attracting firms is less important than for large or advanced countries. A country that acquires a hub-position sees its welfare improve. The other countries may gain or lose; they benefit from cheaper international trade, but suffer from the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> In the case of line infrastructure the spoke countries will invest to eradicate the hub position, whereas in the case of point infrastructure they will not. Policy competition is more likely to deliver too much infrastructure investment when transport costs are low and the strategic effect is more important.
