25|$|Before 1916, six Indian schools {{operated}} in three counties: two in Leake, three in Neshoba, {{and one in}} Newton. The names of those schools were: Tubby Rock Indian School, Calcutta Indian School, Revenue Indian school, <b>Red</b> <b>Water</b> Indian School, and Gum Springs Indian School. The Newton Indian school's name is not known. The agency established new schools in the following Indian communities: Bogue Chitto, Bogue Homo, Conehatta, Pearl River, <b>Red</b> <b>Water,</b> Standing Pine, and Tucker. Under segregation, few schools were open to Choctaw children, whom the white southerners classified as non-whites.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} arose during the {{conversion}} was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The United States Coast Guard had final say. Queen Mary was deemed a building, {{since most of}} her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its <b>red</b> <b>water</b> level paint at a slightly higher level than previously. During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Mother India" [...] {{has been}} defined as [...] "a common icon for the {{emergent}} Indian nation in the early 20thcentury in both colonialist and nationalist discourse". Many authors, including Gayatri Chatterjee, author of , interpret the film as an allegory signifying patriotism and the changing situation in the newly independent nation, and how India was functioning without British authority. It echoes the tale of a modern India, liberating itself from [...] "feudal and colonial oppression". The film, an archetypal nationalistic picture, is symbolic in that it demonstrated the euphoria of [...] "Mother India" [...] in a nation that had only been independent for 10years, and it had a long-lasting cultural impact upon the Indian people. Film scholar Saibal Chatterjee considers Mother India a [...] "mirror of independent India", highlighting problems of a nascent nation, including rural exploitation of farmers by money-lenders, in a dramatic fashion understandable to the common viewer. It also represents the agrarian poverty and hardship of the people at the time. The <b>red</b> <b>water</b> that flows from the canal irrigating the green fields {{at the end of the}} film is seen by Chatterjee as a metaphor to represent the blood of Indians in the struggle for independence, flowing to nourish a new free India. The canal is described by Virdi to signal the imminent end of the feudal order. However, despite Radha's struggle against feudal oppression depicted in the film, her action of stopping the rebellious Birju and upholding status quo—the feudal and patriarchal order—is seen as [...] "regressive" [...] by various authors.|$|E

2500|$|In industry, TNT is {{produced}} in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated {{with a mixture of}} sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused. [...] After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. [...] The rinse water from sulphitation is known as <b>red</b> <b>water</b> and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.|$|E
2500|$|They put the set {{so that it}} was {{upside down}} and {{attached}} the camera so that it looked like the room was right side up, then they poured gallons of <b>red</b> <b>water</b> into the room, because the normal film blood would not make the right effect for the geyser. [...] During the filming of this scene, the blood poured in an unexpected way causing the rotating room to spin. [...] Much of the blood spilled out of the bedroom window covering Craven and Langenkamp. The scene where Nancy is attacked by Krueger in her bathtub was accomplished with a special bottomless tub. The tub was put in a bathroom set that was built over a swimming pool. During the underwater sequence Heather Langenkamp was replaced with a stuntwoman. The [...] "melting staircase" [...] as seen in Nancy's dream was Robert Shaye's idea; it was created using pancake mix.|$|E
2500|$|Pathology of F. magna {{infection}} varies {{according to}} host type but some features are shared by all three types. Primary lesions usually occur in the liver and are associated with mechanical damage due to migrating juvenile flukes or fibrous encapsulation of sedentary adult flukes. The most common feature of F. magna infection is black pigmentation in abdominal or thoracic organs, especially in the liver. The hematin pigment is produced by flukes as a byproduct of feeding on blood. Pigment within tissues {{is a result of}} migrating of juvenile flukes and it accumulates within hepatic cells without resorption. F. magna has also been associated with <b>Red</b> <b>Water</b> disease in bovine. F. magna causes liver damage, which allows the bacteria Clostridium haemolyticum to cause secondary infection in hepatic tissue. The infection will decrease the livers function, and the host's urine will become red, hence the name [...] "Red Water" [...] disease.|$|E

"Bring me the schimmel," [...] said Sihamba, {{but there}} was no need, for the brute which loved her now as always, had winded her, and coming to where she lay, put down his head and fondled her with his black lips.

6000|$|Finck's mood, as the November shadows {{gathered}} on him,--the equal heart may at least pity poor Finck! His resolution is fixed: [...] "Cut ourselves through, this night: Dohna is ours: other side that <b>Red</b> <b>Water</b> there are roads;--perish or get through!" [...] And the Generals (who are rallied now [...] "on the Heights of Falkenhain and Bloschwitz," [...] midway between Maxen and Dohna) get that Order from him. And proceed {{to arrange for}} executing it,--though with outlook more and more desperate, as their scouts report that every pass and post on the <b>Red</b> <b>Water</b> is beset by Reichsfolk. [...] "Wunsch, with the Cavalry, he at least may thread his way out, under cloud of night, by the opposite or Daun side," [...] calculates Finck. And Wunsch sets out accordingly: a very questionable, winding, subterranean march; difficult in the extreme,--the wearied SLIPshod horses going at a snail's pace; and, in the difficult passes, needing to be dragged through with bridle and even to be left altogether:--in which, withal, it will prove of no use for Wunsch to succeed! Finck's Generals endeavoring to rank and rearrange through the night, find that their very cartridges are nearly spent, and that of men, such wounding, such deserting has there been, they have, at this time, by precise count, 2,836 rank and file. Evidently desperate.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{not half}} a mile away, they came in sight of the river, which had been hidden from them before by the lie of the ground, and a groan of despair broke from their lips, for it was in flood. Yes, the storms in the {{mountains}} had swollen it, and it rolled towards the sea a red flood of foam-flecked water, well-nigh two hundred yards from bank to bank. Still they rode on, for they dared not stop, and presently behind them they heard a shout of triumph, and knew that their pursuers had also seen the <b>Red</b> <b>Water,</b> and rejoiced because now they had them in a trap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit fast, Swallow," [...] said Sihamba, {{and then}} she cried a word aloud to the horse, and struck it lightly with her hand.

Down sank the horse and his riders till the <b>Red</b> <b>Water</b> closed over their heads, then they rose again and heard the shout of wonder of their enemies, who by now had almost reached the bank. With a yell of rage Black Piet rode his horse at the river, for to do him justice he was a brave man, but do what he might it would not face it, so with the others he sat still and watched.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{the maiden}} from New Hampshire, {{the old lady}} from Chicago, papa, mamma, the woman who chewed gum, {{and all the rest}} of them, gravely bending over a {{washboard}} and soap. Mysterious virtues lay in that queer stream. It turned the linen white as driven snow in five minutes, and then we lay on the grass and laughed with sheer bliss of being alive.

6000|$|... 'A {{horror of}} this great {{darkness}} came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared {{the edge of the}} sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing--against the <b>red</b> <b>water</b> of the sea. It was a round thing, {{the size of a football}} perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about.

6000|$|From Schmorsdorf Finck pushes out a Cavalry {{charge on}} Brentano. [...] "Could we but repulse Brentano yonder," [...] thinks he, [...] "I might have those Four Battalions to hand, and try again!" [...] But Brentano makes such cannonading, the Cavalry swerve to a Hollow on their right; then find {{they have not}} ground, and retire quite fruitless. Finck's Cavalry, and the Cavalry generally, with their horses all sliding on the frosty mountain-gnarls, appear {{to be good for}} little this day. Brentano, victorious over the Cavalry, comes on with such storm, he sweeps through the obtuse angle, home upon Finck; and sweeps him out of Schmorsdorf Village to Schmorsdorf Hill, there to take refuge, as the night sinks,--and to see himself, if his wild heart will permit him to be candid, a ruined man. Of the Three Attacks, Two have {{completely}} succeeded on him; only Wunsch, at Dohna, stands victorious; he has held back the Reich all day, and even chased it home to its posts on the Rothwasser (<b>RED</b> <b>WATER),</b> multitudinous as it was.|$|E
