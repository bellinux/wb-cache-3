A short range highly directional hydrogen bond energy scale, {{as well as a}} <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> scale which accounts for dispersion and orientationally averaged multi-pole attractions. These energy scales are always treated independently. In recent years, extensive first principles quantum mechanics calculations on small water clusters have shown that both hydrogen bond and <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> scales depend on the number of incident hydrogen bonds of the water molecule. In this work we propose a new methodology to couple the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> scale to the degree of hydrogen bonding in the fluid.

40|$|Abstract: We adapt a {{combinatorial}} optimization algorithm, extremal optimization (EO), for the search problem in computational protein design. This algorithm {{takes advantage of}} the knowledge of local energy information and system-atically improves on the residues that have high local energies. Power-law probability distributions are used to select the backbone sites to be improved on and the rotamer choices to be changed to. We compare this method with simulated annealing (SA) and motivate and present an improved method, which we call <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> extremal optimization (REEO). REEO uses <b>reference</b> <b>energies</b> to convert a problem with a structured local-energy profile to one with more random profile, and extremal optimization proves to be extremely efficient for the latter problem. We show in detail the large improvement we have achieved using REEO as compared to simulated annealing and discuss a number of other heuristics we have attempted to date. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

METHODS:This cross-sectional study analyzed the labels of 2, 072 processed foods {{in a supermarket}} of Florianópolis, Santa Caratina, Brazil. The foods were classified according to the Brazilian food labeling legislation. Central tendency and variability values were calculated for the serving sizes and energy values {{reported on}} the labels, {{as well as the}} ratio between the reported and <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> value. The Spearman correlation test was performed between the reference serving size and the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> density, and also between the reference serving size and energy density of each study food. RESULTS:Nutrition labeling and the Food Guide presented reference servings with different sizes and energy values. The serving sizes reported on the labels did not follow either of the references and presented heterogeneous values, with a maximum range of 55 - 240 g among ready and semi-ready pre-prepared dishes. The reported energy values were between 0. 1 times smaller and 2. 4 times larger than the reference values. The reference serving sizes presented a highly inverse correlation with the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> density (Spearman coefficient= 0. 9) and a very low inverse correlation with the energy density of the foods analyzed (Spearman coefficient= 0. 2). CONCLUSION:This study showed the need for standardizing reference serving size information for the Brazilian population as well as reviewing nutrition labeling legislation in order to standardize the serving sizes reported on labels and to update the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> density used to calculate serving sizes...|$|R

What we do know is the difference between two given energies. We resolve this problem by finding a <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> and then finding another energy by examining the data, relative to the <b>reference</b> <b>energy.</b> From the difference between them we can approximate the energy distribution for a given energy, and since we know the energy threshold of the reaction (E_threshold for 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be is about 1880. 4 - 1880. 8 (keV)) we can calibrate the beam energy. We then determine the energy which produce the maximum yield derivative as the reference and record the energy whose neutron yield is 5 % of the <b>reference</b> <b>energy.</b> The data is collected by simulating this reaction using SimLit. Since this is a simulation we know the real energy distribution so we make a linear fit for energy distribution as function of energy difference. We tested the theory on experimental data for which we approximate the energy distribution by other means, and found our new method to be accurate and satisfactory for our needs...|$|R

However, its effectiveness in practice is influenced by many key factors. In this paper the "reference energy function" was firstly established by operating Monte-Carlo simulation to diverse noise types; then, energy function of hydrologic series was compared with the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> function, and four key issues on discrete wavelet decomposition were studied and the methods for solving them were proposed, namely wavelet choice, decomposition level choice, wavelet threshold de-noising and significance testing of DWT, based on which a step-by-step guide to discrete wavelet decomposition of hydrologic series was provided finally. The specific guide is described as: choose appropriate wavelet from the recommended wavelets and according to the statistical characters relations among original series, de-noised series and removed noise; choose proper decomposition levels by analyzing the difference between energy function of the analyzed series and <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> function; then, use the chosen wavelet and decomposition level, estimate threshold according to series' complexity and set the same threshold under each level, and use the mid-thresholding rule to remove noise; finally, conduct significance testing of DWT by comparing energy function of the de-noised series with the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> function. Analyses of both synthetic and observed series indicated the better performance and easier operability of the proposed guide compared with those methods used presently. Following the guide step by step, noise and different deterministic components in hydrologic series can be accurately separated, and uncertainty can also be quantitatively estimated, thus the discrete wavelet decomposition result of series can be improved. 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.
