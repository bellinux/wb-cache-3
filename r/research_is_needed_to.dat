5|$|The {{cause of}} MS is unknown; however, it is {{believed}} to occur {{as a result of}} some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While {{there are a number of}} environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. <b>Research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. Further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at {{the close of the}} 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but further <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fully establish {{the function of the}} luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though more <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a complex}} of similar {{freshwater}} and estuarine Himantura in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that are or were tentatively identified with H. polylepis. The Australian freshwater Himantura were described as a separate species, H. dalyensis, in 2008. The freshwater Himantura in New Guinea are probably H. dalyensis rather than H. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. Trygon fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with H. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of freshwater whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences. Finally, additional <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of H. polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution, so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted.|$|E

25|$|Carbetocin {{compared}} with oxytocin produced {{a reduction in}} women who needed uterine massage and further uterotonic drugs for women having caesarean sections.

30|$|Conclusions Modified VO 2 max {{could be}} a useful tool to {{identify}} septic patients with adequate reanimation.

25|$|There is much {{variation}} among speakers concerning how tone {{is realized}} phonetically.

More <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.|$|E
25|$|Nipple {{stimulation}} and breastfeeding {{triggers the}} release of natural oxytocin in the body, therefore {{it is thought that}} encouraging the baby to suckle soon after birth may reduce the risk of PPH for the mother. A review looking into this did not find enough good research to say whether or not nipple stimulation did reduce PPH. More <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> answer this question.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} treatment of mania or acute psychosis-induced aggression. In this context, benzodiazepines are given either alone, or in combination with other first-line drugs such as lithium, haloperidol or risperidone. The effectiveness of taking benzodiazepines along with antipsychotic drugs is unknown, and more <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine if benzodiazepines are more effective than antipsychotic drugs when urgent sedation is required.|$|E
