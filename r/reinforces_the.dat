5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> {{theme of the}} {{changing}} self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E

Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|The Tenth Amendment <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> {{principles}} {{of separation of}} powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted {{to the federal government}} by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or the people. The amendment provides no new powers or rights to the states, but rather preserves their authority in all matters not specifically granted to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the forest}} habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers wetter gullies and {{riverside}} sword sedge (Lepidosperma effusum). It borders {{the range of}} the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests. The lack of intermediate forms <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> status of all three taxa as separate species.|$|E

5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, master gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer master gunnery sergeants than sergeants major. One of the major {{differences between the two}} E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{related to}} Hugh de Puiset {{the bishop of}} Durham, who {{he went on to}} serve later in life, Blois {{probably}} came from Blois in France. His relationship with Puiset <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of his origins being in Blois, as Puiset was a nephew of King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, both of whom came from Blois. Nothing else is known of Blois' origins. He was titled magister, implying that he attended a university and was well-educated. He taught at the school of Paris for a while, where at one point a townswoman tried to seduce him, resulting in the medieval writer Gerald of Wales later recounting the humorous story of how Blois resisted the lady's advances.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The interior panel of the door and window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between the shutters and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} reflects Bruegel's {{mastery of}} observation. Each figure {{has a different}} eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of globe and removed eyes. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.|$|E
5|$|To {{take another}} example, in his {{screenplay}} for The Signalman Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E

5|$|Research in the {{archives}} of pre-1914 horse breeding operations found at Windhoek, combined with blood typing studies, suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high-quality riding animals, as opposed to work horses. A study released in 2005 <b>reinforces</b> <b>the</b> theory of the Namib Desert Horse descending {{from a combination of}} European-descended breeding stock and escaped military horses. One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near Kubub, leased by Emil Kreplin (previously mayor of Lüderitz) from 1911 to 1919. Photo albums from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse. In addition, in early 1915, during the fighting of World War I, bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub. Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1,700 grazing horses, for the purposes of scattering them. These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from Kreplin's stud farm during the turmoil of the war. Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub.|$|E
