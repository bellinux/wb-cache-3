5|$|The <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> of wave-cut {{platforms}} {{has been}} created by changes in sea level of the Bristol Channel since the Quaternary period. The arrangement of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, including the Black Rock Limestone, illustrates the events of 350 million years ago. The strata have been tilted and compressed during the variscan orogeny.|$|E
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture of boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in sea level have been combined with isostatic rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in sea level in most areas. In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative sea level have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found largely in the Hebrides consists of machair habitat, a low lying dune pasture land formed as the sea level dropped leaving a <b>raised</b> <b>beach.</b> In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E
40|$|In {{studies of}} the {{shoreline}} displacement it has generally been accepted that <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> were formed during the highest positions of water level during transgressions, before the subsequent regressions, at times when the water level remained long enough (300 - 1300 years) in the same relative position. There were, however, also similar times {{for the formation of}} <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> during the relative regressions preceding the transgressions. As a result of this the <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> often occur together in pairs, where the older beach of the regression is lower than that of the younger transgression beach. It follows from this new explanation that the former water level fluctuations in the Baltic Sea were fewer than the numerous <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> at various altitudes would suggest, as there was only one relative transgression for each pair of <b>raised</b> <b>beaches...</b>|$|R

25|$|Rothera Station is the BAS {{logistics}} centre for the Antarctic {{and home to}} well-equipped biological laboratories and facilities {{for a wide range}} of research. The station is situated on a rock and <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> promontory at the southern extremity of Wormald Ice Piedmont, south-eastern Adelaide Island. The station has a 900m (2,950ft) crushed rock runway, with an associated hangar and bulk fuel storage facility, and a wharf for the discharge of cargo from supply ships. There is a transitory summer population of scientists and support staff who reach Rothera either by ship or through use of a de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft flying from the Falkland Islands.|$|E
25|$|Pound's Homage to Sextus Propertius and Hugh Selwyn Mauberley and Eliot's The Waste Land {{marked a}} {{transition}} from the short imagistic poems that were typical of earlier modernist writing towards the writing of longer poems or poem-sequences. A number of long poems were also written during the 1920s, including Mina Loy's 'auto-mythology', Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose and Hugh MacDiarmid's satire on Scottish society, A Drunk Man Looks At The Thistle. MacDiarmid wrote a number of long poems, including On a <b>Raised</b> <b>Beach,</b> Three Hymns to Lenin and In Memoriam James Joyce, in which he incorporated materials from science, linguistics, history and even found poems based on texts from the Times Literary Supplement. David Jones' war poem In Parenthesis was a book-length work that drew {{on the matter of}} Britain to illuminate his experiences in the trenches, and his later epic The Anathemata, itself hewn from a much longer manuscript, is a meditation on empire and resistance, the local and the global, which uses materials from Christian, Roman and Celtic history and mythology.|$|E
50|$|The two <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> (sometimes {{labelled}} {{as the west}} and east <b>raised</b> <b>beaches)</b> at Portland Bill represent the significant changes fluctuations in sea level and climate change during the last Ice Age, and both largely consist of shelly and sandy pebble deposits. The cause of the two fluctuations was twofold: {{the growth of the}} ice, which absorbed large quantities of water, and the weight of the ice in the north that caused the landmass to tilt.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{superficial}} deposit, including <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> and brickearth. These were formed in periods of climate change during the ice ages. The <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> were generally formed during periods of higher sea level, when ice sheets were at a minimum, and the sand and shingle deposits {{can be seen in}} many low cliffs. The brickearth is originally a wind-blown dust deposited under extremely cold, dry conditions but much has been re-deposited by flood water and mixed with flints.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of previously-unmapped <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> on Macquarie Island {{makes it difficult}} to accept earlier interpretations of landform evolution. These <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> occur up to 270 m ASL, and in places previously thought to have been glaciated. The elevation of the beaches and the distribution and shape of many of the island's plateau lakes and structural lineaments would appear to be consistent with a history in which rapid uplift associated with. block-faulting and other tectonic factors played a much more important role in landform evolution than has been recognised in the past...|$|R
500|$|The Pleistocene glaciations {{almost entirely}} covered Scotland in ice, and Arran's highest peaks {{may have been}} nunataks at this time. After the last retreat of the ice {{at the close of}} the Pleistocene epoch sea levels were up to [...] lower than at present and it is likely that circa 14,000 BP the island was {{connected}} to mainland Scotland. Sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting post-glacial coastlines a complex task, but it is evident that the island is ringed by post glacial raised beaches. King's Cave on the south west coast is an example of an emergent landform on such a <b>raised</b> <b>beach.</b> This cave, which is over [...] long and up to [...] high, lies well above the present day sea level. [...] There are tall sea cliffs to the north east including large rock slides under the heights of Torr Reamhar, Torr Meadhonach and at Scriden (An Scriodan) at the far north end of the island.|$|E
2500|$|The last (Eemian) interglacial period, {{which lasted}} for some 30,000 years, is {{sometimes}} termed the [...] "Poppit Interglacial", the name deriving from Poppit Sands. Here {{there is a}} perfectly exposed beach, where it rests upon {{a classic example of}} a <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> platform just above the high-water mark.|$|E
2500|$|The {{water level}} of the lake has often altered dramatically: near Tatvan, Felix Oswald (see Geology of Armenia, 1901) noted a <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> high above the present {{level of the}} lake as well as {{recently}} drowned trees. Investigation by Degens {{and others in the}} early 1980s determined that the highest lake levels ( [...] above the current height) had been during the last ice age, about 18,000 years ago. Approximately 9,500 years ago there was a dramatic drop to more than [...] below the present level. This was followed by an equally-dramatic rise around 6,500 years ago.|$|E
50|$|The high surface {{has been}} eaten into by cliffs {{dropping}} down to 8 metres. These {{have been formed}} during the Quaternary when the sea level was around 8 metres above the current sea level. There are also <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> at 18 and 30 metres above current sea level. During the glacial periods valleys were eroded deeply below the sea levelThese <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> are found at Portelet Bay, Giffard Bay, and Belcroute Bay. Flint is found amongst the pebbles on these beaches, and this is derived from chalk deposits only found underwater.|$|R
50|$|Cumbrae's western {{coastline}} has fine {{examples of}} <b>raised</b> <b>beaches.</b> One {{of these is}} in the area surrounding Bell Bay, where the island's highest waterfall, Horse Falls, plunges over the old sea cliffs.|$|R
50|$|Geologically, {{the island}} is largely formed from {{keratophyre}} though the northwest coast and islet of West Tump are formed from basalt. A couple of NE-SW aligned faults cross the island. <b>Raised</b> <b>beaches</b> are present in places.|$|R
6000|$|And how {{was that}} great lowland swept away? Who can tell? Probably by no violent convulsion. Slow upheavals, slow depressions, there may have been--indeed must have been--as the sunken fir-forests of Brancaster, and the <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> of Hunstanton, on the extreme north- east corner of the Wash, testify to this day. But the main agent of {{destruction}} has been, doubtless, that same ever-gnawing sea-wash which devours still the soft strata of the whole east coast of England, as far as Flamborough Head; and that great scavenger, the tide-wave, which sweeps the fallen rubbish out to sea twice in every twenty-four hours. Wave and tide by sea, rain and river by land; these are God's mighty mills in which He makes the old world new. And as Longfellow says of moral things, so may we of physical:- ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{upon this}} and other unimpeachable grounds that, as I ventured to say some time ago, persons who are duly conversant with even the {{elements}} of natural science decline to take the Noachian deluge seriously; and that, as I also pointed out, candid theologians, who, without special scientific knowledge, have appreciated the weight of scientific arguments, have long since given it up. But, as Goethe has remarked, {{there is nothing more}} terrible than energetic ignorance; [9] and there are, even yet, very energetic people, who are neither candid, nor clear-headed, nor theologians, still less properly instructed in the elements of natural science, who make prodigious efforts to obscure the effect of these plain truths, and to conceal their real surrender of the historical character of Noah's deluge under cover of the smoke of a great discharge of pseudoscientific artillery. They seem to imagine that the proofs which abound {{in all parts of the}} world, of large oscillations of the relative level of land and sea, combined with the probability that, when the sea-level was rising, sudden incursions of the sea like that which broke in over Holland and formed the Zuyder Zee, may have often occurred, can be made to look like evidence that something that, by courtesy, might be called a general Deluge has really taken place. Their discursive energy drags misunderstood truth into their service; and [...] "the glacial epoch" [...] is as sure to crop up among them as King Charles's head in a famous memorial--with about as much appropriateness. The old story of the <b>raised</b> <b>beach</b> on Moel Tryfaen is trotted out; though, even if the facts are as yet rightly interpreted, there is not a shadow of evidence that the change of sea-level in that locality was sudden, or that glacial Welshmen would have known it was taking place. [10] Surely it is difficult to perceive the relevancy of bringing in something that happened in the glacial epoch (if it did happen) to account for the tradition of a flood in the Euphrates valley between 2000 and 3000 B.C. But the date of the Noachian flood is solidly fixed by the sole authority for it; no shuffling of the chronological data will carry it so far back as 3000 B.C.; and the Hebrew epos agrees with the Chaldaean in placing it after the development of a somewhat advanced civilisation. The only authority for the Noachian deluge assures us that, before it visited the earth, Cain had built cities; Jubal had invented harps and organs; while mankind had advanced so far beyond the neolithic, nay even the bronze, stage that Tubal-cain was a worker in iron. Therefore, if the Noachian legend is to be taken for the history of an event which happened in the glacial epoch, we must revise our notions of pleistocene civilisation. On the other hand, if the Pentateuchal story only means something quite different, that happened somewhere else, thousands of years earlier, dressed up, what becomes of its credit as history? I wonder what would be said to a modern historian who asserted that Pekin was burnt down in 1886, and then tried to justify the assertion by adducing evidence of the Great Fire of London in 1666. Yet the attempt to save the credit of the Noachian story by reference to something which is supposed to have happened in the far north, in the glacial epoch, is far more preposterous.|$|E

40|$|During {{the second}} Italian Antarctic Expedition in 1986 / 87 geomorphological and glaciological {{researches}} {{have been carried}} out, mainly concerning Cenozoic glacial deposits, Holocene glacier fluctuations and Holocene <b>raised</b> <b>beaches.</b> Three main glacial drifts have been recognised, the oldest being associated with well developed red paleosol. The youngest drift all along the coastal belt is composed of till with a muddy matrix, locally rich in fragments of Pelecypods and Serpulids deposited by a grounded ice shelf. At Black Ridge a lateral moraine is present marking {{the boundary between the}} youngest and the older drifts, elsewhere identifiable only by weathering evidences. Holocene glacier fluctuations ha ve been recognised, particularly in the local alpine glaciers: On the basis of the relationships between moraines and <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> at least two glacial advances can be inferred in Late Holocene. Near Edmonson Point ice-cored moraines composed of fossiliferous beach sand and gravel testify an advance younger than 2 200 ± 45 yr B;P. Holocene <b>beaches</b> <b>raised</b> up to 30 m are well known at Terra Nova Bay (Inexpressible Island, Gerlache Inlet). More to the North, <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> have been observed along the coast of Wood Bay, up to an elevation of about 7 m. Numerous new samples of organic remaines associated with the <b>raised</b> <b>beaches</b> (penguin guano and bones, Seal bones, Pelecypods, Barnacles and Corals) have been collected. 14 C ages (not corrected) so far obtained range from 5 770 ± 60 yr B.
