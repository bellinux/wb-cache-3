The singer, according to Jay-Z, often complained that the touring lights were not directed towards him and often left during the middle of sets. Another night during the concert, Kelly stayed on his tour bus for two hours before finally coming out to perform an uninspired set. Jay-Z eventually <b>removed</b> <b>R.</b> Kelly halfway through the tour, after a member of Jay-Z's entourage attacked R. Kelly with Mace or pepper spray. On April 25, 2006, it was confirmed that Jay-Z's younger cousin, Tyran (Ty-Ty) Smith confessed in a Manhattan Criminal Court to pepper-spraying R. Kelly and four of his bodyguards at Madison Square Garden in October 2004. Smith had been charged with assault, but was allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct for four days of community service. After the original incident, Jay-Z made Smith an executive of Def Jam Records. Kelly also launched a $75 million lawsuit against Jay-Z for removing him from the tour, which received a countersuit by Jay-Z which was thrown out by the judge.|$|E

30|$|As is well known, many {{infectious}} diseases possess a latent period, such as Hepatitis, HIV, SARS, Ebola, MERS, etc. When a susceptible individual is infected at the beginning, the disease incubates inside the susceptible {{for a period}} of time, then the susceptible becomes an exposed individual before becoming infectious. For such {{infectious diseases}}, the resulting model is SEIR (susceptible S, exposed E, infectious I, <b>removed</b> <b>R)</b> epidemic type. The study on SEIR-type epidemic dynamical models is a very important subject in the mathematical theory of epidemiology, and {{in the last two decades}} there have been a number of researches on modeling, theoretical analysis, and applications. Continuous SEIR-type epidemic models described by the differential equations have been widely studied. Many important and interesting results can be found in [1 – 9] and the references therein.|$|E

In this paper the possibility of optimal controls both over the susceptible and the infected subjects is assumed, taking into account also limitations of resources. A suitable cost index is introduced and via the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle the optimal control strategy is determined and the existence of the optimal solution is assessed. Numerical results are developed analyzing the effects of different control strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{life testing}} {{experiment}} under the setup of progressive Type II censoring we consider a new flexible scheme, {{in which the}} experimenter removes r 1 ∗ (r 1 ∗≤r 1) units from the experiment if the first failure occurs before some predefined time t 1, and removes r 1 units when the first failure occurs after time t 1.  If the second failure occurs before the time t 2,r 2 ∗ surviving items are removed at random, otherwise r 2 surviving units are <b>removed,</b> (<b>r</b> 2 ∗≤r 2), and so on; finally, after the mth failure, all remaining items are removed. Under this setup of the experiment we study the distributions of failure times, which are entitled as flexible progressive Type II censored (FPC) order statistics. The simulation algorithm for generating FPC samples and an illustrative example for a special case of exponential distribution are also presented. Finally, a Monte Carlo study is also conducted for the expected termination time under FCP...|$|E
30|$|There {{are lots}} of people dying because of {{infectious}} diseases every day. From an epidemiological viewpoint, it is important to study the global stability of disease transmission. Mathematical models describing the infectious disease dynamics have played an important role and provided the preventive strategies in a period. The SEIRS epidemic model is an important model. It shows that the total population is divided into four classes: the susceptible S, the exposed E, the infectious I and the <b>removed</b> <b>R.</b> This model has been studied by many authors [1 – 11]; however, many literature works did not consider disease resistance in humans. With the development and progress of society, people begin to understand the importance of health and exercise. In other words, people’s resistance has improved greatly. So, disease resistance has become an indispensable factor in the study of infectious disease models. Nguyen Huu Khanh considered the disease resistance and formulated a mathematical model [3]. In the model, a person in the exposed group or infected group can return to the susceptible group without treatment.|$|E

40|$|Epidemics of bunchy top, {{the most}} {{destructive}} viral disease of abaca and banana in the Philippines, were modeled using STELLA version 9. 1, a modeling software appropriate for systems analysis of biological populations. A previously developed coupled {{model of the}} population dynamics of the insect vector Pentalonia nigronervosa and epidemic progress of the bunchy top disease was improved and modi ed by incorporating the effects of temperature. Both insect vector and bunchy top epidemic submodels followed the H-L-S-R (healthy (H) - latent (L) - infectious (S) – <b>removed</b> (<b>R))</b> epidemic modeling approach where the diseased plants or insect population was partitioned into nonoverlapping compartments or states. The modi ed model satisfactorily simulated P. nigronervosa population dynamics and bunchy top epidemics.

Major resections included extended and regular right hepatectomy, extended left hepatectomy, and segmentectomy.
