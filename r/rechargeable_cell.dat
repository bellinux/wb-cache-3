50|$|Some of {{the early}} solar watches of the 1970s had {{innovative}} and unique designs to accommodate the array of photovoltaic solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Rhythm, Seiko and Citizen). In the 1990s, Citizen started to sell light-powered watches under the Eco-Drive series name. Since their introduction, photovoltaic devices have greatly improved their efficiency and thereby their capacity. Watchmakers have developed their technology such that solar-powered watches are now {{a major part of}} their range of watches. Several other watch manufacturers offer similar watches or are developing such technology. These other watch manufacturers include (amongst others) Junghans, Casio, Seiko, and Orient.Typically, sunlight and artificial light are absorbed by a solar panel behind the crystal. The dial is either on a layer above or actually on the solar panel. This solar panel converts the light into electrical energy to power the watch. The watch will usually store energy in a <b>rechargeable</b> <b>cell</b> to power itself during the night or when covered such as a wearer's clothing (e.g., sleeve). Citizen's watches use lithium-ion batteries to store sufficient energy to power the watch for several months/years without light exposure, by allowing the watch to enter a power-saving or hibernation mode during which the seconds hand stops until the watch is re-exposed to light. Not all have a power-save mode, yet will still hold a charge for typically six months, as with uncomplicated (date only) analog versions made by Citizen.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{there exists}} a very high demand for {{electrochemical}} energy storage devices such as <b>rechargeable</b> <b>cells</b> and super capacitors due to massive increase {{in the use of}} portable electronics. At the moment this demand is mainly supplied by Li based cells. However due to high cost, rapid reactivity and issues in disposal of Li attention has diverted on non Li based cells. Zn has been identified as a good candidate to replace Li. Even though several Zn based <b>rechargeable</b> <b>cells</b> were reported, less work has been carried out on cells with conducting polymer cathode based Zn cells. In this study, performance of Zn <b>rechargeable</b> <b>cells</b> fabricated with conducting polymer Polypyrrole(PPy) doped with a surfactant anion is reported. PPy films were galvanostatically electro polymerized on to stainless steel disc and cells were assembled with a Polyvinylidenefluoride based gel polymer electrolyte having Zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate as the salt. Cells having different cathode thickness were fabricated and they were characterized using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and continuous charge-discharge tests.

The Laplace transform is used to move from time as the independent variable to frequency as the independent variable. To better understand the effect of frequency changes on the cell, a transfer function is constructed. The transfer function is a transcendental function so a Padé approximant is found to better describe the model at the origin. Consider ∂c(r,t) /∂t=D∂ 2 c(r) /∂ 2 r+(2 /r) (∂c(r) /∂r) ...|$|E
