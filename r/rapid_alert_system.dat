40|$|Hazard {{identification}} {{depends on}} the gathering and evaluation of evidence. In this context {{it is important to}} differentiate between approaches based on expert opinion and ¿weight of evidence¿, and evidence-based approaches using predefined methods and criteria. In moving towards an evidence-based approach, clear guidance for decision-making, specific for each class of agent, should be developed. Quality criteria specific for each type of hazard identification tool need to be defined, with levels of quality acceptable for each. General guidelines exist, but they are not sufficient to evaluate evidence quality in a clear and transparent manner. Further specific guidelines are required to evaluate the summed evidence. In developing these guidelines {{it is important to consider}} existing guidance documents. Careful thought should be given to designing studies to produce the evidence needed. A number of evidence-based hazard identification tools were identified. These include in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo (analysing animal or human tissue after treatment) tools. In vitro and in vivo tools themselves include classical and novel methodologies, (e. g., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). Clinical sample data may be used for exposure assessment, metabolomics, and biomarker analysis. These may be representative of patients, the population at large (including susceptible subgroups), workers, or consumers. Market-based information sources include <b>rapid</b> <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> and other ¿hot lines¿, poison centres, occupational health data, epidemiological studies, consumer protection organizations, post-marketing surveillance, and hospital data. For all such tools, the purity profile of the agent in question should also be included in the assessment. Evidence-based guidelines should take into account all of these tools, and should be able to incorporate both retrospective and prospective data, and data from susceptible (sensitive) population subgroups. Evidence-based medicine is a useful template for evidence-based approaches to toxicology, but there are differences between these two branches of science. The evaluation of the differences and commonalities should be part of the process of establishing an evidence-based toxicology. JRC. DDG. I. 3 -In-vitro method...|$|R

40|$|If {{it emerges}} that a food or feed poses risks to human health, {{immediate}} action must be taken. The RASFF (<b>Rapid</b> <b>Alert</b> <b>System</b> for Food and Feed) ensures the speedy passing on {{of information about}} harmful food and feed within the European Union. In accordance with the General Administrative Regulation on the Implementation of the <b>Rapid</b> <b>Alert</b> <b>System</b> Food and Feed 1 (AVV SWS, § 7 para 4, § 7 para 5 and § 8 para 3), the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has made a Catalogue of Criteria available to the federal states {{as the basis for}} notifications within RASFF. These notification criteria help the public agencies responsible for food control to assess whether foods contaminated with pes-ticide residues or with fungal toxins, bacteria or viruses pose a risk to human health. Fur-thermore, the public agencies are given notification criteria for the assessment of feed in which the maximum levels of undesirable substances, which can carry over to the food of animal origin, have been exceeded.

40|$|Cockpit <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> monitor {{potentially}} hazardous situations, {{both inside}} and outside the aircraft. When a hazard is projected to occur, the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> displays <b>alerts</b> and/or command decisions to the pilot. However, pilots have been observed to not conform to <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> commands by delaying their response or by not following the automatic commands exactly. This non-conformance to the automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> can reduce its benefit. Therefore, a need exists to understand the causes and effects of pilot non-conformance in order to develop automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> whose commands the pilots are more likely to follow. These considerations were examined through flight simulator evaluations of the collision avoidance task during closely spaced parallel approaches. This task provided a useful case-study because the effects of non-conformance can be significant, given the time-critical nature of the task. A preliminary evaluation of <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> identified non-conformance in over 40 % of the cases and a corresponding drop in collision avoidance performance. A follow-on experiment found subjects' alerting and maneuver selection criteria were consistent with different strategies than those used by automatic systems, indicating the pilot may potentially disagree with the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> if the pilot attempts to verify automatic alerts and commanded avoidance maneuvers. A final experiment found supporting automatic alerts with the explicit display of its underlying criteria resulted in more consistent subject reactions. In light of these experimental results, a general discussion of pilot non-conformance is provided. Contributing factors in pilot non-conformance include a lack of confidence in the automatic system and mismatches between the <b>alerting</b> <b>system's</b> commands and the pilots' own decisions based on the information available to them.
