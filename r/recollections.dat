40|$|Across three experiments, I {{investigated}} {{the role of}} <b>recollection</b> rejection in rejecting false suggestions using the misinformation paradigm. The use of model-based measurement of <b>recollection</b> rejection was extended to the misinformation paradigm. I manipulated two factors, delay and feedback, that are known to influence the use of <b>recollection</b> rejection. <b>Recollection</b> rejection was used to reject false suggestions in the misinformation paradigm. Manipulating delay time {{did not affect the}} acceptance of misinformation or the use of <b>recollection</b> rejection. Warning participants about false information reduced misinformation acceptance but did not lead to increased rates of <b>recollection</b> rejection. Collectively, these findings suggest an important role for <b>recollection</b> rejection in rejecting misleading suggestions about events...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{recent studies}} have {{investigated}} how the structures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) support <b>recollection</b> and familiarity, which are two processes widely thought to support recognition memory. The behavioral methods {{that are used to}} isolate <b>recollection</b> and familiarity in neuroimaging and lesion studies typically assume that <b>recollection</b> is a categorical process and not a continuous process. A categorical process is one that either occurs or does not occur for a particular test item (yielding high confidence and high accuracy when it does occur), whereas a continuous process is one that comes in degrees (yielding varying degrees of confidence and accuracy). Studies suggesting that the hippocampus selectively supports the <b>recollection</b> process (such as those that use the Remember/Know procedure or rely on Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis) generally depend on the categorical view of <b>recollection,</b> but much recent evidence suggests that <b>recollection</b> is a continuous process. If <b>recollection</b> is a continuous process (i. e., if <b>recollection</b> comes in degrees), then evidence that has been taken to mean that the hippocampus selectively supports <b>recollection</b> is also compatible with the idea that the hippocampus supports both <b>recollection</b> and familiarity. We suggest that an alternative method can be used to effectively investigate <b>recollection</b> and familiarity in the MTL, one that is valid whether <b>recollection</b> is a categorical or a continuous process.

40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the {{underlying}} neural systems that support <b>recollection,</b> exactly how <b>recollection</b> operates remains unclear. One possibility is that <b>recollection</b> reflects the operation of a continuous retrieval process, whereby test cues always elicit some information from memory. Alternatively, <b>recollection</b> may reflect the operation of a thresholded process that allows for retrieval failure, whereby test cues sometimes elicit no information from memory at all. Here we demonstrate that <b>recollection</b> is thresholded by measuring a commonly reported electrophysiological correlate of episodic retrieval – known as the Left Parietal old/new effect. We use a novel source task designed to directly measure the accuracy of retrieval success, finding that the neural correlate of retrieval was sensitive to the precision of responses when <b>recollection</b> succeeded, but was absent when <b>recollection</b> failed. The results clarify the nature of the neural mechanism underlyingepisodic memory, providing novel evidence in support of some-or-none threshold models of <b>recollection...</b>|$|R

40|$|Memory, {{particularly}} {{memory for}} contextual details (i. e., <b>recollection),</b> undergoes significant development from middle childhood to young adulthood. This research examined {{the development of}} <b>recollection</b> utilizing participant’s subjective reports {{as well as their}} objective accuracy for two contextual details (i. e., the color of the item and a semantic judgment made during encoding). The aims of the present studies were to examine age-related differences in subjective and objective <b>recollection,</b> the correspondence between these abilities, and their neural correlates. Participants included 6 - to 8 -year-old children, 12 - to 13 -year-old adolescents, and young adults. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during the encoding (Study 1) and retrieval (Study 2) portions of a memory paradigm. Age-related improvements in objective and subjective <b>recollection</b> were found in both studies. At encoding, ERP indices of <b>recollection</b> were present when <b>recollection</b> was indexed subjectively or by accuracy for the semantic judgment made during encoding. In contrast, ERP responses were not sensitive to <b>recollection</b> when memory for color was used as the measure of <b>recollection.</b> ERP effects associated with <b>recollection</b> a...|$|R

40|$|The neural {{substrates}} {{of recognition}} memory retrieval {{were examined in}} a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study designed to separate activity related to <b>recollection</b> from that related to continuous variations in familiarity. Across a variety of brain regions, the neural signature of <b>recollection</b> was found to be distinct from familiarity, demonstrating that <b>recollection</b> cannot be attributed to familiarity strength. In the prefrontal cortex, an anterior medial region was related to <b>recollection,</b> but lateral regions, including the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, were related to familiarity. Along the lateral parietal cortex, two functionally distinct regions were also observed: a lateral parietal/temporal region related to <b>recollection</b> and a more superior parietal region involved in familiarity. Similarly, in medial parietal regions, the posterior cingulate was related to <b>recollection,</b> whereas the precuneus was related to familiarity. The hippocampus was related to <b>recollection,</b> but also exhibited an inverse relationship to familiarity-driven recognition confidence. The results indicate that <b>recollection</b> and familiarity rely on different networks of brain regions and provide insights into the functional roles of different regions involved in episodic recognition memory...|$|R

40|$|What is {{conscious}} <b>recollection?</b> Is it {{special to}} humans or do animals have this capacity as well? What brain circuitry supports {{the kinds of}} information processing that constitute <b>recollection?</b> This review will outline recent evidence from studies on rodents, monkeys and humans bearing on these questions. This review focuses on a comparative approach that identified features of <b>recollection</b> that can be studied across species, explores these elements of <b>recollection</b> in animals, and examines in animals {{the role of the}} medial temporal areas that are critically involved in conscious <b>recollection</b> in humans. Substantial evidence indicates that animals exhibit all the fundamental features of <b>recollection,</b> that these abilities depend on the hippocampus in animals as well as humans, and that neuronal representations in the hippocampus reflect information processing fundamental to the features of <b>recollection.</b> In addition, the functional circuitry of the hippocampal system is largely conserved across species, and its organization suggests information processing mechanisms that support the features of <b>recollection</b> are common across species. Aristotle (350 BC) contended that “…other animals (as well as man) have memory, but, of all that we are acquainted with, none, we venture to say, except man, shares in the faculty of <b>recollection.</b> ” Here Aristotle distinguishes “memory, ” as an elementary matching of current sensation...|$|R
5000|$|Recognition memory can be {{subdivided}} into two component processes: <b>recollection</b> and familiarity, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "remembering" [...] and [...] "knowing", respectively. <b>Recollection</b> is the retrieval of details associated with the previously experienced event. In contrast, familiarity is the feeling that the event was previously experienced, without <b>recollection.</b> Thus, the fundamental distinction between the two processes is that <b>recollection</b> is a slow, controlled search process, whereas familiarity is a fast, automatic process.|$|R
5000|$|The dual-process signal-detection/high-threshold theory {{tries to}} {{reconcile}} dual-process theory and signal-detection theory into one main theory. This theory states that <b>recollection</b> {{is governed by}} a threshold process, while familiarity is not. <b>Recollection</b> is a high-threshold process (i.e., <b>recollection</b> either occurs or does not occur), whereas familiarity is a continuous variable that is governed by an equal-variance detection model. [...] On a recognition test, item recognition is based on <b>recollection</b> if the target item has exceeded threshold, producing an [...] "old" [...] response. If the target item does not reach threshold, the individual must make an item recognition decision based on familiarity. According to this theory, an individual makes a [...] "remember" [...] response when <b>recollection</b> has occurred. A know response is made when <b>recollection</b> has not occurred, and the individual must decide whether they recognize the target item solely on familiarity.Thus, in this model, the participant is thought to resort to familiarity as a backup process whenever <b>recollection</b> fails to occur.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{established}} that fluency {{can contribute to}} recognition memory. Previous {{studies have found that}} enhanced fluency increases familiarity, but not <b>recollection.</b> The present study was motivated by a previous finding that conceptual priming affected <b>recollection.</b> We used event-related potentials to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of these effects with conceptually related two-character Chinese words. We found that previous conceptual priming effects on conceptual fluency only increased the incidence of <b>recollection</b> responses. We also found that enhanced conceptual fluency was associated with N 400 attenuation, which was also correlated with the behavioral indicator of <b>recollection.</b> These results suggest that the N 400 effect might be related to the impact of conceptual fluency on <b>recollection</b> recognition. These study findings provide further evidence for the relationship between fluency and <b>recollection...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} variations at encoding and retrieval on <b>recollection.</b> We argue that <b>recollection</b> {{is more likely to}} be affected by the processing that information undergoes at encoding than at retrieval. To date, manipulations shown to affect <b>recollection</b> were typically carried out at encoding. Therefore, an open question is whether these same manipulations would also affect <b>recollection</b> when carried out at retrieval, or whether there is an inherent connection between their effects on <b>recollection</b> and the encoding stage. We therefore manipulated, at either encoding or retrieval, fluency of processing (Experiment 1) -typically found not to affect recollection-and the amount of attentional resources available for processing (Experiments 2 and 3) -typically reported to affect <b>recollection.</b> We found that regardless of the type of manipulation, <b>recollection</b> was affected more by manipulations carried out at encoding and was essentially unaffected when these manipulations were carried out at retrieval. These findings suggest an inherent dependency between recollection-based retrieval and the encoding stage. It seems that because <b>recollection</b> is a contextual-based retrieval process, it is determined by the processing information undergoes at encoding-at the time when context is bound with the items-but not at retrieval-when context is only recovered...|$|R
40|$|Voluntary control {{processes}} can {{be recruited}} to facilitate <b>recollection</b> {{in situations where}} a retrieval cue fails to automatically bring to mind a desired episodic memory. We investigated whether voluntary control processes can also stop <b>recollection</b> of unwanted memories that {{would otherwise have been}} automatically recollected. Participants were trained on cue–associate word-pairs, then repeatedly presented with the cue and asked to either recollect or avoid recollecting the associate, while having the event-related potential (ERP) correlate of conscious <b>recollection</b> measured. Halfway through the phase, some cues switched instructions so that participants had to start avoiding recall of associates they had previously repeatedly recalled, and vice versa. ERPs during <b>recollection</b> avoidance showed a significantly reduced positivity in the correlate of conscious <b>recollection,</b> and switching instructions reversed the ERP effect even for items that had been previously repeatedly recalled, suggesting that voluntary control processes can override highly practiced, automatic <b>recollection.</b> Avoiding <b>recollection</b> of particularly prepotent memories was associated with an additional, earlier ERP negativity that was separable from the later voluntary modulation of conscious <b>recollection.</b> The findings have implications for theories of memory retrieval by highlighting the involvement of voluntary attentional processes in controlling conscious recollectio...|$|R

40|$|Recognition {{memory is}} thought to depend on two {{distinct}} processes: <b>recollection</b> and familiarity. There is debate as to whether damage to the hippocampus selectively impairs <b>recollection</b> or whether it impairs both <b>recollection</b> and familiarity. If hippocampal damage selectively impairs <b>recollection</b> but leaves familiarity intact, then patients with circumscribed hippocampal lesions should exhibit the full normal range of low-confidence and high-confidence familiarity-based recognition. High-confidence, familiarity-based decisions are ordinarily accompanied by successful <b>recollection</b> (when memory is intact). However, patients with hippocampal lesions, if <b>recollection</b> is impaired, should frequently experience high-confidence, familiarity-based recognition {{in the absence of}} <b>recollection,</b> and this circumstance (termed the “butcher-on-the-bus” phenomenon) should occur more often in patients than in healthy controls. We tested five patients with circumscribed hippocampal damage, asking them to recognize recently studied words as well as to remember {{the context in which the}} items were studied. Relative to controls, the patients exhibited no increased tendency to experience the butcher-on-the-bus phenomenon. The simplest explanation of the results is that hippocampal damage impairs familiarity as well as <b>recollection.</b> The same conclusion was suggested when two competing models of recognition memory were used to analyze the data...|$|R
40|$|Recognition {{memory is}} thought to consist of two {{components:}} <b>recollection</b> and familiarity. Whereas it is widely agreed that the hippocampus supports <b>recollection</b> (remembering the episode in which an item was learned), there is uncertainty about whether it also supports familiarity (simply knowing that an item was encountered but without remembering the learning episode). We tested a counterintuitive prediction that follows from {{the idea that the}} hippocampus selectively supports <b>recollection.</b> Patients with hippocampal lesions should have strong experiences of familiarity as often as controls do; however, unlike controls, these experiences should not be accompanied by <b>recollection.</b> Accordingly, with methods that allow participants to report whether they remember an item as encountered previously or whether they simply know it is familiar, patients should express strong familiarity (in the absence of <b>recollection)</b> more often than controls. We indexed strong familiarity and <b>recollection</b> for previously studied words by obtaining confidence ratings together with Remember-Know judgments. The result was that patients provided fewer high-confidence Know responses than controls rather than more. Furthermore, the number of Know responses made by patients was substantially less than was predicted if <b>recollection</b> were impaired. This was true regardless of whether the prediction was {{based on the assumption that}} <b>recollection</b> and familiarity are independent or dependent processes. These results suggest that hippocampal lesions impair both <b>recollection</b> and familiarity. Unlike many previous studies of these constructs, the prediction (and the result) is independent of any particular theoretical model, and it holds even if Remember-Know judgments are not process-pure indicators of <b>recollection</b> and familiarity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with major}} {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) display impairments in <b>recollection,</b> which have been explained by both hippocampal and prefrontal dysfunction. Here, we used an event-related fMRI design, to dissociate hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to the neural processes involved in <b>recollection</b> success and <b>recollection</b> attempt early {{in the course of}} MDD. METHODS: To disentangle state- and trait-effects of depression, we included 20 medication-naive patients with a first depressive episode, 20 medication-free patients recovered from a first episode, and 20 matched, healthy controls in an event-related fMRI study using a source <b>recollection</b> paradigm. RESULTS: Group comparisons revealed that during the acute state of depression there is an increase in left prefrontal activity related to <b>recollection</b> attempt, while there were no differences in neural correlates of successful <b>recollection.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in the early course of depression, depressive state is associated with increased left prefrontal activation during the attempt to recollect source information suggesting an increased need for executive control during <b>recollection</b> in MDD. In this sample of first-episode MDD patients we found no evidence for hippocampal dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Current memory {{theories}} generally {{assume that}} memory performance reflects both <b>recollection</b> and automatic influences of memory. Research on people’s {{predictions about the}} likelihood of remembering recently studied information on a memory test, that is, on judgments of learning (JOLs), suggests that both magnitude and resolution of JOLs are linked to <b>recollection.</b> However, it has remained unresolved whether JOLs are also predictive of automatic influences of memory. This issue was addressed in 3 experiments. Using the process-dissociation procedure, we assessed the predictive accuracy of immediate and delayed JOLs (Experiment 1) and of immediate JOLs from a first and from a second study–test cycle (Experiments 2 and 3) for <b>recollection</b> and automatic influences. Results showed that each type of JOLs was predictive of both <b>recollection</b> and automatic influences. Moreover, we found that a delay between study and JOL improved the predictive accuracy of JOLs for <b>recollection,</b> while study–test experience improved the predictive accuracy of JOLs for both <b>recollection</b> and automatic influences. These findings demonstrate that JOLs predict not only <b>recollection,</b> but also automatic influences of memory...|$|R
