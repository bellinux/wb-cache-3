50|$|V(D)J {{recombination}} {{begins when}} V(D)J recombinase (through {{the activity of}} RAG1) binds an RSS flanking a coding gene segment (V, D, or J) and creates a single-strand nick in the DNA between the first base of the RSS (just before the heptamer) and the coding segment. This is essentially energetically neutral (no need for ATP hydrolysis) and results {{in the formation of}} a free 3' hydroxyl group and a 5' phosphate group on the same strand. The reactive hydroxyl group is positioned by the recombinase to attack the phosphodiester bond of opposite strand, forming two DNA ends: a hairpin (stem-loop) on the coding segment and a blunt end on the signal segment. The current model is that DNA nicking and hairpin formation occurs on both strands simultaneously (or nearly so) in a complex known as a <b>recombination</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

The as-grown bulk lifetime is revealed to depend not only on resistivity under the framework of the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) relation, but also on the oxygen concentration. The dominant <b>recombination</b> <b>center</b> of the as-grown crystal is found to be an SRH-type deep-level center which is considered to be an oxygen-related defect complex.

40|$|SummaryThe {{critical}} initial step in V(D) J recombination, binding of RAG 1 and RAG 2 to recombination signal sequences flanking {{antigen receptor}} V, D, and J gene segments, has not previously been characterized in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that RAG protein binding {{occurs in a}} highly focal manner to a small region of active chromatin encompassing Igκ and Tcrα J gene segments and Igh and Tcrβ J and J-proximal D gene segments. Formation of these small RAG-bound regions, which we refer to as <b>recombination</b> <b>centers,</b> occurs in a developmental stage- and lineage-specific manner. Each RAG protein is independently capable of specific binding within <b>recombination</b> <b>centers.</b> While RAG 1 binding was detected only at regions containing recombination signal sequences, RAG 2 binds at thousands of sites in the genome containing histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4.
