GABRIEL supported work in research projects that might apply to the side effects of nuclear war. It was the sole support of the major research effort of Project SUNSHINE, which tested biological damage from radioactive fallout of Sr-90. By 1954 Project GABRIEL included about 70 investigations supported by the Division of Biology and Medicine. At a summer conference that was hosted by the RAND Corporation the estimate of detonations was revised and increased to 25,000 megatons worth of damage. Project Sunshine was led by <b>radiation</b> <b>physicist</b> Willard Libby on July 21, 1953. Libby realized GABRIEL lacked data in other aspects of fallout, examined carbon-14 and developed radiocarbon dating. The Project GABRIEL report by the AEC was issued in 1954, while the RAND Corporation issued their report on Project SUNSHINE in 1953. Both Project GABRIEL and SUNSHINE played a direct role in the reorganization of the AEC's Division of Biology and Medicine in 1957.|$|E

The education of medical radiation physics in Sweden has traditionally had a high international reputation, and goes back as an academic education to the mid- 1950 s. ‘Medical Physicist’ became a protected professional title and a state-registered health care profession in 1999. Physicists must now hold a licence to practise any sub-area of the profession, that is, diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance tomography, or radiation therapy. In addition, the medical physicist must obtain expert skills and knowledge in radiation protection of both ionising and non-ionising radiation. The university departments at Gothenburg, Lund, Stockholm and Umeå Universities, {{have the authority to}} award a degree of Master of Science in Medical Physics. These departments have in close symbiosis with their respective university hospitals developed the education programmes over more than 50 years, aim to produce qualified medical physicists with expertise in all the fields of medical radiation physics to meet the changing needs of the health-care sector and society at large. The programmes also provide a good academic grounding and a scientific approach, preparing graduates for a future research career...|$|E
40|$|A {{quality control}} study {{was carried out}} by the EORTC Cooperative Group of Radiotherapy. From January 1982 to December 1984, 17 {{institutions}} were visited by a group of "experts" in radiotherapy and radiation physics. The evaluation included three steps: a comparison of megavoltage units, technical and staff environment, and data present in clinical and radiotherapy charts for each center; radiation physics calibration of photon and electron beams; and radiation physics measurements on a stimulated clinical case using an Alderson Rando anatomical phantom. This paper presents the results of Part 1. The results of Parts 2 and 3 will be analyzed in separate papers. Large variations were observed in the number of patients treated per year, per radiotherapist, per <b>radiation</b> <b>physicist</b> and per technician. On average, 400 patients were treated per year per megavoltage unit, but 8 / 17 centers treated more than 500 patients per unit per year. The number of simulators was suboptimal in 12 / 17 centers. These observations were summarized by a workload and staff index, and this index shows that in 5 / 17 centers major problems are present which make it difficult to comply with all the requirements of EORTC protocols. The quality of work-up regarding tumor extension was considered to be satisfactory in all centers. Dental care in patients irradiated to the head and neck was not well organized in 5 / 17 centers. Interaction between CT scan and dosimetry treatment planning could be improved in most centers and this should be one of the primary objectives of future quality control. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The analys is of Monte Carlo methods {{here has}} been made in {{connection}} with a particular problem concerning the transport of low energy photons (30 - 140 keV) through layers of water with thicknesses between 5 and 20 cm. While not claiming to be a complete exposition of available Monte Carlo techniques, the methodological analyses are not restricted to this particular problem. The report describes in a general manner a number of methods which can be used in order to obtain results of greater precision in a fixed computing time. Monte Carlo methods have been used for many years in reactor technology, particularly for solving problems associated with neutron transport, but also for studying photon transport through radiation shields. In connection with these particular problems, mathematically and statistically advanced methods have been worked out. The book by Spanier and Gelbard (1969) is a good illustration of this. In the present case, a more physical approach to Monte Carlo methods for solving photon transport problems is made (along the lines employed by Fano, Spencer and Berger (1959)) with the aim of encouraging even <b>radiation</b> <b>physicists</b> to use more sophisticated Monte Carlo methods. Today, <b>radiation</b> <b>physicists</b> perform Monte Carlo calculations with considerable physical significance but often with unnecessarily straightforward methods.

Beam targeting of patient anatomy has to very accurate to achieve the desired therapeutic result. Good understanding of radiotherapy treatment (RT) concepts is essential to training. This paper presents a virtual environment simulator developed by the authors for training and education of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment of cancer. This simulator employs immersive visualization to provide a high fidelity spatial awareness of the complex relationships between tumour, organs at risk, treatment beam and radiation dose. All these visualization are provided by a 3 D virtual environment based on the patient in a RT treatment room.

40|$|Transfusion {{of blood}} and blood {{components}} in patients with immunosuppression and malignant diseases is life-saving; however, it can result in some serious fatal side effects such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). T-lymphocytes of the donor proliferate and damage the recipient’s target organs, especially the bone marrow, skin, liver and the gastrointestinal system. In an effort to eliminate this problem, blood and cellular blood components are exposed to ionizing gamma radiation prior to transfusion. Irradiation of the blood and its components with gamma radiation and X-rays in established practices {{for the prevention of}} transfusion-associated (TA) -GVHD is the only acceptable method. This process renders T-lymphocytes incapable of proliferating due to the level of irradiation-induced damage in the DNA. Most blood centers rely on a nominal dose of 25 - 30 Gy with no less than 15 Gy delivered to any area of the bag to inactivate lymphocytes in cellular products for transfusion. Accordingly to our survey, there are 24 Cesium- 137 blood irradiators throughout Turkey in University Medical Faculties, Health Ministry Hospitals and Our Leukemia Children’s Foundation for irradiation of chemical material and only 1 unit for medical sterilization. There are two types of blood irradiators in Turkey: a) CIS BIO International France, IBL 437 C type units and b) MSD Nordion Canada Gammacell- 3000 units. These two types are monitored by an electronic controller and they cannot be activated without the canister being in the irradiation chamber and fully self-protected irradiation units.

The hypothesis is that patient participation is a means to develop a safety culture based on the cooperation between patients and healthcare providers, to improve patients' satisfaction and to reduce the costs associated to adverse events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A half-day session was organized on this theme during a training of radiotherapy professionals on risk management. Professionals were first distributed in three subgroups according to their specialty (<b>radiation</b> oncologists, <b>radiation</b> <b>physicists</b> and medical technicians), and had to work on four main questions relating to participation, among which the collection of real situations in which patients effectively contributed (positively or negatively) to patient safety. Results were then collectively discussed. RESULTS: Patient participation allows not only to detect and recover some mistakes or errors made by the professionals (error of identity), but also to decrease patients' risk behaviors (purposely taking the place of another patient {{in order to be}} treated faster). However, it must be seen as a possibility offered to patients, and not as an obligation.
