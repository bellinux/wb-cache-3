40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the dream content and dream meaning (discovery) via The Storytelling Method of Dream Interpretation (TSM) from the dreams of <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics</b> (N= 29) compared to a matched sample of non-alcoholics (N= 29).   The study also examined the dreams and meaning of dreams in relation to waking day mood.   Findings from the study revealed that the dreams of <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics</b> differ significantly from non-alcoholics and the dreams {{provide insight into the}} mood of <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics.</b>   Discovery via TSM was found to be relevant, meaningful, and helpful in terms of waking life issues.   Furthermore, regression analyses provide predictive evidence of discovery from the dream content for <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics.</b>   Analyses comparing discovery categories revealed that the major discovery categories for <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics</b> include: sobriety, past events, emotions, and a positive future.   It appears that TSM is a useful mode of therapy for gaining insight into recovery of alcohol addiction and waking day mood.   Limitations, future research, and clinical applications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This phenomenological inquiry {{investigated}} the loneliness experienced by <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics.</b> Select {{participants responded to}} open-ended interview questions pertaining to their experience of loneliness {{as well as its}} impact on their lives. Moreover, participants were asked to indentify what factor or factors {{may have contributed to the}} onset or persistence of their loneliness. Phenomenological analysis of the data revealed that loneliness, as experienced by <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics,</b> is a recursive experience that is co-morbid with a number of debilitating affects. Therefore, the loneliness that was experienced during recovery represented just one part of a combination of painful affective experiences. In addition, the data revealed a number of factors that contributed to the experience of loneliness for <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics.</b> Information obtained from this study may allow treatment providers to possess a better understanding of how the lives of <b>recovering</b> <b>alcoholics</b> can be influenced by the presence of loneliness and its accompanying affects...|$|R

5000|$|Whether singing [...] "Try to Remember" [...] as the dashing {{narrator of}} [...] "The Fantasticks" [...] in 1960 or trading barbs with fellow detectives and {{reluctant}} witnesses {{on television in}} recent years, Mr. Orbach exuded a wry, ragged masculinity that was all his own. As a star of musicals, he created {{a new kind of}} hero who was leagues away from suave, swaggering Adonises like John Raitt, Howard Keel, and Alfred Drake... And he flourished {{at a time when the}} Broadway musical hero was fast becoming an endangered species... His rough-edged individuality may account for his endurance on the Broadway stage in an era when other promising musical actors - including Larry Kert, Robert Goulet, and Robert Morse - proved unable to follow through on their breakthrough successes. Mr. Orbach may have been the last of a breed: no male star since has matched the breadth and continuity of his career in musicals... It wasn't until the 1990s, when he started appearing as Lennie Briscoe in [...] "Law & Order," [...] that Mr. Orbach became a familiar name throughout the country. The rough edge that distinguished him on Broadway eased his transition to character roles like Briscoe, the <b>recovered</b> <b>alcoholic</b> who seemed to greet the discovery of each episode's crime with a world-weary shrug.|$|E
50|$|The Drunkard, or the Fallen Saved, follows Edward Middleton, a fine {{upstanding}} citizen, who {{has just}} received ownership of a large estate.

Lawyer Cribbs then makes his first appearance, explaining how the new owner will probably kick them off of the land. However, when Edward finally arrives, he instead falls immediately in love with Mary. Time passes, and we see the Middleton family expanded by one: Edward and Marys' daughter, Julia. The Lawyer Cribbs has a plan to destroy Edward and take all of his money however, and after a long night at a local bar, Cribbs springs his plan into action. Cribbs, knowing that Edward enjoys the occasional drink, uses this against him, and turns him into a mad drunk. After getting Edward to sign all of his money away, Cribbs leaves Edward to ruin. Edward leaves his family, and moves away to New York, and lives on the streets, as a drunk. His family tries to follow him, but end up living in destitution as well. A family friend, William Downton finds Mary and Julia, and promises to help find Edward.
