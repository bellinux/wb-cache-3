40|$|The United States {{criminal}} justice system convicts, incarcerates, and, in some instances, executes people for crimes {{of which they are}} innocent. Although wrongful convictions may be an inevitable consequence of our {{criminal justice}} system, it would seem that a person wrongly deprived of his liberty is entitled to a civil remedy to compensate for the mistakes of the criminal system. Yet persons wrongly convicted of crimes who bring actions under 42 U. S. C. section 1983 for an erroneous arrest, detention, or conviction are often denied monetary compensation. This Article considers the role of causation in section 1983 wrongful conviction cases. Although causation is seldom mentioned as an element of a section 1983 claim, it plays two roles in section 1983 litigation. First, causation is an inherent part of the deprivation element of a section 1983 claim. Additionally, causation serves as a link between the defendant <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s breach and the plaintiff <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s <b>damages,</b> which I refer to as <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>damages</b> causation. <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> Wrongful convictions almost never happen for one reason but, instead, are usually the result of several different acts. Hence, they are not easily amenable to causation determinations and courts have used <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>damages</b> causation <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> as a way to limit liability in section 1983 wrongful conviction claims.

Methods/Results: Proof of concept studies were conducted to evaluate the ability of 4 -(5 -hydroxypyrimidin- <b>2</b> -yl) -N,Ndimethyl- 3, 5 -dioxopiperazine- 1 -sulfonamide (compound 4) and 4 -(5 -hydroxy- 4, 6 -dimethoxypyrimidin- <b>2</b> -yl) -N,N-dimethyl- 3, 5 -dioxopiperazine- 1 -sulfonamide (compound 8) to reduce <b>retinal</b> <b>damage</b> in <b>2</b> -week dark adapted Wistar rats exposed to 1000 lx of light for 3 hours.

40|$|Background: Spine {{boards are}} used to immobilise {{accident}} victims suspected of having spinal injury. Guidelines about the maximum time patients remain on the board are often exceeded and on occasions may lead to pressure ulcers. Etiological {{research has shown that}} two processes ultimately lead to pressure ulcers: <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> Ischemic <b>damage</b> <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> which takes several hours to initiate and <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> deformation <b>damage</b> <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> at high strains. The latter process is very quick and the first signs of cell damage are already evident within minutes. Thus in order to minimise the risk of pressure ulcer development during prolonged loading, a new soft-layered long spine board has been designed. Methods: A subject specific numerical approach has been adopted to evaluate the prototype spine board in comparison to a conventional spine board, with reference to the estimated strains in the soft tissues adjacent to the sacrum in the supine position. The model geometry is derived from magnetic resonance images of three human volunteers in an unloaded situation. The loaded images {{are used to}} <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> tune <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> the material parameters of skin, fat and muscle. The prediction of the deformed contours on the soft-layered board is used to validate the model. Findings: Comparison of the internal strains in muscle tissue near the spine showed that internal strains on the soft-layered board are reduced and maximum strains are considerably less than the threshold at which deformation damage is possible. By contrast, on the rigid spine board this threshold is exceeded in all cases. Interpretation: The prototype comfort board is able to reduce the risk for deformation damage and thus reduces the risk of developing pressure ulcers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

First came Professor Wright <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s Cases on Remedies, which concentrates on the substantive law of damages but does not neglect the alternative restitutionary and equitable remedies. It was followed within a few weeks by Professor Crane <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s Cases on the Law of Damages, a third edition which continues to confine itself strictly to problems involving the classic damage remedy. Both books are the product of the same rainmaker, the West Publishing Company. Hence both appear in the new red-covered, two-columned, slim-jim format recently designed by West to facilitate student and teacher cartage at the expense of marginal note space. Both volumes follow the current trend toward shorter books-a trend that is unfortunately as traceable to the demands of overworked teachers for books that can be taught on an automatic <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> for tomorrow take the next twenty pages <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> basis as it is to increased paper and printing costs.
