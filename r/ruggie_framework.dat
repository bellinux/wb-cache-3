40|$|Many textile and garment (T&G) {{workers are}} facing {{human rights abuses}} on a regular basis, {{especially}} women since they make up {{a majority of the}} workers. Most T&G factories are located in less-developed countries (LDCs), and India represents one of the top T&G exporting countries. The industry provides India with economic benefits and have been an important factor to their rising GDP. Over the years, the media attention on the T&G industry has additionally risen and it repeatedly reveals the occurrence of human rights violations. Poor working conditions appear as a normality in the T&G industry in India. However, the international sphere and consumers have started to push for changes to better the working conditions and wants to know what the conditions are where their garments are being produced. Some changes have occurred, e. g. the implementation of the United Nations’ (UN) <b>Ruggie</b> <b>Framework</b> introduced in 2008. The <b>Ruggie</b> <b>Framework</b> was developed attempting to frame the responsibility of the actors involved in the T&G sector; states and businesses. Since its introduction, human rights violations still seem to occur regularly in the factories. The aim of this thesis is first to assess what the challenges are for realising human rights in the T&G industry. Second, I will look at how the <b>Ruggie</b> <b>Framework</b> is operationalised to examine if the practices in the T&G industry in India is in alignment to the framework...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to map out the voluntary-regulatory {{dynamics}} of the discourse of human rights in a business context within the European Union (EU) regulatory environment. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the human rights and corporate social responsibility (CSR) discourses at the EU institutional level, in order to identify the interplay between soft and hard regulatory instruments that may contribute to the “human rights for business” normative landscape. Findings – A renewed focus at the international level on business and human rights has recently produced a United Nations (UN) framework document mapping corporate and state responsibilities in the area of human rights (the UN SRSG <b>Ruggie</b> <b>Framework).</b> Emphasising voluntariness as main tool, but also recognizing the importance of domestic uses of corporate law, of the investment and trade agreements, as well as of the international development cooperation tools, this framework report is in need of “operationalisation”. Starting from the interface between domestic and international developments in CSR and human rights for business, the paper explores the extent to which the European CSR context can offer tools and instruments towards such an operationalisation of the corporate responsibility for human rights and for social values generally. The article charts the dynamic relationship between EU soft regulatory attempts and the community mandatory legislation. Together, these define the EU's policy on CSR and human rights. Originality/value – The paper reveals an innovative normative mosaic, made up of complex soft and hard regulatory instruments that should enable the EU to integrate economic, trade and human rights policies and, ultimately, to contribute to the new CSR framework proposed at the international level...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} how the <b>Ruggie's</b> <b>framework</b> for corporate human rights performance {{may benefit from}} {{a relationship with the}} capability approach. The capability approach is found to fit nicely with both human rights and managerial perspectives. Among the many reciprocal contributions these perspectives can make to each other, this paper places a specific focus on how the capability approach can strenghten the case for the universality of human rights by means of Nussbaum's list of capabilities; as well as get the <b>Ruggie's</b> <b>framework</b> specified in business settings by accounting for different factors of variability and aspects of freedom. A manager-friendly 4 -step flow chart of practical reasoning is suggested and tested on the issue of gender equality in the firm...|$|R
30|$|The {{process of}} working with local {{communities}} {{to ensure that the}} development project minimizes its effects on the local population and mitigates its environmental damage, will help create the ‘social license’ necessary for the development to proceed smoothly (Gunningham et al. 2004; Prno and Slocombe 2012). Creating governance structures that engage local stakeholders early and establish clear grievance procedures can reduce the likelihood that local community members will protest a given project and also reduce the likelihood of violence if protests do emerge (Holliday and Yep 2005; Lemos and Agrawal 2006). Industry now has many decades of experience incorporating sustainable development initiatives into large-scale development projects as a component of their risk management and CSR initiatives (Breshears et al. 2005; Castka and Balzarova 2008); [URL] Furthermore, international governmental organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank have developed comprehensive frameworks for incorporating sustainable development practices into both business development models as well as local and national regulatory <b>frameworks</b> (<b>Ruggie</b> 2008, 2011). The International Finance Corporation’s CommDev (Commdev.org) website has an extensive repository of practical information related to incorporating sustainable development into project plans, including a Financial Valuation Tool, which helps firms and investors estimate the financial return on site-specific sustainability investments. These industry and international organization-developed tools also offer guidelines for appropriate ways to compensate individuals and communities who are displaced by large-scale projects, which is another important element in the efforts to eliminate violence related to these projects.|$|R
40|$|This article {{references}} {{the excellent}} article of Larry Cata Backer, as {{it provides an}} analysis of the 2008 Report 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Protect, Respect, Remedy 2 ̆ 2 (PRR) <b>framework.</b> <b>Ruggie</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most recent efforts, reflected in the 2010 Report, are directed at operationalizing the PRR framework set forth in the 2008 Report. Both these reports have been vetted internationally amongst governments, lawyers, academics and human rights advocates. How will governments, corporations, trade associations and rights advocates conceptualize and construct the fora and modes of recourse available to persons aggrieving human rights abuses? That question is the central focus of the 2010 Report and, as such, lies beyond the current charge here. The article was not intended to be comprehensive. First it provides a brief restatement of the 2008 Report, and then in Part III comments upon Backer 2 ̆ 7 s discussion and analysis of it. In Part IV the article presents some additional questions and themes presented by the 2008 PRR framework. In Part V, the article describes and analyzes the relationship between business and human rights questions and recent developments in American corporate law. Part VI addresses how the agenda of business and human rights relates to certain recent developments in federal securities law. The conclusion contemplates the curious relationship between legal change and social change. Professor Backer is certainly correct that the PRR framework will be influential in the evolving relationship of business and human rights. The rest remains to be resolved through a complicated conversation, between business leaders, human rights advocates and lawyers and politicians, for years to come...|$|R
