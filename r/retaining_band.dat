50|$|Reflectors were {{arranged}} {{around the outside}} of the reactor to provide the means to control the reactor. The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a <b>retaining</b> <b>band</b> anchored by an explosive bolt. When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down.|$|E

40|$|It {{was shown}} that flat elution curves were {{maintained}} with constant length rare-earth bands using either copper-ammonium- hydrogen or copper-hydrogen retaining beds. However, when the copper-hydrogen <b>retaining</b> <b>band</b> was used, some precipitation {{occurred at the}} lower boundary region or the rare-earth band. When the copper-ammonium-hydrogen band was used, a longer time was required to achieve equilibrium in this bend. When a narrow copper-ammonium-hydrogen bend was used, between the rare-earth and the copper-hydrogen bed, the precipitation was prevented and the 2 ̆ 2 tlat 2 ̆ 2 equilibrium type elution curves were obtained. It was demonstrated that when a final retaining bed of the proper composition is used with a given eluant, then the interposed band and the rare-earth band maintain a. constant length. In addition, it was demonstrated that, when the final retaining bed was not compatible with the eluant, then the flat type elution curves were maintained with the interposed band growing in length and the rare-earth band remaining constant in length...|$|E
5000|$|The peroneal retinacula (singular: peroneal retinaculum) are fibrous <b>retaining</b> <b>bands</b> which bind {{down the}} tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis as they {{run across the}} side of the ankle. (Retinaculum is Latin for retainer).|$|R
5000|$|As {{they got}} closer, {{they found the}} ATDA {{to be in a}} slow rotation, with the conical nose shroud still attached, the two pieces hanging agape at the front like a giant, open jaw. Stafford {{described}} [...] "It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating around". He asked if maybe he could use the spacecraft to open the 'jaws' but the ground decided against it, fearing this might cause damage to the spacecraft.The crew described how the shroud’s explosive bolts had fired but, because the quick disconnect lanyards that were designed to unlock the electrical connectors to the explosive bolts had not been hooked up, the electrical wiring to the bolts held the two 1-1/2 inch wide steel shroud <b>retaining</b> <b>bands</b> together. If the electrical wires were cut {{on one side of the}} shroud, the two steel bands would immediately straighten and, being still held together by the wires on the opposite side of the shroud, it was difficult to predict the path of the released bands. Their ability to rip open a space suit caused the salvage mission to be abandoned. At the Cape, backup pilot Buzz Aldrin suggested that Cernan cut the electric wires with surgical scissors from the equipment pack. An experiment on the ground demonstrated this could indeed slice the wires, but also showed the ATDA bristled with dangerous, sharp edges. Ground controllers were, in Deke Slayton's words, [...] "just aghast" [...] at the idea, which did not take into consideration the substantial risks of the energy in the released shroud <b>retaining</b> <b>bands</b> holding the shroud halves together, the constant spinning of the ATDA, or the fact that the released shroud <b>retaining</b> <b>bands,</b> might whip back, and puncture Cernan's spacesuit.|$|R

50|$|Ber timber is hard, strong, fine-grained, fine-textured, tough, durable, and reddish in colour. It {{has been}} used to line wells, to make legs for bedsteads, boat ribs, {{agricultural}} implements, tool handles, and other lathe-turned items. The branches are used as framework in house construction and the wood makes good charcoal with a heat content of almost 4,900 kcal per kg. In addition, this species is used as firewood in many areas. In tropical Africa, the flexible branches are wrapped as <b>retaining</b> <b>bands</b> around conical thatched roofs of huts, and are twined together to form thorny corral walls to retain livestock.|$|R
60|$|Smith {{was seated}} in the sanctum of the {{distinguished}} Director-General of Antiquities at the new Cairo Museum. It was a very interesting room. Books piled upon the floor; objects from tombs awaiting examination, lying here and there; a hoard of Ptolemaic silver coins, just dug up at Alexandria, standing {{on a table in}} the pot that had hidden them for two thousand years; in the corner the mummy of a royal child, aged six or seven, not long ago discovered, with some inscription scrawled upon the wrappings (brought here to be deciphered by the Master), and the withered lotus-bloom, love's last offering, thrust beneath one of the pink <b>retaining</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
50|$|CMJ - Up The Downstair <b>retains</b> the <b>band's</b> willowy {{roots in}} Albion psychedelia but expands the brief, {{dropping}} its cheesy self-consciousness while infusing some contemporary dance auras (from acidic mesmerism to almost funky syncopation) with more 'group-like' interaction.|$|R
50|$|Dealing With It! is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{hardcore}} punk band D.R.I., which was released in 1985. Although the band started their migration towards a heavy metal influence, this album still <b>retains</b> the <b>band's</b> roots.|$|R
50|$|In a {{departure}} from their previous album, Yes chose not to work with English artist Roger Dean and assigned Bob Cesca to design the artwork. However, the cover <b>retains</b> the <b>band's</b> logo that Dean originally designed in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|The album, which {{reportedly}} cost over £1 million (GBP) to produce, <b>retained</b> the <b>band's</b> epic sound while showing increasing influences {{ranging from}} jazz and blues to The Beatles, {{the latter of}} which is most evident on the hit single [...] "Sowing the Seeds of Love".|$|R
50|$|The <b>band</b> <b>retained</b> {{the rights}} in early 2006 and {{released}} the album on iTunes and Amazon for mp3 download.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} solo effort by Information Society {{frontman}} Kurt Harland. After {{the breakup of the}} band in the mid-1990s, Harland decided to <b>retain</b> the <b>band</b> name for this album. In 2006, the band reunited (with Harland initially opting out, before rejoining in 2007) and reassumed the name.|$|R
5000|$|Their final single with B-Unique was [...] "Hurricanes", {{released}} on 11 June 2007. An iTunes error prevented the single hitting the Top 40. Because of this, {{the band was}} dropped. However, B-Unique <b>retained</b> the <b>band's</b> album, resulting in a lengthy legal battle to return the album to Pull Tiger Tail.|$|R
50|$|Their success {{led them}} to the DreamWorks label for their follow-up, 2001's Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday. After the album and {{subsequent}} tour, the band broke up, with Laguana <b>retaining</b> the <b>band</b> name. Creeper Lagoon went on to release an EP in 2002 (Remember the Future) and an album in 2006 (Long Dry Cold).|$|R
5000|$|Fallen is an all-original album {{featuring}} the band's signature sounds and style. However, {{the sound of}} the album is heavier, but still <b>retains</b> the <b>band's</b> melodic pattern.

5000|$|Nobby Islet {{may have}} been formed as {{recently}} as 6000 years ago due to the relatively shallow depth of the water surrounding it. [...] As of 1996, the islet is reported as appearing to be entirely composed of a limestone known as Bridgewater Formation calcarenite. It is also observed that there was recent evidence of rockfalls due to the crumbly consistency of the calcarenite and that debris cones were present on its relatively sheltered northern side while any collapsed materials on its southern face had been washed away by wave action. The islet’s summit was also reported as being ‘gently terraced by resistant layers of calcrete that <b>retain</b> <b>bands</b> of sandy soil’. [...] Nobby Islet is technically a sea stack. The islet is located in waters of a depth of about 5.5 m that partially conceal wave-cut platforms and that are subject to rolling seas.|$|R

50|$|Mind Control is {{the fourth}} album by American post-grunge band Tantric and was {{released}} on August 4, 2009. It is the band's second album under Silent Majority Group and was produced by Brett Hestla, marking Tantric's departure from mainstay producer Toby Wright. Mind Control <b>retains</b> the <b>band's</b> 2008 lineup {{with the exception of}} drummer Kevin Miller who was replaced by Richie Monica.|$|R
50|$|The {{forces of}} Brian Ua Néill had been raiding Norman-held {{territory}} in Ulster after 1257 {{in an attempt}} to assert their independence and form a coalition of the Irish against the Normans. Ua Néill allied with Aedh mac Fedhlimidh Ua Conchobhair of Connacht and together with their men went into battle against the Normans. According to the Annals of Innisfallen, the Normans had gathered an army of mostly Irish Gaelic mercenaries to fight against the coalition, and the Normans themselves played only a small role in the fighting. Many of the Irish clans in Leinster, Ulster, Munster, Meath and Breifne, which were under Norman rule at the time, provided the Normans with the bulk of their fighting forces, serving as mercenaries and <b>retained</b> <b>bands.</b> Thus, most of the battles between the Normans and Irish at this time would have seemed more like battles between the Irish themselves. Brian Ua Néill was defeated and killed together with a number of Uí Catháin chiefs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>band</b> <b>retains</b> a close {{friendship}} with The Whitehaus Family Record, which has organized shows featuring Christians & Lions and label {{artists such as}} Gracious Calamity and The Woodrow Wilsons.|$|R
50|$|The Silent Enigma {{represents}} {{a turning point}} in Anathema's career (it is the first album to feature guitarist Vincent Cavanagh singing lead vocals, replacing Darren White) and sees the band incorporating more clean vocals and melodic elements, while still <b>retaining</b> the <b>band's</b> early death-doom style. The album was originally titled Rise Pantheon Dreams, a title later used by White for his post-Anathema project The Blood Divine.|$|R
5000|$|Their second album, [...] "Gravity Dance (1991)," [...] {{threw the}} musical balance greatly {{over to the}} rock sensibility.

50|$|Newly formed Logo Records {{approached}} Farren {{with the}} possibility of re-releasing some of his material but were delighted when he expressed a preference for recording new material. <b>Retaining</b> his <b>band,</b> minus Rudolph who had returned to his native Canada, the group recorded this album which featured guest appearances from fellow NME journalist Chrissie Hynde, Curved Air singer Sonja Kristina, former Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson and harmonica player Will Stallibrass.|$|R
5000|$|The {{material}} on In on the Kill Taker <b>retained</b> the <b>band's</b> aggressive and rhythmic style, but displayed more diversity as well. This {{is evident in}} songs like [...] "Smallpox Champion" [...] which features surf-style guitar parts, combined with heavy syncopated riffs. [...] "23 Beats Off" [...] features a noise rock coda and the instrumental [...] "Sweet and Low" [...] showcases subdued guitar lines, melodic bass and jazz-influenced drumming.|$|R
50|$|The {{matter of}} whether to leave a cigar band on while the cigar is being smoked {{is a matter of}} some debate. In Great Britain bands have been {{traditionally}} removed, the retention of the brand names being commonly considered a form of impolite boasting by one smoker amongst his fellows. Elsewhere, whether or not one <b>retains</b> the <b>band</b> while the cigar is being smoked is deemed a matter of personal preference.|$|R
40|$|We {{model the}} {{exchange}} rate market for a country that initially follows a band policy, as a four-stage sequential game of complete information, where a stochastic shock is realized in the last stage. Given a fixed cost of leaving the band, we show that three types of equilibria may exist, corresponding to different expectations by {{the public about the}} government <b>retaining</b> the <b>band,</b> (1) in all future states, (2) only in some future states, and (3) in none of the states. In case (2) a speculative attack occurs but is countered when the cost of countering it is not too high, leading to adverse shifts in fundamentals. We study the government 2 ̆ 019 s incentives to abandon or <b>retain</b> the <b>band,</b> and to abandon the band preemptively before public expectations are revealed. The standard Krugman and Obstfeld models are obtained as special cases, respectively when we have regime collapse as a unique equilibrium, and when there are multiple equilibria and the game always progresses to stage 4...|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 {{the band}} was renamed the Wallace Arnold (Rothwell) Band, {{reflecting}} sponsorship by coach tour operator Wallace Arnold. The then [...] "B" [...] <b>band</b> <b>retained</b> the name Rothwell Temperance Band and is the current band.|$|R

All other <b>bands</b> <b>retained</b> a 'Bandmaster' as head, and the Royal Artillery <b>Band</b> <b>retained</b> in {{addition}} to its director of music, a bandmaster, for the reason of it being the largest of all British military bands, with its own musical training establishment, the Junior Musicians Troop, Royal Artillery.|$|R
25|$|The {{album was}} largely {{recorded}} at Opra Music Studios in North Hollywood, California. The album's themes largely center on growing older; its lyricism, written by Pierre, concerns such subjects as relationships, drug abuse, and procrastination. Musically, the album <b>retains</b> the <b>band's</b> sound with {{less of an}} emphasis on the Moog synthesizer. Drummer Tony Thaxton broke his arm prior to recording, which led the band to use a drum machine on early recordings.|$|R
50|$|After Kalnoky, Egan and Ansley had departed, saxophonist Ryan Eldred {{became the}} band's primary songwriter, sharing lyric duties with new lead vocalist Jeff Davidson, and Eldred also became the band's third vocalist.
