5000|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is {{a common}} point of {{mechanical}} failure {{that leads to a}} [...] "jam" [...] of an automatic pistol. A rough surface or the presence of debris on the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> will eventually lead to the bullet being directed off-center, causing the gun to fail to complete the reloading cycle. Polishing a <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is among the tasks commonly performed by gunsmiths.|$|R
50|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is a {{critical}} part of a semi-automatic pistol or automatic rifle. When the pistol is fired and the spent case is ejected, the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> functions to direct a fresh cartridge from the magazine into firing position; that is, the slides along the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> into battery. The need for the cartridge to slide both forwards and upwards along the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> and into the barrel is the primary design consideration that makes the ogive the preferred shape for all modern automatic pistol rounds (a hollow point bullet is a truncated ogive), as there are many other shapes that are stable in ballistic flight.|$|R
50|$|<b>Feed</b> <b>ramp</b> {{is a basic}} {{feature of}} many breech loading {{cartridge}} firearm designs. It is a tightly machined and polished piece of metal which guides the cartridge {{at the top of}} the magazine into the firing chamber of the barrel. Depending on design, the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> may be part of the magazine (AR-7), part of the receiver or frame (Mauser C96), or part of the barrel (H&K USP). However, some firearms, like the FN Five-seven, have a beveled chamber instead of a <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Brennan {{moved the}} <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> from the AR-10 barrel {{extension}} to the detachable magazines. According to Brennan, this alteration {{is one reason}} why the 45 Raptor can feed wide-mouth hollow point rounds better than competing cartridges. [...] Standard, straight-wall magazines are modified by shortening the follower and installing an insert that includes the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b> Curved magazines cannot accept the insert, and are therefore incompatible with the 45 Raptor conversion. Magazine capacity is not altered.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 thin {{aluminum}} grips and a {{fiber optic}} front sight were added and improvements {{were made to}} the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> to improve reliability.|$|R
50|$|Options offered {{with the}} K9 include Tritium night sights, and wood Hogue grips. The Elite {{version of the}} pistol offers a {{polished}} <b>feed</b> <b>ramp,</b> polished and deburred slide, beveled magazine well, and enlarged trigger with a smoother action.|$|R
50|$|It {{uses the}} Browning system like the FN GP 35 with an {{integral}} barrel <b>feed</b> <b>ramp,</b> it is a single-action trigger with slide mounted safety that locks {{the firing pin}} so the hammer can be lowered by pressing the trigger with safety engaged.|$|R
50|$|In newer pistols the {{magazines}} are positioned 2 mm {{higher in the}} gun to get the rounds nearer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>ramp.</b> The required replacement part to position the magazine higher in older pistols that exhibit feeding problems is offered by Tanfoglio Germany for their customers without charge.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>feeding</b> <b>ramp</b> {{between the}} ESP85 and ESP85A {{is also a}} bit different. While one may attach the barrel to the frame, the trigger will not work, because {{rearward}} movement will stop against the feeding-ramp. But a usable conversion {{can be made with}} the help of a gunsmith.|$|R
50|$|The casing {{extractor}} {{is contained}} in the bolt while a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger housing. Due to the upward angle that the bolt must traverse in order to fire, the weapon has no <b>feed</b> <b>ramp,</b> so bullets are pushed by the bolt directly from the magazine into the chamber.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Kahr Arms {{introduced}} Elite {{versions of}} the MK9 and MK40. The elite variants feature a polished stainless steel finish and a laser etching on the slide. In addition to an enhanced look, the magazine well is beveled to facilitate easier reloading, and the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is polished to insure reliable feeding.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]38 Super {{retains the}} {{original}} {{dimensions of the}} [...]38 ACP case. The cartridge was originally designed to headspace on the semi-rim, which worked in the Colt M1900 due {{to the design of}} the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b> When the [...]38 Auto became the [...]38 Super, in the 1911A1, the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> could no longer be used as rim support. As a result of this, observed accuracy of the [...]38 Super suffered until Irv Stone of Bar-Sto barrels re-designed the chamber to allow headspacing on the case mouth. Since then, all new production [...]38 Super pistols headspace on the case mouth, as with other cartridges in this class. The semi-rimmed case is known to cause feeding problems in some magazines, especially double stack magazines, and {{led to the development of}} new variants with reduced rims (typically only [...]003" [...] per side).|$|R
5000|$|Reliability of the AR-7 {{is highly}} {{dependent}} {{on the condition of}} the magazine and on the ammunition used, perhaps more so than with other models of semi-automatic [...]22 caliber rifles. The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is part of the magazine and subject to damage from mishandling. Flat-nosed bullets tend to jam {{on the edge of the}} chamber of the barrel. The transition of cartridge from magazine to barrel can be smoothed by minor beveling of the chamber of the barrel, by using round-nosed as opposed to flat-nosed bullets and by paying attention to condition of the feed lips and <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> of the magazine. Later production magazines include an external wire spring to align the cartridge; earlier magazines used two pinch marks at the top of the magazine body, which in use could become sprung open or worn.|$|R
5000|$|They {{all have}} a {{spring-loaded}} internal magazine with hinged floor-plate, and even the [...]222 {{is based on the}} long action, although with a modified magazine and <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b> They came with iron sights. The rear sight was available in 'standard' or with the 'Williams' adjustable ramp. The beaded foresight was protected by a spring steel shroud.|$|R
50|$|The FN P90 {{personal}} defense weapon uses a horizontally mounted feeding system; {{the magazine}} sits {{parallel to the}} barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} receiver, and the ammunition is rotated 90 degrees by a spiral <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> before being chambered. The AR-57, also known as the AR Five-seven, is an upper receiver for the AR-15/M16 rifle lower receiver, firing FN 5.7Ã—28mm rounds from standard FN P90 magazines.|$|R
50|$|The {{stepped feed}} rails plus a {{modified}} <b>feed</b> <b>ramp,</b> achieve smooth <b>feeding</b> of flat nosed solid bullets in this rifle. Any of these routes {{can result in}} a very functional and very accurate dangerous game rifle. Frankly speaking, there are not a lot of gunsmiths who know how to get a big bore to feed properly, making the CZ550 conversion very attractive because there is so little to do.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson's patents {{were used}} by Armalite on the AR-10, AR-15, and later M16 rifles. Johnson was hired by Armalite as a {{consultant}} to promote their rifle incorporating his bolt design. Later, Johnson worked to improve the M1 carbine eventually developing the 5.7mm Spitfire cartridge in 1963 and starting Johnson Arms, Inc. The M1 Carbine can be converted to use 5.7mm Spitfire by replacing the barrel with modification of the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{frame mounted}} safety switch is present along {{the left side}} of the frame in the {{conventional}} location to be operated by the user's right thumb. Patridge-type target sights are standard on this gun, with the rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation. The front sight is integral with the barrel shroud and is not removable or adjustable. An integral <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> at the barrel breech helps assure reliable loading of rounds into the chamber from the magazine.|$|R
50|$|Upper {{and lower}} receivers: The rifles were {{produced}} by the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) at Fort Benning, Georgia using either new semi-automatic ArmaLite lower receivers or existing Army M16A2 or A4 lower receivers previously supplied by either Colt or Fabrique Nationale de Herstal. All rifles were equipped with a fixed A2 stock and a Knight's Armament Company 2-stage match grade trigger capable of only semi-automatic fire. The upper receivers were flat-top style, but unlike the SAM-R and SPR, {{they did not have}} extended <b>feed</b> <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
50|$|ARDEC began {{development}} of a new magazine design in July 2013 to address feeding issues of older designs with the new M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round. It was first made public in 2014 and completed development in mid-2016 as the Enhanced Performance Magazine. The magazine uses a blue follower and a tan body which presents the rounds with a better angle to the weapon's feedway, preventing the hardened steel tip of the EPR from contacting the aluminium <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> of the M4 carbine, increasing mean rounds between stoppage by 300%.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, the U.S. Army {{introduced}} the new Enhanced Performance Magazine. These new magazines have tan bodies and blue followers. [...] "Unlike previous magazines, the EPM uses a new, modified magazine body (and therefore not interchangeable, hence the different color) which presents the rounds {{at a more}} favorable angle to the rifleâ€™s feedway, improving reliability and, importantly, preventing the hardened steel tips of new 5.56mm M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds from contacting the aluminum <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> section on M4 type rifles." [...] This allows for a dramatic 300% {{increase in the number}} of rounds fired between stoppages.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]50 GI {{is not in}} the magnum {{class and}} works at the same {{pressures}} as the [...]45 ACP. The cartridge uses the same rim size as the [...]45 ACP and a [...]45 shell holder can be used for reloading. This new brass is made by Starline Brass and is slightly shorter than a standard [...]45 ACP. The magazine well in the grip frame has thinner walls than a standard M1911 to accommodate the [...]50 GI's wider magazine, and the flame <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is contoured with a more open radius for the larger-diameter [...]50-caliber bullet. Both are machined from heat-treated forgings, and the Model No. 1's hammer and sear are machined from tool steel.|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate using RAMP, a complete starter feed (Cargill Corn Milling, Blair NE) which contains {{a high level of}} Sweet Bran and a minimal amount of forage, for receiving lightweight calves and adapting cattle to high-grain diets. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to compare <b>feeding</b> <b>RAMP</b> with a traditional receiving diet to lightweight calves for the first 30 d of the feeding period. Seven experiments compared using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets to a traditional grain adaptation program or evaluated using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets in fewer days. Three of these trials were metabolism studies that evaluated DMI and ruminal pH of cattle during grain adaptation. <b>Feeding</b> <b>RAMP</b> to newly received lightweight calves improved G:F and did not affect the incidence of BRD. Using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets resulted in increased G:F and HCW when compared using a traditional grain adaptation program with alfalfa hay. No major differences in ruminal pH were observed between cattle adapted with RAMP or a traditional system but RAMP decreased ruminal pH variation during grain adaptation which may suggest less acidosis. In a metabolism study eliminating the adaptation period resulted in decreased ruminal pH and increased pH variance when compared to longer more traditional adaptation with more step diets. Although pH was lower in the metabolism study for cattle transitioned directly from RAMP to a finishing diet, performance was not affected in 2 feedlot trials when compared to a 4 -step adaptation program with RAMP. In the final metabolism study, regardless of adaptation period length (10 or 22 d), RAMP treatments increased eating time and average ruminal pH during the adaptation period. This may suggest less acidosis when using RAMP to start cattle on <b>feed.</b> Cattle fed <b>RAMP</b> for 10 d can be transitioned directly to a finishing diet containing 47. 5 % Sweet Bran without negatively affecting performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{of newly}} arrived 570 lb. steer calves fed RAMP or a control ration was {{evaluated}} in two trials completed in 2010 and 2011. Treatment diets were fed {{for an average}} of 31 days in year 1 and 24 days in year 2. Diets included a control receiving diet consisting of alfalfa hay, Sweet BranÂ®, dry rolled corn, and supplement or RAMP which is a complete starter ration containing a high level of Sweet Bran and a minimal amount of forage. Across both years, RAMP improved F:G but was due to increased ADG in year 1 and decreased DMI in year 2. <b>Feeding</b> <b>RAMP</b> to newly arrived calves improved feed efficiency the first three weeks cattle were in the feedlot...|$|R

2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by <b>feed</b> <b>ramps</b> into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver.

2500|$|The Beretta 92 pistol {{evolved from}} earlier Beretta designs, {{most notably the}} M1923 and M1951. From the M1923 comes the open slide design, while the alloy frame and locking block barrel, {{originally}} from Walther P38, were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 [...]380 caliber Model 84.

50|$|The Five-seven pistol feeds from {{detachable}} box magazines, {{but it is}} unconventional in that {{it feeds}} cartridges into the chamber {{without the use of}} a barrel <b>feed</b> <b>ramp,</b> having a beveled chamber onlyâ€”the pistol's feeding is inherently reliable because of its use of bottlenecked cartridges. The pistol is supplied with 20-round magazines as standard, or 10-round magazines for jurisdictions where magazines are restricted by law to a maximum capacity of 10 rounds. The Five-seven will also accept an aftermarket extended 30-round magazine, which protrudes an additional 38 mm {{from the base of the}} pistol. With an additional cartridge in the chamber, the Five-seven pistol has a total capacity of 11, 21, or 31 rounds depending on which magazine type is used. Magazine pouches for the Five-seven magazine are available from various manufacturers.|$|R

5000|$|Kahr's trigger {{is similar}} to a {{double-action}} revolver, with a short -inch trigger travel. On polymer-framed models, the slide travels on steel inserts that are permanently set into the polymer frame. There are also polymer rails, which are not structurally functional, but aid in keeping out dirt, and with aligning the slide when reassembling the slide onto the polymer frame. In steel framed versions, the rail design is traditional and very {{similar to that of the}} M1911 pistol. Kahr pistols have their <b>feed</b> <b>ramps</b> offset to the left, which allows the trigger draw bar to lie flatter against the right side of the frame. This feature helps the Kahr pistol line to achieve a slide width of [...]90 of an inch in 9mm and [...]40 S&W models, and 1.01 inches when chambered in [...]45ACP, narrower than many popular pistols.|$|R
