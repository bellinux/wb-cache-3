5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

For example, he used statistics to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> arguments of slave owners, who wrote that blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than free blacks or white urban laborers. To do this, he drew up statistical tables of data from the census.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{such as the}} sarcophagid fly Emblemasoma hunt cicadas by sound, being {{attracted}} to their song.

5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia.

His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{affiliation}} with the Institute for Advanced Study would last {{until his death in}} 1955.

The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.|$|E

5|$|Paul Joseph Goebbels {{was born}} on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an {{industrial}} town south of Mönchengladbach near Düsseldorf. Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds. His father Fritz was a factory clerk; his mother Katharina (née Odenhausen) was ethnically Dutch. Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1947), Hans (1895–1949), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915), and Maria (1910–1949), who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938. In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> rumors that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Shaiva scriptures narrate {{that god}} Shiva assumed the Avatar (incarnation) of Sharabha to pacify Narasimha - the fierce man-lion avatar of Vishnu worshipped by Vaishnava sect. This form is {{popularly known as}} Sharabeshwara ("Lord Sharabha") or Sharabeshwaramurti. The Vaishnavas <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> {{portrayal}} of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva-Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu. Another tale narrates that Vishnu assumed {{the form of the}} ferocious Gandaberunda bird-animal to combat Sharabha. In Buddhism, Sharabha appears in Jataka Tales as a previous birth of the Buddha.|$|E

5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur.

5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis for good.

5|$|Vaishnava {{followers}} including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayendra Tirtha (1514–93) <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> {{portrayal of}} Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as {{they consider the}} Shaivite Puranas as tamasic - and thus not authoritative - based on their reading of Sattvic Puranas and Shruti texts. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called Shaivasarvasvakhandanam.|$|E

5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, {{descendants}} of Edwin Booth {{reported that they}} obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor's body to obtain DNA samples to compare {{with a sample of}} his brother John's DNA to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> rumor that John had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin's body. The family hoped to obtain samples of John Wilkes's DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokeswoman Carol Johnson announced that the family's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.|$|E

After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party's leaders who had asked him to stay away.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Jordan Chandler's alleged {{account of}} the {{relationship}} was detailed in a book by journalist Victor M. Gutierrez. The book {{was said to be}} based on a diary the boy had kept at the time and included details of alleged sexual encounters between Jackson and him. In 1995, Jackson filed a civil suit against Gutierrez for slander; the jury found in Jackson's favor, awarding him $2.7 million in damages. However, that suit was unrelated to the book and the judgement does not serve to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> allegations contained within. In 1996, Evan Chandler sued Jackson for around $60 million, claiming Jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case. In 1999, a court ruled in Jackson's favor and threw out the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to <b>refute</b> <b>the</b> charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E
