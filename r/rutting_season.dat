In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the <b>rutting</b> <b>season,</b> the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E

The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Seasonal movements, home ranges, {{core areas}} and habitat use {{patterns}} of hunted, migratory Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) were investigated on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. Radio telemetry {{was used to}} obtain more than 3, 100 locations of 9 elk from May 1984 - March 1985, and November - December, 1985. Radio-collared elk were in 2 herds that migrated approximately 32 km, and 1500 m in elevation, between winter ranges at sea level to summer ranges at timberline. Migratory routes primarily were in riparian areas on narrow valley floors. Home ranges were largest during late autumn ([x-bar] = 43. 1 square km) and smallest during summer ([x-bar] = 5. 9 square km). Minimum daily movements of elk followed a similar seasonal pattern and were largest during late autumn ([x-bar] = 1119 m) and smallest during summer ([x-bar] = 602 m). Core areas in summer and <b>rutting</b> <b>seasons</b> occurred in subalpine parklands among precipitous, rocky ridges. Core areas during winter and calving seasons were primarily on the valley floors and lower portions of valley walls, areas that also have the greatest degree of human development. Elk used areas less than 300 m from residences and paved roads in winter core areas primarily at night. In addition, distances of elk from paved roads and residences were significantly greater during day-time hours, which was also the period with {{the greatest amount of}} motor vehicle traffic. In summer and <b>rutting</b> <b>seasons,</b> elk selected subalpine parkland habitats, and used coniferous forests in proportions less than expected on the basis of availability. In winter, deciduous and deciduous/coniferous forests were used in greater proportions than expected, whereas coniferous forests (< 150 yr) were used less than expected. Most elk selected slopes less than 24 percent during the summer, <b>rutting</b> and winter <b>seasons...</b>|$|R

Easy to spot in areas with high deer populations, hunters use them to find ideal locations for hunting. They appear in the late summer or early fall, when male deer rub the velvet off their newly acquired antler growth or during <b>rut</b> <b>season.</b> The area between the forehead and antlers contains a large number of apocrine sweat glands, and leave a scent that communicates a challenge to other male deer while also attracting potential mates.

To be successful, this requires a thorough understanding of the behavior of captive musk deer in order to improve their reproductive success and management. Between August 2005 to January 2006, the behavior sampling of 19 male and 13 female captive alpine musk deer, Moschus sifanicus Büchner, 1891, was used to examine the durations of twelve behavioral characteristics during the pre-rut (August to October) and <b>rut</b> <b>seasons</b> (November to January). Both males and females exhibited some seasonal variation in behavior. Males rested and fed more during the pre-rut than the rut and spent more time walking, fighting, and standing alert during the rut.

From this age, when they had recovered from their first <b>rut</b> <b>season</b> and were in their second spring/early summer, the entires grew more rapidly than the castrates.

Liveweights of entires and castrates were similar in stags slaughtered at 13 and 19 months, but castrates were smaller than entires at 25 months. Castration reduced the size of the head and skin, but there was little important effect of castration on body components at any slaughter age.

To understand these effects we studied the diet of both deer species during two consecutive years. Red deer eat more grasses during Spring, contrasting with Summer, when 80 % of the diet was shrubs and broadleaved trees. Roe deer consumed more shrubs and trees, throughout the year and had a more diversified diet than Red deer.

40|$|In mammals {{body size}} determines the energy requests, {{the amount of}} food can be gathered, the {{vulnerability}} to predators, and male reproductive success. Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) is an ungulate characterised by an evident dimorphism between sexes and among males of different ages. Hence, it is an ideal study case to shed light on the effects of body size. While foraging, larger males were less selective than younger and smaller ones, thus suggesting that large body provides to males the possibility to use a poorer quality food, which is more available in the environment. Moreover, larger males were less sensible to predation risk. As a result they had more time for feeding (they were less vigilante) and they fed higher-quality forage (they used riskier and food-rich meadows). However, after wolf recolonization male ibex changed their habitat use in favour of safer low-quality meadows. Finally, old males had higher reproductive success. This was particularly true during <b>rut</b> <b>seasons</b> with abundant snow, when only the tactic successfully used by large males (tending) was adopted. Adult males substantially reduced food intake during the rut having more time to invest in mating activities. In conclusion, {{the findings of this study}} showed that the evolution of a large body in male ibex is probably to be favoured because it increases, directly and indirectly, their reproductive success...|$|R

Electronic data-logging (CountcardTM) devices attached to 9 white-tailed doe deer on neck collars were used to monitor their movement activities during 2 <b>rutting</b> <b>seasons</b> in 2. 5 acre fenced enclosures. Direct daily behavioral observations on buck responses toward individual does were used to detect estrus and to validate changes in 24 -hour activity counts as another indication of estrous cycling. When individual activity counts for the estrus days on the does were compared to diestrus counts as estimated by mean values over days 10 through 15 post-estrus, a significant high product moment correlation of 0. 946 was obtained indicating similar and proportional changes in activity under the 2 behaviorally-detected conditions. As predicted, mean activity counts for the estrus days were significantly higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 0039) than the mean counts for the diestrus days. This indicated some potential utility for the devices as sensors for estrus detection.

40|$|Adult male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex) {{have been}} shown to exhibit unusually high {{survival}} to relatively advanced ages (> 10 years), leading to speculation that males may engage in an energetically conservative reproductive strategy that increases survival. We investigated {{the extent to which the}} adoption of alternative mating tactics contributes to the extraordinary survival of adult males in this species. Because basic information on the mating system of Alpine ibex is scarce, we 1 st characterized the temporal and spatial distribution of receptive females. Our observations during 3 consecutive <b>rutting</b> <b>seasons</b> revealed 2 alternative mating tactics. Apparently dominant males monopolized individual receptive females by following and defending them, a tactic known as tending. In contrast, apparently subordinate males tried to achieve temporary access to tended females when the latter started to run, a tactic referred to as coursing. In total, 24 copulations were observed, of which 20 (83. 3 %) were the result of tending and 4 were the result of coursing. The adoption of the 2 tactics was strongly age-dependent; older males (9 - 12 years) engaged primarily in tending, whereas younger males (2 - 6 years) engaged mainly in coursing. Males adopting the coursing tactic spent more time in low-cost and less time in high-cost behaviors than males adopting the tending tactic. Time-budget comparisons with another ungulate species suggested that although tending is a relatively costly tactic, coursing is a low-cost tactic that may contribute to the exceptional adult survival in male Alpine ibe...|$|R
