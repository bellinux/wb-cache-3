Use of this window material with a previously proposed selective radiator material, a form of anodised aluminium that reflects radiation at wavelengths shorter than 8 microns allows for the economical production of an effective selective radiator system.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using acoustic <b>plate</b> <b>radiators</b> powered by piezoceramic thin sheets as canceling sources for active control of aircraft engine fan noise is demonstrated. Analytical and numerical models of actuated beams and plates are developed and validated. An optimization study is performed {{to identify the}} optimum combination of design parameters that maximizes the plate volume velocity for a given resonance frequency. Fifteen plates with various plate and actuator sizes, thicknesses, and bonding layers were fabricated and tested using results from the optimization study. A maximum equivalent piston displacement of 0. 39 mm was achieved with the optimized plate samples tested with only one actuator powered, corresponding to a plate deflection {{at the center of}} over 1 millimeter. This is very close to the deflection required for a full size engine application and represents a 160 -fold improvement over previous work. Experimental results further show that performance is limited by the critical stress of the piezoceramic actuator and bonding layer rather than by the maximum moment available from the actuator. Design enhancements are described in detail that will lead to a flight-worthy acoustic <b>plate</b> <b>radiator</b> by minimizing actuator tensile stresses and reducing nonlinear effects. Finally, several adaptive tuning methods designed to increase the bandwidth of acoustic <b>plate</b> <b>radiators</b> are analyzed including passive, active, and semi-active approaches. The back chamber pressurization and volume variation methods are investigated experimentally and shown to be simple and effective ways to obtain substantial control over the resonance frequency of a <b>plate</b> <b>radiator.</b> This study shows that piezoceramic-based <b>plate</b> <b>radiators</b> can be a viable acoustic source for active control of aircraft engine fan noise...|$|R

40|$|TORCH (Timing Of {{internally}} Reflected CHerenkov photons) is {{a precision}} time-of-flight detector for particle identification at low momentum. It uses Cherenkov photons produced by charged particles {{passing through a}} quartz <b>radiator</b> <b>plate.</b> Some of these photons propagate by total internal reflection, they emerge at the edges and are subsequently focused onto photon detectors. The recorded positions and arrival times of the photons are used to precisely reconstruct their trajectory and propagation time in the quartz. This allows to determine the crossing time of the particles through the plate. The TORCH design requires the development of fast photon detectors with fine and asymmetric anode segmentation. The overall per-photon time precision must be better than 70 ps after signal processing and photon path reconstruction in the quartz. In addition, the photon detectors must survive several years of high illumination levels. The on-going RandD programme aims at demonstrating the TORCH basic concept through the realization of a detector module equipped with custom photon detectors featuring the required granularity and lifetime, with dedicated fast front-end electronics and with high-quality quartz radiator and focussing optics. This paper will report on the latest TORCH results achieved in the laboratory and in charged particle beam tests.
