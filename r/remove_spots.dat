50|$|As per Toonz 6.3, the 6.4 edition is {{available}} in two versions: Toonz 6.4 Bravo! for the paperless animation only and Toonz Harlequin for the traditional and paperless animation process and it introduces new or improved features {{to the world of}} Toonz. The Cleanup Module has been widely improved: now you can check the process in the before and after processing preview area, and <b>remove</b> <b>spots</b> and marks from the scanned drawings by using a specific option. You can also use the Morphological Antialias technique {{at the end of the}} Cleanup Process using the associated parameter to set the intensity. Another new feature is the scanning in Black&White mode in order to save time and hard disk space. You can also choose the output format for the scanned images. Also, the camera DPI parameter is now editable both in the Camera and in the Cleanup Settings and a completely new algorithm for the Raster-to-Vector Converter traces the outline of your drawings while adjusting few parameters in order to achieve high quality results even starting from mid-resolution images. Other new features are the Interactive Color Editing or the Smart FX Schematic Editing, while the already wide range of Output Settings and the Preview Window has been improved.|$|E
40|$|O sistema de abrasão a ar pode ser utilizado como auxiliar no diagnóstico de cárie frente a sua capacidade de remoção de manchas e pigmentos com desgaste mínimo. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi verificar a influência da limpeza dos sulcos e fissuras por esse sistema no diagnóstico de lesões de cárie através de fluorescência a laser (DIAGNOdent®) e exame visual. A amostra foi composta de 65 sítios que sugeriam lesões de cárie em dentes decíduos doados pelo BDH-FOUSP. Foram {{realizadas}} duas mensurações com o laser DIAGNOdent® (examinador A) e dois exames visuais (examinador B). Em seguida as superfícies foram abrasionadas por um aparelho Prep Star (Danville Engineering) utilizando ponta de 38 mm de diâmetro e pó de óxido de alumínio de 50 μm. Foram repetidos os dois exames com o DIAGNOdent® e os dois exames visuais. O padrãoouro foi obtido pela análise em lupa estereoscópica (32 X) dos sítios seccionados. Obteve-se um Kappa (antes/depois) de 0, 282 / 0, 884 para o DIAGNOdent® e 0, 896 / 0, 905 para o exame visual. As correlações de Pearson, Spearman e Kendal foram calculadas para correlacionar os métodos com o padrão-ouro, obtendo-se os valores para o DIAGNOdent® (antes/depois) de 0, 155 / 0, 483; 0, 210 / 0, 515; 0, 194 / 0, 487; respectivamente. Para o exame visual foram encontrados valores de 0, 294 / 0, 573; 0, 347 / 0, 547; 0, 312 / 0, 486, respectivamente. Compararam-se os valores encontrados para o DIAGNOdent® antes e depois da abrasão e da mesma forma para o exame visual através do teste de Wilcoxon (- 6, 15 e – 4, 04, respectivamente). Pode-se concluir que o uso do sistema de abrasão a ar contribuiu para aumentar a efetividade e facilitar o diagnóstico das lesões de cárie quando utilizado o DIAGNOdent® e o exame visual. The {{air abrasion}} {{system can be}} used to aid in caries diagnosis because it´s able to <b>remove</b> <b>spots</b> and pigments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the influence of cleaning pits and fissures with this system on the diagnosis of caries using both laser fluorescence (DIAGNOdent®) and visual examination. The sample was composed of 65 sites that suggested caries lesions in deciduous teeth donated by the BDH-FOUSP. Two examinations with laser DIAGNOdent® (examiner A) and two visual examinations (examiner B) were carried out. Following these examinations, the surfaces were air abraded by a Prep Star device (Danville Engineering) using a tip of 38 mm diameter and aluminum oxide powder of 50 μm. Subsequently, the two examinations with laser DIAGNOdent® and two visual examinations were repeated. A goldstandard was obtained by analysis of sectioned teeth using a stereoscope magnifying glass (32 X). Kappa (before/after) indexes of 0. 282 / 0. 884 and 0. 896 / 0. 905 using DIAGNOdent® and visual examination were obtained, respectively. The Pearson´s, Spearman´s and Kendal´s correlations were calculated to correlate methods with the gold-standard. This analysis resulted in the following values using DIAGNOdent® (before/after) : 0. 155 / 0. 483; 0. 210 / 0. 515; 0. 194 / 0. 487, respectively. Using visual examination (before/after), this analysis resulted in the values of 0. 294 / 0. 573; 0. 347 / 0. 547; 0. 312 / 0. 486, respectively. Statistical analysis was carried out through comparing values found for DIAGNOdent® before and after air abrasion and in an identical way for visual examination through the Wilcoxon´s test (- 6. 15 and - 4. 04, respectively). It can be concluded that the use of the air abrasion system contributed to the increased effectiveness and made easier the detection of injuries of caries diagnosis when using both DIAGNOdent® and visual examination...|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} model is {{proposed for the}} analysis of errors in microarray experiments and is employed in the analysis and development of a combined normalisation regime. Through analysis of the model and two-dye microarray data sets, this study found the following. The systematic error introduced by microarray experiments mainly involves spot intensity-dependent, feature-specific and spot position-dependent contributions. It is difficult to remove all these errors effectively without a suitable combined normalisation operation. Adaptive normalisation using a suitable regression technique is more effective in <b>removing</b> <b>spot</b> intensity-related dye bias than self-normalisation, while regional normalisation (block normalisation) is an effective way to correct spot position-dependent errors. However, dye-flip replicates are necessary to remove feature-specific errors, and also allow the analyst to identify the experimentally introduced dye bias contained in non-self-self data sets. In this case, the bias present in the data sets may include both experimentally introduced dye bias and the biological difference between two samples. Self-normalisation is capable of removing dye bias without identifying the nature of that bias. The performance of adaptive normalisation, on the other hand, depends on its ability to correctly identify the dye bias. If adaptive normalisation is combined with an effective dye bias identification method then there is no systematic difference between the outcomes of the two methods...|$|R

40|$|Stellar activity, such as starspots, can induce radial {{velocity}} (RV) variations that can mask or even mimic the RV signature of orbiting exoplanets. For this reason RV exoplanet surveys have been unsuccessful when searching for planets around young, active stars {{and are therefore}} failing to explore an important regime which can help to reveal how planets form and migrate. This paper describes a new technique to <b>remove</b> <b>spot</b> signatures from the stellar line-profiles of moderately rotating, active stars (v sin i ranging from 10 to 50 km s− 1). By doing so it allows planetary RV signals to be uncovered. We used simulated models of a G 5 V type star with differing dark spots on its surface along with archive data of the known active star HD 49933 to validate our method. The results showed that starspots could be effectively cleaned from the line-profiles so that the stellar RV jitter was reduced by more than 80 per cent. Applying this procedure to the same models and HD 49933 data, but with fake planets injected, enabled the effective removal of starspots so that Jupiter mass planets on short orbital periods were successfully recovered. These results show that this approach {{can be useful in}} the search for hot-Jupiter planets that orbit around young, active stars with a v sin i of ∼ 10 – 50 km s− 1. ...|$|R

40|$|In total, {{expression}} levels from 6567 {{genes are}} measured {{for each of}} the 88 samples, where 63 are labeled calibration samples and 25 represent blind tests. In the analysis we used the red intensity (ri) and the relative red intensity (rri). Genes are omitted if for any of the samples ri is less than 20. With this cut we are left with 2308 genes, which are used below for the analysis. The cut in ri mainly <b>removes</b> <b>spots</b> for which the image analysis failed. In Fig. 1 the number of genes each sample removes is shown. We used the natural logarithm of rri as a measure of the expression levels. 2. Principal Component Analysis – PCA To allow for a supervised regression model with no “over-training ” (i. e. low number of pa-rameters as compared to the number of samples), we reduce the dimensionality of the samples using PCA [1]. Even though the formal dimension of the problem is given by the number of genes, the effective dimension is just one less than the number of samples. Hence the eigen-value problem underlying PCA can be solved without diagonalizing 2308 × 2308 matrices by using singular value decomposition. Thus each sample is represented by 88 numbers, which are the results of projection of the gene expressions using the PCA eigenvectors. In what follows we use the 10 dominant components out of the 88 PCA eigenvectors to represent the expression data. ...|$|R
