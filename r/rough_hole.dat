6000|$|Seven o'clock, {{the hour}} of the rehearsal, came round, and {{in a short time}} Eustacia could hear voices in the fuel-house. To {{dissipate}} in some trifling measure her abiding sense of the murkiness of human life she went to the [...] "linhay" [...] or lean-to-shed, which formed the root-store of their dwelling and abutted on the fuel-house. Here was a small <b>rough</b> <b>hole</b> in the mud wall, originally made for pigeons, through which the interior of the next shed could be viewed. A light came from it now; and Eustacia stepped upon a stool to look in upon the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{love with}} Dick Hardman?" [...] she whispered, hotly. [...] "My God! I wouldn't soil even {{my hands on}} him--if I didn't have to.... He met me in Frisco. He brought me to this damned stinking <b>rough</b> <b>hole.</b> He made me {{promises}} he never kept. Not to marry me. Don't get the wrong hunch. He has double-crossed me. And I had to sink to this!... Drunk? Yes, sure I was drunk. Don't you understand I have to be drunk to stand this life? I'm not drunk now because you got here early.... Something deep must be behind my meeting you, Panhandle Smith." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{entrance}} to the wine shop was like a <b>rough</b> <b>hole</b> in a wall of flints. The owner {{was the only person}} who was not in the street, for he came out from the darkness at the back where the inflated forms of wine skins hung on nails could be vaguely distinguished. He was a tall, one-eyed Asturian with scrubby, hollow cheeks; a grave expression of countenance contrasted enigmatically with the roaming restlessness of his solitary eye. On learning that the matter in hand was the sending on his way of that English mariner toward a certain Gonzales in the mountains, he closed his good eye for a moment as if in meditation. Then opened it, very lively again.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Sunbursts {{suffered}} structural failures {{that resulted in}} fatal accidents. The cause was traced to cable attachment brackets that were made with <b>rough</b> <b>holes</b> that over time in service sawed through the cable thimbles and caused the flight cables to break. This was addressed by replacing the brackets.|$|R
30|$|Subsystem C is <b>rough</b> pin <b>hole</b> {{boring machine}} {{used to make}} pin holes on the piston to give proper size to the holes, which are used to fit the pin by which a rod is {{connected}} to crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{twist drill}} bits used in metalworking also {{work well in}} wood, {{but they tend to}} chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in <b>rough</b> <b>holes</b> for carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade bits and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits, Forstner bits and hole saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat.|$|R
5000|$|Llech Ronw (The Stone of Gronw) for {{the series}} was carved by local stone mason Edward Rowlands from a brief by {{designer}} Peter Caldwell: [...] "An upright piece of slab stone or slate (like a gatepost) with a 4" [...] dia <b>rough</b> <b>hole</b> cut through it 1'.0" [...] from the top and a roughly etched grooved pattern of circles 2'.0" [...] from the top. The stone should be 5'.00" [...] above the ground and 2".0 below. The stone should be very rough and weather-worn and will represent an ancient monument". After the production was finished the stone was left in situ by the river Dovey below Bryn Hall but Rowlands added his name to the carving so that his work would not {{be mistaken for a}} real ancient monument.|$|E
30|$|When the {{diameter}} of the lead hole of a wood member was larger than the bolt diameter, the contact conditions between the wood and bolt changed in comparison with the case of no clearance, and the stress distribution along the lead hole changed as the clearance became larger [41]. The clearance between the lead hole and bolt had a greater effect on the shear strength of multiple bolted joints than that of single bolted joints, because the clearance prevented uniform loading on all bolts. The results of experiments and analyses showed that the initial stiffness and ultimate load decreased when {{the diameter}} of the lead hole was larger than the bolt diameter, provided that the ultimate slip increased with an increase in the clearance [38, 42]. The lead hole in a wood member produced by a drill had a surface roughness that was dependent on the configuration of the drill and its feed rate. The surface roughness had an effect on the bearing stress, and the maximum load of a specimen with a smooth hole was larger than that with a <b>rough</b> <b>hole</b> [43].|$|E
50|$|May was {{the first}} to offer big-money tournaments, first to allow club members to use golf carts, first to provide grandstands, and first to use radios to keep spectators up to date about what was {{happening}} elsewhere on the course. He kept his admission prices low, allowing families to attend, and allowed picnics in the <b>rough</b> bordering <b>holes</b> during his events.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, {{repair rate}} {{fluctuations}} {{have been studied}} for the effect of maintenance on time-dependent availability of the system. We found that the time-dependent availability of system S 1 shows 0.001 % increase for fixture seat machining and <b>rough</b> pin <b>hole</b> boring, and for other subsystems, time-dependent availability shows 0.01 % (for rough grooving cum tuning and finish profile turning), 0.02 % (for rough oil drilling), and 0.025 % increase (for finish grooving) with corresponding increase in repair rates as observed from Tables  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the weak subsystem {{was found to be}} the fixture seat machining which is due to the effect maintenance practice as well.|$|R
60|$|The Indian, whose horned cap and person {{were well}} {{powdered}} with snow, stepped slowly over the threshold, extending {{his hand to}} the Highlander's grasp, and looking cautiously round with rolling black eyes, as if he half expected a dynamite explosion to follow his entrance. His garments bore evidence of <b>rough</b> usage. <b>Holes</b> in his moccasins permitted portions of the duffle socks underneath to wander out. Knots on his snow-shoe lines and netting told of a long rough journey, and the soiled, greasy condition of his leathern capote spoke of its having been much used not only as a garment by day but as a shirt by night.|$|R
50|$|Modifications that {{manufacturers}} made {{to recover}} {{some of the}} lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using <b>holes,</b> <b>rough</b> paint or dimples), were forbidden {{at the end of}} 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books. Seppo Räty had achieved a world record of 96.96 m in 1991 with such a design, but this record was nullified.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is in the}} draft angles. These are required to remove the piece from the mold. On the outside walls, a draft angle of 1° may work (assuming no <b>rough</b> surface or <b>holes).</b> On inside walls, such as {{the inside of a}} boat hull, a draft angle of 5° may be required. [...] This is due to shrinkage and possible part warping.|$|R
60|$|This unearthly glimmer, faint as it was, {{helped us}} much, indeed but for it {{we must have}} been overtaken, for here the ground was very <b>rough,</b> full of <b>holes</b> also made by {{burrowing}} marmots. Thus in our extremity help did come {{to us from the}} Mountain, until at length the moon rose, when as quickly as they had appeared the volcanic fires vanished, leaving behind them nothing but the accustomed pillar of dull red smoke.|$|R
25|$|Most nests {{of these}} species have a loose, coarse woven texture which {{suggests}} that D. norwegica are terrestrial. One such nest was found, spherical in size, approximately 10.5cm long, 10.5cm at its widest point and 15cm off the ground. This nest was fastened {{from the top of}} a willow branch and was further stabilized by a side branch attachment. The nest consisted of eleven envelope layers with a few extra layers {{on the edge of the}} top comb. The texture of each layer is <b>rough</b> with some <b>holes</b> from weaving.|$|R
50|$|Standing in {{a region}} which {{has some of the}} highest {{mountains}} in the UK, Beinn Bhàn can be easily overlooked, however it is conspicuous in the view from the Commando Memorial at Spean Bridge, where its long NW ridge is well seen rising from Glen Mallie to the summit ridge overlooking the Great Glen. The hill has three notable corries on its slopes, the south facing Coire Mhuilinn (corrie of the mill) above Glen Loy is smooth and grassy, while the two north facing corries of Coire Bhotrais (corrie of the <b>rough</b> miry <b>holes)</b> and Coire Dubh (black corrie) are more rocky and steeper in nature. All three corries bite significantly and high into the hill to give a two kilometre long narrow curving summit ridge which is above the 750 metre contour for its entire length. The highest point stands at the eastern end of the ridge and there are two lesser and unnamed tops, both with a height of 771 metres situated at the midpoint and western end. 200 metres west of the main summit are several springs which emerge on the summit ridge and are the origins of the stream which flows down Coire Mhuilinn.|$|R
60|$|Going {{at once to}} {{his room}} Billy withdrew his tools from their hiding place beneath the mattress, {{and a moment later}} was busily engaged in boring holes through the floor at the foot of his bed. For an hour he worked, {{cautiously}} and quietly, until he had a <b>rough</b> circle of <b>holes</b> enclosing a space about two feet in diameter. Then he laid aside the brace and bit, and took the keyhole saw, with which he patiently sawed through the wood between contiguous holes, until, the circle completed, he lifted out a section of the floor leaving an aperture large enough to permit him to squeeze his body through when the time arrived for him to pass into the bank beneath.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on {{microhabitat}} distribution and substrate roughness on barnacle settlement at Cabo Frio region, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Ten commercial blocks of granite rock (100 cm 2) were attached to rocky coast at 0. 6 tide level (5 smooth blocks and 5 <b>rough</b> with 20 <b>holes).</b> Experiment was conduced for five weeks, with repetitions each week. Settlement was higher on rough (398 individuals) than on smooth blocks (38 individuals) on the same week. There {{was no significant difference}} between settlement in the centre of the block and at the edge. Significant differences observed among weeks were affected by the variability of cyprid larvae density. This result showed that roughness was an important variable to be considered on barnacle settlement...|$|R
2500|$|Hobens was victimized {{with some}} horribly bad {{luck in the}} 1904 North and South Open at Pinehurst, North Carolina. After 36 holes of {{regulation}} play he was tied for first place with Alec Ross. The two players went to a playoff where Hobens was one shot ahead {{with just a few}} holes to play. He hooked his tee shot into the left <b>rough</b> on a <b>hole</b> but had an easy, unobstructed shot to the green. [...] Upon making his backswing, his clubhead hooked a weed, or a [...] "creeper" [...] as it was called by Jerome Travers, which caused his ball to move. [...] Hobens, unable to stop his stroke, proceeded to miss the ball completely. [...] The unfortunate result was a one-stroke penalty for causing the ball to move and another stroke for the whiff. He ended up losing the tournament.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a report of study on the casting defects occurable to cement-bonded and molasses-added mold, {{concerning}} to the permeability of mold and the pressure of gas from core in pouring process of cast iron and aluminum alloy. Results are obtained as follows: 1) Permeability of the testing sand after 24 hours' drying at room temperature shows 210 - 290. This figure means that the cement-bonded molds have good permeability. 2) The pressure of gas from core changes under influence of water and molasses. Higher gas pressure caused by higher water content tends to produce more gas-originated defects. 3) Improper decrease of water content tends to cause other type of casting defects, such as <b>rough</b> surface, sand <b>hole,</b> sand inclusion. So, a proper mixing ratio of additions should be selected to produce sound castings; for example, weight ratio of sand 100, cement 10, water 5 ～ 6, and molasses 3 ～ 4, for our experimental conditions, can be recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape of}} real objects {{can be so}} complicated, that only a {{sampling}} data point set can accurately represent them. Analytic descriptions are too complicated or impossible. Natural objects, for example, can be vague and <b>rough</b> with many <b>holes.</b> For this kind of modelling, a-complexes offer advantages over triangulations and hulls at little extra computational cost. Geometric and topological descriptions are well-formalised, with the flexibility to capture holes, up to a complete separation. Spatial distribution of the point set and the attachment of weights make ''special modelling effects" possible. We explore in this paper the merits of geometric modelling with a-complexes, {{with the objective of}} evaluating their practical value. We discuss the a-complex as a model description and as a representation scheme. Varying the a-value is intuitive, but weighting can be tedious. We present a few strategies. We also show how to run FEM computations on a-complexes. a-Complexes form a useful addition to existing approaches and are applicable to a number of problems not (easily) handled by existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} Titanium and Ti 6 Al 7 Nb surface by the mechanical grinding and sanding acid etch on mouse osteoblastic adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. In Titanium and Ti 6 Al 7 Nb surface by mechanical grinding and sanding acid corrosion are different processing to prepare a smooth surface and <b>rough</b> surface with <b>holes,</b> SEM and EDX analyze titanium surface morphology and elemental composition, laser confocal microscopy analyze surface roughness of titanium plate and a three-dimensional structure, inductively coupled plasma spectrometer to measure the internal elements of titanium and titanium alloy precipitation, observe different titanium surface adhesion of osteoblast cells by scanning electron microscope and analyze the proliferation of osteoblast by MTT test. Our results showed that sandblasted etched titanium surface treated to form a porous structure, the roughness of the surface is much larger than mechanical polishing, the precipitation of element content among titanium and titanium alloys is minimal in simulated body fluid, osteoblastic adhesion, proliferation, differentiation on titanium surface with Sandblasted etching group {{is much better than}} the mechanical grinding group. In summary, two methods could promote osteoblastic adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, but sandblasting etching group is better than mechanical grinding group, while in sandblasting etching treatment group Ti 6 Al 7 Nb is better than Titanium.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the potential use of ultrasonic atomization technique for biopolymer particles and tube preparation. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was selected as a model polymer. The polymer solutions were, first prepared. For particles forming, the factors affecting the preparation such as the polymer concentrations, the distance between a nozzle and a target plates and the feed flowrate target plate were investigated. In case of tube fabrication, the feed flowrate {{and the time of}} atomizing were of interest. All samples were analyzed for particle sizes and SEM images. For particles preparation, it was found that when increasing concentrations of PLA, the particles size of PLA increased {{as a result of the}} increased viscosity of polymer solution, causing larger droplets of spray, hence large particles formed. Upon varying the distance between a nozzle and a target plate, it was found that the spray distance did not affect the particle sizes. For tube fabrication, the polymer solution was atomized over the rotating shaft. The results showed the rotating shaft speed had no effects on the tube structure. The tubes could be successfully formed. The tube had <b>rough</b> surface without <b>holes.</b> When increasing the atomizing, the tube had rougher surface. To create porous structure of the tube, anti solvent was added to the polymer solution prior to spraying. The as-sprayed tube illustrated rough surface with network structures having porous-like scaffold structure due to the different evaporation rate between solvent and anti-solven...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: we have {{recently}} reported {{the presence of}} two potassium currents with 598 and 368 pS conductance in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) membrane. The 598 pS channel was voltage dependent and ATP sensitive. However, the 368 pS channel was rarely observed and its identity remained obscure. Since cationic channels in intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and RER play important roles in intracellular signaling and cellular protection, studying their biophysical and pharmacological properties is important. Methods: we used channel incorporation into bilayer lipid membrane method. L-α-Phosphatidylcholine (PC), a membrane lipid, was extracted from fresh egg yolk. Bilayer lipid membrane was formed in a 150 μm diameter <b>hole.</b> <b>Rough</b> endoplasmic reticulum vesicles were obtained from liver after homogenization and several centrifugations. All recordings were filtered at 1 kHz and stored at a sampling rate of 10 kHz for offline analysis by PClamp 9. Statistical analysis was performed based on Markov noise free single channel analysis. Results: A 364 pS potassium channel was identified which was voltage independent in + 50 to - 50 mV voltages. In all voltages, open probability (Po) was over 0. 9. Nonspecific inhibitor of K+ channels, 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP, 20 mM), inhibited the channel activity. However, intracellular nucleotide like ATP {{had no effect on}} channel gating. Conclusion: We observed a new potassium channel with 346 pS conductance in RER membrane that unlike the 598 pS K channel was not ATP sensitive. This channel may {{play an important role in}} Ca 2 + homeostasis and cell protection...|$|R
