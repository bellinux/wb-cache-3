The Squire then chooses a mentor, called a Sponsor, from one of the existing Rovers; the Sponsor's task is to guide the Squire in learning all the necessary Scouting skills and to aid the Squire in performing a service project as set out by the <b>Rover</b> Crew. Once the service project is completed the Squire can be invested as a fully fledged <b>Rover.</b>|$|E
