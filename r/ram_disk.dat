5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although {{there is no way to}} switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

25|$|The {{protected}} mode of the 80286 was not utilized until {{many years after}} its release, {{in part because of}} the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> driver included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. A DOS could utilize the additional RAM available in {{protected mode}} (extended memory) either via a BIOS call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk,</b> or as emulation of expanded memory. The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64kB segments, just like in real mode.|$|E

2500|$|Determining {{the number}} of {{directory}} entries per cluster is straight forward, each entry occupies 32 bytes, this results in 16 entries per sector for a sector size of 512 bytes. The DOS 5 RMDIR/RD command removes the initial [...] "." [...] (this directory) and [...] ".." [...] (parent directory) entries in subdirectories directly, therefore sector size 32 on a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> is possible for FAT12, but requires 2 or more sectors per cluster. A FAT12 boot sector without the DOS 4 extensions needs 29 bytes before the first unnecessary FAT16B 32-bit number of hidden sectors, this leaves three bytes for the (on a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> unused) boot code and the magic 0x55 0xAA {{at the end of}} all boot sectors. On Windows NT the smallest supported sector size is 128.|$|E
50|$|Internal RAM was 64K, {{of which}} a part could be {{reserved}} as <b>RAM</b> <b>disk.</b> An External <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> could be attached, creating a 120K <b>RAM</b> <b>disk,</b> leaving internal RAM as user BIOS and workspace.|$|E
50|$|The AmigaOS has a {{dynamically}} sized <b>RAM</b> <b>disk,</b> which resizes itself automatically {{to accommodate}} its contents. Starting with AmigaOS 2.x, operating system configuration files were {{loaded into the}} <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> on boot, greatly speeding operating system usage. Other files could be copied to the <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> like any standard device for quick modification and retrieval. Also beginning in AmigaOS 2.x, the <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> supported file-change notification, which was mostly used to monitor configuration files for changes.|$|E

50|$|Unlike most {{commercial}} <b>RAM</b> <b>disks,</b> EWF cannot {{reclaim the}} RAM after files have been deleted from it. In EWF RAM (and EWF RAM Reg) mode, the memory consumed only ever increases. Eventually {{the system will}} have no more free space and will crash.|$|R
50|$|The PX-8 did {{not have}} any {{internal}} disk drive, and instead allowed either memory to be partitioned into application memory and a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk,</b> or an external 60 KB or 120 KB intelligent <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> module to be attached (64K and 128K internally but some used for the processor). The intelligent <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> module had its own Z80 processor with a backup battery.|$|E

5000|$|Software can [...] "partition" [...] {{a portion}} of a computer's RAM, {{allowing}} it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called a <b>RAM</b> <b>disk.</b> A <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> loses the stored data when the computer is shut down, unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source.|$|E
50|$|Starting with AmigaOS 1.3, {{there is}} also a fixed-capacity {{recoverable}} <b>RAM</b> <b>disk,</b> which functions as a standard <b>RAM</b> <b>disk</b> but can maintain its contents on soft restart. It is commonly called the RAD disk after its default device name, and it {{can be used as a}} boot disk (with boot sector). Previously, a recoverable <b>RAM</b> <b>disk,</b> commonly called the ASDG RRD or VD0, was introduced in 1987; at first, it was locked to ASDG expansion memory products. Later, the ASDG RRD was added to the Fred Fish series of freeware, shareware, and public domain software (disks 58 and 241).|$|E
