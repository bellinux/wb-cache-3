50|$|This {{is an easy}} {{species to}} <b>rear,</b> <b>feeding</b> on fresh privet, ivy or bramble. They need {{to be kept in}} a cage around 25 cm in height to allow for {{successful}} moulting. Females will lay eggs shortly after reaching adulthood, at the rate of several per night. These can be hatched by keeping them on dry paper towel, or in a dry dish. Eggs can take four months to hatch, depending on many factors, including temperature. This is species number one on the Phasmid Study Group Culture List.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler breeder pullets were {{subjected}} to photostimulation (PS) at either 14, 17, or 20 wk of age after attaining greater than recommended BW during rearing {{in order to determine}} effects on age at onset of lay, egg weight, and egg production. During <b>rearing,</b> <b>feed</b> was consumed ad libitum (AL) or provided in allotments resulting in growth to projected BW of 2. 8 (heavy, HV) or 2. 3 kg (light, LT) at 20 wk. <b>Rearing</b> period <b>feeding</b> and age at PS treatments made up a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement. A single restricted feeding program was provided during lay. Although age at first egg in the AL treatment was earlier than in HV and LT treatments, total production by HV and LT birds was greater because peak and postpeak production by AL birds were depressed. Relative to PS at 20 wk, PS at 14 and 17 wk advanced age at first egg and increased cumulative production to 30 wk. However, early PS decreased peak production and, therefore, did not affect total production. Mean egg weight and settable egg production (egg weight> 50 g) were increased in HV and LT treatments. Egg weight and settable egg production were not affected by age at PS. These results indicate that the onset of lay by broiler breeders can be advanced by early PS and that increased BW facilitates this. However, allowing greater BW during rearing does not compensate for reduced early egg weights and results in decreased total production and mean egg weights when feed is provided at recommended levels during lay.

40|$|The {{importance}} of main-stem rivers and major tributaries to endangered Colorado River fishes is well documented, but {{the use and}} significance of small tributary streams remains poorly understood. Historically, these fishes probably used smaller tributaries for spawning, <b>rearing,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and refuge. Currently, the proliferation of nonnative species and altered flows may have affected tributary use by endangered fishes. In February 2008 and 2009, we installed a PIT-tag passive interrogation array (PIA) in the San Rafael River, Utah, approximately 2 km upstream from the confluence with the Green River, and another PIA approximately 60 km upstream from the Green River confluence. Using passive detections and active captures in the San Rafael River from 2008 to 2010, we detected 15 Colorado Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius, 16 Bonytails Gila elegans, 20 Razorback Suckers Xyrauchen texanus, and five “undocumented” fish. Several endangered fishes were detected on multiple occasions and across years, often moving {{into and out of}} the San Rafael River from distances up to 360 km away (range, 6 – 360 km).

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} using 144 day-old chicks of Arabian strain village chicken {{to determine the effect}} of dietary protein and energy ratios in starter diets with dehydrated food waste, superworms and unfertilized eggs on growth performance in closed confinement system. Dehydrated food waste was the main energy source, superworms and unfertilized eggs were the main protein sources. Six experimental diets were formulated to have 3 energy to protein ratios (134, 150 and 164) with 150 energy to protein ratio as the control [...] Every ratio had two different protein sources with the same inclusion level. Each treatment had 2 replicates with 12 birds each in a complete randomized design. Feed and water were provided ad libitum from 0 - 42 d. Proximate analysis of the main ingredients in the diet showed dehydrated food waste had 4, 500. 54 kcal/kg of gross energy and 25. 18 % of crude protein while superworms and unfertilized eggs had crude protein of 46. 54 and 46. 33 %, respectively. The study showed that a single diet of energy:protein ratio of 134 kcal ME/kg protein supported optimum growth rate of Arabian strain village chicken from 1 to 42 d of <b>rearing.</b> <b>Feed</b> conversion ratio improved with increasing dietary energy level.

Groups of fecunded and non-fecunded females were studied. The ovarioles showed four developing stages during egg production, morphologically alike for fecunded and non-fecunded females, but differing in the duration {{time of the}} stages. Each ovarium has 24 ovarioles on average, less than any other species known into the genus, and all ovarioles are physiologically active at each oviposition.

Fecunded and non-fecunded females showed a similar preoviposition period, but longer than any other species known into the genus. The interoviposition period is shorter among fecunded females than non-fecunded and among other species of the genus. The number of ovipositions and eggs per oviposition and the daily oviposition rate are higher among fecunded females than non-fecunded and any other species of the genus. Differing from other Coccinellidae species, the mean eggs width do not change {{between the first and second}} ovipositions. The eggs handling decrease the larvae viability.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} with Nicholas parent-stock turkey breeder hens {{was designed to}} determine the effects of feed restnction during the rearing period and age at photostimulation on reproductive performance. Hens reared on ad libitum intake of conventional corn-soybean diets (ad libitum), skip- 1 -day per week (skip- 1 -day), and 95 % of ad libitum (95 %) were placed into cages and photostimulated when they reached a target body weight of 10 kg or at the conventional age of 29 wk. A 3 x 2 factorial design was used, with five replicates of three hens for each treatment. All birds were fed for ad libitum access during the breeding period. More eggs were set from 95 % birds than from ad libitum or skip- 1 -day birds (P< 05); there was no difference between ad libitum and skip- 1 -day birds. Photostimnlafing based on 10 kg of BW versus 29 wk of age had no effect on total eggs set. There was no effect of <b>rearing</b> <b>feed</b> restriction on fertility or hatchability. Photostimulating based on 10 kg rather than 29 wk of age reduced fertility and hatchability (P< 05). The results of this study indicate that optimum reproductive performance is attained by restricting the feed consumption of turkey breeder hens to 95 % of ad libitum during the rearing period. No benefits were gained from photostimulating at 10 kg of BW versus 29 wk of age. (Key words: feed restriction, photostimulation, age, reproduction, turkey breeder hens...|$|R
