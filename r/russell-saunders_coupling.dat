Absolute stabilization of the laser's frequency (or wavelength) as fine as 2.5 parts in 1011 can be obtained through use of an iodine absorption cell.The mechanism producing population inversion and light amplification in a HeNe laser plasma originates with inelastic collision of energetic electrons with ground state helium atoms in the gas mixture.

5000|$|Houston {{began his}} college {{education}} in 1916 at Ohio State University (OSU) where {{he earned his}} baccalaureate degree in physics. He {{served in the military}} during 1918 and 1919. After teaching physics at the University of Dubuque for one year, he entered graduate studies at the University of Chicago and studied under Albert A. Michelson, who had won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907, and Robert Millikan who would win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923 for his measurement of the charge on the electron and for his work on the photoelectric effect. It was at this time that Houston began his experimental work on the fine structure of hydrogen. In 1922, he returned to Ohio State, where he was an instructor in physics and studied spectroscopy under A. D. Cole. Houston was granted his Ph.D. in 1925, after which he went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) on a National Research Fellowship, largely because Millikan had left Chicago for Caltech in 1922. At Caltech Houston continued his work in spectroscopy and making improvements in Fabry-Pérot interferometry. At Caltech, he taught a spectroscopy course out of Atombau und Spektrallinien, which became the “bible” of atomic theory for the new generation of physicists who developed atomic and quantum physics. In 1927 and 1928, Houston was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which he used to go to Germany to do postgraduate study with Arnold Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich and Werner Heisenberg at the University of Leipzig. Also studying with Sommerfeld concurrently with Houston were Carl Eckart, Edwin C. Kemble, and Rudolf Peierls. At that time, the winter semester of 1927, Sommerfeld, in his special lectures, treated the theory of electrons in metals for the first time. As a course of study, Sommerfeld suggested to Houston that he investigate the mean free path of electrons and its relationship to resistance in metals as a function of temperature. Sommerfeld showed Houston the proof of a paper soon be published on the subject of Fermi statistics applied to phenomena in metals. Houston’s work on the subject was published in a paper coauthored with Sommerfeld and Eckart. [...] After spending the winter semester of 1927 with Sommerfeld, Houston went to spend the spring semester of 1928 with Heisenberg in Leipzig. There, he studied the spin-orbit interaction in two-electron spectra. Houston was able to show the transition from <b>Russell-Saunders</b> <b>coupling</b> to jj-coupling in two-electron systems and its influence on the Zeeman effect.

40|$|Spin Orbit Coupling (SOC) is {{introduced}} to molecular ab initio density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In the presented scheme, one first approximates the electronic ground {{state and a}} number of excited states of the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Hamiltonian with the aid of the DMRG algorithm. Owing to the spin-adaptation of the algorithm, the total spin S is a good quantum number for these states. After the non-relativistic DMRG calculation is finished, all magnetic sublevels of the calculated states are constructed explicitly, and the SOC operator is expanded in the resulting basis. To this end, spin orbit coupled energies and wavefunctions are obtained as eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the full Hamiltonian matrix which is composed of the SOC operator matrix and the BO Hamiltonian matrix. This treatment corresponds to a quasi-degenerate perturbation theory approach and can be regarded as the molecular equivalent to atomic <b>Russell-Saunders</b> <b>coupling.</b> For the evaluation of SOC matrix elements, the full Breit-Pauli SOC Hamiltonian is approximated by the widely used spin-orbit mean field operator. This operator allows for an efficient use of the second quantized triplet replacement operators that are readily generated during the non-relativistic DMRG algorithm, together with the Wigner-Eckart theorem. With a set of spin-orbit coupled wavefunctions at hand, the molecular g-tensors are calculated following the scheme proposed by Gerloch and McMeeking. It interprets the effective molecular g-values as the slope of the energy difference between the lowest Kramers pair with respect to the strength of the applied magnetic field.

40|$|With the {{development}} of the quantum mechanics it has become evident that the factors mainly responsible for chemical valence are the Pauli exclusion principle and the Heisenberg-Dirac resonance phenomenon. It has been shown {{that in the case of}} two hydrogen atoms in the normal state brought near each other the eigenfunction which is symmetric in the positional coordinates of the two electrons corresponds to a potential which causes the two atoms to combine to form a molecule. This potential is due mainly to a resonance effect which may be interpreted as involving an interchange in position of the two electrons forming the bond, so that each electron is partially associated with one nucleus and partially with the other. The so-calculated heat of dissociation, moment of inertia, and oscillational frequency of the hydrogen molecule are in approximate agreement with experiment. London has recently suggested that the interchange energy of two electrons, one belonging to each of two atoms, is the energy of the non-polar bond in general. He has shown that an antisymmetric (and hence allowed) eigenfunction symmetric in the coordinates of two electrons can occur only if originally the spin of each electron were not paired with that of another electron in the same atom. The number of electrons with such unpaired spins in an atom is, in the case of <b>Russell-Saunders</b> <b>coupling,</b> equal to 2 s, where s is the resultant spin quantum number, and is closely connected with the multiplicity, 2 s + 1, of the spectral term. This is also the number of electrons capable of forming non-polar bonds.

40|$|Many {{applications}} of plasma physics {{are related to}} light generation. The applications range from TL-tubes until the latest flat displays. The size of discharges is decreasing further and further. At this moment the typical dimensions of a plasma display panel cell are {{in the order of}} 100 µm. A model has been developed in the plasma group at Eindhoven to describe these microdischarges [1]. To verify and further improve the model experimental data is needed. Therefore diagnostic tools for this kind of discharge are developed. A laser absorption technique has already been developed by Tachibana et. al. [2]. The diagnostic gives a good insight of the temporal and spatial evolution of metastable xenon in this kind of microdischarge. The diagnostic discussed in this paper tries to use these metastables to measure the electric field. In figure 1 the scheme is depicted. In this scheme the two metastable levels, two resonant levels and the emission dip spectroscopy (e-dip) scheme is illustrated. The e-dip spectroscopy is based on the scheme used e. g. by Döbele et. al. [3] to measure electric field strengths in hydrogen and helium discharges. Xenon is a rare atom and has a closed shell structure in the ground state described in Russell-Saunders notation as 1 S 0. Exciting one electron out of this structure will leave an inner ion core. This core can have two possible configurations according to <b>Russell-Saunders</b> <b>coupling,</b> 2 P 3 / 2 or the 2 P 1 / 2 configuration. Racah notation is used to describe the excited levels. 6 s[3 / 2] 2 says that the outer electron is excited to the 6 s shell. There is no prime so the inner core has 2 P 3 / 2 configuration. The angular momentum of the outer electron is coupled with the total angular momentum of the core resulting in 3 / 2 + 0 = 3 / 2. The total angular momentum is now 3 / 2 + 1 / 2 (spin) = 2. The transition from 6 p[3 / 2] 2 to 6 s[3 / 2] 2 at 823. 2 nm is one of the strongest lines in the xenon spectrum. In this diagnostic we will excite some {{of the population of the}} 6 p[3 / 2] 2 level to a rydberg state. This will result in dips in the 823. 2 line. This e-dip spectroscopy is based on the known stark spectrum as function of electric field strength. To study the feasibility a dielectric barrier discharge is used and a very good spatial resolution is not needed. The first part of this paper the experimental set-up will be discussed. Limits of this method and development in the near future are discussed in the second part...|$|E
