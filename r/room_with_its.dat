5|$|An {{interior}} rearrangement {{was completed}} around 1942. The women's {{room for the}} main waiting room was moved from the east side to the west side, with one bay added to the west wing. A new dining area was constructed, occupying one-third of the waiting <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> kitchen occupying the former bathroom space. The lunch cafe and staircases were also modified.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} of the keep has been {{restored}} to its early 20th-century appearance as a barracks room. The second floor was redeveloped in the late 19th century to form another barracks <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> ceiling incorporating additional early 20th-century girders and concrete to support the gun battery above it. The roof of the keep has two 12-pounder gun mounts with their original gun-lockers; there is a 12-pounder gun on display originally used on a Royal Naval vessel. The keep's roof would originally have been flat, with crenellations for artillery, but both the roof and crenellations were removed in the 1770s.|$|E
5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black with curves in many directions. The room had black and white zebra-patterned wallpaper, {{in the style of}} New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor {{waterfall}} surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the Vermilion <b>Room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small front room was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings.|$|E

50|$|In 2003, {{anticipating the}} 2004 Summer Olympic Games, Hilton Athens was renovated by Greek architects Alexandros Tombazis and Charis Bougadelis. The {{establishment}} was refurbished, {{and a new}} seven-storey northern wing was added. The completed new wing contains 74 rooms and suites, which {{add up to a}} total of 506 available hotel <b>rooms.</b> <b>With</b> <b>its</b> current 15 floors above ground, the building is 65 meters high.|$|R
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{extension}} has {{the same}} half-timber and stucco exterior as the original structure, also complementing the Law Park pavilion to form one complex. The extension houses an elevator between the basement and two above-ground floors. The first floor has a circulation desk of cherry- and caramel-stained wood with a granite countertop. It was sold to the library by craftsman and village resident Leonard Rerek at a significant discount. The first floor also includes a teen center with computers and a breakout room, {{as well as a}} children's <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own breakout room. The second floor holds the adult fiction, non-fiction, and reference collections, as well as four computers, library offices, and a partitionable program room seating up to 80 people. The extension's interior was designed by architect, village resident, and library board member Catherine Bukard. The exterior was designed by Lothrop Associates.|$|E
5|$|The old Sky <b>Room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> {{spectacular}} 360-degree view reopened in 1999 as the James Edgar Hervey Skyroom, {{in honor}} of alumnus James Edgar Hervey, Class of 1950, a prominent San Diego trial lawyer. It {{is used as a}} space for student study by day (no alcohol allowed) and is available for special events in the evenings. Other floors of the building hold offices, apartments and residential conveniences. The mezzanine level contains a compact fitness center, the third and fourth floors contain classrooms and offices for political action groups and legal assistance organizations, and the 22nd and 23rd floors hold publishing headquarters for a number of scholarly journals.|$|E

50|$|The hotel had 440 guest <b>rooms,</b> each <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own shower bath. Guest suites had {{a sitting}} room, dining room, bath, {{and up to}} seven bedrooms. The hotel's 500 {{residential}} guest apartments each had its own kitchenette, dining room, and drawing <b>room</b> <b>with</b> fireplace. Some had as many as 11 rooms, and up to five baths.|$|R
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception <b>Room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
25|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} built in red brick by Robert Adam between 1771 and 1778 for Lord Apsley, the Lord Chancellor, {{who gave the}} house its name. Some Adam interiors survive: the semi-circular Staircase, the Drawing <b>Room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> apsidal end, and the Portico Room, behind the giant Corinthian portico added by Wellington.|$|E
50|$|Outside was {{the palace}} of Moctezuma <b>with</b> 100 <b>rooms,</b> each <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own bath, for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. Also located nearby was the cuicalli, or house of the songs, and the calmecac.|$|R
50|$|For this purpose, the {{hospital}} has conditioned a student {{area on the}} 6th floor, with over 60 bunkbeds divided into 12 <b>rooms</b> (each <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own toilet and shower), a TV room, lockers and study rooms. Further improvements are expected soon.|$|R
5000|$|Inveresk Lodge Garden is a {{hillside}} garden, {{composed of a}} series of garden <b>rooms,</b> each <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own season and theme. Many of the plants have been recognised by the Royal Horticultural Society with an [...] "Award of Garden Merit".|$|R
25|$|The {{works of}} art {{continue}} through the common <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> portrait of a prelate attributed to Lorenzo Lotto. The Drawing Room today displays a collection of blue Chinese ceramics with examples from the Han dynasty circa 206 BC, to the Qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1911. This room contains the painting of the Madonna and Child with St. John by Andrea del Sarto of 1520.|$|E
25|$|The large main waiting <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> floral and Greek Revival motifs in tiled {{stained glass}} by Louis Comfort Tiffany set atop bands of pale cement, is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} finest in the U.S. aesthetically. The terminal exterior extends to over four stories and has a distinguished copper-clad façade with ornate detailing. Its single-story base is constructed of rusticated Indiana limestone. A grand double stair with decorative cast-iron railings within the main waiting room provides an entrance to the upper-level ferry concourse.|$|E
25|$|Work on the {{interiors}} {{came to a}} halt when the building's fabric was completed. Not until the 1730s was the first phase of interior work carried out, including a palace chapel in the attic designed by the Swedish architect Carl Hårleman. The interiors at Strömsholm Palace are largely Gustavian in style. In 1766 the heir to the Swedish throne, later King Gustav III, married Princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. As a wedding present from the Riksdag of the Estates, she was given Strömsholm Palace. Extensive interior works commenced, under the architectural direction of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and continued into the 19th century. The queen's bedchamber {{is a prime example of}} Swedish interior design from the start of the Gustavian era, as well as the Chinese dining <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> fabric-covered walls with Chinese style paintings done by the renowned tapestry painter Lars Bolander.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thought of}} my wanderings since then became poignant, almost terrifying. The <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> all <b>its</b> memories, was unchanged. How safe I had been within its walls! Why could I not have been, content with what it represented? of tradition, of custom,--of religion? And what was it within me that had lured me away from these? ...|$|R
25|$|Accessed from a double-loaded corridor, Floors 2 through 18 were {{sleeping}} rooms, {{arranged in a}} square doughnut formation. A central light well was built into the hotel, extending from the lobby {{to the top of}} the building.

500|$|The Ritz's {{most widely}} known {{facility}} is the Palm Court, an opulently decorated cream-coloured Louis XVI setting. It {{is decorated with}} lavish furnishings, including gilded Louis XVI armchairs with oval backs, which the architects had designed based on research into French neo-classical furniture design of the 1760s and 1770s, which were made by Waring and Gillow. The <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its,</b> [...] "panelled mirrors of bevelled glass in gilt bronze frames" [...] and [...] "high coving ornamented with gilded trellis-work", according to [...] Montgomery-Massingberd and Watkin [...] "epitomizes the elegantly frivolous comfort of Edwardian high life".|$|E
500|$|Memling {{left out}} the rays of light, as did Dieric Bouts in his Getty Annunciation, yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a fenestra incarnationis, {{which would have been}} an {{adequate}} symbol for the contemporary viewer. By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light. Memling's <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> window through which light streams, is a most [...] "decorous sign of Mary's chastity", according to Blum. There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, yet her consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.|$|E
500|$|Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake, {{also known}} as Self-Portrait, is an 1889 oil on wood {{painting}} by French artist Paul Gauguin, which represents his late Brittany period in the fishing village of Le Pouldu in northwestern France. No longer comfortable with Pont-Aven, Gauguin moved on to Le Pouldu with his friend and student Meijer de Haan and {{a small group of}} artists. He stayed for several months in the autumn of 1889 and the summer of 1890, where the group spent their time decorating the interior of Marie Henry's inn with every major type of art work. Gauguin painted his Self-Portrait [...] in the dining <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> companion piece, [...] Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan (1889).|$|E

500|$|Von Neumann {{liked to}} eat and drink; his wife, Klara, {{said that he could}} count {{everything}} except calories. He enjoyed Yiddish and [...] "off-color" [...] humor (especially limericks). He was a non-smoker. At Princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his gramophone, which distracted those in neighboring offices, including Albert Einstein, from their work. Von Neumann did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in. He never used it, preferring the couple's living <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> television playing loudly. Despite being a notoriously bad driver, he nonetheless enjoyed driving—frequently while reading a book—occasioning numerous arrests, as well as accidents. When Cuthbert Hurd hired him as a consultant to IBM, Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets.|$|E
500|$|Describing it as a [...] "pop fluff" [...] song, Simon Price of The Independent {{wrote that}} [...] "there's always a {{suggestion}} of something interesting going on behind those glitter-encrusted eyes". NME Ben Patashnik applauded the song's suggestive nature; [...] "'So Happy I Could Die' perfectly evokes {{the feeling of being}} alone in a crowded <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> icy beats, suggesting Gaga takes refuge in masturbation as the only way to retain control." [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was declared as the twenty-seventh best Lady Gaga song by Rolling Stone, who concluded: [...] "Gaga exults in the pleasures of club-hopping, drinking and bi-curiosity." [...] Under the Radar columnist Nick Hyman avouched that [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] was an uninspiring track, while Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that Gaga's vocals were the worst out of any of her songs. [...] "It's a bit of a disappointment, too, because for someone who is so painfully deliberate in crafting their unique visual image, it’s a let down to see that some of that quality control couldn’t be applied to the song selection that will ultimately define their legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the Whole <b>Room!</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E
50|$|Nickelodeon: Outta Control was {{a former}} {{attraction}} in conjunction with Nickelodeon in the Cred Street (Now Cloud Cuckoo Land) area of Alton Towers theme park, Staffordshire, England.
