5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in <b>reality.</b> <b>The</b> latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E

30|$|Images {{produce a}} reality of their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged reality of ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ reality in works of art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning of the image is perceived as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> image. From an epistemological perspective, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> image and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> image with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point of view, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> image is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. The multitude of experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses {{to the meaning of}} the image. <b>The</b> inherent, experiential <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> image is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical <b>reality</b> (<b>the</b> brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality.

5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly <b>reality.</b> <b>The</b> design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E
5000|$|Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi had {{originally}} declared <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> Quran (haqiqat-i quran) and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> Ka'ba (haqiqat-i ka'ba-yi rabbani) {{to be above}} <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of Muhammad (haqiqat-i Muhammadi). This caused fury of opposition, particularly among certain sufis and ulama of Hijaz who objected to the Ka'ba having exalted spiritual [...] "rank" [...] than the Prophet. Sirhindi argued in response that <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> Prophet is superior to any creature. The real Ka'ba is worthy of prostration since it is not created and is covered with the veil of nonexistence. It is this Ka'ba in the essence of God that Sirhindi was referring to as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of <b>the</b> Ka'ba, not {{the appearance of the}} Ka'ba (surat-i ka'ba), which is only a stone. By {{the latter part of the}} nineteenth century, the consensus of the Naqshbandi community had placed <b>the</b> prophetic <b>realities</b> closer to God than <b>the</b> divine <b>realities.</b> <b>The</b> rationale for this development may have been to neutralize unnecessary discord with the large Muslim community whose emotional attachment to Muhammad was greater than any understanding of philosophical fine points.|$|R

5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury {{there were only two}} guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in <b>reality</b> <b>the</b> Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the assumption}} that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the Taylor administration's {{definitive}} accomplishment {{in foreign}} policy was the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, regarding a proposed inter-oceanic canal through Central America. While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, {{and the construction of}} such a canal was decades away from <b>reality,</b> <b>the</b> mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position. For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua. The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.|$|E

The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E
