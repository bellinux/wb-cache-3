Clearly, subscription lists for Shepard’s products are declining as online usage grows. Attrition has been steepest in large law firms, where relatively junior associates conduct {{a great deal of}} citations research online. Attrition has been less steep in libraries and small firms where attorneys who prefer print continue to do their research. For many years, attrition in academic law libraries was relatively low. Many law school libraries continued to retain relatively substantial collections of Shepard’s in print. In recent years, attrition has increased—especially in law schools that no longer teach their students how to Shepardize in print. But because many law school libraries {{are open to the public}} (or at least to graduates of the school), including practicing attorneys in the communities they serve, a typical law school library continues to retain at least a basic collection of Shepard’s print products....After Shepard’s became a part of LexisNexis, we totally redesigned the way we process case law and citations. The multi-million-dollar Citations Redesign (CR) project was intended to eliminate duplication and allow us to deliver current, accurate information unmatched by our competition. The ability to produce Shepard’s print pages quickly and efficiently was built into the CR requirements—another factor contributing to the continuing viability of Shepard’s in print.|$|R
40|$|What {{happened}} to the doctrine of natural right in the nineteenth century? We know that it flourished in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. We know that something like it - the doctrine of human rights and new forms of social contract theory - flourished again {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century and continues to flourish in the twenty-first. In between there was a period of decline and hibernation - uneven, to be sure, and never complete - but a period in which to invoke natural right was always to invite intellectual ridicule and accusations of political irresponsibility. Thus article asks: How far can the decline of natural right in the nineteenth century be attributed to the reaction against the revolution in France? How far it was the effect of independent streams of thought, like positivism and historicism? Why was radical thought so ambivalent about natural right throughout the nineteenth century, and why was socialist thought in particular inclined to turn its back on i? As a framework for thought, natural right suffered a radical decline in the social and political sciences. But things were not so clear in jurisprudence, and natural right lived on to a much <b>riper</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> in the writings of some prominent economists. So we have to ask: What is it about this theory that allowed it to survive in these environments, when so much of the rest of intellectual endeavor in the nineteenth century was toxic or inhospitable to it. Finally, I shall ask how far American thought represents an exception to all of this. Why and to what extent did the doctrine survive as a way of thinking in the United States, long after it had lost its credibility elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|<b>Old</b> <b>age</b> {{has many}} images, {{with the one}} of a crisis regaining momentum. While images of {{activity}} and opportunity gained ground during recent decades, this trend now seems to reverse. The current economic crisis drains the financial resources of older people, which increases <b>old</b> <b>age</b> poverty. Moreover, governments react to the double-pressure of economic crises and population ageing through budget cuts, which reduces support systems for older people. It, moreover, centers public discourses more strongly on social problems associated with <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Both developments underline the needs associated with <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and draw our {{attention away from the}} potentials of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> In other words, they bring discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age</b> back to the topic of crises. This working paper discusses how the economic crisis affects older people, how governments, labour markets, and families react to the double-pressure of population ageing and economic crisis, and how individuals perceive their <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> It concludes with reflections on the implications of growing crisis-centrism in discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Such crisis-centrism can lead us to overlook social inequalities in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and to neglect the subjective character of the perception of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> The public image of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> might, thus, be stronger associated with the idea of crisis than what older people’s lived experience suggests...|$|R

40|$|Background/Purpose: Measures {{to prevent}} the {{development}} of muscle mass decline should be initiated from midlife. However, the impact of physical activity at midlife on muscle mass in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> remains uncertain. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} whether physical activity at midlife influences muscle mass and physical performance in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Methods: A total of 272 Japanese women aged 65 years and older were enrolled in the study. Information about physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> were collected using a retrospective questionnaire. We calculated the skeletal muscle mass index in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and recorded the participants' walking speed and hand grip strength in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> We then classified the participants into four groups according to their physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and conducted multiple linear regression analysis to determine whether the physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> were associated with skeletal muscle mass index and physical performance in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Results: The participants in the groups that were physically inactive at midlife had a significantly lower skeletal muscle mass index in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> than those who were physically active at midlife (p <  0. 01). Participants in the groups that were physically inactive in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> also had significantly slower walking speeds at <b>old</b> <b>age</b> than those who were physically active (p <  0. 01). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age and body mass index.
