Maxi-mum powers of 3. 83 mW and 23. 35 mW may be set as input to the proposed ingestible antenna in order to guarantee compliance with the IEEE C 95. 1 - 1999 and IEEE C 95. 1 - 2005 safety standards, respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} practical {{method for}} the electromagnetic (EM) fields reduction around transmitting stations has been developed. The {{project has been}} stimulated by the necessity to reduce the field levels {{in the vicinity of}} transmitting stations, including FM, UHF, cellular base stations and other <b>radiocommunication</b> <b>services,</b> to obey regulations concerning human protection against electromagnetic radiation. The main constraint in the optimization procedure is the requirement to preserve the radiated power ERP of a service in operation. The method joins accuracy with high efficiency, and is based on 3 stages procedure using the antenna numerical models of different levels of approximation. An example is given of its application to a real case of transmitting stations in which the levels of measured EM exceeded the safety limits...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY High {{capacity}} {{cellular mobile}} <b>radiocommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Europe and in North America have set extremely demanding minimization interference {{targets for the}} involved operating systems, {{in order to keep}} spectrum efficiency in high levels. The evaluation of the conditional cochannei interference probability remains a very interesting scientific area and a major concern in mobile communications. Therefore the evaluation is strongly needed to maintain thr rerquired transmission quality level, to control the spectrum efficiency, to optimize the design criteria and to predict the signai-to-interference ratio in different cellular systems. In this paper, a new mathematical method is presented suitable for the exact exact evaluation o f the outage probability of this type of intereference under specific considerations concerning the existing mobile's propagation environment. Using this prototype method, a high level of probability's accuracy is obtained especially in the worst cases, where the received signai is degraded due to the presence of radio-shadowing phenomena. ...|$|R
40|$|This Report has {{aimed at}} {{providing}} deeper {{insight into the}} theory and practices of spectrum refarming. As such {{it could be used}} as a guide by Administrations on spectrum refarming and spectrum trading bearing in mind that the implementation of refarming and spectrum trading processes remains a strictly national issue. The Report has described the technical developments of the use of radio and has indicated how radiocommunications technology and use have changed during the recent decades. Furthermore the current regulatory regime including the EU package of Directives has been described. The main theme has been the introduction of refarming and secondary trading as a part of the overall spectrum management activities. In addition to the theoretical aspects of refarming the practical instruments of refarming and spectrum trading have been investigated and the current experiences and state of the art within CEPT countries and in non-CEPT countries provides an indication in which direction this issue will develop. It is expected that refarming of frequency bands involving some sort of forced withdrawal of frequency assignments might be a process that some countries may have to employ in the future, when frequencies have to be made available for the introduction of new <b>radiocommunication</b> <b>services.</b> Below is an overview of the conclusions on spectrum refarming, spectrum trading and on the current experience o...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-R) is to ensure rational, equitable, efficient and economical use of the radio-frequency spectrum by all <b>radiocommunication</b> <b>services,</b> including those using satellite orbits. ITU-R held its Radiocommunication Assembly (RA- 07) in Geneva, 15 - 19 October 2007. A major outcome was the change of Study Group (SG) structure by {{reducing the number of}} SGs from seven to six, for example creating one large new SG (SG 5) on terrestrial services by merging fixed and mobile services, previously SGs 9 and 8, respectively. RA- 07 also decided to include a sixth terrestrial air interface in the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) family by including the OFDMA TDD WMAN technology, a WiMAX derived technology. Mobile telecommunications were at centre stage at this RA as the Assembly adopted flexibility by choosing IMT as the root name for IMT collectively. IMT- 2000 technologies as well as coming evolutions of the future IMT are now referred to as IMT. This had a major consequence for the following World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 07) as spectrum both previously allocated to IMT- 2000 and future allocations to IMT-Advanced in the Radio Regulations (RR) will now be collectively referred to as IMT. The ITU-R and its RAs play a major role for the development of global radiocommunications and make very important decisions for international telecommunications business. Terje Tjelta i...|$|R
