[...] University of Washington, 2011 The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to identify how nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and flame stability (blowout) are impacted by the use of fuels that are alternatives to typical pipeline natural gas. The research focuses on lean, premixed combustors that are typically used in state-of-the-art natural gas fueled systems. An idealized laboratory lean premixed combustor, specifically the jet-stirred reactor, is used for experimental data. A series of models, including those featuring detailed fluid dynamics and those focusing on detailed chemistry, are used to interpret the data and understand the underlying chemical kinetic reasons for differences in emissions between the various fuel blends. An ultimate goal is to use these data and interpretive tools to develop a way to predict the emission and stability impacts of changing fuels within practical combustors. All experimental results are obtained from a high intensity, single-jet stirred reactor (JSR). Five fuel categories are studied: (1) pure H 2, (2) process and refinery gas, including combinations of H 2, CH 4, C 2 H 6, and C 3 H 8, (3) oxygen blown gasified coal/petcoke composed of H 2, CO, and CO 2, (4) landfill and digester gas composed of CH 4, CO 2, and N 2, and (5) liquified natural gas (LNG) /shale/associated gases composed of CH 4, C 2 H 6, and C 3 H 8. NOx measurements are taken at a nominal combustion temperature of 1800 K, atmospheric pressure, and a reactor residence time of 3 ms. This is done to focus the results on differences caused by fuel chemistry by comparing all fuels at a common temperature, pressure, and residence time. This {{is one of the few}} studies in the literature that attempts to remove these effects when studying fuels varying in composition. Additionally, the effects of changing temperature and residence time are investigated for selected fuels. At the nominal temperature and residence time, the experimental and modeling results show the following trends for NOx emissions as a function of fuel type: 1.) NOx emissions decrease with increasing H 2 fuel fraction for combustion of CH 4 /H 2 blends. This appears to be caused by a reduction in the amount of NO made by the prompt pathway involving the reaction of N 2 with hydrocarbon radicals as the CH 4 is replaced by H 2. 2.) For category 2 (the process and <b>refinery</b> <b>blend)</b> and category 5 (the LNG, shale, and associated gases), NOx emissions increase with the addition of C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons. This could be due to an increased production of free radicals resulting from increasing CO production when higher molecular weight hydrocarbons are broken down. 3.) For category 3 (the O 2 blown gasified coal/petcoke), NOx emissions increase with increasing CO fuel fraction. The reason for this is attributed to CO producing more radicals per unit heat release than H 2. When CO replaces H 2, an increase in NOx emissions is seen due to an increase in the productivity of the N 2 O, NNH, and Zeldovich pathways. 4.) For category 4 (the landfill gas) the addition of diluents such as CO 2 and N 2 at constant air flow produces more NOx per kg of CH 4 consumed, and N 2 is more effective than CO 2 in increasing the NOx emission index. The increase in emission index appears to be due to an enhancement of the prompt NOx pathway as the diluents are added and the mixture moves towards stoichiometric. In addition, the presence of CO 2 as a diluent catalyzes the loss of flame radicals, leading to less NOx formation than when an equivalent amount of N 2 is used as a diluent. For a selected set of fuels, detailed spacial reactor probing is carried out. At the nominal temperature and residence time, the experimental results show the following trends for flame structure as a function of fuel type: 1.) Pure H 2 is far more reactive in comparison to CH 4 and all other pure alkane fuels. This results in relatively flat NOx and temperature profiles; whereas, the alkane fuels drop in both temperature and NOx production in the jet, where more fresh reactor feed gases are present. 2.) For category 2 (the Process and Refinery blends), H 2 addition increases reactivity in the jet while decreasing overall NOx emissions. The increased reactivity is especially evident in the CO profiles where the fuels blended with C 2 H 6 and H 2 have CO peaks on jet centerline and CO emissions for pure CH 4 peaks slightly off centerline. 3.) For category 3 (the O 2 blown gasified coal/petcoke), the temperature profiles for the gasification blend and pure H 2 are nearly identical, which is likely due to the high reactivity of H 2 dominating the relatively low reactivity of CO. Despite a small temperature difference, the addition of CO causes an increase in NOx production. 4.) For category 4 (the landfill gas), the temperature profiles are virtually indistinguishable. However, the addition of diluent decreases reactivity and spreads out the reaction zone with the CO concentration peaking at 2 mm off of centerline instead of 1 mm. Diluent addition increases NOx production in comparison to pure CH 4 for reasons explained above. 5.) For category 5 (the LNG, shale, and associated gases), the temperature profiles are all very similar. The increased reactivity of C 2 H 6 is evident from looking at the CO profiles. Increased C 2 H 6 promotes CO production on jet centerline which is indicative of the hydrocarbon material breaking down earlier in the jet. At temperatures and residence times other than the nominal conditions, the experimental results show the following trends: 1,) The NOx emissions from LPM combustion of pure CH 4, H 2, C 2 H 6, and C 3 H 8 are shown to vary linearly with residence time and in an Arrhenius fashion with temperature. This occurs because (1) more reaction time leads to more NOx formation, and (2) NOx formation is a strong, non-linear function of temperature. 2.) The addition of both H 2 and C 2 H 6 to a LPM CH 4 flame is effective at extending its lean blowout limit. The results of both two and three dimensional CFD simulations are presented to illustrate the general flow, temperature, and species structure within the reactor. Since the two dimensional model is far more computationally efficient, it is employed to study various fuel mixtures with more sophisticated chemical mechanisms. The CFD results from the LPM combustion of H 2, H 2 /CO, and CH 4 with NOx formation are presented. A three dimensional CFD simulation is run for LPM CH 4 combustion that uses a global CH 4 oxidation mechanism. While this model does not predict intermediate radicals and NOx, the CO contours and flow field can be used as guidelines to develop a chemical reactor network (CRN), which can incorporate detailed chemistry. In addition, this model runs quickly enough that it is a good way to initialize the temperature and flow field for simulations that do incorporate more complex chemistry. The two dimensional model is used to illustrate the difference in combustion behavior between the various fuels tested. In particular, it illustrates the geometric locations of the super-equilibrium radical fields and shows where and through which pathways NOx is formed. The pathway breakdowns show good agreement with the CRN modeling results. The main goal of the CFD modeling is to use the results of each model to develop Chemical Reactor Networks, CRNs, that are customized for a particular burner. The CRN can then be used to estimate the impacts due to fuel variation...|$|E

40|$|The {{preignition}} {{characteristics of}} the R- 2800 cylinder, as effected by fuel consumption, engine operating variables, and spark plug type and condition, were evaluated. The effects on preignition-limited performance of various percentages of aromatics (benzene, toluene, cumene, xylene) in a base fuel of triptane were investigated. Two paraffins (triptane and S + 6. 0 ml TEL/gal) and two <b>refinery</b> <b>blends</b> (28 -R and 33 -R) were preignition rated. The effect {{of changes in the}} following engine operating variables on preignition limit was determined: inlet-air temperature, rear spark plug gasket temperature, engine speed, spark advance, tappet clearance, and oil consumption. Preignition limits of the R- 2800 cylinder using Champion C 34 S and C 35 S and AC-LS 86, LS 87, and LS 88 spark plugs were established and the effect of spark plug deterioration was investigated. No definite trends in preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure were indicated for aromatics as a class when increased percentages of different aromatics were added to a base fuel of triptane. Three types of fuel (aromatics, paraffins, and <b>refinery</b> <b>blends)</b> showed a preignition range for this cylinder from 65 to 104 percent when based on the performance of S plus 6. 0 ml TEL per gallon as 100 percent. The R- 2800 cylinder is therefore relatively insensitive to fuel composition when compared to a CFR F- 4 engine, which had a pre-ignition range from 72 to 100 percent for the same fuels. Six engine operating variables were investigated with the following results: preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure decreased, with increases in engine speed, rear spark plug gasket temperature, inlet-air temperature, and spark advance beyond 20 F B. T. C. and was unaffected by rate of oil consumption or by tappet clearance. Spark plugs were rated over a range of preignition-limited indicated mean effective pressure from 200 to 390 pounds per square inch at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 07 in the following order of increased resistance to preignition: AC-LS 97, AC-LS 88, Champion C 358, AC-LS 86, and Champion C 34 S. Spark plug deterioration in the form of cracks in the porcelain had been broken away from the center electrode and were retained in the spark plug cavity, the preignition limit was decreased as much as 57 percent. When the broken pieces had been removed, the preignition limit increased from that of the undamaged porcelain as the weight of removed porcelain was increased...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSolid biomass {{and waste}} are {{major sources of}} energy. They account for about 80 % of total primary energy {{consumed}} in Nigeria. This paper assesses the biomass resources (agricultural, forest, urban, and other wastes) available in Nigeria {{and the potential for}} biofuel production from first, second, third and fourth generation biomass feedstocks. It reviews the scope of biomass conversion technologies tested within the country and the reports on the technology readiness level of each. Currently, most of the emerging biofuels projects in Nigeria utilize first generation biomass feedstock for biofuel production and are typically located many miles away from the petroleum refineries infrastructures. These feedstocks are predominantly food crops and thus in competition with food production. With significant availability of non-food biomass resources, particularly in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, and the petroleum refineries located in the same area, it is pertinent to consider expanding use of the petroleum refinery׳s infrastructure to co-process non-food biomass into bio-intermediate oil for blending with petroleum. This not only addresses the potential food versus fuel conflict challenging biofuel production in Nigeria, but also reduces the cost of setting up new bio-refineries thus eliminating the transportation of ethanol to existing petroleum <b>refineries</b> for <b>blending.</b> In view of this, it is recommended that further research be carried out to assess the feasibility of upgrading existing refineries in Nigeria to co-process bio-based fuels and petroleum products thus achieving the targets set by the Nigeria Energy Commission for biofuel production in the country...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} techniques for increasing the performance of pavement rehabilitation is the use of asphalt rubber mixtures, which utilize crumb rubber from used tires for modifying the asphalt to produce asphalt rubber binder. Crumb rubber can be produced by two different types of grinding, ambient and cryogenic. The asphalt rubber binder used in asphalt rubber mixtures can be obtained through two different processes, terminal blending (produced at a <b>refinery)</b> and continuous <b>blending</b> (produced in a plant). Because the performance of the asphalt rubber binder depends on the elastomeric properties of the crumb rubber, the manufacturing process, especially the digestion time, influences these properties. The digestion time is responsible for the interaction between the crumb rubber and the straight asphalt, which is characterized by the amount of elastomeric properties transferred to the straight asphalt. This paper presents an assessment of the digestion time using conventional performance-related tests and scanning electron microscopy analyses, which examined the surface of asphalt rubber binder. In this study, two straight asphalts with different penetrations and two crumb rubbers, an ambient crumb rubber and a cryogenic crumb rubber, were considered. The asphalt rubber binders studied in this work were produced using different contents of crumb rubber and different digestion times. The objective of this work is to contribute to the assessment of the digestion time of asphalt rubber binder based on microscopy analysis. This paper concluded that scanning electron microscopy is an important tool for defining the digestion time of asphalt rubber binder...|$|R
