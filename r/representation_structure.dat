SHYSTER was evaluated under five headings: its usefulness, its generality, the quality of its advice, its limitations, and possible enhancements that could be made to it. Despite its simple knowledge <b>representation</b> <b>structure,</b> it has shown itself capable of producing good advice, and its simple structure has facilitated the specification of different areas of law.|$|E
5000|$|Following from Peter Sells account, [...] {{argued that}} {{there may not be}} a need for three {{primitive}} roles to explain logophoricity. In fact, logophoric phenomena can be explained by introducing only one semantic role into Discourse Representation Structures: the assigned epistemic validator (or, more briefly, validator). This semantic role is assigned the Discourse Marker v. The role of validator is associated with the individual who is responsible for validating the content of what is being reported. Similarly to Sells, Stirling argues that once this primitive is within the bounds of a Discourse <b>Representation</b> <b>Structure,</b> it is free to be anaphorically related to other NPs in the discourse.|$|E
50|$|In one sense, DRT {{offers a}} {{variation}} of first-order predicate calculus — its forms are pairs of first-order formulae and the free variables that occur in them. In traditional natural language semantics, only individual sentences are examined, but {{the context of a}} dialogue plays a role in meaning as well. For example, anaphoric pronouns such as he and she rely upon previously introduced individual constants in order to have meaning. DRT uses variables for every individual constant in order to account for this problem. A discourse is represented in a discourse <b>representation</b> <b>structure</b> (DRS), a box with variables at the top and the sentences in the formal language below in the order of the original discourse. Sub-DRS can be used for different types of sentences.|$|E

50|$|A syntax-directed editor may treat grammar {{rules as}} {{generative}} (e.g., offering the user templates {{that correspond to}} one or more steps in a formal derivation of program text) or proscriptive (e.g., preventing a phrase of a given part of speech from being moved to a context where another part of speech is required) or analytic (e.g., parsing textual edits to create a structured <b>representation).</b> <b>Structure</b> editing features in source code editors make it harder to write programs with invalid syntax. Language-sensitive editors may impose syntactic correctness as an absolute requirement (e.g., as did Mentor), or may tolerate syntax errors after issuing a warning (e.g., as did the Cornell Program Synthesizer). Strict structured editors often make it difficult to perform edits that are easy to perform with plain text editors, {{which is one of the}} factors contributing to the lack of adoption of structured editing in some domains, such as source code editing.|$|E
50|$|Peter Sells {{introduced}} a semantic account of logophoricity using Discourse <b>Representation</b> <b>Structure.</b> This approach {{allows for the}} possibility of binding between an antecedent and a logophor within the same sentence or across sentences within a discourse. He introduced three semantic roles, or primitives, which occur in discourse: source, self, and pivot. The source refers to the individual who is the intentional communicator, the self to the individual whose perspective is being reported, and the pivot to the individual who is the deictic center of the discourse, i.e., the one from whose physical perspective the content of the report is being evaluated.. The predicates which correspond to these primitives are represented by Discourse Markers (DMs). Additionally, there is a Discourse Marker (S) which stands for the speaker of the discourse. Sells imposes a condition that the DMs associated with a primitive predicate are able to be anaphorically related to other referents in the discourse.|$|E
50|$|A further {{example of}} SHYSTER’s pragmatism is its simple {{knowledge}} <b>representation</b> <b>structure.</b> This structure {{was designed to}} facilitate specification of different areas of case law using a specification language. Areas of case law are specified {{in terms of the}} cases and attributes of importance in those areas. SHYSTER weights its attributes and checks for dependence between them. In order to choose cases upon which to construct its opinions, SHYSTER calculates distances between cases and uses these distances to determine which of the leading cases are nearest to the instant case. To this end SHYSTER can be seen to adopt and expand upon nearest neighbor search methods used in pattern recognition. These nearest cases are used to produce an argument (based on similarities and differences between the cases) about the likely outcome in the instant case. This argument relies on the doctrine of precedent; it assumes that the instant case will be decided the same way as was the nearest case. SHYSTER then uses information about these nearest cases to construct a report. The report that SHYSTER generates makes a prediction and justifies that prediction by reference only to cases and their similarities and differences: the calculations that SHYSTER performs in coming to its opinion do not appear in that opinion. Safeguards are employed to warn users if SHYSTER doubts the veracity of its advice.|$|E

However, comparative studies of the two training strategies are relatively few. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of action observation training and motor imagery training on the development of mental <b>representation</b> <b>structure</b> and golf putting performance as well as the relation between the changes in mental <b>representation</b> <b>structure</b> and skill performance during the early learning stage. Forty novices were randomly assigned to one of four groups: action observation training, motor imagery training, physical practice and no practice. The mental <b>representation</b> <b>structure</b> and putting performance were measured before and after 3 days of training, then after a 2 -day retention period. The results showed that mental <b>representation</b> <b>structure</b> and the accuracy of the putting performance were improved over time through the two types of cognitive training (i. e., action observation training and motor imagery training). In addition, we found a significant positive correlation between changes in mental <b>representation</b> <b>structure</b> and skill performance for the action observation training group only. Taken together, these results suggest that both cognitive adaptations and skill improvement occur through the training of the two simulation states of action, and that perceptual-cognitive changes are associated with the change of skill performance for action observation training...|$|E
