25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> diesel engine is much poorer than a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> gasoline engine, but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output piston engine, the Wankel is superior.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rotor}} rotates orbitally revolving, {{each side of}} the rotor is brought closer to and then away from the wall of the housing, {{compressing}} and expanding the combustion chamber like the strokes of a piston in a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine. The power vector of the combustion stage goes {{through the center of the}} offset lobe.|$|E
25|$|From the {{combustion}} chamber shape and features, the fuel octane requirements of Wankel engines {{are lower than}} in <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engines. The maximum road octane number requirements were 82 for a peripheral-intake port wankel engine, and less than 70 for a side-inlet port engine. From {{the point of view}} of oil refiners this may be an advantage in fuel production costs.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel engine has the {{advantages}} of compact design and low weight over {{the most commonly used}} internal combustion engine employing <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pistons.</b> These advantages have given rotary engine applications in a variety of vehicles and devices, including: automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. The point of power to weight has been reached of under one pound weight per horsepower output.|$|R
25|$|A steam {{locomotive}} {{is a type}} of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material – usually coal, wood, or oil – to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pistons</b> which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.|$|R

25|$|In a Wankel engine, the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{cannot be}} pre-stored {{because there are}} consecutive intake cycles. The engine has a 50% longer stroke duration than a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine. The four Otto cycles last 1080° for a Wankel engine (three revolutions of the output shaft) versus 720° for a four-stroke reciprocating engine, but the four strokes are still the same proportion of the total.|$|E
25|$|National {{agencies}} that tax automobiles according to displacement and regulatory bodies in automobile racing variously consider the Wankel engine to be {{equivalent to a}} four-stroke piston engine of 1.5 to 2 times the displacement of one chamber per rotor, {{even though there are}} three chambers per rotor. Some racing series have banned the Wankel altogether, along with all other alternatives to the traditional <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> four-stroke design.|$|E
25|$|Cranks were {{formerly}} {{common on}} some {{machines in the}} early 20th century; for example almost all phonographs before the 1930s were powered by clockwork motors wound with cranks. <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. Internal combustion engines of early 20th century automobiles were usually started with hand cranks (known as starting handles in the UK), before electric starters came into general use.|$|E
50|$|These large {{piston engines}} {{resemble}} automobile engines, only much larger. Commonly known as “recips,” these engines are fueled by natural {{gas from the}} pipeline. <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>pistons,</b> located in cylinder cases {{on the side of}} the unit, compress the natural gas. The compressor pistons and the power pistons are connected to a common crankshaft. The advantage of reciprocating compressors is that the volume of gas pushed through the pipeline can be adjusted incrementally to meet small changes in customer demand.|$|R
50|$|A blowing {{engine is}} a large {{stationary}} steam engine directly coupled to air pumping cylinders. They are used to provide the air blast for blast furnaces {{and other forms of}} smelter. As the working cylinder and the driven load are both <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pistons,</b> they may be directly coupled by their piston rod. The connecting rod is only used to drive a flywheel whose inertia balances load through the cycle of the engine, not as an output shaft. These engines were some of the last new return connecting rod designs to be built.|$|R
50|$|Hand {{pumps are}} {{manually}} operated pumps; they use human power and mechanical advantage to move fluids or air {{from one place}} to another. They are widely used in {{every country in the world}} for a variety of industrial, marine, irrigation and leisure activities. There are many different types of hand pump available, mainly operating on a piston, diaphragm or rotary vane principle with a check valve on the entry and exit ports to the chamber operating in opposing directions. Most hand pumps have plungers or <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pistons,</b> and are positive displacement.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the steam}} engine, the Stirling engine is {{traditionally}} classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers {{to and from}} the working fluid take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the working parts of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine where heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the working fluid. Most of the many possible implementations of the Stirling engine fall into the category of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the actual output shaft, there is only one power pulse per revolution, since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each output shaft revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occur each revolution at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per rotor revolution. The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E
25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} power stroke only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower pumping losses through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the four-stroke cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E

25|$|Racing {{versions}} of the first-generation RX-7 were entered at the prestigious 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a 13B engine, failed by less than one second to qualify in 1979. The next year, a 12A-equipped RX-7 not only qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981, along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with one 14th-place finish and another DNF. The RX-7 Le Mans effort {{was replaced by the}} 717C prototype for 1983. In 1991, Mazda made racing history becoming the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to win the 24 hours of Le Mans. The car was a 4-rotor prototype, the 787B. To this day, Mazda is the only Japanese manufacturer to have won the prestigious 24-hour Le Mans race outright. Mazda is also the only manufacturer to win the 24 hours of Le Mans race using something other than a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E

50|$|Their {{ability to}} work at higher {{pressures}} has led to marine boilers being almost entirely water-tube.

50|$|A {{reciprocating}} engine, {{also often}} {{known as a}} piston engine, is typically a heat engine (although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pistons</b> to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{piezoelectric}} electricity sources produce {{power on}} the order of milliwatts, too small for system application, but enough for hand-held devices such as some commercially available self-winding wristwatches. [...] One proposal is that they are used for micro-scale devices, such as in a device harvesting micro-hydraulic energy. In this device, the flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid drives a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> supported by three piezoelectric elements which convert the pressure fluctuations into an alternating current.|$|E
2500|$|Rotary engines have {{a problem}} not found in <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> {{four-stroke}} engines in that the block housing has intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing. In contrast, reciprocating engines perform these four strokes in one chamber, so that extremes of [...] "freezing" [...] intake and [...] "flaming" [...] exhaust are averaged and shielded by a boundary layer from overheating working parts. The use of heat pipes in an air-cooled Wankel was proposed by the University of Florida to overcome this uneven heating of the block housing. Pre-heating of certain housing sections with exhaust gas improved performance and fuel economy, also reducing wear and emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> <b>pistons.</b> As the {{cylinder}} block rotates, the exposed {{ends of the}} pistons are constrained to follow {{the surface of the}} cam plane. Since the cam plane is at an angle to the axis of rotation, the <b>pistons</b> must <b>reciprocate</b> axially as they precess about {{the cylinder}} block axis. The axial motion of the pistons is sinusoidal. During the rising portion of the piston's reciprocation cycle, the piston moves toward the valve plate. Also, during this time, the fluid trapped between the buried end of the piston and the valve plate is vented to the pump's discharge port through one of the valve plate's semi-circular ports - the discharge port. As the piston moves toward the valve plate, fluid is pushed or displaced through the discharge port of the valve plate.|$|R
2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. This poor combustion in the trailing side of chamber {{is one of the}} reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in a Wankel's exhaust stream. A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system. (At the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in 1991, the 26B had significantly lower fuel consumption than the competing <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> engines.
