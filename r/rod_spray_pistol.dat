40|$|A {{pneumatic}} hand <b>spray</b> <b>pistol</b> {{for applying}} coloured lacquers has separate pipelines (3, 4, 9) for the medium to be applied, atomising air and pressurised air. At {{least in the}} pipeline for the pressurised air and/or the one for the medium, there are devices (6, 8) controlled by a unit (2) which influence the spray geometry and/or the flow rate. There is another such device in the pipeline for the atomising air. The control unit has a store for different settings for the devices and these settings can be called up by the user. The devices comprise solenoid valves, pressure reducers, pressure controllers, metering units or proportional valves.

40|$|During twenty {{applications}} with a <b>spray</b> <b>pistol</b> of methomyl to chrysanthemums, inhalation exposure as well {{as potential}} and actual dermal exposure were monitored using the 'whole-body'-method. On {{the basis of the}} exposure data, in terms of exposure to the liquid formulation and the spray liquid, the possible health risk for methomyl and thirteen other pesticides, frequently used in ornamentals, was indicatively assessed. From the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) in animal experiments an Indicative Limit Value (ILV) was derived. The ILV is considered indicative for the limit of daily exposure for a worker which probably gives no rise to adverse health effects. This value is a rough approximation since the database for a proper assessment of such a value is generally incomplete. Assuming that exposure is independent of the pesticide, using a suitable format, the actual observed exposure can be compared with the ILV. To reduce the dermal exposure levels below the ILV the exposure of especially the hands has to be reduced e. g. by using impermeable gloves. £J 1998 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

40|$|Thermal plasma spray is a common, {{well-established}} {{technology used}} in various application fields. Nevertheless, in our work, this technology was employed {{in a completely}} new way; for the preparation of bulk titanium. The aim was to produce titanium with properties similar to human bone {{to be used for}} bone augmentations. Titanium <b>rods</b> <b>sprayed</b> on a thin substrate wire exerted a porosity of about 15 %, which yielded a significant decrease of Young′s modulus to the bone range and provided rugged topography for enhanced biological fixation. For the first verification of the suitability of the selected approach, tests of the mechanical properties in terms of compression, bending, and impact were carried out, the surface was characterized, and its compatibility with bone cells was studied. While preserving a high enough compressive strength of 628 MPa, the elastic modulus reached 11. 6 GPa, thus preventing a stress-shielding effect, a generally known problem of implantable metals. U- 2 OS and Saos- 2 cells derived from bone osteosarcoma grown on the plasma-sprayed surface showed good viability...|$|R
40|$|During 20 {{applications}} with a <b>spray</b> <b>pistol</b> of methomyl to chrysanthemums, inhalation exposure as well {{as potential}} and actual dermal exposure were monitored. Inhalation exposure during mixing, loading and application averaged 5. 1 microgram/hour. Dermal exposure of the hands during mixing and loading, and application was 13. 1 mg/hour, and 0. 8 mg/hour respectively. The potential exposure of the remaining {{parts of the body}} was 1. 7 mg/hour, showing exposure mainly of the front torso (23 %) and the legs (57 %). The actual dermal exposure (excluding the hands) was 40 microgram/hour. Penetration of the pesticide through the overall was less than 5 % on average. On the basis of the exposure data, the possible health risks for methomyl and 13 other pesticides, frequently used in ornamentals, was indicatively assessed. From the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) in animals an Indicative Limit Value (ILV) was derived: the ILV is considered as being indicative of the level of daily exposure for a worker which probably gives norise to adverse health effects. Calculations showed that the ILV for inhalation exposure was exceeded once, and the ILV for dermal exposure was exceeded by twelve pesticides. For reduction of the dermal exposure levels below the ILV the exposure of the hands has to be reduced e. g. by using impermeable gloves...|$|R
5000|$|In {{less than}} three weeks with the Barons, Piersall was ejected on four occasions, the last coming after {{striking}} out in the second inning on July 16. Prior to his at-bat, he had acknowledged teammate Milt Bolling's home run by <b>spraying</b> a water <b>pistol</b> on home plate. Receiving a three-day suspension, Piersall entered treatment three days later at the Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts. Diagnosed with [...] "nervous exhaustion", he spent the next seven weeks in the facility and missed the remainder of the season.|$|R
40|$|The {{absorptivity}} for {{laser beam}} a, thermal conductivity lambdab and thermal diffusivity αb of the thin black paint layer sprayed on material surfaces are measured by applying a non-contact measurement method of the thermophysical properties of solids. The values of a= 0. 67, λb= 1. 45 W/mK and αb= 1. 24 × 10 - 6 m 2 /s are {{obtained for the}} sprayed layer thickness ζb= 40 μm. Furthermore, for the ζb= 24 μm thick layers which are formed by rubbing with a glass <b>rod</b> after <b>spraying,</b> the values of α= 0. 73, λb= 1. 85 W/mK and αb= 1. 09 × 10 － 6 m 2 /s are obtained. It is also shown that the present thermal diffusivity αb for ζb= 40 μm is about 30 ～ 80 % larger than those obtained by Araki et a 1. for the thicker layers ζb= 150 ～ 248 μm...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{a very good}} {{combination}} of strength and ductility, 630 MPa 0. 2 % proof stress and 14. 8 % elongation to fracture in tensile test, has been obtained for the 7075 Al alloy after optimizing the processing parameters for spray forming, hot extruding the spray deposit, and peak aging the samples taken from the extruded <b>rod.</b> The <b>spray</b> deposits contained some porosity but it was almost eliminated on hot extrusion. Electron probe microanalysis revealed that even though spray forming {{was carried out in}} an open atmosphere, it did not affect the oxygen content and its distribution in the material on spray forming, because the atomizing argon gas provided a protective cover to molten droplets and prevented their oxidation. The chemical composition of the spray-formed material was found to be almost the same as the raw material, and the major alloying elements were found to be uniformly distributed in the extruded rod...|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, the {{motorized}} water gun {{was perhaps}} {{at its most}} prolific. Companies such as Entertech Inc. and Larami Inc. created water guns modeled after guns popularized in movies such as Rambo. At the heart of these devices was a small motor and crank shaft that converted a rotary motion into a forward-backwards pumping motion to drive a small pump akin {{to those found in}} the small <b>spray</b> bottle-type squirt <b>pistols.</b> Stream performance was often not improved, but the motor removed the need to pump, which made the toys popular. The greatest fallback was that they wore out batteries quickly. However, their main strength—and consequent reason for dismissal—was their realistic styling. After some of these realistic-shaped water guns caused accidental shootings by police, stricter rules regarding shapes and coloring of water guns were drafted in the United States.|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} morphological and optical properties of zinc oxide rods. Highly structured ZnO layers comprising with well-shaped hexagonal rods were prepared by spray pyrolysis deposition of zinc chloride aqueous solutions at ~ 550 ∘C. The rods {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, photoluminescence, and ultraviolet and visible absorption spectroscopy measurements. The deposition of the 0. 1 [*]mol/L solution at ~ 550 ∘C resulted in crystals with a diameter of 400 – 1000 [*]nm and length of 500 – 2000 [*]nm. Sharp near-band edge emission peaks, centered at 3844 and 3680 [*]Å, dominated the PL spectra of ZnO at 300 [*]K and 6. 2 [*]K, respectively. In addition to this, absorption coefficient was determined by absorption measurement. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, results suggest that ZnO <b>rods,</b> prepared by <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, have high crystalline quality. This is desirable in nanotechnology applications...|$|R
40|$|Paper is coated {{to improve}} the {{printability}} and the visual properties. The factors that determine the coating structure are important because the structure determines the physical, optical, and printing properties. This work focuses on determining {{a relationship between the}} rheological properties of the coating, the application method, and the final coating structure. Coatings with different polymers and pigments were characterized in terms of steady shear and viscoelastic properties. These coatings were applied onto plastic film and paper with a laboratory <b>rod</b> coater, a <b>spray</b> coater, and a high-speed blade coater. The final coating structure after drying was characterized in terms of void fraction, water absorption rate, gloss, and light scattering coefficient. A relationship between the viscoelasticity of the suspensions and the final coating structure was found for the associative thickeners. However, the concentration and molecular weights of cellulosic thickeners did change the wet state rheology, but the final coating structure was not changed. Pigment shape, type, and size distribution are more important than the elastic modulus whe...|$|R
