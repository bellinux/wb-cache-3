That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E

5|$|Boyd was {{promoted}} to Assistant Director of Research at the Engineering Experiment Station in 1954. He served {{as director of the}} station from July 1, 1957, until 1961. While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of <b>research</b> <b>centers</b> at institutes of technology, which argued that research should be integrated with education; Boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day-to-day research. Boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research. He was influential {{enough to be able to}} override the wishes of Joseph Howey, director of the School of Physics, on occasion: for example, Boyd successfully hired physicist Earl W. McDaniel in 1954 over Howey's determined opposition.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Thayer School saw {{expansion}} into new fields such as nanotechnology and biochemical engineering, as well as collaboration with such nearby institutions as Dartmouth Medical School, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. In the early first decade of the 21st century, the core curriculum for undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998â€“2004), making the school's offerings more accessible to non-major Dartmouth students. The MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), completed in 2006, was a $21million project to expand the school's classrooms and <b>research</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|E
5|$|James E. Boyd was {{promoted}} to Assistant Director of Research at the station in 1954, and succeeded Calaway as director on July 1, 1957.

5|$|The {{university}} {{offers more}} than 280 degree programs through its 14 academic colleges on campusâ€”including programs leading to professional degrees in architecture, law, optometry, and pharmacy. The institution conducts $150million annually in research, and operates more than 40 <b>research</b> <b>centers</b> and institutes on campus. Interdisciplinary research includes superconductivity, space commercialization and exploration, biomedical sciences and engineering, energy and natural resources, and artificial intelligence. Awarding more than 9,000 degrees annually, UH's alumni base exceeds 260,000. The {{economic impact of the}} university contributes over $3billion annually to the Texas economy, while generating about 24,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} museum's longevity, Robbins lobbied the {{national}} legislature (Congress) to absorb his museum into the Smithsonian Institution, a federal group of museums and <b>research</b> <b>centers.</b> The House of Representatives approved this plan in 1978 with backing from Representatives John Brademas, Lindy Boggs, Ron Dellums, the Congressional Black Caucus, and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey. The Smithsonian directors adopted the museum {{the next year}} and began plans to move the collection from the townhouses into a proper museum. In 1981, the museum was renamed the National Museum of African Art.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the school's name {{changed to}} the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed {{to the modern}} Master of Business Administration (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered {{primarily}} to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year. Under Dean Karl Hill, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus {{with the construction of}} a new dormitory and the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976â€“1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983â€“1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third. Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several <b>research</b> <b>centers</b> and nondegree business programs.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, UPCA {{requested}} Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos {{to allow}} the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey {{found that there was}} very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units. New colleges and <b>research</b> <b>centers</b> were created over the next few years, while the College of Veterinary Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman.|$|E

In December 2008, the University of Michigan Board of Regents approved the purchase of the facilities, and the university anticipates hiring 2,000 researchers and staff during the next 10 years. The city is the home of other research and engineering centers, including those of Lotus Engineering, General Dynamics and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Other <b>research</b> <b>centers</b> sited in the city are the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and the Toyota Technical Center.

5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture <b>Research</b> <b>Centers</b> (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant genetic resources in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E
