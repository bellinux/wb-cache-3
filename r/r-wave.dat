50|$|The {{concept of}} HRT was {{introduced}} to the medical community by Georg Schmidt and colleagues from the Munich University of Technology in 1999 in the British medical journal the Lancet. While studying PVC characteristics, Schmidt and his colleagues had noticed that heart rate seemed to speed up after a PVC. To get a clearer picture, they listed the time from one heartbeat's <b>R-wave</b> to the next <b>R-wave</b> (called RR intervals) and synchronized these lists to the time of the PVC beat and averaged the values in the list. A plot of this averaged RR interval list (called a PVC tachogram) not only confirmed their observation that heart rate sped up for a few beats after a PVC, but highlighted another less obvious feature, that heart rate then slows down beyond what it was before the PVC, before returning to the original heart rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) uses electrodes {{placed on}} the torso, wrists, or legs, to measure the electrical activity {{of the heart and}} measures the interbeat interval (distances between successive <b>R-wave</b> peaks in the QRS complex). The interbeat interval, divided into 60 seconds, determines the heart rate at that moment. The statistical variability of that interbeat interval is what we call heart rate variability. The ECG method is more accurate than the PPG method in measuring heart rate variability.|$|E

Torsades de pointes is associated with long QT syndrome, a condition whereby prolonged QT intervals are visible on an ECG. Long QT intervals predispose the patient to an , wherein the <b>R-wave,</b> representing ventricular depolarization, occurs during the relative refractory period at the end of repolarization (represented by {{the latter half of the}} T-wave).

50|$|Note {{that the}} BP has two {{component}}s, the early one (BP1) lasting from about −1.2 to −0.5; the late component (BP2) from −0.5 to shortly before 0 sec. The pre-motion positivity is even smaller, and the motor-potential which starts about fifty to sixty milliseconds before {{the onset of}} movement and has its maximum over the contralateral precentral hand area is still smaller. Thus, it takes great care to see these potentials: exact triggering by the real onset of movement is important, which is especially difficult preceding speech movements. Furthermore, artifacts due to head-, eye-, lid-, mouth-movements and respiration have to be eliminated before averaging because such artifacts may be of a magnitude which makes it difficult to render them negligible even after hundreds of sweeps. In the case of eye movements eye muscle potentials have to be distinguished from cerebral potentials. In some cases animal experiments were necessary to clarify the origin of potentials such as the <b>R-wave.</b> Therefore, it took many years until some of the other laboratories were able to confirm the details of Kornhuber & Deecke's results.

40|$|SUMMARY The role of {{intracardiac}} {{volume in}} controlling electrocardiographic <b>R-wave</b> amplitude changes during acute myocardial ischemia was studied in 24 open-chest dogs. The <b>R-wave</b> amplitude in surface ECG leads 2, V. and Frank X, Y and Z leads {{were correlated with}} hemodynamic, echocardiographic and angio-graphic changes in a 5 -minute circumflex coronary artery ligation and reperfusion model. After coronary liga-tion, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and volume increased progressively above control, reached a peak and plateau at 120 - 130 seconds after ligation and {{did not return to}} control levels until more than 5 minutes after release of the occlusion. In contrast, the <b>R-wave</b> amplitude showed a biphasic response to acute ischemia, reaching a nadir (IR = 18. 2 % below control) at 30 seconds after coronary ligation and only subsequently in-creased to reach a peak (=R 52 % above control) at 150 seconds after ligation. In addition, <b>R-wave</b> amplitude returned immediately to control levels within 10 seconds after reperfusion. In six other dogs, both venae cavae were occluded for a 30 -second period, beginning 180 seconds after coronary ligation. Although in-tracardiac volume decreased markedly, <b>R-wave</b> amplitudes increased even more. Thus, the demonstration of discordance between alterations in intracardiac volume and <b>R-wave</b> amplitude in these studies suggests that factors other than intracardiac volume determine <b>R-wave</b> amplitude changes in the course of acute myocardial ischemia...|$|E

40|$|Background: Regeneration of <b>R-wave</b> or {{disappearance}} of Q-wave sometimes occurs after myocardial infarction (MI) {{especially in the}} coronary intervention era. We assessed the impact of poor <b>R-wave</b> progression (PRWP) or residual <b>R-wave</b> in precordial leads on myocardial infarct size in patients with prior anterior MI treated with coronary intervention. Methods: Fifty-three patients with prior anterior MI and 20 age- and sex-matched patients without underwent electrocardiogram (ECG), myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and echocardiography. Poor <b>R-wave</b> progression (PRWP) was defined as RV 3  ≤  3  mm. Results: <b>R-wave</b> was significantly lower in all precordial leads in patients with prior anterior MI than those without. Among 53 patients with prior anterior MI, 33 patients had PRWP, and the remaining 20 patients did not. Patients with PRWP had larger sum of defect score (17. 5  ±  8. 6 vs 7. 6  ±  10. 3, p <  0. 001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (46. 1  ±  9. 8 % vs 55. 2  ±  12. 9 %, p <  0. 01) than those without. The sum of <b>R-wave</b> in lead V 1 to V 6 inversely correlated with the sum of defect score (r = − 0. 56, p <  0. 001), and positively correlated with LVEF (r =  0. 45, p <  0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) can {{be readily}} assessed using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Inversion recovery (IR) sequences provide the highest contrast between enhanced infarct areas and healthy myocardium. Applying such methods to small animals is challenging due to rapid respiratory and cardiac rates relative to T 1 relaxation. Methods Here we present a fast and robust protocol for assessing LGE in small animals using a multi-slice IR gradient echo sequence for efficient assessment of LGE. An additional Look-Locker sequence {{was used to assess}} the optimum inversion point on an individual basis and to determine most appropriate gating points for both rat and mouse. The technique was applied to two preclinical scenarios: i) an acute (2 hour) reperfused model of MI in rats and ii) mice 2 days following non-reperfused MI. Results LGE images from all animals revealed clear areas of enhancement allowing for easy volume segmentation. Typical inversion times required to null healthy myocardium in rats were between 300 - 450 ms equivalent to 2 - 3 <b>R-waves</b> and ~ 330 ms in mice, typically 3 <b>R-waves</b> following inversion. Data from rats was also validated against triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and revealed close agreement for infarct size.

Group I was composed of 149 patients who were studied prospectively. The specificity of <b>R-wave</b> changes measured from preexercise to immediately postexercise (SRV 5) was 81 %, but that of <b>R-wave</b> changes measured from preexercise to peak exercise (URV 5) was 46 %. A group of 156 patients (Group II) evaluated retrospectively showed a high specificity for the SRV 5 (84 %) and poor specificity for the URV 5 (39 %). The sensitivity of the SRV 5 was 38 % in Group I and 42 % in Group II.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{proposed that}} a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent cascade produces the bulk energization of electrons to approximately 25 keV in the impulsive phase of solar flares (LaRosa & Moore 1993). In that scenario, (1) the cascading MHD turbulence is fed by shear-unstable Alfvenic outflows from sites of strongly driven reconnection {{in the low}} corona, and (2) the electrons are energized by absorbing the energy that flows down through the cascade. We did not specify the physical mechanism by which the cascading energy is ultimately transferred to the electrons. Here we propose that Fermi acceleration is this mechanism, {{the process by which}} the electrons are energized and by which the cascading MHD turbulence is dissipated. We point out that in the expected cascade MHD fluctuations of scale 1 km can Fermi-accelerate electrons from 0. 1 keV to approximately 25 keV on the subsecond timescales observed in impulsive flares, provided there is sufficient trapping and scattering of electrons in the MHD turbulence. We show that these same fluctuations provide the required trapping; they confine the electrons within the turbulent region until the turbulence eis dissipated. This results in the energization of all of the lectrons in each large-scale (5 x 10 (exp 7) cm) turbulent eddy to 25 keV. The Fermi process also requires efficient scattering so that the pitch-angle distribution of the accelerating electrons remains isotropic. We propose that the electrons undergo resonant scattering by high-frequency plasma <b>R-waves</b> that, as suggested by others (Hamilton & Petrosian 1992), are generated by the reconnection. Ions are not scattered by <b>R-waves.</b> Provided that there is negligible generation of ion-scattering plasma turbulence (e. g., L-waves) by the reconnection or the MHD turbulence, the ions will not Fermi-accelerate and the cascading energy is transferred only to the electrons. We conclude that, given this situation, electron Fermi acceleration can plausibly account for the electron bulk energization in impulsive solar flares...|$|R
