5|$|The {{radioisotope}} iridium-192 {{is one of}} the {{two most}} important sources of energy for use in industrial γ-radiography for non-destructive testing of metals. Additionally, 192Ir is used as a source of gamma radiation for the treatment of cancer using brachytherapy, a form of radiotherapy where a sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Specific treatments include high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, bilary duct brachytherapy, and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (approx $450). Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants (EnLAW), a non-governmental advocacy group, later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE {{on behalf of the}} victims, and also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (approx $155,000) as restitution. KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640,246 baht (approx $19,000).|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> {{originated}} from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in our solar system. McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss {{can be attributed to the}} favorable half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> {{are being}} {{incorporated}} into the world’s scrap metal supply. In order to prevent this unwanted radioactive material from entering metal processing sites, some facilities have voluntarily installed radiation monitoring devices {{at the entrance to}} their facilities (Figure 1). However, this monitoring does not guarantee that all <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> will be detected in scrap metal loads. Shielding of the sources by the metal scrap, location of the source within the scrap load and the location and sensitivity of the monitoring system will determine if the source is detected. To date, there have been 83 meltings of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> in metal processing facilities (1), with site cleanups averaging $ 12 – 15 million (1). One facility, the site of a melted a radiation source, has incurred cleanup costs in excess of $ 26 million (1). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a cooperative partnership with the scrap metal industry, developed a CD ROM based training program to provide a protocol for response to facility radiation alarms (2). This training enables site workers to identify and properly manage <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> after they have been detected in the scrap metal supply. In order to prevent these sources from becoming uncontrolled, it is necessary to identify and manage these <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> before they get placed in the scrap metal supply.

This will be achieved through the permanent disposal of all disused sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> (DSRS) in the three target Member States. 2. Project background and rationale Sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> are widely used throughout the world for beneficial purposes, in industry, medicine and research. Regulatory and physical control of the majority of sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> is ensured during manufacturing, distribution and regular use. However, the IAEA has recognised that when sources become disused, and especially where regulatory infrastructure is ineffective and/or financial resources are limited, there is the possibility that control over these sources will be lost. In other circumstances, repatriation of DSRS to countries manufacturing and supplying sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> may not be possible, in which case interim or long-term storage of the DSRS is required. But in Member States without an adequate radioactive waste management infrastructure, the management of DSRS in storage may also be extremely weak.

25|$|For x-ray, {{gamma ray}} and {{electron}} irradiation, shielding is required when the foods are being irradiated. This {{is done to}} protect workers and the environment outside of the chamber from radiation exposure. Typically permanent or movable shields are used. In some gamma irradiators the <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> is under water at all times, and the hermetically sealed product is lowered into the water. The water acts as the shield in this application. Because of the lower penetration depth of electron irradiation, treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes is not possible.|$|E
25|$|In nature, radium {{is found}} in uranium and (to a lesser extent) thorium ores in trace amounts {{as small as a}} seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not {{necessary}} for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it was used as a <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium's toxicity has since become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E
25|$|The first single-station smoke {{detector}} {{was invented in}} 1970 and made public the next year. It was an ionization detector powered by a single 9-volt battery. They cost about US$125 and sold {{at a rate of}} a few hundred thousand per year. Several technological developments occurred between 1971 and 1976, including the replacement of cold-cathode tubes with solid-state electronics, which greatly reduced the detectors' sizes and made it possible to monitor battery life. The previous alarm horns, which required specialty batteries, were replaced with horns that were more energy-efficient, enabling the use of commonly available sizes of batteries. These detectors could also function with smaller amounts of <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> material, and the sensing chamber and {{smoke detector}} enclosure were redesigned for more effective operation. The rechargeable batteries were often replaced by a pair of AA batteries along with a plastic shell encasing the detector. The 10-year-lithium-battery-powered smoke alarm was introduced in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{irradiation}} involves {{packets of}} light (photons) that originate from radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. Gamma rays {{are used for}} products that are too thick for treatment with electron beams. Every radioactive element gives rise to Gamma rays with specific energies characteristic of the source element, these rays have zero mass and no electrical charge. The ones used for food irradiation are able to penetrate through food products. The radioactive isotope radioisotope cobalt-60 is used as the source in all commercial scale gamma irradiation facilities. Gamma irradiation is most widely used technology because the deeper penetration of the gamma rays enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes (reducing the need for material handling) and it is significantly less expensive than using an X-ray source. Cobalt-60 is bred from cobalt-59 using neutron irradiation in specifically designed nuclear reactors. In limited applications caesium-137, a less costly alternative recovered during the processing of spent nuclear fuel, {{is used as a}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>source.</b> Insufficient quantities are available for large scale commercial use. An incident where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring NRC intervention has led to near elimination of this radioisotope.|$|E

25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current draw of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E
