5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abna æ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin {{was to have a}} chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abna æ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E

25|$|Although hemispatial neglect {{has been}} {{identified}} following left hemisphere damage (resulting in the neglect of {{the right side of}} space), it is most common after damage to the right hemisphere.

Hence the right hemisphere is able to compensate for the loss of left hemisphere function, but not vice versa.|$|E

Other four-wheel-drive vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs.

A study examines {{the effects of}} institutional change on age-based labor market inequalities in Europe. There is a focus on wage-setting institutions on the adult male population {{and the rate of}} their unequal income distribution. According to the study, there is evidence that unemployment protection and temporary work regulation affect the dynamics of age-based inequality with positive employment effects of all individuals by the strength of unions. Even though the European Union is within a favorable economic context with perspectives of growth and development, it is also very fragile.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} isospin {{symmetry}} and related {{methods such as}} the Eightfold Way come from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under {{the action of the}} Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the strong force behaves the same under the exchange of the up and down quark (and by extension the exchange of the proton and the neutron).|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} calpain {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} ‚Äúcalcium-activated neutral protease‚Äù (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the lysosome and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the cathepsin family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain‚Äôs role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name ‚Äúcalpain‚Äù, to recognize it as a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, papain. Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed Œº("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. calpain I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they are activated by micro- and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 {{after the}} French and Indian War, and the British soon {{constructed}} the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford; these names ostensibly <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that cattle were brought {{across the river}} there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits, as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory to Spain in 1783, after being defeated in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers {{on the north side}} of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.|$|E
25|$|Due, perhaps, to {{the absence}} of a {{centralised}} state response to the social problem of madness until the 19th century, private madhouses proliferated in 18th century Britain on a scale unseen elsewhere. References to such institutions are limited for the 17th century but it is evident that by the start of the 18th century, the so-called 'trade in lunacy' was well established. Daniel Defoe, an ardent critic of private madhouses, estimated in 1724 that there were fifteen then operating in the London area. Defoe may have exaggerated but exact figures for private metropolitan madhouses are available only from 1774, when licensing legislation was introduced: sixteen institutions were recorded. At least two of these, Hoxton House and Wood's Close, Clerkenwell, had been in operation since the 17th century. By 1807, the number had increased to seventeen. This limited {{growth in the number of}} London madhouses is believed likely to <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that vested interests, especially the College of Physicians, exercised considerable control in preventing new entrants to the market. Thus, rather than there being a proliferation of private madhouses in London, existing institutions tended to expand considerably in size. The establishments which increased most during the 18th century, such as Hoxton House, did so by accepting pauper patients rather than private, middle class, fee-paying patients. Significantly, pauper patients, unlike their private counterparts, were not subject to inspection under the 1774 legislation.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, the Texas A System was {{restructured}} and Dean Ernest H. Hereford {{was named}} {{the first president of}} the college. However, NTAC was still subordinate to the Texas A campus at College Station. The name was changed to Arlington State College (ASC) in 1949 to <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that agriculture was no longer {{an important part of the}} curriculum. Efforts were begun to turn ASC into a four-year institution, but the Texas A administration refused to consider the idea since it was possible that ASC could grow to be larger than College Station. The growth of the city of Arlington in the 1950s led to a major expansion of ASC. The student population increased from 1,322 in 1952 to 6,528 in 1959, which led to land acquisition and construction of many buildings. Jack Woolf was named president in 1959 as serious efforts began to make ASC a four-year college. The Texas legislature approved the four-year status on April 27, 1959. Enrollment reached 9,116 students in the fall of 1963, a larger total than the Texas A College Station campus. Although Texas A proposed a reorganization for the system to recognize ASC's growth, President James Earl Rudder resisted developing ASC into a university with graduate programs. Rudder and the Texas A board of directors remained focused on the College Station campus, and funding for ASC construction was not to be made available.|$|E
