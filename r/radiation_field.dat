In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the <b>radiation</b> <b>field,</b> but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E

25|$|The {{goal of the}} IGRT {{process is}} to improve the {{accuracy}} of the <b>radiation</b> <b>field</b> placement, and to reduce the exposure of healthy tissue during radiation treatments. In years past, larger planning target volume (PTV) margins were used to compensate for localization errors during treatment. This resulted in healthy human tissues receiving unnecessary doses of radiation during treatment. PTV margins are the most widely used method to account for geometric uncertainties. By improving accuracy through IGRT, radiation is decreased to surrounding healthy tissues, allowing for increased radiation to the tumour for control.|$|E

Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles would indeed arise, if it is assumed that the incident energy is entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the other Le Sage models, because the radiation must vanish somehow and any absorption must lead to an enormous heating. Therefore, Lorentz abandoned this model.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of gravitational radiation, there are ordinarily no shear-free slices of null infinity. A four-complex-dimensional set of shear-free slices of complexified null infinity do exist. They comprise the manifold ℋ space. In general, there are no preferred real subspaces of ℋ space associated with slices of real null infinity. However, for <b>radiation</b> <b>fields</b> possessing a twist-free axial symmetry, a two-parameter family of shear-free slices of real null infinity exist and therefore pick out a preferred two-dimensional real subspace of ℋ space. In this paper, we study the geometry of these 2 -spaces for the particular case of quadrupole <b>radiation</b> <b>fields</b> for which determination of the shear-free slices reduces to the standard problem of determining orbits of a particle moving in a potential.

25|$|In reality, a {{coherent}} isotropic radiator of linear polarization {{can be shown}} to be impossible. Its <b>radiation</b> <b>field</b> could not be consistent with the Helmholtz wave equation (derived from Maxwell's equations) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a plane wave in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent {{to the surface of the}} sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the hairy ball theorem shows that a continuous vector field tangent to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an isotropic radiator with linear polarization.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{new concepts}} for <b>radiation</b> <b>fields</b> {{in patients with}} early stage Hodgkin lymphoma treated with a combined modality. PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: Patients receiving combined modality therapy with at least 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy. Pre- and postchemotherapy cervical and thoracic CT scans are mandatory and should be performed, whenever possible, in the treatment position {{with the use of}} image fusion capabilities. A pre-chemotherapy PET scan is strongly recommended to increase the detection of involved lymph nodes. RESULTS: <b>Radiation</b> <b>fields</b> are designed to irradiate the initially involved lymph nodes exclusively and to encompass their initial volume. In some cases, <b>radiation</b> <b>fields</b> are slightly modified to avoid unnecessary irradiation of muscles or organs at risk. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of involved-node radiotherapy (INRT) described here is the first attempt {{to reduce the size of}} <b>radiation</b> <b>fields</b> compared to the classic involved fields used in adult patients.

500|$|The first {{claim of}} a dust shell {{surrounding}} Betelgeuse was put forth in 1977 {{when it was}} noted that dust shells around mature stars often emit large amounts of radiation in excess of the photospheric contribution. Using heterodyne interferometry, it was concluded that the red supergiant emits most of its excess radiation from positions beyond 12 stellar radii or roughly the distance of the Kuiper belt at 50 to 60 AU, which depends on the assumed stellar radius. Since then, there have been studies done of this dust envelope at varying wavelengths yielding decidedly different results. Studies from the 1990s have estimated the inner radius of the dust shell anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0arcseconds, or 100 to 200AU. These studies point out that the dust environment surrounding Betelgeuse is not static. In 1994, it was reported that Betelgeuse undergoes sporadic decades long dust production, followed by inactivity. In 1997, significant changes in the dust shell's morphology in one year were noted, suggesting that the shell is asymmetrically illuminated by a stellar <b>radiation</b> <b>field</b> strongly affected by the existence of photospheric hotspots. The 1984 report of a giant asymmetric dust shell 1pc (...) [...] has not been corroborated by recent studies, although another published the same year said that three dust shells were found extending four light-years {{from one side of the}} decaying star, suggesting that Betelgeuse sheds its outer layers as it moves.|$|E
