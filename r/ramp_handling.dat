5000|$|The Maze {{started as}} part of the {{construction}} of the Bay Bridge in the 1930s. It was named the [...] "Distribution Structure" [...] but eventually became the [...] "Maze" [...] to the media and public. The first maze was simple: westbound traffic from 38th St (later MacArthur Blvd) merged with northbound traffic from Cypress St and crossed above the Southern Pacific tracks, then split into ramps north to the Eastshore Highway (US 40) and west to the Bay Bridge. A parallel set of <b>ramps</b> <b>handled</b> eastward/southward traffic. Aerial view looking SE Traffic flows thus had only a few hundred feet to weave through each other until about 1955 when the Maze was enlarged to prepare for the four freeways that converged there a few years later. Another round of extensive re-engineering followed the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, including the addition of diamond lane ramps and a huge girder flyover connecting the relocated northbound Nimitz with the northbound Eastshore Freeway (which is technically I-80 eastbound and I-580 westbound). The original 1936 ramps were removed during this 1990s construction.|$|R

Some designs have two ramps and the [...] "inside" [...] thru road (on {{the same side}} as the freeway that ends) crossing each other at a three-level bridge. The disadvantage is that traffic of the terminating road enters and leaves on the passing lane. The T interchange is preferred to a trumpet interchange because a trumpet requires a loop ramp by which speeds can be reduced, but flyover <b>ramps</b> can <b>handle</b> much faster speeds.|$|R

40|$|Both {{low cost}} {{carriers}} ‘fresh wind’ and liberalisation of ground handling market makes airlines to be cost-wise {{in every single}} field. Thus, ground handling contract are cutting down {{in terms of their}} costs. Handling companies struggle with pressure being put from the market environment, they rush 25 minutes turnaround with couple of people. This can be potentially dangerous from the safety point of view. One of possible solutions seems to be introducing turnaround coordinator, person who would supervise the <b>ramp</b> <b>handling</b> procedures. This paper discusses the role of turnaround coordinator within the aircraft turnaround process. Duties and responsibilities of this person are described. However, not every airport is staffing this position. The survey shows that smaller airports pay much more attention to this issue than the big ones...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{autonomous}} driving {{has become an}} increasingly practical technology. With state-of-the-art computer and sensor engineering, autonomous vehicles may be produced and widely used for travel and logistics in the near future. They have great potential to reduce traffic accidents, improve transportation efficiency, and release people from driving tasks while commuting. Researchers have built autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads and handle normal surrounding traffic and obstacles. However, in situations like lane changing and merging, the autonomous vehicle faces the challenge of performing smooth interaction with human-driven vehicles. To do this, autonomous vehicle intelligence {{still needs to be}} improved so that it can better understand and react to other human drivers on the road. In this thesis, we argue for the importance of implementing ”socially cooperative driving”, which {{is an integral part of}} everyday human driving, in autonomous vehicles. An intention-integrated Prediction- and Cost function-Based algorithm (iPCB) framework is proposed to enable an autonomous vehicles to perform cooperative social behaviors. We also propose a behavioral planning framework to enable the socially cooperative behaviors with the iPCB algorithm. The new architecture is implemented in an autonomous vehicle and can coordinate the existing Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Centering interface to perform socially cooperative behaviors. The algorithm has been tested in over 500 entrance ramp and lane change scenarios on public roads in multiple cities in the US and over 10; 000 in simulated case and statistical testing. Results show that the proposed algorithm and framework for autonomous vehicle improves the performance of autonomous lane change and entrance <b>ramp</b> <b>handling.</b> Compared with rule-based algorithms that were previously developed on an autonomous vehicle for these scenarios, over 95 % of potentially unsafe situations are avoided...|$|E

40|$|Active {{anti-roll}} bars have recently found greater acceptance among premium car manufacturers and optimal {{application of this}} technology has emerged as an important field of research. This thesis investigates the potential of implementing active {{anti-roll bars}} in a passenger vehicle {{with the purpose of}} increasing customer value. For active anti-roll bars, customer value is defined in terms of vehicle’s ride comfort and handling performance. The objective with this thesis is to demonstrate this value through development of a control algorithm that can reflect the potential improvement in ride comfort and handling. A vehicle with passive anti-roll bars is simulated for different manoeuvres to identify the potential and establish a reference {{for the development of a}} control algorithm and for the performance of active anti-roll bars. While ride is evaluated using single-sided cosine wave and single-sided <b>ramps,</b> <b>handling</b> is evaluated using standardized constant radius, frequency response and sine with dwell manoeuvres. The control strategy developed implements a combination of sliding mode control, feed forward and PI-controllers. Simulations with active anti-roll bars showed significant improvement in ride and handling performance in comparison to passive anti-roll bars. In ride comfort, the biggest benefit was seen in the ability to increase roll damping and isolating low frequency road excitations. For handling, most significant benefits are through the system’s ability of changing the understeer behaviour of the vehicle and improving the handling stability in transient manoeuvres. Improvement in the roll reduction capability during steady state cornering is also substantial. In conclusion, active anti-roll bars are undoubtedly capable of improving both ride comfort and handling performance of a vehicle. Although the trade-off between ride and handling performance is significantly less, balance in requirements is critical to utilise the full potential of active anti-roll bars. With a more comprehensive control strategy, they also enable the vehicle to exhibit different driving characteristics without the need for changing any additional hardware...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. Ground {{handling}} is a {{key component}} of the air transport logistics supply chain as it facilitates the mobility of cargo and people from one destination to another. Ground handling facilitates international trade hence its existence is critical to the competitiveness of a nation. Airline businesses usually overshadow ground handling due to the historical dominance of airlines in the aviation industry. The importance and effectiveness of the ground handling function as part of the air transport business is fast becoming a global issue as the industry is slowly emerging. The following tenets of ground handling are fast becoming key issues in the air transport business: passenger handling, cargo handling, handling <b>ramp</b> <b>handling,</b> baggage handling, equipment, safety, security, and human resources. Ground handling players are mainly concerned with productivity, profitability and maximising returns on investment. Dwindling revenue, unsustainable profit margins, low productivity and low customer satisfaction and loyalty are terms no shareholder or business leader wants to hear. This research will give insight into ground handling best practices that are a panacea for the industry. The ground handling business is time sensitive and requires massive investment. Therefore, sustainable best practices are the right ingredient for customer loyalty and business success. The focus on ground handling in South Africa and Zimbabwe will help in assessing the level of development in each country. This will aid in recommending best practices for the industry taking into account different country-specific risks and operational conditions. There are few studies in the field of ground handling and it is an industry not many individuals know about. Many ground-handling executives admit that the industry absorbed them by accident and not by design. They only realise the importance of the industry when they are in it. This research is a practical study meant to bring out solutions to the industry...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Airline {{operations}} are generally handled in two phases, strategic and tactical. Strategic {{operations are}} concerned with schedule planning. Given the desired schedule of services to be offered to passengers (called the Schedule of Services) established by the Commercial/ Marketing department, the Operations group generates the Nominal Operational Schedule (NOS) for the airline's resources such aircraft rotations and crew rotations, and then assigns tail numbers, and individual crew members to a given flight. These activities constitute the schedule generation and resource allocation phases of the scheduling process. They are carried out by various groups which support {{the development of the}} planned schedule for all airline resources. Given these resource schedules, the tactical side of the Operations group is responsible for the final stage of the scheduling process: Execution Scheduling. Execution scheduling is the process of executing the system resource schedules on a daily basis. This involves three main activities: executing the pre-planned schedules, updating the schedules for minor operational deviations, and rerouting for irregular operations. The tactical operations of a regular scheduled air carrier is usually under the 24 hour/day control of a central organization {{often referred to as the}} Airline Operational Control Center AOCC. This chapter presents a summary of a typical AOCC, outlining its organization, primary activities within the airline, and operational facilities. The facilities and personnel of a particular AOCC will vary considerably depending on the type and size of the airline. AOCC centers can range from a single controller/dispatcher on duty to several dispatchers and hundreds of other personnel handling flights throughout the carrier's entire global network. During the process of operation control, the AOCC is supported by the Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC) which controls aircraft maintenance activities, and various Station Operations Control Centers (SOCC) which control station resources (gates, refuelers, catering, <b>ramp</b> <b>handling,</b> and passenger handling facilities). Operations Control Centers are usually linked to the Aeronautical Radio Inc. (ARINC) and the Societe International Telecommunications Aeronautiques (SITA) networks to send and receive teletype/telex messages. Communications with maintenance and engineering, customer service, and airport services are maintained to facilitate prompt contact with the appropriate personnel. Teletype, telex, facsimile, telephone, leased lines, and public data networks combine to provide an effective medium of collecting information and communicating revised operational plans developed by the AOCC center. In some cases, the AOCC has communications systems connected to VHF, HF and Satcom radio links, air traffic control centers, and other relevant locations, allowing them to effectively gather and disseminate information instantaneously.

It is observed in Figs.  5 and 6 that wind generation is relatively high in hours 1 – 6 where the system cannot provide enough down ramping capabilities to effectively utilizing available wind energy. In turn, PtG is called to help converting excessive wind energy into natural gas, which will prevent wind spillage and facilitate an economic operation. For the remaining hours where electrical load is relatively high, the gas-fired unit is operated to generate electricity and maintain power system security by providing up/down <b>ramping</b> capabilities to <b>handle</b> worst cases.

40|$|The English National Spinal Unit at Stoke Mandeville is {{a unique}} centre {{in that it was}} the first {{hospital}} in the world where the treatment of spinal injuries was studied comprehensively and a completely new approach evolved. It began early during the Second World War with the increased number of spinal injuries. Dr. Ludwig Guttman, with difficulty, gained permission to put some new ideas into practice and began with one patient. The centre had, at the time I was there in 1951 – 1952, increased to one hundred and twenty beds in the hospital, had its own staff of doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and orderlies, and, of the eighteen physiotherapists employed at the hospital, sixteen worked full time in the unit. Between all the members of staff, from Dr. Guttman down, there was a tremendous spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm which inspired all the patients as well and made us all into a happy, purposeful, and single-minded team. Each physiotherapist had eight to ten patients to treat, and this, with weekly lectures on various aspects of spinal injury treatment by the medical staff, attendance at the initial examination of patients, and on ward rounds, meant a very full programme of work for all. The hospital itself was well constructed for paraplegic needs. It was built on one level with necessarily broad corridors to cope with high-speed wheelchair traffic. All stepped entrances had been converted into easily graded <b>ramps.</b> A <b>handle</b> on a chain hung over all beds, in all garages, toilets, and baths, to facilitate the patient's transfer without assistance from one place to another...|$|R
