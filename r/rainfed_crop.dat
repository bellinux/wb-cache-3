40|$|Most {{areas of}} the world where {{rainfall}} is limiting are characterized by low agricultural output and, ironically, high population growth rates that generate increased food de-mand. Arid and semi-arid regions permit a range of vegetative biomass production, from <b>rainfed</b> <b>crops</b> to native pasture, and sparse steppe shrubs to true desert. Given the harsh climatic conditions in areas such as West Asia-North Africa, where less than 10 % of the land area is amenable to <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping,</b> soil resources are fragile and cropping condi-tions precarious. Yet with appropriate manipulation of soil fertility and crop management within a systems context, including breeding of improved cultivars, conservation tillage, and rotations, substantial production increases can occur at the farmer's level. While irri-gation has increased considerably in the past few decades, having a major impact on crop yields, surface and ground water sources remain limited. Applied research specific to the region has shown that crop output can be considerably enhanced with adequate nutrition, most of which has to be added as commercial fertilizer.

40|$|The Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa has {{experienced}} recurrent droughts since the mid- 1970 s and {{today there is}} considerable concern for how this region {{will be able to}} adapt to future climate change. To develop well targeted adaptation strategies, the relative importance of climate factors as drivers of land use and livelihood change need to be better understood. Based on the perceptions of 1249 households in five countries across an annual rainfall gradient of 400 - 900 mm, we provide an estimate of the relative weight of climate factors as drivers of changes in rural households during the past 20 years. Climate factors, mainly inadequate rainfall, are perceived by 30 - 50 % of households to be a cause of decreasing <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> production, whereas a wide range of other factors explains the remaining 50 - 70 %. Climate factors are much less important for decreasing livestock production and pasture areas. Increases in pasture are also observed and caused by improved tenure in the driest zone. Adaptation strategies to declining crop production include &# 039;prayer&# 039; and migration in the 400 - 500 mm zone; reforestation, migration, and government support in the 500 - 700 mm zone; and soil improvement in the 700 - 900 mm zone. Declining livestock holdings are countered by improved fodder resources and veterinary services. It is concluded that although <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> production is mainly constrained by climate factors, livestock and pasture are less climate sensitive in all rainfall zones.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the use of}} a whole farm model in a participatory modelling research approach to examine the sensitivity of four contrasting case study farms to a likely climate change scenario. The newly generated information was used to support discussions with the participating farmers in the search for options to design more profitable and sustainable farming systems in Queensland Australia. The four case studies contrasted in key systems characteristics: opportunism in decision making, i. e. flexible versus rigid crop rotations; function, i. e. production of livestock or crops; and level of intensification, i. e. dryland versus irrigated agriculture. Tested tactical and strategic changes under a baseline and climate change scenario (CCS) involved changes in the allocation of land between cropping and grazing enterprises, alternative allocations of limited irrigation water across cropping enterprises, and different management rules for planting wheat and sorghum in <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping.</b> The results show that expected impacts from a likely climate change scenario were evident in the following increasing order: the irrigated cropping farm case study, the cropping and grazing farm, the more opportunistic <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> farm and the least opportunistic <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> farm. We concluded that in most cases the participating farmers were operating close to the efficiency frontier (i. e. in the relationship between profits and risks). This indicated that options to adapt to climate change might need to evolve from investments in the development of more innovative cropping and grazing systems and/or transformational changes on existing farming systems. We expect that even though assimilating expected changes in climate seems to be rather intangible and premature for these farmers, as innovations are developed, adaptation is likely to follow quickly. The multiple interactions among farm management components in complex and dynamic farm businesses operating in a variable and changing climate, make the use of whole farm participatory modelling approaches valuable tools to quantify benefits and trade-offs from alternative farming systems designs in the search for improved profitability and resilience...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDurum wheat is {{the most}} {{important}} C 3 <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> in southern Sardinia, Italy. Climate variability and socio- economic factors are the main sources of uncertainty and concern for farmers in this region that has experienced severe drought conditions and problems of competing water demands during the last decades. Within the framework of a European Union project, CLIMB (Climate Induced Changes in the Mediterranean Region), durum wheat production was simulated under future climate change conditions to evaluate the effects of increased maximum temperature and high rainfall variability on crop yield, and the adaptability of the crop response. The first stage of this work was devoted to properly calibrating the AquaCrop model and testing its predictive performance, prior to applying it under future climate change scenarios. Durum wheat (CV Creso) yield and daily meteorological data collected and recorded in the Agris experimental fields during the period 1995 – 2012 were systematically checked and analyzed before their use for calibration of the AquaCrop model. After calibration the model showed a generally good performance with a significant correlation between observed and simulated yield for durum wheat during the considered period, including the year 1995 that was characterized by a severe drought that led to water stress conditions. A future scenario of climate change was then used as input to the AquaCrop model to predict wheat yield response and to investigate the control of water availability on <b>rainfed</b> <b>crop</b> production for the period 1951 – 2100. The simulated future scenarios show potential improved productivity arising from the increased CO 2 concentration. This encouraging result is however tempered by increased uncertainty and fluctuations in rainfall during the fall and early winter periods (September–December). The possible tradeoffs between these factors, as well as the expected negative effects of increased maximum temperatures, are being further examined...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLand use {{conversion}} from <b>rainfed</b> to irrigated <b>cropping</b> increases drainage {{and groundwater}} recharge, yet reliable {{estimates of the}} magnitude of the change are difficult to obtain for shallow aquifers. In the semiarid Komadugu Yobe River valley (Lake Chad basin, SE Niger), the area of irrigated cropping has doubled in the last three decades, which may have increased recharge fluxes to the shallow (similar to 6 m in depth) water table. To quantify the increase in recharge, water flow in the vadose zone was modeled, taking into account the predetermined heterogeneity of the River alluvium. For each sedimentary unit, soil moisture was monitored in situ under controlled hydraulic surface conditions by vertical neutron probe surveys. Using one-dimensional numerical simulations in a Monte-Carlo procedure, probability density functions (PDFs) of soil hydraulic parameters that reproduce moisture measurements were established. The centers of the PDFs were shown to be in accordance with the textural classification inferred from grain size analyses. The PDFs were then combined with a three-dimensional geological model of the alluvium and the groundwater recharge was simulated separately under irrigated and <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> conditions. The results showed that the uncertainty in soil hydraulic parameters (i) strongly influenced the absolute values of the simulated recharge, but (ii) only slightly affected the simulated differential recharge between irrigated and <b>rainfed</b> <b>cropping</b> conditions. The increase in groundwater recharge was therefore well constrained and was estimated at 15 cm (dry year) and 25 cm (wet year), i. e., representing 18 and 23 % of water input.
