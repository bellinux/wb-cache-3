40|$|British Columbia {{forestry}} guidelines require riparian management {{areas of}} 20 to 50 m width between small streams and cutblocks, composed of <b>reserve</b> <b>zones</b> (no timber harvest) and/or management zones (limited timber harvest). Guidelines in Kootenai National Forest, Montana, limit forest harvesting for 30 m adjacent to permanent streams. As one step {{in providing a}} basis to assess such guidelines, we compared (1) habitat structure between spruce-dominated riparian forest and pine-dominated upland forest, (2) breeding bird characteristics (density of detections, species richness, species diversity and species equitability) between riparian and upland forest, and (3) breeding bird characteristics between riparian <b>reserve</b> <b>zones</b> of various widths (averaging 70, 37, or 14 m wide). The study occurred in the Montane Spruce biogeoclimatic zone of southeastern British Columbia. In relation to upland forest, riparian forest had greater tall shrub and canopy cover, but fewer live trees. Snag density, low shrub cover, and coarse woody debris did not differ at P lt 0. 05. The two habitat types {{did not differ in}} mean bird species richness per site, but riparian forest had greater species diversity and species equitability, greater density of all species combined, and greater density of three individual species. The density of all birds combined, all riparian-associated birds combined, and three of the four riparian-associated species increased with increasing <b>reserve</b> <b>zone</b> width. Species diversity and species equitability did not differ significantly among treatments. The widths of riparian management areas required under current British Columbia and Kootenai National Forest guidelines are considerably narrower than the widest category of reserves investigated in this study (70 m). Our data indicate that prescribed riparian management areas under current guidelines will have lower densities of total birds and of riparian-associated birds than if reserves were required to average 70 m in widthKinley and Newhouse "Relationship of riparian <b>reserve</b> <b>zone</b> width to bird density and diversity in southeastern British Columbia.

40|$|Objectives: Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) {{reduces the}} muscular contractions by {{temporarily}} inhibiting {{the release of}} acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of the BTX-A injected into the masseter muscle of a developing rat mandible. Materials and methods: Four-week-old male (no. 80) Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control group, saline group, BTX-A group and baseline control group. Rats of baseline group were sacrificed at 0 day to provide baseline values of the mandibular measurements. The masseter muscle of rats in the saline and the BTX-A group were administered with saline and BTX-A solutions respectively. Experimental animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks. Results: The BTX-A group demonstrated smaller mandibular dimension compared with the other groups (P < 0. 05). Their condylar cartilages showed increased apoptosis at the proliferation stage of the <b>reserve</b> <b>zone</b> and masseter muscle fibers demonstrated atrophic changes. Conclusions: The result demonstrated BTX-A influence on inhibitory action of the developing mandible because of apoptosis at the proliferation stage of the <b>reserve</b> <b>zone</b> of the condylar cartilage in developing rat mandible. © 2008 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{brown meagre}} Sciaena umbra, an iconic {{demersal}} fish species in Mediterranean coastal habitats, is {{particularly vulnerable to}} fishing pressure and presents a worrying population decline. Fish numbers and sizes were surveyed by visual census at Scandola (Corsica) in and outside <b>reserve</b> <b>zones</b> subject to increasing levels of protection, including unprotected zones (UP) where all fishing activities are permitted, buffer zones (BZ) subject to partial protection and a totally protected no-take integral <b>reserve</b> <b>zone</b> (IR). The numerical abundance, individual size and biomass of the brown meagre were found to increase with levels of reserve protection. The abundance of the larger size classes and the numbers of fish per shoal were significantly lower in unprotected zones. A comparison with similar censuses performed in 1983 showed a significant increase of S. umbra abundance in IR, but no difference in UP. That increasing levels of protection resulted in increased abundance and biomass of the brown meagre suggested a prominent role of fishing, particularly spearfishing, activities in the persistence of its low abundance in the unprotected zones. As a consequence, protective action for the brown meagre (including a ban on both spearfishing and recreational hook-and-line fishing) has been introduced in France since January 2014...|$|R
