40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{relationship}} between government ownership and bank risk. Two different variables are generated using the Chinese commercial banks 2 ̆ 7 data from the year 2000 to 2011. One variable is z-risk which indicates the risk of insolvency based on the banks 2 ̆ 7 operating performance, {{and the other one}} is Moody 2 ̆ 7 s financial strength ratings which measures the <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> of individual bank. Data support that government ownership increases commercial banks 2 ̆ 7 <b>operation</b> <b>risk,</b> either in terms of solvency margin or financial strength ratings. The results also indicate that larger banks have lower <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> than smaller commercial banks. However, our empirical evidence shows that economic growth has negative impact on the <b>operation</b> <b>risk</b> of commercial banks even after controlling year-specific effect.

These are the risk magnitude of the new technique on the workplace environment and the fatigue level that affect human's health.

40|$|Recently {{government}} of many countries have adopted plan to encourage private investment on infrastructure undertaken normally by public sector. These infrastructures include highway, expressway, airport, power generation, water supply, and so on. Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme is widely employed in private financing of public infrastructure. BOT project normally involves dealing with many parties, {{huge amount of}} budget, long period of time, and many uncontrollable factors. These features make the BOT project very risky. Important risks include development risk, completion risk, cost increase <b>risk,</b> performance <b>risk,</b> <b>operation</b> <b>risk,</b> political risk, environmental risk, credit risk, and market risk. As a private financing scheme, BOT {{does not imply that}} private sector undertaking project must assume all the project risks. On the contrary, success of this scheme depends very much on reasonable supports or risk sharing from the government side. The main focus of this paper is government supports in highway BOT project.
