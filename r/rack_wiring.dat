5000|$|Wire decking is {{commonly}} used as a safety measure on selective pallet rack to prevent pallets or the products stored on them from falling through the <b>rack</b> structure. <b>Wire</b> mesh decking comes in various thicknesses and mesh dimensions. Wire mesh construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of {{the holes in the}} mesh. Most wire mesh decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this waterfall decking, the wire mesh extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. Reverse waterfall decking can provide containment of a loose product to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system. Lay-in decking rests inside the step of the beam, and wire mesh does not waterfall over the beam. Some types of decking are manufactured with solid metal instead of wire mesh. Even though the solid decking provides a greater distributed weight capacity, it is discouraged by fire inspectors because sprinkler systems cannot spray through the shelves to levels below.|$|R
50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} <b>wire</b> <b>racks,</b> to catch the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the racking end of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R

To toast bread with a toaster oven, {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale. They can be used to cook toast with toppings, like garlic bread or cheese, though they tend to produce drier toast since their heating elements are located farther from the toast (to allow larger items to be cooked). They take 4-6 minutes to make toast as compared to 2-3 minutes in pop-up toasters. Since the toast lies on bars in a toaster oven, the toast will have untoasted stripes on one side. The evidence from product testing does not indicate that convection oven toaster ovens perform better than regular toaster ovens. People wishing to make large amounts of toast in a toaster oven should check the size before purchase, as even seemingly large toaster ovens may not fit six standard-size pieces of bread.|$|R
50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> connected to tracks that are suspended from channels {{on the floor and}} ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Excessive {{environmental}} vibrations {{can have}} deleterious effects {{in a variety}} of animals. Despite the potentially detrimental effects vibrations may have on animal health and experimental results, they remain poorly understood in the animal laboratory setting. This study investigates the consequences of excessive train vibrations on the breeding success of laboratory mice. An instrumented cage, featuring a high sensitivity microphone and accelerometer, was used to characterize the vibrations and noise in a vivarium that is in close proximity to an active railroad. The passing trains cause vibrations of a magnitude that is three times larger than the ambient vibrations caused by the mice. The majority of the noise recorded within the laboratory facility was below the audible range of mice and was thus considered to not have a significant erect on them. Low breeding rates were observed and are hypothesized {{to be the result of}} the train vibrations. To verify the effect of the train vibrations, a controlled vibration study was conducted by using a custom-built electromagnetic shaker to simulate the train vibrations. Mice, which were unaccustomed to train vibrations, served as the test subjects and were vibrated in a facility far from the railroad tracks. The stress levels of the mice test groups, featuring both males and females, were compared to control groups in order to establish the signifcance of the results. It was determined that vibrations similar to those produced by a passing train can create large fluctuations in the stress levels of female mice. These fluctuations in stress levels warrant concern due to the negative effects that stress can have on mice and, consequently, on experimental outcomes. In order to alleviate further negative impacts on laboratory research, a vibration isolating caster system will be designed to replace the on currently being used on the <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> on which the mouse are housed...|$|R
40|$|A {{material}} can enhance or distract from the end-user experience {{and is an}} important decision for designers. As such, material libraries exist to provide designers with a hands-on resource to understanding materials beyond just data sheets. When we took 2. 009, a mechanical engineering capstone class, we {{found it difficult to}} decide which materials to use. Thus, in this work, we sought to create a materials library under an engineering context for student product designers to use. To understand how material libraries function and which materials would best suit the collection, we benchmarked three physical and one virtual material library. We also sought input from those involved in product design classes, such as past students, Professor Wallace who teaches 2. 009, and Pappalardo shop staff who support the students in their creations. We also looked at past receipts to supplement our knowledge as well as looked at distributors and what they offered to expand our selection. Our six main categories of materials were: woods, metals, composites, polymers, fabrics, and Smooth-On products. The material libraries key criteria were to be well organized, portable, and useful. We went through several design sketches before deciding on utilizing a modular <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> so we could place dividers and shelves as necessary. A coding system was also implemented that included main categories and subcategories with associated colors to help with the user experience of quickly locating, using, and returning. Each material comes attached with information and a more complete overview is located in an information packet. While this first version the materials library was met with excitement, {{it is by no means}} complete. As such, there are also a number of ways to improve the experience and the collection. by Patricia Das and Roget Mo. Thesis: S.

40|$|Over {{the past}} year, NASA's focus {{has turned to}} crewed long {{duration}} and exploration missions. On these journeys, crewmembers {{will be required to}} execute thousands of procedures to maintain life support systems, check out space suits, conduct science experiments, and perform medical exams. To support the many complex tasks crewmembers undertake in microgravity, NASA is interested in providing crewmembers a hands-free work environment to promote more efficient operations. The overarching objective is to allow crewmembers to use both of their hands for tasks related to their mission, versus holding a paper manual or interacting with a display. The use of advanced, hands-free tools will undoubtedly make the crewmembers task easier, but they can also add to overall task complexity if not properly designed. A leading candidate technology for supporting a hands-free environment is the Head-Mounted Display (HMD). A more recent technology (e-book reader) that could be easily temp-stowed near the work area is also a potential hands-free solution. Previous work at NASA involved the evaluation of several commercially available HMDs for visual quality, comfort, and fit, as well as suitability for use in microgravity. Based on results from this work, three HMDs were selected for further evaluation (along with an e-book reader), using International Space Station (ISS) -like maintenance procedures. Two evaluations were conducted in the Space Station Mockup and Trainer Facility (SSMTF) located at the NASA Johnson Space Center (building 9). The SSMTF is a full scale, medium fidelity replica of the pressurized portions of the ISS. It supports crew training such as ingress and egress, habitability, and emergency procedures. In each of the two evaluations, the participants performed two maintenance procedures. One maintenance procedure involved inspecting air filters in a life support system and replacing them with a clean filter if one were found to be contaminated. The second maintenance procedure focused on working in a confined space; specifically, pulling down a <b>rack</b> to inspect <b>wiring</b> configurations, and rewiring in a different pattern. The maintenance procedures were selected to assess mobility, tool use, and access to multiple document sources during task performance. That is, the participant had to move from rack to rack, use a wrench, a camera, etc., replace components, and refer to diagrams to complete tasks. A constraint was imposed that the ISS-like format of the procedures was to be retained, and not modified or optimized for the electronic device ("plug and play" approach). This was based on future plans to test with real procedures on ISS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the following study was to evaluate the most efficacious pH for treatment of post-chill, cleaned broiler paws with the Precure™ (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) antimicrobial. Precure™ is listed as a solution of GRAS acids for use by FDA and is listed as a safe and suitable ingredient by USDA for use on poultry. This study was done {{at the request of}} a poultry processor who was being asked by the customer to adhere to strict microbial standards for poultry paws. Thus, a bag of randomly collected, chilled and cleaned paws was obtained from a local broiler processing facility and was transported on ice to MCA Services (Rogers, AR). Upon arrival at the laboratory, the bag of paws was held frozen (o F) for 2 days and was then tempered (40 to 42 o F) for two days prior to initiation of the study. For the experiment, there was a control group and three treatment groups. The control group and each of the three treatment groups consisted of three replicate samples (n= 3). Each replicate sample consisted of three randomly selected paws. Thus, a treatment group consisted of a total of nine paws. The three treatment groups evaluated were Precure™ at pH= 1. 5, Precure™ at pH= 1. 7 and Precure™ at pH= 1. 85. For treatment of the product, the nine paws for each treatment group were placed on a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and were allowed to touch and overlap as would be typical in a processing environment. Each treatment group of paws was sprayed with the appropriate Precure™ treatment at 20 mL per second for 5 seconds. Thus, each group of nine paws was sprayed with 100 mL of the appropriate Precure™ treatment solution. The sprayed paws were then allowed to drain for 10 seconds. After draining, paws were placed three to a bag in sterile rinse bags and were held at 40 o F for Escherichia coli, as well as for presence or absence of Salmonella in accordance with USDA/FSIS standard laboratory procedures using 100 mL Butterfield’s Phosphate Diluent. Petrifilm™ 3 was utilized for enumeration of organisms and Salmonella incidence was determined using the BAX ® 4 System PCR assay. The lower detection level for all quantified groups of organisms was 1 colony forming unit per mL. The control group of paws had an Aerobic Plate Count of 4. 3 logs, a coliform count of 1. 6 logs and an E. coli count of 1. 6 logs. Two of the three control groups of paws were positive for Salmonella. Log reductions in Aerobic Plate Count were 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 6 for the Precure™ treatments at pH = 1. 85, 1. 7 and 1. 5, respectively. Reductions in coliform levels were 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 logs at pH= 1. 85, 1. 7 and 1. 5, respectively. The reduction in E. coli was log 0. 2 for all pH treatment groups. It {{should be noted that the}} control level of E. coli was only 0. 2 logs, thus all treatment groups resulted in no recovery of E. coli. As for Salmonella incidence, 0 of 3 samples was positive in the Precure™ pH= 1. 85 group, and 1 of 3 samples was positive in both the pH= 1. 7 and pH= 1. 5 treatment groups. Results from these trials indicate that a Precure™ spray at pH= 1. 5 is the most effective Precure™ treatment for reduction and elimination of microorganisms on chilled, cleaned broiler paws. However, it should be noted that microbial reductions were not greatly enhanced by lowering the pH of the Precure™ treatment from 1. 85 to 1. 5. In summary, effective application of Precure™ to broiler paws can provide the processor with an approved and very economical means of controlling spoilage and potentially pathogenic microorganisms...|$|R
