5|$|Interstellar {{acetic acid}} was {{discovered}} in 1996 by {{a team led by}} David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory</b> and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory.</b> It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} {{new field of}} radio astronomy sparked Bacher's interest, and he hired John Bolton and Gordon Stanley from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in 1955. A grant from the Office of Naval Research allowed Bolton to build the Owens Valley <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory,</b> which became an important {{center for the study}} of quasars.|$|E
5|$|For the National Science Foundation (NSF), SRI {{operates}} the advanced modular incoherent scatter radar (AMISR), a novel relocatable atmospheric research facility. Other SRI-operated research facilities for the NSF include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the Sondrestrom Upper Atmospheric Research Facility in Greenland. In May 2011, SRI {{was awarded a}} $42 million contract to operate the Arecibo Observatory from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2016.

50|$|Beginning in 1930s, {{radio telescopes}} {{have been built}} {{for use in the}} field of radio {{astronomy}} to observe the Universe in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such an instrument, or collection of instruments, with supporting facilities such as control centres, visitor housing, data reduction centers, and/or maintenance facilities are called <b>radio</b> <b>observatories.</b> <b>Radio</b> <b>observatories</b> are similarly located far from major population centers to avoid electromagnetic interference (EMI) from radio, TV, radar, and other EMI emitting devices, but unlike optical <b>observatories,</b> <b>radio</b> <b>observatories</b> can be placed in valleys for further EMI shielding. Some of the world's major <b>radio</b> <b>observatories</b> include the Socorro, in New Mexico, United States, Jodrell Bank in the UK, Arecibo in Puerto Rico, Parkes in New South Wales, Australia, and Chajnantor in Chile.|$|R

50|$|The Voyager {{encounter}} of Neptune in August 1989 {{presented an}} additional {{challenge for the}} Network. The DSN personnel negotiated with several <b>radio</b> <b>observatories</b> the option of combining signals with the deep-space stations.|$|R
50|$|Observations {{from the}} Earth's surface {{are limited to}} {{wavelengths}} that can pass through the atmosphere. At low frequencies, or long wavelengths, transmission {{is limited by the}} ionosphere, which reflects waves with frequencies less than its characteristic plasma frequency. Water vapor interferes with radio astronomy at higher frequencies, which has led to building <b>radio</b> <b>observatories</b> that conduct observations at millimeter wavelengths at very high and dry sites, in order to minimize the water vapor content in the line of sight. Finally, transmitting devices on earth may cause radio-frequency interference. Because of this, many <b>radio</b> <b>observatories</b> are built at remote places.|$|R
50|$|Radio {{astronomy}} {{also had}} its start following WWII, and many scientists involved in radar development then entered this field. A number of <b>radio</b> <b>observatories</b> were constructed {{during the following}} years; however, because of the additional cost and complexity of involving transmitters and associated receiving equipment, very few were dedicated to radar astronomy. In fact, essentially all major radar astronomy activities have been conducted as adjuncts to <b>radio</b> astronomy <b>observatories.</b>|$|R
25|$|The robotic <b>radio</b> <b>observatory</b> OSRA will record radio {{emissions}} of the Sun's corona with four different four antennas {{in the frequency}} bands 40–100MHz, 100–170MHz, 200–400MHz and 400–800MHz. The antennas follow the Sun automatically.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the concept}} {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the ionosphere. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on Kwajalein Atoll, while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific <b>radio</b> <b>observatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1988 the NRC {{invited the}} {{operators}} of the Hay River <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory</b> in the Northwest Territories, the Interstellar Electromagnetics Institute (IEI), to relocate their SETI efforts to ARO. Due to budget cuts the NRC {{had been unable}} to use the ARO for research for some time, and were looking for low-cost projects that might be able {{to make use of the}} equipment. IEI jumped at the chance, and operated a SETI effort known as Project TARGET on the 18m UofT telescope until 1991, when continuing budget cuts forced the NRC to cease operation of the site.|$|E

25|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Dr. Donald MacRae established a radio astronomy observatory on the observatory grounds in 1956. The DDO work led to the 1963 measurement of the absolute flux density of Cassiopeia A at 320MHz, a radiometric standard. The DDO also built an 18m radio telescope in Algonquin Park in northern Ontario, co-locating it {{at the site of}} the larger Algonquin <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory.</b> This instrument was actively used until 1991, when budget cuts led to it being abandoned. It was later used by a private group as part of a SETI project, Project TARGET, and has reported moved to a site outside Shelburne, Ontario.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to managing JPL, Caltech also operates the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, the Owens Valley <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory</b> in Bishop, California, the Submillimeter Observatory and W. M. Keck Observatory at the Mauna Kea Observatory, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory at Livingston, Louisiana and Richland, Washington, and Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory in Corona del Mar, California. The Institute launched the Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech in 2006, the Keck Institute for Space Studies in 2008, {{and is also}} the current home for the Einstein Papers Project. The Spitzer Science Center (SSC), part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center located on the Caltech campus, is the data analysis and community support center for NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.|$|E
25|$|In June 1983, Valdes and Freitas {{used the}} 26 m radiotelescope at Hat Creek <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory</b> {{to search for}} the tritium hyperfine line at 1516MHz from 108 {{assorted}} astronomical objects, with emphasis on 53 nearby stars including all visible stars within a 20 light-year radius. The tritium frequency was deemed highly attractive for SETI work because (1) the isotope is cosmically rare, (2) the tritium hyperfine line is centered in the SETI waterhole region of the terrestrial microwave window, and (3) in addition to beacon signals, tritium hyperfine emission may occur as a byproduct of extensive nuclear fusion energy production by extraterrestrial civilizations. The wideband- and narrowband-channel observations achieved sensitivities of 5–14 x 10−21 W/m²/channel and 0.7-2 x 10−24 W/m²/channel, respectively, but no detections were made.|$|E

500|$|To further {{expand its}} {{scientific}} capabilities, Salyut 6 {{was equipped with}} 20 portholes for observations, two scientific airlocks to expose equipment to space or eject rubbish, and various pieces of apparatus to carry out biological experiments. Later on during the flight, a Progress spacecraft delivered an external telescope, the KRT-10 <b>radio</b> <b>observatory</b> (...) , which incorporated a directional antenna and five radiometers. The antenna was deployed on the rear docking assembly, with the controller remaining inside the station, and was used for both astronomical and meteorological observations.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, after {{advancing}} to full professor at Minnesota, Critchfield became {{vice president for}} research at the Convair division of General Dynamics. [...] Here, {{he worked on the}} Atlas family of rockets, which began as a series of ICBMs and evolved into launch vehicles for Project Mercury and many other space missions. [...] He also created the Convair Scientific Research Laboratory whose staff were expected to serve as consultants for the company's engineering divisions and to carry out basic scientific research. [...] In 1957, Critchfield's student William C. Erickson joined the staff, and created the Clark Lake <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory.</b> [...] In 1963, this facility, where observations focused on long wavelength radio waves, was transferred to the University of Maryland, where Erickson had become a professor. [...] Although the original observatory has been abandoned, similar research continues at the much larger Long Wavelength Array in central New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|The {{university}} {{decided that}} it was time to increase the size of the department and hired Dr. George C. McVittie as the next director. After his arrival in the fall of 1952, McVittie began the refurbishment of the Observatory's major instruments. [...] The 12-inch refractor and the 3-inch transit telescope were restored in 1954 by J.W. Fecker Company. He also began expanding the faculty. Dr. Stanley Wyatt joined the faculty in 1953, George Swenson and Ivan King in 1956, Kennth Yoss, John Dickel and James Kaler in 1964 and Edward Olson in 1966. With George Swenson's arrival, Illinois began a program of radio astronomy resulting in the Vermillion River <b>Radio</b> <b>Observatory</b> that opened in 1962. Prairie Observatory was an optical observatory consisting of a 40-inch telescope and was completed in 1967. By the time of Dr. McVittie's retirement in 1971, the one-astronomer department had expanded to nine faculty with research interests in relativity, cosmology, celestial mechanics, perturbation theory, dynamics of star clusters, planetary nebulae, planets, supernovae and radio astronomy. [...] The department which produced only five advanced degrees prior to 1951 graduated 29 Masters and 14 Doctoral student during the McVittie administration.|$|E
