25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle,</b> resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E
50|$|These cars use {{traditional}} engine layout between {{driver and}} <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b> Typically, they're simply called MR layout cars.|$|E
50|$|Kowloon Motor Bus of Hong Kong {{received}} two Scania K310UD (complete designation: K310UD6x2EB. The 6x2 shows the bus has a rigid bogie) buses with and ZF 6HP602 gearbox, the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> has a ratio (differential) of 6.20 {{and is also}} a product of ZF. The bus was designed in close co-operation with the body constructor Salvador Caetano (Waterlooville) {{in order to save}} weight.|$|E
50|$|Drum brakes of 8 in {{diameter}} were fitted, hydraulically operated, and the suspension was independent {{at the front}} using MacPherson struts. The <b>rear</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> used semi elliptic leaf springs. The steering mechanism used a worm and peg system.|$|R
5000|$|In that {{original}} quattro system, later found in road-going passenger cars, {{the engine and}} transmission are situated in a longitudinal position. Torque is sent through the transmission to a mechanical centre differential (commonly abbreviated to [...] "diff") which apportions (distributes) the torque between front and <b>rear</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axles.</b> 4WD was permanently active.|$|R
5000|$|Peterbilt model numbers {{traditionally}} {{started with}} a [...] "2" [...] for single <b>drive</b> <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> tag axle models, and with a [...] "3" [...] for dual <b>drive</b> <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> model from 1939 until 1981 with the 362. Peterbilt eliminated this distinction in the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The 200 is {{equipped}} with either a 2.4 L TigerShark (184-hp and 173-lb ft) or 3.6 L Pentastar engine (295-hp and 262-lb ft) both matched to a 9-speed automatic transmission. An all wheel drive system is available with the 3.6 L engine, including a fully disconnecting <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> to improve fuel efficiency. The system detects adverse road conditions and engages, sending power to all 4 wheels. The system disengages when increased traction is no longer needed. The 200 would also offer a stop/start system to aid fuel efficiency with the 2.4 L TigerShark engine.|$|E
50|$|Green Monster Number 2 {{was painted}} by Arfons' mother to {{resemble}} the World War II Curtiss P-40 Flying Tigers fighter airplane, with an open mouth showing large teeth. The top speed of the car was estimated at 270 miles per hour (435 km/h), and it could reach 140 miles per hour (225 km/h) in nine to ten seconds from a standing start. Running on passenger car tires, the car required four wheels on the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> to withstand the power. At the first World Series of Drag Racing at Lawrenceville, Illinois, it clocked the highest top speed at 132.35 miles per hour (213.00 km/h), and eventually a world record of 145.16 mph (233.61 km/h).|$|E
5000|$|The {{automatic}} ControlTrac {{four-wheel drive}} {{system can be}} coupled with AdvanceTrac electronic stability control, which includes four-wheel electronic traction control. The combination of these two systems is innovative due to a vehicle equipped as such, can continue {{to move forward with}} only one wheel having traction. AdvanceTracs four-wheel electronic traction control system uses the vehicles four-wheel four-sensor four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) and is programmed with additional anti-slip logic to simulate differential locks via aggressively [...] "brake locking" [...] either the front or <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> differentials. By ABS brake locking the front and rear differentials, up to 100 percent of torque can be sent to any one drive wheel, allowing the vehicle to keep moving, even with two of its drive wheels (one front, one rear) completely off the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "mid-engine" [...] has {{usually been}} applied to cars having the engine located between the driver and the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axles.</b> This layout is {{referred}} to here as RMR layout. Sports and racing cars typically have this mid-engine layout, as these vehicles' handling characteristics {{are more important than}} other features, such as capacity. Additionally the mechanical layout and packaging of an RMR car is substantially different from that of a front engine or rear engine car.|$|R
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks appearing near the spring brackets of the Britannias and Clans, a substantial rearrangement {{took place in}} this area {{that resulted in the}} locomotive riding on three cast steel [...] "sub-frames" [...] carrying the ten front-most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind the <b>rear</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axle.</b> (Perhaps remarkably, these were not integrated into a cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher, the pony truck pivot stretcher being a fabrication.) Had the planned batch of further smaller Pacifics been built, they would have been fitted with this arrangement.|$|R

5000|$|Manufacturer {{collaborated with}} the company SOR, giving them special tiles for {{interior}} and exterior of the vehicle. The interior is insulated by mats with aluminum foil. Toughened glass windows are glued to the body. Troy double doors {{on the right side}} panel are electro controlled. Engine with automatic transmission are placed vertically in the so-called [...] "Chimney" [...] in the right rear corner of the bus. <b>Rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> may be Voith or ZF and front axle is solid (Voith, ZF or LAF). Composite cylinders for CNG (each with a capacity of 320 liters), which are for the gas versions TEDOM C 12 G placed {{on the roof of the}} car, the bus can drive 450 km (3 bottles) or 650 km (4 bottles). Fuel tank with diesel version of the C 12 D has a volume of 250 l.|$|E
5000|$|Serving as {{one example}} to verify how AMC {{products}} were routinely derided by various automotive press, Popular Science magazine {{wrote that the}} new [...] "Rambler Rebel reveals a sudden interest in performance," [...] but its handling package cannot overcome the car's obsolete suspension design. However, AMC was reluctant to forfeit their Nash engineered suspension design which employed a strut type front and panhard rod controlled torque tube rear drive system, both having long coil springs to place the upper spring seats higher {{into the body of}} the car. This feature was to afford a softer ride quality and better handling by reducing the geometrical leverage of the car's center of gravity for less body roll [...] "sway" [...] in cornering. What was labeled as [...] "obsolete" [...] is juxtaposed by noting how General Motors employed a similar suspension system on their third generation Camaro and Firebird nearly twenty years later which had MacPherson strut front and a torque arm mounted <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{government}} and industry cooperative is using advanced power technology in a city transit bus that will offer double the fuel economy, and reduce emissions to one tenth of government standards. The heart of the vehicle's power system is a natural gas fueled generator unit. Power from both the generator and an advanced energy storage system is provided to a variable speed electric motor attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle.</b> A unique aspect of the vehicle's design is its use of "super" capacitors for recovery of energy during braking. This is the largest vehicle ever built using this advanced energy recovery technology. This paper describes the project goals and approach, results of its system performance modeling, {{and the status of}} the development team's effort...|$|E
500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks {{appearing in the}} frame plates near the spring brackets, had the second batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics been built, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary Class 8 Pacific. This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on three cast steel Combined Frame Stretcher & Spring Brackets carrying the 10 front-most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind the <b>rear</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axle.</b> These Combined Frame Stretcher & Spring Brackets are often referred to as [...] "sub-frames". (Perhaps remarkably, the rearmost spring brackets were not to be integrated into a single cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher. The pony truck pivot stretcher being a separate fabrication).|$|R
50|$|Between 1905 and 1906, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Popular model, {{which had a}} two-cylinder, 6HP Stevens engine and a belt <b>driven</b> <b>rear</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Single axle {{semi-trailers}} were {{commonly used}} for log transportation in Finland in the 1960s. The maximum axle load of the existing 4×4 Sisu K-40 was often exceeded in logging work. The solution was a truck incorporating {{the addition of a}} non-driven third axle at the back, paired in a tandem <b>axle</b> with the <b>rear</b> <b>driven</b> <b>axle.</b> The new model, the Sisu K-44, was introduced in 1959, with a choice of engine sizes for both the middle-weight ("Kontio") and the heavy ("Jyry") classes. The K-44's <b>driven</b> front <b>axle</b> and transfer case were borrowed from the existing K-40, while the bogie, of which only the first <b>axle</b> was <b>driven,</b> came from the K-34. This drivetrain layout, called 4×4+2, is seldom seen outside Finland. However, Vanajan Autotehdas, SAT's main domestic competitor, had already introduced a similarly configured vehicle a year earlier.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA failure {{analysis}} investigation {{was performed on}} a fractured heavy duty truck frame rail obtained during endurance track testing. The fracture observed was on the frame web within the torque rod connection to the <b>rear</b> <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> of the vehicle. This section of frame experiences multi-axial loading conditions including out-of-plane bending, twisting and shear under road loads. Metallographic examination revealed micro-cracks {{on the edges of}} an open hole located in an area of high stress concentration. This manufacturing defect acted as a stress raiser and resulted in fatigue crack initiation. Simulation of crack growth on frame rail using dynamic loads from a full vehicle model was completed. After careful analysis it was concluded that the failure occurred due to an aggressively drilled open hole which created small crack initiations in a high stress-state location of the frame. This resulted in extensive curvilinear crack growth under dynamic loads of the vehicle...|$|E
