5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by the newly-formed Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the Rainier Valley with a stop at South Othello Street. After the $6.7billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, the RTA considered building a shorter elevated line on Rainier Avenue, including an option beginning at Columbia City, {{to the north of}} Othello, and ending in the University District. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9billion regional transit plan was approved by voters, including a light rail line between Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the Rainier Valley, with an at-grade station on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South at South Othello Street.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route <b>running</b> <b>through</b> Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E

However, by June, the project was not being built at a rate that would allow a December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the new line on October 9, 2016, with weights to simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, started <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the subway in November 2016.|$|E

The line would serve upwards of 250,000 passengers per day and would provide access to JFK Airport from Midtown Manhattan. In February 2015, the Regional Plan Association suggested having some F trains, after <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the 63rd Street Tunnel, be rerouted to operate over the Lower Montauk Branch of the LIRR <b>running</b> <b>through</b> underserved Maspeth and Glendale and then meeting up with the Rockaway Beach Branch in Rego Park.|$|E
