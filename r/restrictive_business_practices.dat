It is therefore, recommended that Nigeria should encourage domestic investment to accelerate growth rather than relying on FDI as a primer mover of the economy and develop a code of conduct on FDI to curb the <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice</b> of multinationals and limit their repatriation of profits from Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|Antitrust {{issues have}} {{become one of}} the main concern of the world economy {{community}} and the United Nations. For many years, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has multiplied the meetings to discuss the relationship between transnational enterprises and international investment and has engaged in reflections on methods to avoid a decline in international investment. However, these meetings failed to resolve the fundamental issue of the impact of international antitrust principles on restrictive arrangements between a foreign parent corporation and its local subsidiary, particularly where that subsidiary is in a developing country. If applied, multinational enterprises would be significantly deterred from creating and improving foreign subsidiaries because of rules denying them control of the buying and selling policies of such subsidiaries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the market power of a multinational corporation in the relevant markets, the degree of independence of the subsidiary, the purpose of the restraint and the relationship between the scope and duration of the restraint and any legitimate purposes for it. This article explores two essential antitrust liability decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States aimed at enforcing the policy of American antitrust agencies in refraining them from challenging arrangements between closely affiliated firms, except in special circumstance. In addition, the author analyzed the basis of the Antitrust Guide for International Operations issued in 1977 by the Justice Department and its impact on the activities of a multinational corporation. The proposed approach set out in this paper calls for rules against restrictions on subsidiaries to deal only with basically commercial decisions, such as what the subsidiary should manufacture, where it should be located, and how it should be managed. Nevertheless, this article found that intra-corporate restrictions should be treated at the international level, not as never being a <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice</b> or always being a <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice,</b> but in terms of the rule-of-reason analysis developed in United States cases which analysis is closely approximated by the Common Market treatment of similar practices...|$|R

In 1964, Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB was floated at the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The current name was adopted in 1977. Between 1983 and 1991, the strategy was to act as a wide-ranging industrial conglomerate, with a particular focus on mining and metals. Later, the company's focus returned to rubber products. In 1999, the scope was further narrowed by specializing in industrial applications. In 2003, polymer-based precision seals were added to the product offerings. In 2009 the European Commission fined several marine hose producers, among them Trelleborg AB, [...] "...for participating in a cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and 2007 in violation of the ban on cartels and <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> in the EC Treaty (Article 81) and the EEA Agreement (Article 53)."

5000|$|Europe {{around the}} 16th century was {{changing}} quickly. The new world {{had just been}} opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561 a system of Industrial Monopoly Licenses, similar to modern patents had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new {{in the way of}} innovation or manufacture. In response English courts developed case law on <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> The statute followed the unanimous decision in Darcy v. Allein 1602, also known as the Case of Monopolies, of the King's bench to declare void the sole right that Queen Elizabeth I had granted to Darcy to import playing cards into England. [...] Darcy, an officer of the Queen's household, claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increases (2) quality decrease (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put an end to granted monopolies until King James I began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies, which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as guilds. From King Charles I, through the civil war and to King Charles II, monopolies continued, especially useful for raising revenue. Then in 1684, in East India Company v. Sandys it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate, on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas.|$|E
