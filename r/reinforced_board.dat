Defibrated residuals were used in three levels namely 20, 30 and 40 % based on their dry weight. Two different types of boards were manufactured: homogeneous and three-layered boards. Constructive gypsum powder was procured from Jabal-Gach Co. Thickness of all boards was 16 mm and their density kept constant at 1 g/cm 3. Specimens were prepared in compliance with EN- 312 for Physical and mechanical tests. Results showed that mechanical properties generally decreased with more residual fiber contents. The bending strength was significantly more in three-layered boards; however, internal bonding showed higher values in homogeneous boards. Increase in gypsum content up-to resulted in higher mechanical properties; higher gypsum content resulted in an increase only in the internal bonding values. Higher residual fiber content resulted in a significant decrease in the water absorption and thickness swelling. It may therefore be concluded that 2. 75 is a suitable mixing proportion of residual fiber composite-boards. Also, up to 30 % of residual fiber can be recommended to be used instead of wood-particles...|$|R

40|$|Muscovite {{is known}} by its thermal and {{electrical}} insulating properties. Based on this, {{it was hypothesized that}} its addition on paints should increase the thermal resistance. The use of muscovite as mineral insulating is pointed out as advantageous due to its low cost compared to other materials used for this purpose, such as the ceramic microsphere. The use of a low cost material could open the access to the medium and low income families, implying two aspects: the life quality increase by thermal comfort and the increase of energy saving. Thus, this part of the population could open a new market to thermal paints. Aiming to contribute to this issue, this work evaluated the thermal insulation performance of commercial paints containing muscovite additions and determined the economic evaluation for its industrial production. The thermal paint was formulated by adding 10 %, 20 % and 40 % of muscovite to the commercial paint. This was applied on steel <b>reinforced</b> mortar <b>boards.</b> Thermal insulation tests were carried out in bench scale using an adapted box. The economic evaluation of the industrial production of muscovite-based thermal paint was conducted, considering the Brazilian economic market in this activity.

The economic analysis also demonstrated the feasibility of the thermal paint industrial production.

In order {{to better understand the}} impact behaviors of SFRFGBs with different content of fly ash and fiber, Laser particle size analysis (LSA), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) are employed to explore the microstructure and failure mechanism. The experimental results show the addition of PVA fiber changes the impact failure mode from a brittle pattern to ductile pattern, resulting in a great increase in impact toughness for SFRFGBs with high volume fraction of fiber. SFRFGBs without or with low percentage of fly ash possess very high impact strength and stiffness. However, when too much fly ash was incorporated, the impact resistance of SFRFGBs is reduced obviously.

When too much fly ash is added, the Geopolymer product is greatly reduced, resulting in a formation of very poor matrix. (c) 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc...|$|R
40|$|From the 1950 s to the 1990 s, New Zealand governments {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} reform hospital boards. Hospital boards served two functions: they provided hospital services and they functioned as institutions of political representation. Governments tried repeatedly to regionalise {{health services and}} remove elected officials from hospital boards. Governments' ability to shape health policy was constrained however by the sequence of hospital board development prior {{to the development of}} universal access to health care in 1938. In addition, public support for localised hospitals and hospital <b>boards</b> <b>reinforced</b> their staying power. The power of hospital boards was finally challenged in 1989 and then in 1991, when Labour and then National, took dramatic and decisive action and altered the rules of hospital policy to regionalise services and to reduce the influence of elected board members. This study suggests that scholars should recast the notion that Westminster or centralised systems necessarily make reform easy. Localised institutions are shown to be powerful within an apparently highly centralised political structure, and policy legacies and embedded institutions influence and constrain policy options. This study also shows that the timing and sequence of the expansion of universal access to health care is critical to understanding how health care systems are organised.

40|$|Abstract: In an {{electronics}} plant, a new one-component naphthalene type epoxy resin {{was used as}} an adhesive for <b>reinforcing</b> a circuit <b>board.</b> The resinous part of the adhesive consisted of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and 1, 6 -bis(2, 3 -epoxypropoxy) naphthalene type epoxy resins. The hardener was methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA). Of 54 workers, 15 (27. 8 %) were diagnosed to have work-related dermatitis but were not patch tested. Therefore, it was impossible to determine the specific agent responsible for the worker’s symptoms or to distinguish between allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. They worked without protective gloves until they started to develop skin symptoms. The hands were the commonly affected region (13 out of 15 cases). The latent period of dermatitis was very short (mean 2. 2 weeks). Of these, 10 cases (66. 7 %) received medication for dermatitis, and 9 cases (60 %) were transferred to other work. The work-related skin symptoms were closely related to the specific tasks, i. e., filling dispensers with the adhesive and manual application of the adhesive to a portion of a circuit board using a dispenser. For occupational hygiene reasons, contact with epoxy resins should be minimized by taking all possible measures into use, including protective gloves.

Absenteeism in these two schools has been a problem tor many years, according to the records of the Montreal Protestant Central School Board. New interest in this problem has been stimulated by the Quebec Compulsory Education Act of 1943.

Settling on suitmation and miniature effects, Tsuburaya and his crew scouted the locations Godzilla was to destroy and were nearly arrested after a security guard overheard their plans for destruction but were released after showing police their Toho business cards. Kintaro Makino, the chief of miniature construction, was given blueprints by Akira Watanabe for the miniatures and assigned 30 to 40 workers from the carpentry department to build them, which took a month to build the scaled down version of Ginza. A majority of the miniatures were built at 1:25 scale but the Diet building was scaled down to a 1:33 scale to look smaller than Godzilla. The buildings' framework were made of thin wooden <b>boards</b> <b>reinforced</b> with a mixture of plaster and white chalk. Explosives were installed inside miniatures that were to be destroyed by Godzilla's atomic breath while some were sprayed with gasoline to burn easier, others included small cracks so they could crumble easily.
