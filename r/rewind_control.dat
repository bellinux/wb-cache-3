40|$|Audio is a {{ubiquitous}} form {{of information}} that is usually treated as a single, unbreakable, piece of content. Thus, audio interfaces remain simple, usually consisting of play, pause, forward, and <b>rewind</b> <b>controls.</b> Spoken audio can contain useful information across multiple topics and finding the information desired is usually time consuming. Most audio players simply do not reveal {{the content of the}} audio. By using the speech transcript and acoustic qualities of the audio, I have developed a tool, SpEx, which enabled search and navigation within spoken audio. SpEx displayed audio as discrete segments and revealed the topic content of each segment using mature Information Visualisation techniques. Audio segments were produced based on the acoustic and sentence properties of speech to identify topically and aurally distinct regions. A user study found that SpEx allowed users to find information in spoken audio quickly and reliably. By making spoken audio more accessible, people can gain access to a wider range of information...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As the {{improving}} of {{rewinding machine}} production {{process and the}} speed of rewinding machine,the higher request of <b>rewinding</b> machine <b>control</b> systemis is put forward. So the control system is established to process,analysis and share various data. According to the request, a set of complete rewinding machine measurement and control network based on Field-bus is introduced in the paper. It is testified by experiment that this system can process and share the various data...|$|R

The reeling tension system complexity, uncertainty, simple {{open loop control}} cannot achieve the desired effect. The system use the MITSUBISHI FX 3 U series PLC as the control core. By sampling the floating roll location, the use of digital PID closed loop control winding motor speed so that the floating roll location constant so as to realize the constant tension control of windin...|$|R
50|$|When The Kodak {{stereo camera}} was finally {{released}} {{at the end}} of 1954 it was an instant hit. The price tag, $84.50, about half the price of a Realist, certainly helped, but so did the ease of use, especially the self-cocking shutter, <b>rewind</b> crank, and <b>controls</b> easily set from the top. When this was combined with the trusted Kodak name, {{it is not surprising that}} it was sold so well.|$|R
5000|$|Broadbus was {{an early}} {{developer}} of memory-based systems for delivering both movies and television on demand. The company's flagship B-1 system was reportedly capable of supporting more than 15,000 subscribers simultaneously watching movies and television, all with fast-forward, <b>rewind</b> and pause <b>controls.</b> In 2003 the company received the trademark TOD, for [...] "television on demand" [...] services. By late 2004 employed more than 125 people throughout the US, Europe and Asia.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} two simple {{approaches}} {{applied to the}} real-time <b>control</b> of <b>rewinding</b> machine and their comparison. In brief, the comparison of results obtained by nonlinear real-time control with pre-identification, and by adaptive real-time control with on-line identification was performed. The <b>rewinding</b> machine was <b>controlled</b> by PC from MATLAB's Real-Time Toolbox using technological card, terminal board and wires. Each of two used approaches has its advantages and its drawbacks, which was proven, and nonlinear control {{seemed to be more}} suitable for the rewinding machine, minimally because of the action signal history from the nonlinear control, the action is more consistent.

50|$|In Snake <b>Rewind</b> {{the player}} <b>controls</b> a snake-like dot or line and {{must try to}} collect the fruits that spawn around the playing field while trying to stay inside the boarded plane and not accidentally running into the snake itself. As the player moves forwards, the snake will leave a trail of {{where it has been}} thus the player must choose {{carefully}} where they want to go. The main area where Snake Rewind differs from the original Snake game is ability to rewind time when the snake dies. The rewind ability is used by spending fruit, the games currency. The game features power ups and 10 different areas to play in.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{built-in}} DSi Camera application, {{which would not}} read any files that were not generated by the DSi itself, the DSi Music application does not have this restriction {{when it comes to}} files and directory structure. When files are stored in a multi-level directory structure into the root directory of the SD card, the DSi parsed through them instantly and displayed all the internal directories for quick access. During playback, users have access to features such as forwarding, <b>rewinding,</b> and volume <b>controls.</b> Nintendo presumably envisioned DSi Music as being a substitute for a real music player. However, there is an important drawback of the DS Music application, that is, it does not support the popular MP3 format. Instead, the player only supports the AAC format with [...]mp4, [...]m4a, or [...]3GP filename extensions. Furthermore, compared with Sony's PlayStation Portable it is more difficult to interface the DSi with a PC, as there is no USB port on the system. In order to transfer music and podcasts over, users will need to remove the SD Card and plug it directly into their PC.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how consumers view content using Video on Demand (VoD) {{in the context}} of an IP-based video distri-bution environment. Users today can use interactive stream control functions such as skip, replay, fast-forward, pause, and <b>rewind</b> to <b>control</b> their viewing. The use of these func-tions can place additional demands on the distribution in-frastructure (servers, network, and set top boxes) and can be challenging to manage with a large subscriber base. A model of user interaction provides insight into the impact of stream control on server and bandwidth requirements, client responsiveness, etc. We capture the activity users in a natural setting, view-ing video at home. We first develop a model for the ar-rival process of requests for content. We then develop two stream control models that accurately capture user interac-tion. We show that stream control events can be charac-terized by a finite state machine and a sojourn time model, parametrized for major periods of usage (weekend and week-day). Our semi-Markov (SM) model for the sojourn time in each stream control state uses a novel technique based on a polynomial fit to the logarithm of the Inverse CDF. A sec-ond constrained model (CM) uses a stick-breaking approach familiar in machine learning to model the individual state sojourn time distributions. The SM model seeks to preserve the sojourn time distribution for each state while the CM model puts a greater emphasis on preserving the overall ses-sion duration distribution. Using traces across a period of 2 years from a large-scale operational IPTV environment, we validate the proposed model and show that we are able to faithfully predict the workload presented to a video server. We also provide a synthetic trace developed from the model enabling researchers to also study other problems of inter-est. We also use the techniques to model consumer viewing of video content recorded on their personal Digital Video Recorder (DVR) ...|$|R
