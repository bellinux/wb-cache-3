40|$|Objective Platelet (2 A) -adrenergic receptors (ARs) mediate {{platelet}} aggregation {{in response to}} sympathetic stimulation. The 6. 3 -kb variant of (2 A) -AR gene is associated with increased epinephrine-induced {{platelet aggregation}} in healthy volunteers. The cytochrome P 450 2 C 19 * 2 (CYP 2 C 19 * 2) loss-of-function allele influences P 2 Y 12 -mediated platelet inhibition and hence the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events. We assessed the influence of 6. 3 -kb (2 A) -AR gene variant on platelet aggregation and its interaction with CYP 2 C 19 * 2 loss-of-function allele in patients with stable angina on aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy). Approach and Results Aggregation to 5 increasing doses of epinephrine (from 0. 156 to 10 mol/L) was assessed in aggregation units by Multiplate Analyzer and platelet reactivity in P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> and % inhibition by VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 assay before percutaneous revascularization. Gene polymorphisms were analyzed with TaqMan Drug Metabolism assay. Of 141 patients, aggregation was higher in 6. 3 -kb carriers (n= 52) when compared with wild types (n= 89) at all epinephrine doses (P< 0. 05) apart from 10 mol/L (P= 0. 077). Percentage inhibition was lower (P= 0. 048) in 6. 3 -kb (2 A) -AR carriers. Percentage inhibition was lower (P= 0. 005) and P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> was higher (P= 0. 012) in CYP 2 C 19 * 2 allele carriers. Higher P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (P= 0. 037) and lower percentage inhibition (P= 0. 009) were observed in carriers of both 6. 3 -kb (2 A) -AR variant and CYP 2 C 19 * 2 allele when compared with wild-type or with either mutation on its own. Conclusions The 6. 3 -kb (2 A) -AR variant is associated with increased platelet reactivity to epinephrine and has an additive effect along with CYP 2 C 19 * 2 loss-of-function allele on P 2 Y 12 -mediated platelet responses in patients with stable angina on dual antiplatelet therapy...|$|E
40|$|Patients with SCAD and {{concomitant}} COPD are at {{high risk}} of cardiovascular adverse events, due to chronic inflammation, responsible of endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and heightened platelet reactivity (PR). The objective of this randomised clinical trial was to test if ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel in improving endothelial function in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Forty-six patients with SCAD and COPD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel (n= 23) or ticagrelor (n= 23) on top of standard therapy with aspirin. The following parameters were assessed at baseline and after 1 month: i) rate of apoptosis and ii) nitric oxide (NO) levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), iii) levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell, iv) 29 cytokines/chemokines, v) on-treatment PR. The primary endpoint of the study was the 1 -month rate of HUVECs apoptosis. The rate of apoptosis after 1 month was significantly lower in patients treated with ticagrelor (7. 4 ± 1. 3 [*]% vs 9. 3 ± 1. 5 [*]%, p< 0. 001), satisfying the pre-specified primary endpoint. In the ticagrelor arm, levels of NO were higher (10. 1 ± 2. 2 AU vs 8. 5 ± 2. 6 AU, p= 0. 03) while those of ROS (4 ± 1. 8 AU vs 5. 7 ± 2. 8 AU, p= 0. 02) and P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (52 ± 70 PRU vs 155 ± 62 PRU, p< 0. 001) were lower.

MethodsDeidentified records of patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at our institution (January 2010 -June 2011) were searched for patients without identified risk factors for excessive bleeding who underwent documented P 2 Y 12 testing after clopidogrel administration (n =  276). Clinical outcomes were analyzed according to whether preoperative platelet function was higher (platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> [PRUs], ≥ 237) or lower (PRU, 290, or no clopidogrel), intermediate (200 - 290), or low (437 mL) in 62 (42 %) of the clopidogrel-treated patients. Lower-PRU patients {{were more likely to}} receive coagulation factors (odds ratio [OR], 2. 82; P = . 0004) and to have high CTO or coagulation factor transfusion (OR, 2. 35; P = . 02) than higher-PRU patients. Likewise, intermediate- and low-PRU patients had incrementally greater incidences of high CTO (OR, 1. 72; P = . 002) and coagulation factor transfusion (OR, 2. 08; P < . 0001) than high-PRU/no clopidogrel patients. High CTO or coagulation factor transfusion was more frequent in intermediate-PRU (OR,  2. 67; P = . 02) and low-PRU (OR, 5. 08; P = . 0002) patients than in high-PRU/no clopidogrel patients.

40|$|Abstract—Some {{characteristic}} {{features of}} chemical transformations of polymers are examined on three examples: 1. The reactions of various organo-lithium bases onto the ester carbonyls of polymethylmethacrylate are typical examples of one-step substitutions involving retardation, i. e. decreased <b>reactivity</b> of <b>units</b> vicinal to substituted ones. 2. The reaction of phenyl-lithium onto the carbonyl groups of PMMA {{is a typical}} two-step substitution process, with additional possibilities of cyclization via lactonization or via acetalization. To understand the reactions involved {{it is necessary to}} make use of model-molecules and of copolymers where cyclizations are avoided. It was established that retardation characterizes the first step (ketone formation) but the probability of the second step to occur subsequently is rather high. Lactonization (by attack of an alcoolate onto a vicinal ester) is therefore somewhat privileged. 3. Chemical modification of polyvinylalcohol by metallation and subsequent reactions of alkylhalides or of propane sultone was investigated thoroughly. It was found that sequential substitution was obtained. This is due to enhanced <b>reactivity</b> of <b>units</b> vicinal to substituted ones (case or propane sultone); but it may also be due to the tendency of side chains to crystallize in double layers, in which case the placement of the substituted units is determined by physical effects rather than by purely chemical factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effectiveness}} of aspirin and clopidogrel {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffering from acute cardiovascular events is unclear. High on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) {{has been associated with}} worse outcomes. Here, we assessed the association of dipstick proteinuria (DP) and renal function on HTPR and clinical outcomes. Retrospective cohort analysis of 261 consecutive, non-dialysis patients admitted for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) that had VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 and VerifyNow Aspirin assays performed. HTPR was defined as P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>unit</b> (PRU) [*] 3 ̆e[*] 208 for clopidogrel and aspirin reaction units (ARU) [*] 3 ̆e[*] 550 for aspirin. Renal function was classified based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and dipstick proteinuria was defined as ≥ 30 [*]mg/dl of albumin detected on a spot analysis. All cause mortality, readmissions, and cardiac catheterizations were reviewed over 520 days. In patients on clopidogrel (n[*]=[*] 106), DP was associated with HTPR, independent of eGFR, diabetes mellitus, smoking or use of proton pump inhibitor (AOR[*]=[*] 4. 76, p[*]=[*] 0. 03). In patients with acute coronary syndromes, HTPR was associated with more cardiac catheterizations (p[*]=[*] 0. 009) and readmissions (p[*]=[*] 0. 032), but no differences in in-stent thrombosis or re-stenosis were noted in this cohort. In patients on aspirin (n[*]=[*] 155), no associations were seen between DP and HTPR. However, all cause mortality was significantly higher with HTPR in this group (p[*]=[*] 0. 038).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: High {{platelet}} reactivity (HPR) {{and presence}} of CYP 2 C 19 loss-of-function alleles {{are associated with}} higher risk for periprocedural myocardial infarction in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It is unknown whether personalised treatment based on platelet function testing or genotyping can prevent such complications. METHODS: The ONSIDE-TEST is a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial aiming to assess if optimisation of antiplatelet therapy based on either phenotyping or genotyping is superior to conventional care. Patients will be randomised into phenotyping, genotyping, or control arms. In the phenotyping group, patients will be tested with the VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 assay before PCI, and patients with a platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>unit</b> greater than 208 will be switched over to prasugrel, while others will continue on clopidogrel therapy. In the genotyping group, carriers of the * 2 loss-of-function allele will receive prasugrel for PCI, while wild-type subjects will be treated with clopidogrel. Patients in the control arm will be treated with standard-dose clopidogrel. The primary endpoint {{of the study is}} the prevalence of periprocedural myocardial injury within 24 h after PCI in the controls as compared to the phenotyping and genotyping group. Secondary endpoints include cardiac death, myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, or urgent repeat revascularisation within 30 days of PCI. Primary safety outcome is Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 and 5 bleeding during 30 days of PCI. SUMMARY: The ONSIDE TEST trial is expected to verify the clinical utility of an individualised antiplatelet strategy in preventing periprocedural myocardial injury by either phenotyping or genotyping...|$|R
40|$|Patients pretreated with ticagrelor {{with less}} than 1 hour from {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI) or receiving ticagrelor in cath lab were prospectively included and received cangrelor. Cangrelor was infused for 2 hours and platelet function was assessed as P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (PRU) with the VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 function assay before start of infusion, 15 min {{after the start of}} infusion, and 30 min after the end of infusion. A total of n = 32 patients with an average age of 68 (± 13) years with n = 22 (69 %) males were included. The level of P 2 Y 12 inhibition before cangrelor infusion was started was 249 PRU (IQR 221 – 271). After 15 min of cangrelor infusion the P 2 Y 12 reactivity was markedly decreased to 71 PRU (IQR 52 – 104, p 225. Results were consistent between patients receiving ticagrelor prehospital or in the cath lab and no statistical differences in PRU were noted between the two groups in any of the three measurements.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies showed}} that esomeprazole does not {{interfere}} significantly with the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. It is unknown whether famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, interacts with clopidogrel. This double-blind, randomized study aimed to compare the influence of esomeprazole and famotidine on the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. Methods: Patients with acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary interventions treated with aspirin and clopidogrel cotherapy were randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg daily or famotidine 40 mg daily. Platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (PRUs) were measured at baseline and on day 28. The primary analysis involved the PRU values on day 28. Results: There were 44 patients in the esomeprazole group and 44 in the famotidine group. The baseline PRUs of the 2 groups were comparable (esomeprazole vs famotidine, 229. 1 ± 85. 6 vs 220. 4 ± 83. 0, P =. 63). The PRUs on day 28 were 242. 6 ± 89. 7 and 237. 5 ± 79. 2 in the groups receiving esomeprazole and famotidine, respectively (mean difference 5. 1, 95 % CI - 30. 8 to 41. 0, P =. 78). Conclusions: The platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel was not significantly different between patients receiving esomeprazole and those receiving famotidine. Neither esomeprazole nor famotidine reduced the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Flow-diverting stents {{have been}} {{associated}} with embolic and hemorrhagic complications, but the rate of procedure-related microemboli is unknown. Using transcranial Doppler sonography, we measured the rate of microemboli in 23 patients treated with flow-diverting stents. Patients received preprocedural dual antiplatelet medications and intraprocedural heparinization. Point-of-care platelet reactivity testing was performed before the procedure, and nonresponders (213 P 2 Y 12 /ADP receptor <b>reactivity</b> <b>units)</b> received additional thienopyridine. Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed within 12 – 24 hours. Microemboli were detected in 3 patients (13 %), 2 of whom were initially nonresponders. There was no association between the presence of microemboli and procedural or neurologic complications, aneurysm size, number of stents, or procedure time. Eight procedures (34. 8 %) required additional thienopyridine for inadequate platelet inhibition, and 3 required further treatment for persistent nonresponse to point-of-care platelet reactivity testing. There were 6 technical and 2 postoperative complications; none were associated with inadequate platelet inhibition or microemboli. The combination of routine point-of-care platelet reactivity testing and postprocedural microembolic monitoring may help identify patients at risk for thromboembolic complications after flow-diverting stents.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIt {{has been}} well known that the {{inhibition}} of platelet aggregation (IPA) by anti-platelet agents was important to reduce the thrombo-embolic events in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the peri-procedural IPA by anti-platelet agents was not well known. MethodsWe compared the peri-procedural IPA between prasugrel and adjunctive cilostazol to dual anti-platelet therapy (triple anti-platelet therapy; TAP) in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We prospectively randomized 70 consecutive clopidogrel-naive patients with STEMI planned PCI to either prasugrel [loading dose (LD) 60 mg; 37 patients] or TAP (LD aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and cilostazol 200 mg; 33 patients). Primary end points {{of the study were}} the platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>unit</b> (PRU) or % inhibition by the VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 assay at pre-PCI and pre-discharge. ResultsThe drug loading to pre-PCI time was similar between prasugrel and TAP groups (25. 4 ± 10. 42 min vs. 25. 5 ± 10. 56 min, p= 0. 957). PRU at pre-PCI was significantly lower in prasugrel than in TAP (269. 1 ± 71. 69 vs. 306. 5 ± 48. 67, p= 0. 012). The lower PRU and greater % inhibition also observed in prasugrel than in TAP at pre-discharge (108. 2 ± 60. 51 vs. 238. 1 ± 73. 40; 63. 6 ± 18. 51 % vs. 16. 8 ± 17. 91 %, p< 0. 001 respectively).

40|$|Aspirin and {{clopidogrel}} {{are proven}} to prevent thromboembolic events during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Enzyme release of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) enzyme during PCI {{has been associated}} with an increased risk of future adverse cardiac events. This study examined the correlation between measurements of aspirin resistance and the level of inhibition of the thienopyridine-specific P 2 Y 12 platelet receptor and CK-MB release after PCI. We prospectively studied 330 patients with elective PCI treated with drug-eluting stents. Patients were pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel. Patients with positive CK-MB or acute coronary syndrome and those on glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were excluded. Serum assays of aspirin resistance (Ultegra Rapid Platelet Function Assay-ASA, Accumetrics) and clopidogrel resistance (Rapid Platelet Function Assay P 2 Y 12, Accumetrics) were performed before PCI. Serum troponinI and CK-MB levels were measured at 8, 16, and 24 hours after PCI. Aspirin resistance unit (ARU) measurement > or = 550 was detected in 12 patients (3. 7 %). Mean platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>unit</b> (PRU; measurement of inhibition of P 2 Y 12 activity) was 192. 2 +/- 95. 4 (lower PRU, more inhibition of P 2 Y 12 receptor). There was no correlation between level of ARU or PRU and troponin I or CK-MB release after PCI at any time point. Only multivessel coronary disease was found to be a predictor of any increase in CK-MB in a multivariate analysis (odds ratio 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 to 3. 3, p = 0. 0003). A positive correlation was found between levels of ARU and PRU. Target vessel revascularization/major adverse cardiac event rate at 6 months was 8. 2 % with no correlation between ARU or PRU and release of cardiac enzymes or occurrence of adverse cardiac events.

Surface area and mineral structure are recognized as crucial parameters for microbial reduction rates of bulk, macroaggregate iron minerals. However, a significant fraction of iron oxide minerals in the subsurface is supposed to be present as nanosized colloids. We therefore studied the role of colloidal iron oxides in microbial iron reduction. In batch growth experiments with Geobacter sulfurreducens, colloids of ferrihydrite (hydrodynamic diameter, 336 nm), hematite (123 nm), goethite (157 nm), and akaganeite (64 nm) were added as electron acceptors. The colloidal iron oxides were reduced up to 2 orders of magnitude more rapidly (up to 1, 255 pmol h− 1 cell− 1) than bulk macroaggregates of the same iron phases (6 to 70 pmol h− 1 cell− 1). The increased reactivity was not only due to the large surface areas of the colloidal aggregates but also was due to a higher <b>reactivity</b> per <b>unit</b> surface. We hypothesize that this can be attributed to the high bioavailability of the nanosized aggregates and their colloidal suspension.

BackgroundWhether on-clopidogrel PR and role of genotype differ over time is unknown. MethodsOn-clopidogrel PR before percutaneous coronary intervention, and 1 and 6 months thereafter via VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 (Accumetrics Inc., San Diego, California), CYP 2 C 19 * 2, * 17, CYP 3 A 5 * 3, and ABCB 1 polymorphisms were evaluated in 300 patients.

From baseline to 1 month, 83 of 300 patients varied their response status. This was mainly due to baseline poor responders becoming full responders (75 of 83). Genotype justifies roughly 18 % of this trend. CYP 2 C 19 * 2 and * 17 influence on PR was consistent over time, whereas that of ABCB 1 appeared of greater impact at baseline. On-clopidogrel PR at 1 month independently best predicts ischemic and bleeding events. We found a therapeutic window (86 to 238 P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units)</b> with a lower incidence of both ischemic and bleeding complications. A risk score was created by combining genotype (ABCB 1 and CYP 2 C 19 * 2), baseline PR, and creatinine clearance to predict 1 -month poor responsiveness and 1 -year poor prognosis. ConclusionsIn patients at steady state for clopidogrel undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, PR decreases from baseline to 1 month. Genotype influences ≈ 18 % of this trend. On-clopidogrel PR at 1 month is the strongest predictor of adverse outcomes, and this can be predicted by combining genotype to baseline phenotype and clinical variables...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{significant}} proportion of patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention experience recurrent ischaemic events despite standard doses of treatment. Although clinical studies show significant heterogeneity in antiplatelet therapy responses, routine testing is not undertaken due to (i) lack of a standardized test, and (ii) poor clarity with regards to definition of abnormal responses. Short Thrombelastography (s-TEG) is a validated test that allows rapid measurement of clotting responses to antiplatelet therapy. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the reproducibility of s-TEG and to compare s-TEG with VerifyNow in assessment of responses to antiplatelet therapy. METHODS: (i) intra-individual variability was assessed using s-TEG Area Under the Curve (AUC 15) and maximum amplitude (MA) in one volunteer at 20 time-points on no medication and at 10 time-points pre and post 300 ?mg aspirin treatment (ii) inter-individual variability was determined from a retrospective analysis of data on MA and AUC 15 obtained from 56 volunteers on no medication, 25 volunteers pre and post 300 ?mg aspirin treatment and 28 patients pre and post 600 ?mg clopidogrel treatment (iii) a comparison between AUC 15 arachidonic-acid (AA) channel and VerifyNow aspirin response units (VN ARU) and between AUC 15 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) channel and VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (VN PRU) was obtained from retrospective analysis of data at 370 and 296 time-points respectively. RESULTS: There was minimal intra-and inter-individual variability in MA and AUC 15 in the AA, ADP and thrombin channels. There was a good correlation between AA AUC 15 and VN ARU (r?=? 0. 701, p?<? 0. 001) and between ADP AUC 15 and VN PRU (r?=? 0. 609, p?<? 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Clopidogrel {{napadisilate}} {{has better}} clopidogrel stability than clopidogrel bisulfate. Our trial’s {{objective was to}} compare the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel napadisilate with clopidogrel bisulfate in participants with ischemic stroke. Methods: The study was a phase 4, 4 -week, randomized, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial. Patients are randomized to receive either clopidogrel napadisilate 75 mg or clopidogrel bisulfate 75 mg. The primary study endpoint was change from baseline in P 2 Y 12 percent inhibition at week 4. The primary analysis was conducted in the per-protocol population. Noninferiority was confirmed if the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the treatment difference was more {{than or equal to}} – 9. 0 % points. The secondary endpoint was change in P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (PRU). At a final visit, all adverse events were recorded. Results: Sixty-one participants were randomly assigned clopidogrel napadisilate and 60 were randomly assigned clopidogrel bisulfate. Thirty-nine participants in the clopidogrel napadisilate group and 39 in the clopidogrel bisulfate group were analyzed for the primary endpoint. At 4 weeks, mean percent inhibition had increased in both treatment groups. The estimated mean change from baseline was 22. 3 % with clopidogrel napadisilate and 21. 4 % with clopidogrel bisulfate; the estimated treatment difference of 0. 9 % (95 % CI, – 8. 6 to 10. 4) confirmed the non-inferiority of clopidogrel napadisilate to clopidogrel bisulfate. The mean reduction in PRU and rates of adverse events were not significantly different between treatments. Conclusion: Clopidogrel napadisilate was noninferior to clopidogrel bisulfate as assessed by change in platelet inhibition. Rates of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Therefore, clopidogrel napadisilate can be a suitable alternative to clopidogrel bisulfate in ischemic stroke patients...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare the action of prasugrel and ticagrelor in ST-segment {{elevation}} myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). BackgroundIt has been documented that prasugrel and ticagrelor are able to provide effective platelet inhibition 2 h after a loading dose (LD). However, the pharmacodynamic measurements after prasugrel and ticagrelor LD have been provided by assessing only healthy volunteers or subjects with stable coronary artery disease. MethodsFifty patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with bivalirudin monotherapy were randomized to receive 60 mg prasugrel LD (n = 25) or 180 mg ticagrelor LD (n = 25). Residual platelet reactivity was assessed by VerifyNow at baseline and 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after LD. ResultsPlatelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> (PRU) 2 h after the LD (study primary endpoint) were 217 (12 to 279) and 275 (88 to 305) in the prasugrel and ticagrelor groups, respectively (p = NS), satisfying pre-specified noninferiority criteria. High residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) (PRU ≥ 240) was found in 44 % and 60 % of patients (p = 0. 258) at 2 h. The mean time to achieve a PRU < 240 was 3 ± 2 h and 5 ± 4 h in the prasugrel and ticagrelor groups, respectively. The independent predictors of HRPR at 2 h were morphine use (odds ratio: 5. 29; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 44 to 19. 49; p = 0. 012) and baseline PRU value (odds ratio: 1. 014; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 00 to 1. 03; p = 0. 046). ConclusionsIn patients with STEMI, prasugrel showed to be noninferior as compared with ticagrelor in terms of residual platelet reactivity 2 h after the LD. The 2 drugs provide an effective platelet inhibition 2 h after the LD in only a half of patients, and at least 4 h are required to achieve an effective platelet inhibition {{in the majority of}} patients.

40|$|ObjectivesThe primary aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the antiplatelet effects of prasugrel versus high-dose clopidogrel in patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and, secondarily, their relation to cytochrome (CYP) 2 C 19 * 2 carriage. BackgroundHigh on-treatment platelet reactivity after clopidogrel administration after PCI is linked to the loss-of-function CYP 2 C 19 * 2 allele and accompanied by an increased risk of adverse events. MethodsWe performed a prospective, randomized, single-blind, crossover study of platelet inhibition by prasugrel 10 mg/day versus high-dose 150 mg/day clopidogrel in 71 (of 210 screened; 33. 8 %) post-PCI patients with HTPR. Platelet function was assessed by the VerifyNow assay (Accumetrics, San Diego, California), and real-time polymerase chain reaction genotyping was performed for CYP 2 C 19 * 2 carriage. ResultsThe primary endpoint of platelet reactivity (measured in platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>units)</b> at the end of the 2 treatment periods was lower after prasugrel compared with clopidogrel (least-squares estimates 129. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 111. 1 to 147. 7 versus 201. 7, 95 % CI: 183. 2 to 220. 2; p < 0. 001). The least-squares mean difference between the 2 treatments was − 122. 9 (95 % CI: − 166. 7 to − 79. 2, p < 0. 001), and − 47. 5 (95 % CI: − 79. 5 to − 15. 4, p = 0. 004), in carriers and noncarriers of at least 1 mutant allele, respectively. The HTPR rates were lower for prasugrel than for clopidogrel, in all patients (7. 5 % vs. 35. 8 %, p < 0. 001), in carriers (5. 3 % vs. 47. 4 %, p = 0. 007), and in noncarriers (8. 8 % vs. 29. 4 %, p = 0. 005), respectively. ConclusionsIn patients with HTPR after PCI, prasugrel is more effective compared with high clopidogrel in reducing platelet reactivity, particularly in CYP 2 C 19 * 2 carriers. Genotyping guidance might be helpful only in case an increased clopidogrel maintenance dose is considered.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the long-term outcome after elective percutaneous coronary intervention in low-risk patients screened for aspirin and/or clopidogrel responsiveness in the 3 T/ 2 R (Tailoring Treatment With Tirofiban in Patients Showing Resistance to Aspirin and/or Resistance to Clopidogrel) trial. BackgroundThe impact of aspirin and/or clopidogrel poor response on long-term outcome is debated. MethodsAspirin and clopidogrel response was measured with the VerifyNow system aspirin and P 2 Y 12 assays. After percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), death, stroke, and myocardial infarction were assessed up to 1 year. ResultsOverall, 1, 277 patients were screened, and 826 (65 %) were treated with PCI. In all, 124 patients were found to be aspirin poor responders, and there were 179 clopidogrel poor responders (totally, 278 poor responders). The 1 -year end point was significantly higher in poor responders as compared to full responders (15. 8 % vs. 8. 6 %, p = 0. 002), which is principally due to more myocardial infarction occurrence. At multivariable analysis, clopidogrel poor response emerged as an independent predictor (hazard ratio: 1. 15, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 03 to 1. 28). Receiver-operator characteristic analysis identifies ≤ 23 of percentage of platelet inhibition and ≥ 208 of P 2 Y 12 <b>reactivity</b> <b>units</b> as optimal cut offs to predict 1 -year end point. Excluding periprocedural events, also peri-PCI myocardial infarction, which is strongly related to aspirin/clopidogrel poor response, was an independent predictor (hazard ratio: 1. 25, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 14 to 1. 37). Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration reduces this risk in poor responders (21. 2 % vs. 34. 7 %, p = 0. 02), but not in full responders (6. 3 % vs. 6. 5 %, p = 0. 8). ConclusionsPoor response to clopidogrel is an independent predictor of periprocedural myocardial infarction and worse 1 -year outcome in low-risk patients undergoing PCI, whereas poor response to aspirin failed to predict a worse outcome. Contrary to what was observed in poor responders, glycoprotein IIb/IIa inhibitor therapy failed to provide a benefit in aspirin and/or clopidogrel full responders...|$|E

Hence, care must be taken to define shutdown margin in the most conservative way in the reactor's technical specifications; a typical research reactor will specify the margin when in the cold condition, without xenon.

40|$|The size-dependent {{dissolution}} of nanoscale hematite (8 and 40 nm α-Fe 2 O 3) was examined {{across a broad}} range of pH (pH 1 – 7) and mechanisms including proton- and ligand- (oxalate-) promoted dissolution and dark (ascorbic acid) and photochemical (oxalate) reductive dissolution. Empirical relationships between dissolution rate and pH revealed that suspensions of 8 nm hematite exhibit between 3. 3 - and 10 -fold greater <b>reactivity</b> per <b>unit</b> mass than suspensions of 40 nm particles across all dissolution modes and pH, including circumneutral. Complementary suspension characterization (i. e., sedimentation studies and dynamic light scattering) indicated extensive aggregation, with steady-state aggregate sizes increasing with pH but being roughly equivalent for both primary particles. Thus, while the reactivity difference between 8 and 40 nm suspensions is generally greater than expected from specific surface areas measured via N 2 –BET or estimated from primary particle geometry, loss of reactive surface area during aggregation limits the certainty of such comparisons. We propose that the relative reactivity of 8 and 40 nm hematite suspensions is best explained by differences in the fraction of aggregate surface area that is reactive. This scenario is consistent with TEM images revealing uniform {{dissolution of}} aggregated 8 nm particles, whereas 40 nm particles within aggregates undergo preferential etching at edges and structural defects.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} reactivity coefficients, {{along with other}} core nuclear characteristics, determine reactor core behavior in normal operation and accident conditions. The Power Coefficient of Reactivity (PCR) is an aggregate indicator representing the change in reactor core <b>reactivity</b> per <b>unit</b> change in reactor power. It is an integral quantity which captures {{the contributions of the}} fuel temperature, coolant void, and coolant temperature reactivity feedbacks. All nuclear reactor designs provide a balance between their inherent nuclear characteristics and the engineered reactivity control features, to ensure that changes in reactivity under all operating conditions are maintained within a safe range. The CANDU® reactor design takes advantage of its inherent nuclear characteristics, namely a small magnitude of reactivity coefficients, minimal excess reactivity, and very long prompt neutron lifetime, to mitigate the demand on the engineered systems for controlling reactivity and responding to accidents. In particular, CANDU reactors have always taken advantage of the small value of the PCR associated with their design characteristics, such that the overall design and safety characteristics of the reactor are not sensitive to the value of the PCR. For other reactor design concepts a PCR which is both large and negative is an important aspect in the design of their engineered systems for controlling reactivity. It will be demonstrated that during Loss of Regulation Control (LORC) and Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LBLOCA) events, the impact of variations in power coefficient, including a hypothesized larger than estimated PCR, has no safety-significance for CANDU reactor design. Since the CANDU 6 PCR is small, variations in the range of values for PCR on the performance or safety of the reactor are not significant...|$|R
30|$|Lignin is {{the main}} {{obstacle}} to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides. Plant cell walls consist of cellulose microfibrils embedded in an amorphous matrix of lignin and hemicelluloses through chemical and physical interactions, in which covalent bonds {{are considered to be}} present between lignin and hemicelluloses [6, 7]. The difficulty in degrading lignin results from not only interaction with polysaccharides, but also the inherent complexity of the chemical structure. Phenylpropane units with three different methoxy substitutions on the aromatic rings, known as guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units, are connected via C–O and C–C linkages, including primarily β-O- 4, β- 5, β-β, 5 - 5, 4 -O- 5, and β- 1 types [8, 9]. The resulting lignin macromolecule cannot be isolated in an unmodified form. The relative amounts of G, S, and H units vary between plants species and influence lignin degradability due to differences in the <b>reactivity</b> of each <b>unit</b> [10, 11]. In general, gymnosperm woods (softwood) contain only G units, angiosperm woods (hardwood) have both G and S units, and grasses have additional H units. In the alkaline delignification process of kraft pulping, S units are known to be more readily removed than G units [11, 12].|$|R

S. The primary barrier to uranium release from this material in the subsurface is the material itself. A better understanding the chemical and physical properties of the material is therefore critical. Biogenic uraninite is fascinating from the standpoint that particle size (typically 2 to 5 nm), molecular-scale structure, and unit cell composition all have been posited to strongly moderate its stability in the subsurface. In particular, there has been concern that the nanosize of this material induces strain that destabilizes the material. We have used EXAFS, in situ synchrotron powder diffraction, TEM, XPS, and continuous-flow dissolution measurements to assess the impacts of size, structure, and composition on the stability of biogenic uraninite.

Methods: The study groups were comprised of 49 anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) -positive untreated-CD, and 123 controls (EMA-negative treated CD, EMA-negative chronic diarrhea, autoimmune hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and healthy people).
