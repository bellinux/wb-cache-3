According to the prosecution, this is the telephone call {{known to have been}} made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the <b>radio</b> <b>log</b> is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E

Bamber's new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the <b>radio</b> <b>log</b> that, they say, shows Neville called police that night to say his daughter had [...] "gone berserk" [...] {{with one of his}} guns. A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{records of}} Lurline surrendered to Lt. Cmdr. George W. Pease, 14th Naval District in Honolulu, have disappeared. Neither Lurlines log, nor the {{reports to the}} Navy or Coast Guard by Grogan in Hawaii have been found. Thus no contemporaneously written evidence of what was recorded aboard Lurline is now available. Grogan commented on a signal source [...] "moving" [...] eastward in the North Pacific over several days as shown via [...] "relative bearings" [...] which then [...] "bunched up" [...] and stopped moving. However, the directions given by Grogan in a recreation of the logbook for the Matson Line were 18 and 44° off from known strike force positions and instead pointed towards Japan. According to author Jacobsen, Japanese commercial shipping vessels are the likely source. A recently discovered missing personal report written by Grogan after the <b>radio</b> <b>log</b> had been passed to the 13th Naval District, dated 10 December 1941 and titled [...] "Record for Posterity", also does not support claims of Kido Butai broadcasting.|$|E

The state of the boat gave no indication that it had been overrun by a rogue wave, or that any accident had occurred which might have caused Crowhurst to fall overboard.

Although his biographers, Tomalin and Hall, discounted the possibility that some sort of food poisoning contributed to his mental deterioration, they acknowledged that there is insufficient evidence to rule it, or several other hypotheses, out.|$|E
