5000|$|Previously, {{there were}} two {{categories}} of signs considered nonconforming: nonconforming [...] "compensable" [...] and nonconforming [...] "grandfathered". Due to the 1978 Amendments, the status of some billboards changed due to a locality enacting more <b>restrictive</b> <b>sign</b> ordinance than the state criteria. These are labeled as 1978 Amendment signs. Generally, signs in this category are not placed in the legal, conforming categories under federal or state requirements. As with other nonconforming signs, the removal of such signs require the payment of just compensation.|$|E
5000|$|As a legislator, Bourdon took an {{interest}} in issues of concern to anglophone Quebecers and Quebecers from cultural communities. He criticized the Bourassa government's 1991 announcement of a ten per cent hiring target for anglophones in the civil service, saying that anglophones were already welcome to apply for positions and did not face discrimination. He argued that the government should instead determine why anglophones were not already applying in larger numbers. Later in the same year, Bourdon served on a PQ task force on the rights of Quebec anglophones; in this capacity, he recommended easing Quebec's <b>restrictive</b> <b>sign</b> laws to permit a greater use of English-language signs at commercial establishments. He was quoted as saying, [...] "We have to head toward a relaxing of the legislation on commercial signs. Even though I don't think the law is breaching a fundamental right, it's very clear it's perceived as such by the Quebec anglophone community. It's an abscess to them." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize to an {{arbitrary}} order, under minimal hypotheses, some sufficient conditions for Lipschitz {{continuity of the}} optimal control. The proof combines the approach by Hager in 1979 for dealing with first-order state constraints, and the high-order alternative formulation of the optimality conditions. It {{takes into account the}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>sign</b> conditions taken into account in some recent papers...|$|E
5000|$|Prohibitory and <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> are {{classified}} as regulatory signs, as per the MUTCD.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} all {{circular}} like the <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs,</b> but feature white symbols {{on a blue}} background.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} used to set the {{obligations}} of all traffic which use a specific area of road. Unlike prohibitory or <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs,</b> mandatory signs tell traffic what it must do, rather than must not do.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} MUTCD prohibitory and <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> were text-only (i.e. NO LEFT TURN). Some {{of these}} signs {{continue to be}} used in the US.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all prohibitory signs use a red {{circle with}} a slash. <b>Restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> {{typically}} use a red circle, as in Europe. Some may be {{seated on a}} rectangular white background.|$|R
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} road signs {{which are used}} to set the {{obligations}} of all traffic which use a specific area of road. Unlike prohibitory or <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs,</b> mandatory signs tell traffic what it must do, rather than must not do. Most mandatory road signs are circular, may use white symbols on a blue background with white border or black symbols on a white background with a red border, although the latter is also associated with prohibitory signs.|$|R
5000|$|Road {{signs in}} Cambodia are {{standardized}} road signs {{similar to those}} used in other nations but with certain differences. Until the early 1980s, Cambodia closely followed US, Australian, and Japanese practices in road sign design, with diamond-shaped warning <b>signs</b> and circular <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> to regulate traffic. Cambodia failed to resolve the traffic signs are in English except where otherwise solved! ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> {{are mostly}} circular, with black symbols {{on a white}} {{background}} with a red border. The exceptions are zone signs which are rectangular, and no parking signs which use a red symbol on a blue background. These signs are valid from where they stand and for {{the entirety of the}} road until it is ended by another sign, or until the next crossroads depending on the specific sign.|$|R

50|$|Road {{signs in}} Malaysia are {{standardised}} road signs {{similar to those used}} in Europe but with certain distinctions. Until the early 1980s, Malaysia closely followed Australian, Irish and Japanese practice in road sign design, with diamond-shaped warning <b>signs</b> and circular <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> to regulate traffic. Signs usually use the FHWA Series fonts (Highway Gothic) typeface also used in the United States, Canada, and Australia, as well as New Zealand, although some signs on recently completed expressways use Transport Heavy (cf. the second image shown to the right). However, the new format sign is used a special font be cooked up for Malaysia sign from Malaysian Highway Authority (LLM). The font called LLM Lettering. The font has two type of typefaces, LLM Narrow and LLM Normal.|$|R
5000|$|Bassist David [...] "Yorkie" [...] Palmer {{elaborated}} on the album's concept: [...] "The album basically {{deals with}} the subject of surveillance and a certain loss of freedom in modern society. On different levels from like the tiny sort of <b>restrictive</b> <b>signs</b> you see everywhere like you know: no ball games, no trespassing, no dogs, no cycling, clean it up to more oppressive things {{on a larger scale}} such as cameras in the back of police vans, helicopters with cameras in. Generally the whole idea that even though you may think you live in the most idyllic place every place comes with its own restrictions that prohibit you doing certain things and we just found it interesting because it seems to be an unnameable group of people who put these restrictions into place, it doesn't seem to be by general consensus." [...] Some of the lyrics deal with Tommy Scott's feelings of raising a family in suburbia, and how it parallels with having spent most of his youth living on a council estate plagued by high levels of crime and unemployment (as previously discussed in the song [...] "Neighbourhood"), as well as his opinions and experiences in the music industry.|$|R
5000|$|The Goodies, {{dressed as}} policemen, turn an Identikit into an Identikit Game (for all the family), and open [...] "The Coppe Shoppe" [...] (where they sell {{handcuffs}} as a 'charm bracelet', and also sell police helmets). Riding their trandem, they give flowers to people, take away <b>restrictive</b> traffic <b>signs</b> and traffic meters, paint LOVE on the road, block off some streets so {{that children can}} use the streets to play in, and go swimming in a [...] "no swimming" [...] area at a park. Everyone begins to love the police, including small children (who run to the Goodies and mob them, whenever they see them).|$|R
40|$|Language, {{which allows}} complex ideas to be communicated through {{symbolic}} sequences, is a characteristic feature {{of our species}} and manifested in a multitude of forms. Using large written corpora for many different languages and scripts, we show that the occurrence probability distributions of signs at {{the left and right}} ends of words have a distinct heterogeneous nature. Characterizing this asymmetry using quantitative inequality measures, viz. information entropy and the Gini index, we show that the beginning of a word is less <b>restrictive</b> in <b>sign</b> usage than the end. This property is not simply attributable to the use of common affixes as it is seen even when only word roots are considered. We use the existence of this asymmetry to infer the direction of writing in undeciphered inscriptions that agrees with the archaeological evidence. Unlike traditional investigations of phonotactic constraints which focus on language-specific patterns, our study reveals a property valid across languages and writing systems. As both language and writing are unique aspects of our species, this universal signature may reflect an innate feature of the human cognitive phenomenon.

40|$|Background: There {{are several}} occupations that can expose people to some air pollutants. Dental {{technicians}} {{are exposed to}} inorganic dust and chemical vapors when making dental prosthesis that can put them at risk for respiratory problems. This study was performed to assess respiratory dysfunction {{in a group of}} dental technicians. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study designed to ascertain the prevalence of respiratory disorders in dental laboratory technicians in Rasht, a city located in north of Iran. A Structured questionnaire was adapted according to the European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire and used to elicit information regarding sociodemographic characteristics and medical status of the study participants. The ventilation status, protective measures and direct exposure to materials in the laboratories were directly observed by the observers and subjects underwent respiratory tests and chest x-ray. Results: The mean age of dental technicians was 31. 31 yrs (range 18 - 56 years) and 83 % were males with a mean dental work experience of 9. 04 years. In 54. 8 % of cases, the work environment did not have air conditioning system. The most common signs and symptoms were cough (38. 1 %) and wheezing (16. 7 %). There was a significant correlation between smoking and respiratory <b>signs.</b> <b>Restrictive</b> airway pattern and air trapping were two prevalent findings which were observed in 85. 7 % and 33. 3 % of the subjects. Cigarette smoking had a negative effect on FEV 1, FEF 25 %- 75 %, and TLC causing a significant reduction in all three parameters (p< 0. 05). The most prevalent finding was interstitial opacity which was observed in 10 individuals (23. 8 %). This finding was not significantly associated with age, gender, cigarett...|$|R
40|$|Firms acquire {{technologies}} through internal R&D and/or technology licensing {{from external}} sources. Taiwanese firms {{had a long}} history of paying technology licensing fees and thus Taiwan suffer long-term deficit in technology trading. This study is intended to discuss the factors how to influence restrictive clauses, and this research adopts to AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) method, thus this study decides to research about restrictive clauses' content of technology licensing behavior, as well as test the differences of industries how to influence <b>signing</b> <b>restrictive</b> clauses. Empirical findings include that(1) the large part content of restrictive clause are licensing scope, because licensor in order to protect licensing scope of the technology, as well as prevent licensee from sublicensing, result in lowering technology value. (2) Via the regression analyses the result detects, the opposite sum of asset negotiate to the restrictive clauses without the obvious impact, the opposite patent number, absorptive ability, expected sales and time have the obvious impact. Restrictive clauses in technology licensing contracts vary significantly and significant difference exists in clause application across industries. Empirical results of this research suggest that Taiwanese firms should be cautious in negotiating technology licensing contracts, especially restrictive clauses that carries strategic content, less firms should suffer future technological dependence and strategic inflexibility. 國內廠商取得技術的途徑，有內部自行研發和技術授權等兩種方式，而付給授權廠商大筆技術授權金與移轉費用，對國內廠商而言更是沉重的負擔，為了解影響限制條款議定的因素，因此本研究以國內上市上櫃公司為主，來探討技術授權行為中簽訂授權契約限制條款之影響因素，並利用分析層級程序法（AHP, Analytic Hierarchy Process），將契約限制條款之質化資料，轉化為可衡量比較的數值，以作為未來國內廠商在簽訂技術授權契約的參考。 研究結果發現（ 1 ）「授權範圍」類型的限制內容最多，由於技術人為了保護該技術的使用範圍，避免被授權廠商透過再授權的方式，將其技術普遍流通於市場中，而降低該技術的使用價值。（ 2 ）相對專利數比、吸收能力和契約期間對契約限制條款嚴格程度有顯著影響；預期技術獲利能力則呈現部分顯著的情況；而相對規模比對契約限制條款之影響不顯著。研究結果建議國內需要技術廠商在簽訂技術授權契約的協商過程中，能注意到限制條款內容的簽訂，避免日後遭國外技術授權廠商設計不合理的條款所牽制，造成技術依賴或策略僵化。第一章 緒論 第一節 研究背景 [...] - 1 第二節 研究動機 [...] - 2 第三節 研究目的 [...] - 4 第四節 研究流程 [...] - 5 第五節 研究範圍與研究對象 [...] - 6 第二章 文獻探討 第一節 交易成本理論 [...] - 7 第二節 技術移轉 [...] - 8 第三節 技術授權 [...] 14 第四節 談判力 [...] 19 第三章 研究方法 第一節 研究架構 [...] 22 第二節 研究假說 [...] 24 第三節 研究變數之定義及衡量 [...] 27 第四節 資料收集 [...] 31 第五節 資料分析方法 [...] 33 第四章 資料分析與實證結果 第一節 樣本特徵分析 [...] 42 第二節 技術授權契約調查問卷之分析 [...] 48 第三節 多元迴歸實證結果 [...] 60 第五章 結論與建議 第一節 研究結論與管理意涵 [...] 63 第二節 未來研究方向與建議 [...] 67 附錄一 [...] - 68 附錄二 [...] - 77 參考文獻 [...] 10...|$|R
