25|$|NASA {{extends the}} Kepler {{mission to the}} K2 mission, a reduced two <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel</b> {{operation}} mode necessitated by faults in the originally designed four wheel mode used to accurately aim the telescope, to continue exoplanet discovery {{as well as new}} scientific observation opportunities.|$|E
25|$|CMGs {{differ from}} {{reaction}} wheels. The latter apply torque simply by changing rotor spin speed, but the former tilt the rotor's spin axis without necessarily changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For {{a few hundred}} watts and about 100kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of newton meters of torque. A <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel</b> of similar capability would require megawatts of power.|$|E
50|$|The JWST {{telescope}} {{still has}} spinning <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{which can be}} adjusted to point the telescope without using propellant. The gyroscopes are sensors that provide information, while the <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> are devices that physically change {{the orientation of the}} spacecraft. JWST has both <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> and gyroscopes, which work together with the other systems to keep the telescope in the right orbit and pointed in the desired direction.|$|R
50|$|On July 14, 2012, one of {{the four}} <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> used for fine {{pointing}} of the spacecraft failed. While Kepler requires only three <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field.|$|R
50|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Minotaur, high electrical currents were {{detected in the}} satellite's <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> causing them to be shut down. There was no indication of a fault, and after the protection limits were adjusted, orientation with <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> was resumed the following day.|$|R

2500|$|Four [...] {{monopropellant}} thrusters provided spacecraft steering during main thruster burns, {{and twelve}} [...] monopropellant thrusters {{were used for}} attitude control. For precision attitude control, a <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel</b> attitude control system was also included. Information for attitude control was provided by star trackers, an inertial measurement unit and six sun sensors.|$|E
2500|$|... 17 January – NASA {{announces that}} the Kepler space {{observatory}} {{has developed a}} <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel</b> issue and will discontinue operation for 10 days {{in the interest of}} solving the problem. Three functional reaction wheels are needed to accurately aim the telescope; one of Keplers original four reaction wheels failed in July 2012. If this second wheel issue is not resolved, NASA may be forced to end the long-running Kepler mission altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Rosetta <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> {{also showed}} higher than {{expected}} vibration, though testing revealed {{the system could}} be operated more efficiently resulting in less wear on the wheels. Before hibernation, two of the spacecraft's four <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> began exhibiting [...] "noise". Engineers turned on three of the wheels after the spacecraft awoke, including one of the bad wheels. The other improperly functioning wheel was held in reserve. Additionally, new software was uploaded which would allow Rosetta to function with only two active <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> if necessary.|$|R

2500|$|It {{is worth}} noting that [...] "saturation" [...] can only apply to a cluster of two or more CMGs, since it means that their rotor spins have become parallel. It is {{meaningless}} to say that a single constant-speed CMG can become saturated; in a sense it is [...] "permanently saturated" [...] in whatever direction the rotor happens to be pointing. This contrasts with a single <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel,</b> which can absorb more and more angular momentum along its fixed axis by spinning faster, until it reaches saturation at its maximum design speed.|$|E

40|$|This report {{introduces}} an optimization {{approach to}} finding {{the best way to}} orient three <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> on an orbiting spacecraft. For this purpose, a quadratic cost function is constructed based on torque, momentum storage, and power requirements. Since momentum management is such an important issue for an orbiting spacecraft, a simple momentum management strategy is also parametrized and included as part of the overall optimization process. The main consideration in this study is to find an orientation which minimizes mass and power of the required <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels,</b> while allowing a specified maximum amount of time between momentum dumps for science acquisition. Several case studies are given to demonstrate convergence of the method, including an application to the NASA/JPL’s future Europa orbiter mission. This is a preliminary study which considers the orientation of 3 <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels.</b> A future report will consider the more complex case of orienting 4 <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels...</b>|$|R

5000|$|From July 2012 to May 11, 2013, {{two out of}} {{the four}} <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> in the Kepler {{telescope}} failed. This loss severely hampered Kepler ability to maintain a sufficiently precise orientation to continue its original mission. On August 15, 2013, engineers concluded that Keplers <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> cannot be recovered and that planet searching using the transit method (measuring changes in star brightness caused by orbiting planets) could not continue. Although the failed <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> still function, they are experiencing friction exceeding acceptable levels, and consequently hindering {{the ability of the}} telescope to properly orient itself. The Kepler telescope was returned to its [...] "point rest state", a stable configuration that uses small amounts of thruster fuel to compensate for the failed <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels,</b> while the Kepler team considered alternative uses for Kepler that do not require the extreme accuracy in its orientation as needed by the original mission. On May 16, 2014, NASA extended the Kepler mission to a new mission named K2, which uses Kepler differently, but allows it to continue searching for exoplanets.|$|R

50|$|On August 15, 2013, NASA {{announced}} that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues {{with two of}} the four <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> failed. An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's capabilities, its two good <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> and its thrusters. Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost.|$|R
50|$|Attitude {{control for}} CubeSats relies on miniaturizing {{technology}} without significant performance degradation. Tumbling typically occurs {{as soon as}} a CubeSat is deployed, due to asymmetric deployment forces and bumping with other CubeSats. Some CubeSats operate normally while tumbling, but those that require pointing in a certain direction or cannot operate safely while spinning, must be detumbled. Systems that perform attitude determination and control include <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels,</b> magnetorquers, thrusters, star trackers, Sun sensors, Earth sensors, angular rate sensors, and GPS receivers and antennas. Combinations of these systems are typically seen in order to take each method's advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. <b>Reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> are commonly utilized for their ability to impart relatively large moments for any given energy input, but <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel's</b> utility is limited due to saturation, the point at which a wheel cannot spin faster. Examples of CubeSat <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> include the Maryland Aerospace MAI-101 and the Sinclair Interplanetary RW-0.03-4. <b>Reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> can be desaturated with the use of thrusters or magnetorquers. Thrusters can provide large moments by imparting a couple on the spacecraft but inefficiencies in small propulsion systems cause thrusters to run out of fuel rapidly. Commonly found on nearly all CubeSats are magnetorquers which run electricity through a solenoid to take advantage of Earth's magnetic field to produce a turning moment. Attitude-control modules and solar panels typically feature built-in magnetorquers. For CubeSats that only need to detumble, no attitude determination method beyond an angular rate sensor or electronic gyroscope is necessary.|$|R

50|$|In 2004, {{during the}} mission of the Hayabusa spacecraft, an X-axis <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel</b> failed. The Y-axis wheel failed in 2005, causing the craft to rely on {{chemical}} thrusters to maintain attitude control.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{servicing}} {{missions to}} the Hubble Space Telescope have replaced a <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel.</b> In February 1997, the Second Servicing Mission (STS-82) replaced one after electrical anomalies, {{rather than any}} mechanical problem. Study of the returned mechanism provided {{a rare opportunity to}} study equipment that had undergone long-term service (7 years) in space, particularly for the effects of vacuum on lubricants. This was found to be in excellent condition. In 2002, Servicing Mission 3B (STS-109), astronauts from the shuttle Columbia replaced another <b>reaction</b> <b>wheel.</b> Neither of these wheels had failed and Hubble was designed with four redundant wheels, and maintained pointing ability so long as three were functional.|$|E

50|$|The {{failure of}} one or more <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> can cause a {{spacecraft}} to lose its ability to maintain position and thus potentially cause a mission failure.|$|R
2500|$|During {{its time}} {{in orbit around}} Vesta, the probe {{experienced}} several failures of its <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels.</b> Investigators planned to modify their activities upon arrival at Ceres for close range geographical survey mapping. The Dawn team stated that they would orient the probe using a [...] "hybrid" [...] mode utilizing both <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> and ion thrusters. Engineers determined that this hybrid mode would conserve fuel. On November 13, 2013, during the transit, in a test preparation, Dawn engineers completed a 27-hour-long series of exercises of said hybrid mode.|$|R

These spacecraft indicate a similar effect, although for various reasons (such as their relative proximity to the Sun) firm conclusions cannot be drawn from these sources. The Cassini mission has <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> as well as thrusters for attitude control, and during cruise could rely for long periods on the <b>reaction</b> <b>wheels</b> alone, thus enabling precision measurements. It also had radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted close to the spacecraft body, radiating kilowatts of heat in hard-to-predict directions.|$|R
