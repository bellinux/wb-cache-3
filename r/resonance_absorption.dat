2500|$|Gamma {{spectroscopy}} is {{the study}} of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays. As in optical spectroscopy (see Franck Condon effect) the absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a [...] "resonance") when the energy of the gamma ray is {{the same as that of}} an energy transition in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the Mössbauer effect the narrow <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type.|$|E
2500|$|Resonant {{absorption}} by nuclear spins {{will occur}} only when electromagnetic radiation {{of the correct}} frequency (e.g., equaling the Larmor precession rate) is being applied to match the energy difference between the nuclear spin levels in a constant magnetic field of the appropriate strength. The energy of an absorbed photon is then , where ν0 is the resonance radiofrequency that has to match (that is, {{it has to be}} equal to the Larmor precession frequency νL of the nuclear magnetization in the constant magnetic field B0). Hence, a magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> will only occur when , which is when [...] Such magnetic resonance frequencies typically correspond to the radio frequency (or RF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum for magnetic fields up to roughly 20T. It is this magnetic resonant absorption which is detected in NMR.|$|E
2500|$|For spin 1/2 nuclei, {{the energy}} {{difference}} between the two spin states at a given magnetic field strength is proportional to their magnetic moment. However, even if all protons have the same magnetic moments, they do not give resonant signals at the same frequency values. This difference arises from the differing electronic environments of the nucleus of interest. Upon application of an external magnetic field, these electrons move in response to the field and generate local magnetic fields that oppose the much stronger applied field. This local field thus [...] "shields" [...] the proton from the applied magnetic field, which must therefore be increased in order to achieve <b>resonance</b> (<b>absorption</b> of rf energy). Such increments are very small, usually in parts per million (ppm). For instance, the proton peak from an aldehyde is shifted ca. 10 ppm compared to a hydrocarbon peak, since as an electron-withdrawing group, the carbonyl deshields the proton by reducing the local electron density. The difference between 2.3487 T and 2.3488 T is therefore about 42 ppm. However a frequency scale is commonly used to designate the NMR signals, even though the spectrometer may operate by sweeping the magnetic field, and thus the 42 ppm is 4200Hz for a 100MHz reference frequency (rf).|$|E

However, optical losses in the form of <b>resonance</b> <b>absorptions</b> in these ultrathin devices have been observed.

5000|$|Leonhardt's insight {{inspired}} Barnett's 2010 resolution, {{wherein the}} Abraham version is the kinetic momentum and the Minkowski version is the canonical momentum; “the kinetic momentum {{of a body}} is simply the product of its mass and velocity”, while “the canonical momentum of a body is simply Planck’s constant divided by its de Broglie wavelength”. Barnett argues that the medium Einstein-box thought experiment (also known as “Balazs thought experiment”) supports Abraham momentum while the photon-atom Doppler <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> experiment supports Minkowski momentum. In other words, the photon takes Abraham momentum in the Einstein-box thought experiment, while it takes Minkowski momentum in the photon-atom Doppler <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> experiment; with both Abraham and Minkowski momentums being correct photon momentums. However Wang disagrees, criticizing that “In Barnett’s theory, the argument for supporting Abraham momentum {{is based on the}} analysis of the Einstein-box thought experiment by the ‘center-of-mass-energy’ approach, where the global momentum-energy conservation law is employed to obtain Abraham photon momentum and energy in the medium box in the laboratory frame. At first sight, such an approach is indeed impeccable; however, upon more careful investigation, one may find that the approach itself has implicitly assumed the Abraham momentum to be the correct momentum; thus leaving readers an open question: Do the Abraham momentum and energy obtained still satisfy the global momentum-energy conservation law in all inertial frames of reference so that the argument is consistent with the principle of relativity?” ...|$|E

However each element of the core has a specific temperature coefficient of reactivity (e.g. the fuel or cladding). The mechanisms which drive fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity are different than water temperature coefficients. While water expands as temperature increases, causing longer neutron travel times during moderation, fuel material will not expand appreciably. Changes in reactivity in fuel due to temperature stem from a phenomenon known as doppler broadening, where <b>resonance</b> <b>absorption</b> of fast neutrons in fuel filler material prevents those neutrons from thermalizing (slowing down).|$|E

50|$|A {{more precise}} {{confirmation}} of the relativistic Doppler effect was achieved by the Mössbauer rotor experiments.
