5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
5|$|The current I-195 was {{initially}} planned as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it became two proposed freeways Route 37 and Route 38 {{that were to}} cross {{the central part of}} the state. A compromise was <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single freeway between Trenton and Belmar which would get Interstate Highway funding as I-195. It was built in several stages during the 1970s and 1980s. There once existed a plan to extend the I-195 designation west to the upcoming interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, but it was instead decided to extend the I-295 designation west and south, along existing I-95, to the new interchange.|$|E

5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E

During the summer of 2000, Six Feet Under participated in the Vans Warped Tour, a festival that, at the time, usually featured punk rock bands.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Musa Kazim on 27 March 1934, Christian {{executive}} vice-president Yacoub Farraj became acting president. No agreement could be <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> permanent successor, and no further Congresses were held. Its role was surpassed {{by a number of}} Palestinian Arab political parties representing the interests of particular families and individuals, or identifying with specific locations: the Istiqlal (1932), National Defence Party (1934), Arab Reform Party (1935), National Bloc Party (1935) and the Palestine Arab Party (1935). In 1932 a small group was formed in the Jaffa-Ramleh area, the Palestine Youth Party.|$|E

500|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more. The newly formed Main Roads Board took over control and maintenance of the Perth–Albany road and twenty-one other important roads between 1926 and 1928, which were declared [...] "main roads". At this stage the Perth–Albany road was not much more developed than a bush track. To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the Board's work schedule prioritised upgrading the worst individual segments, rather than any one road. In 1928/29, twenty-two separate sections of the Perth–Albany road were improved, but many were short, and drivers would experience quite varied conditions, from new sealed road to gravel road, and then a boggy dirt in just a few miles. By 1932, the improved conditions allowed an average speed of [...] to be <b>reached,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total trip of eight to nine hours instead of two days.

500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when {{she got out of}} bed to pray, but instead <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1935 Pinus radiata {{was first}} {{introduced}} as a commercial tree crop, to the district - as the trees were found not to be adversely affected by the local soil deficiencies. [...] As the initial crops matured, Tokoroa was then developed as a residential satellite for Kinleith Mill workers (New Zealand Forest Products Limited's integrated timber, pulp and paper mill), approximately 8km south of the township.

By the early 1970s, however, Tokoroa <b>reached,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, a population of over 20,000 - the number necessary to be officially deemed a city.
