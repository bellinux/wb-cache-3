5|$|In the UK Albums Chart, it charted {{at number}} 119, and again did not <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> this {{position}} {{and had a}} better chart performance on its R Albums Charts, where it peaked at number eight. In the French Album Charts, it debuted at number 56, and again did not <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> this position. After charting on the chart for five consecutive weeks, it {{fell out of the}} top two-hundred positions by October 2009. Man on the Moon: The End of Day also found its peak at number 56 again on the Swiss Album Charts. In Australia, on the week commencing September 28, 2009, the album reached its peak of 85 on the ARIA Chart. As of April 22, 2016, the album has sold 860,000 copies in the United States. On July 12, 2017, Man on the Moon: The End of Day was certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of two million units.|$|E

5|$|The 2004–08 {{volcanic}} activity of Mount St. Helens {{has been documented}} as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004 there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.|$|E

5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing.

5|$|Kala debuted {{at number}} {{eighteen}} on the US Billboard 200, selling 29,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It failed to <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> this position but still significantly outperformed the peak position of 190 attained by M.I.A.'s previous album. It also topped the Top Electronic Albums chart. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 5 March 2010, and by September 2013, it had sold 559,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} thirty-nine on the UK Albums Chart, and again did not <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> this position, {{although}} {{as in the}} US this represented an improvement on the chart performance of Arular, which had peaked at number ninety-eight. The album was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 30 January 2009, denoting sales in excess of 60,000 copies within the United Kingdom. In Canada, Kala was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). The album also reached the top forty {{in a number of}} other countries, including Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Norway and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Ficus obliqua occurs from Mount Dromedary (36° S) in {{southern}} New South Wales northwards {{along the coast}} and Great Dividing Range {{to the tip of}} Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. Outside Australia it occurs on New Guinea and offshore islands, through eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi in the west and east into the southwestern Pacific, where it is found in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda. Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content, it occurs on sandstone or latite soils in the Sydney region. The habitat is warm temperate to moist subtropical rainforest. Large specimens can <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> the canopy as emergent trees.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it would almost never <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E
5|$|Explosive eruptions may {{decrease}} and {{be followed}} by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If the lava dome continues to grow, it would eventually <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> the crater rim. The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. Tephra swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows, explosions and eruption columns. The community of Squamish would be abandoned, Highway 99 {{would be out of}} service and destroyed, and traffic adjacent to Vancouver, Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E

5|$|When Victoria's first child, Victoria, Princess Royal, {{was born}} on 21 November 1840, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the {{arrangements}} for the nursery staff. Lehzen put the nursery {{in the hands of}} a Mrs. Southey, a Mrs. Roberts, and Sir James Clark, despite Albert's objections that Clark was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. Eventually, the Princess Royal fell ill, but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel. In fact, the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill. Albert, who was devoted to his first-born, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and be it on her head if the child died. Soon after this argument, Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone.|$|E
