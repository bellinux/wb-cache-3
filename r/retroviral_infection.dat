40|$|Type I interferons (IFNs) are {{well-known}} cytokines that, {{among their}} main functions, are {{key components of}} the host immune response against viral infections. Due to its immune modulation properties, they are commonly used in the therapeutic approach of various <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections,</b> namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In HIV infection, {{it has been shown}} that IFN therapy limits early viral replication, particularly useful on post-exposure prophylaxis. In veterinary medicine, recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω) was the first interferon licensed for use in cats. Several studies have recently shown that this compound seems to stimulate the innate immunity, decreasing clinical signs and co-infections in naturally FIV-infected cats. More than summarizing the main conclusions about rFeIFN-ω in cats, this review emphasizes the immune-modulation properties of IFN therapy, opening new perspectives for its use in <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections.</b> Either in FIV-infected cats or in HIV individuals, type I IFNs seem to induce an innate immune-modulation and should not be overlooked as a therapeutic option in <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

50|$|The gene {{encoding}} this {{protein is}} an endogenous retroviral element {{that is the}} remnant of an ancient <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> integrated into the primate germ line. In the case of syncytin-1 (which is found in humans, apes, and Old World but not New World monkeys), this integration likely occurred more than 25 million years ago. Syncytin-1 {{is one of two}} known syncytin proteins expressed in catarrhini primates (the other being syncytin-2) and one of many syncytins captured and domesticated on multiple occasions over evolutionary time in diverse mammalian species. This is analogous to the incorporation of certain bacterial species into animal cells during the course of evolution that eventually developed into mitochondria.|$|E
50|$|A {{self-sustaining}} T cell {{response would}} make sIBM {{a type of}} autoimmune disorder. When studied carefully, {{it has not been}} impossible to detect an ongoing viral infection in the muscles. One theory is that a chronic viral infection might be the initial triggering factor setting IBM in motion. There have been a handful of IBM cases—approximately 15—that have shown clear evidence of a virus called HTLV-1. The HTLV-1 virus can cause leukemia, but in most cases lies dormant and most people end up being lifelong carriers of the virus. One review says that the best evidence points towards a connection with some type of retrovirus and that a <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> combined with immune recognition of the retrovirus is enough to trigger the inflammation process.|$|E

40|$|Host cell factors {{modulate}} <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections.</b> Among those, cyclophilin A (CypA) promotes virus infectivity by facilitating virus uncoating or capsid unfolding or {{by preventing}} retroviral capsid interaction with cellular restriction factors. In Aotus species, a retrotransposed copy of CypA {{inserted into the}} tripartite motif 5 (TRIM 5) gene encodes a fusion protein which may block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by targeting the incoming virus to ubiquitin-ligated degradation or by interfering with normal uncoating of the incoming particle, rendering those monkeys resistant to infection. In this study, we have extensively analyzed representative specimens from all New World primate genera and shown that the retrotransposed CypA copy is only present in Aotus. We have shown that this inserted copy diverged from its original counterpart and that this occurred prior to Aotus radiation, although no positive selection was observed.

50|$|Walleye {{epidermal}} hyperplasia {{virus is}} a retrovirus classified under, Epsilonretroviruses, a recent genus {{addition to the}} family of Retroviridae. There are three genome sequenced and identified exogenous retroviruses of this genus which include two known types (WEHV-1 and WEHV-2) associated with walleye epidermal hyperplasia disease. Both viral types are confirmed to be the causative agents of the neoplastic condition in the freshwater fish species, the North American Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum). The specific association of <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> with proliferative lesions in fish is based on the presence of retrovirus-like particles (observed via electron microscopy) and reverse transcriptase activity (using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques) from neoplastic tissue. Although both virus types have been observed in lesions of diseased fish, each cell of the infected tissue is host to a specific virus. Transmission studies have also shown that WEHV-2 has been the more proliferative agent of the condition as compared to WEHV-1.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{infectivity}} factor, or Vif, is {{a protein}} found in HIV and other retroviruses. Its {{role is to}} disrupt the antiviral activity of the human enzyme APOBEC (See also APOBEC3G) by targeting it for ubiquitination and cellular degradation. APOBEC is a cytidine deaminase enzyme that mutates viral nucleic acids.Vif is a 23-kilodalton protein that is essential for viral replication. Vif inhibits the cellular protein, APOBEC3G, from entering the virion during budding from a host cell by targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Vif hijacks the cellular Cullin5 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is composed of ElonginB, ElonginC, Cullin5, and Rbx2, (Crystal Structure of the HIV Vif BC-box in Complex with Human ElonginB and ElonginC is solved and shown here) in order to target APOBEC3G for degradation. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G causes hypermutation of the viral genome, rendering it dead-on-arrival at the next host cell. APOBEC3G is thus a host defence to <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> which HIV-1 has overcome by the acquisition of Vif. Targeting Vif has been suggested as a strategy for future HIV drug therapies.|$|E
40|$|Antiviral {{adaptive}} {{immune defenses}} consist of humoral and cell-mediated responses, which together eliminate extracellular and intracellular virus. As most retrovirus-infected individuals do not raise efficient protective antivirus immune responses, {{the relative importance}} of humoral and cell-mediated responses in restraining <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> is not well understood. We utilized retrovirus-resistant I/LnJ mice, which control infection with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) via an adaptive immune mechanism, to assess the contribution of cellular responses and virus-neutralizing antibodies (Abs) to the control of <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection.</b> We found that in retrovirus-infected CD 8 -deficient I/LnJ mice, viral titers exceed the neutralizing capability of antiviral Abs, resulting in augmented virus spread and disease induction. Thus, even in the presence of robust neutralizing Ab responses, CD 8 -mediated responses are essential for full protection against <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{adaptive}} and innate immunity, {{which must}} sense the infection {{to be turned}} on (and can take weeks to become effective {{in the case of}} adaptive immunity) intrinsic immune proteins are constitutively expressed and ready to shut down infection immediately following viral entry.

40|$|International audienceTo better {{understand}} the origins and modes of transmission of HTLV- 3 and to search for other <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections</b> (HTLV- 1, HTLV- 2, foamy viruses), we studied {{the family of a}} HTLV- 3 -infected individual (Pyl 43), from Cameroon. Thirty-five persons were included. All adult men were still actively hunting nonhuman primates (NHP). All women were also butchering and cutting-up animals. Five persons reported a bite by an NHP. While HTLV- 3 infection was only found in Pyl 43, HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 infections were found, respectively, in 5 and 9 persons with one being co-infected by both retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggested intra-familial transmission of HTLV- 1 subtypes B and D and HTLV- 2. One man was infected by a chimpanzee foamy virus, acquired probably 45 years ago, through a bite. Acquisition of <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections</b> still occurs in central Africa involving to various extent not only intra-familial transmission for HTLV- 1 /HTLV- 2 but also direct interspecies transmission from NHP for foamy virus and possibly for HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 3...|$|R
40|$|Retroviral {{envelope}} protein p 15 E and antigenically related proteins have been implicated as potential mediators of immune dysfunction associated with <b>retroviral</b> <b>infections</b> and with neoplasia. Due to its extreme hydrophobicity, purified p 15 E {{has not been}} available in a nondenatured form or in sufficient quantities for detailed studies on the mechanisms of its immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, a plasmid was constructed to direct the synthesis in Escherichia coli of the major hydrophilic region of murine p 15 E.

The recombinant protein also inhibited, by up to an average of 92 % (EC 50 = 2. 1 microM), the proliferation of the murine T-cell line CTLL- 2. These data (i) provide direct evidence that a retroviral {{envelope protein}} can itself inhibit lymphoproliferative function and (ii) map the inhibitory activity to a specific region of p 15 E.

40|$|Background—We {{recently}} reported {{the development of}} culture-derived (CD) platelets with the aim to express any protein of interest in these platelets. 1 We now report a specific protocol of <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> into the progenitor cells and subsequent selection, which allows to generate large amounts of highly homogenous transgene-expressing CD platelets and to study transgene function rapidly and reliably at large-scale ex vivo and in vivo settings. Methods and Results—After <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> and selection, the activation-dependent expression profile of surface markers, aggregation, and granule release were investigated. The function of transgene-expressing CD platelets, the precursor cells {{of which had been}} retrovirally infected, compared well to noninfected CD platelets or freshly isolated platelets. Hence, the <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> protocol did not alter platelet physiology. In contrast, adenoviral infection of precursors to CD platelets resulted in marked functional alterations that obviated their use in analytic experiments.

40|$|AbstractRetroviruses must {{integrate}} their cDNA {{to a host}} chromosome, but {{a significant}} fraction of retroviral cDNA is degraded before integration. XPB and XPD {{are part of the}} TFIIH complex which mediates basal transcription and DNA nucleotide excision repair. <b>Retroviral</b> <b>infection</b> increases when XPB or XPD are mutant. Here we show that inhibition of mRNA or protein synthesis does not affect HIV cDNA accumulation suggesting that TFIIH transcription activity is not required for degradation. Other host factors implicated in the stability of cDNA are not components of the XPB and XPD degradation pathway. Although an increase of retroviral cDNA in XPB or XPD mutant cells correlates with an increase of integrated provirus, the integration efficiency of pre-integration complexes is unaffected. Finally, HIV and MMLV cDNA degradation appears to coincide with nuclear import. These results suggest that TFIIH mediated cDNA degradation is a nuclear host defense against <b>retroviral</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E
