5000|$|Studies of {{recurrent}} febrile seizures {{have shown that}} seizures resulted in impaired learning and memory but also disrupted signaling that normally results in activation of cAMP response element binding factor (CREB), a transcription factor. For rats tested in the inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, normally an activation of CREB occurs by phosphorylation at Ser133. This activation is impaired following recurrent febrile seizures. A seizure-induced modification of a signaling cascade upstream of CREB is suggested by this. Adult rats with infant febrile seizures were treated with <b>Rolipram,</b> a specific phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor (PDE4 inhibitor), which resultes in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and is known to activate CREB by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. <b>Rolipram</b> treatment reversed the learning deficits in rats that had experienced recurrent febrile seizures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rolipram</b> {{has several}} {{activities}} {{that make it}} a continuing focus for research. The etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases involves misfolded and clumped proteins which accumulate in the brain. Cells have a mechanism to dispose of such proteins called the proteasome. However, in Alzheimer's disease and some other conditions the activity of these proteasomes is impaired leading to a buildup of toxic aggregates. Research in mice suggests that <b>rolipram</b> {{has the ability to}} ramp up the activity of proteasomes and reduce the burden of these aggregates. Preliminary evidence suggests that this can improve spatial memory in mice engineered to have aggregate build-up. It continues to be used in research as a well-characterized PDE4 inhibitor. It has been used in studies to understand whether PDE4 inhibition could be useful in autoimmune diseases, [...] Alzheimer's disease, cognitive enhancement, spinal cord injury, and respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD.|$|E
50|$|RBBP4 {{works at}} least in part through the PKA-CREB1-CPB pathway.

It has previously been shown that dopamine D1/D5 agonists such as 6-Br-APB and SKF-38,393 that are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP phosphodieserase inhibitor <b>rolipram</b> reduce memory defects in aged mice.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} found that {{phosphodiesterase}} 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, such as <b>Rolipram,</b> cause emesis as one of their side effects. It has been found that these PDE4 isoforms are expressed in the CTZ and in the brainstem in general. The mRNA products from genes that code for these PDE4 isoforms are plentiful in the CTZ, and not only located in CTZ neurons, but also in glial cells and blood vessels associated with the CTZ neurons. PDE4 mRNAs are transcribed more in the area postrema and the CTZ {{than anywhere else in the}} brainstem. The PDE4 degrades the phosphodiester bonds in the second messenger molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is one of the ways the brain relays information. By modifying cAMP signaling in the CTZ, it is thought that this could mediate the emetic effects of PDE4 inhibitors in the CTZ.|$|E
50|$|The prototypical PDE4 {{inhibitor}} is <b>rolipram.</b> PDE4 inhibitors {{are known}} to possess procognitive (including long-term memory-improving), wakefulness-promoting, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. Consequently, PDE4 inhibitors have been investigated as treatments for {{a diverse group of}} different diseases, including central nervous system disorders such as major depressive disorder (clinical depression), anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, Huntington's disease, stroke, autism and inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. PDE4D inhibition, along with PDE4A inhibition also appears to be responsible for the antidepressant effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Similarly PDE4B inhibition appears to be required for the antipsychotic effects of PDE4 inhibitors, in line with this view PDE4B polymorphisms and altered gene expression in the central nervous system have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in a postmortem study. PDE4 also regulates the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 signalling cascade in the frontal cortex, which may contribute to the antipsychotic and procognitive effects of PDE4 inhibitors. Whereas PDE4C is expressed primarily in the periphery and hence may be partly responsible for the peripheral effects of PDE4 inhibitors (e.g. their anti-inflammatory effects). PDE4 inhibition is also known to attenuate ethanol seeking and consumption in rats, hence suggesting its possible utility in the treatment of alcohol dependence. A few different lines of evidence suggests the therapeutic utility in the treatment of brain tumours.|$|E

As anti-TNF-alpha therapy is effective in rheumatoid arthritis, we investigated the effect of <b>rolipram</b> on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. <b>Rolipram</b> was administered after the onset of clinical arthritis at doses of 0. 5, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg twice daily, with a dose-dependent therapeutic effect on clinical severity and joint erosion.

In vitro studies using bone marrow-derived macrophages confirmed that <b>rolipram</b> directly suppressed TNF-alpha and IL- 12 production following stimulation with IFN-gamma and LPS. The effect of <b>rolipram</b> on T cell activity was studied by measuring Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine production by collagen-stimulated draining lymph node cells from arthritic mice treated in vivo with <b>rolipram.</b> <b>Rolipram</b> reduced IFN-gamma production and increased IL- 10, indicating that <b>rolipram</b> down-regulated the ongoing Th 1 response to type II collagen.

Immunohistochemistry revealed a significant increase in P-selectin expression after 60 [*]min superfusion with PAF which was attenuated by <b>rolipram.</b> LPS exposure of the mesentery for 4 [*]h caused a significant increase in P- and E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) expression. <b>Rolipram</b> pretreatment down-regulated both P- and E-selectin expression but had no effect on ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 expression. Significant increases in plasma cyclic AMP levels were detected at 4. 5 [*]h after <b>rolipram</b> administration. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that <b>rolipram</b> is a potent in vivo inhibitor of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. The effects observed are mediated through endothelial P- and E-selectin downregulation. Therefore, selective PDE- 4 inhibitors may be useful in the control of different inflammatory disorders...|$|E
40|$|Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors {{have been}} shown to induce the cAMP-mediated {{signaling}} pathway by inhibiting cAMP hydrolysis. This study investigated the effect of a PDE 4 inhibitor on the expression of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), which is an endogenous inhibitor of CREmediated transcription, in osteoblastic cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed that <b>rolipram,</b> a PDE 4 inhibitor, stimulates the ICER mRNA in a dose dependent manner. The induction of ICER mRNA expression by <b>rolipram</b> was suppressed by the inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and p 38 MAPK, suggesting the involvement of PKA and p 38 MAPK activation in ICER expression by <b>rolipram.</b> It was previously shown that <b>rolipram</b> induced the expression of TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE, also known as RANKL, ODF, or OPGL) in osteoblasts. This paper provides evidences that a transcriptional repressor like ICER might modulate TRANCE mRNA expression by <b>rolipram</b> in osteoblasts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Both enantiomers of <b>rolipram</b> (1) {{have been}} {{prepared}} in large quantity from a common intermediate rac- 3 -(3 ’-cyclopentyloxy- 4 ’-methoxy) phenyl- 4 -nitro butyric acid (6), which was resolved {{by way of the}} two readily separable diastereoisomeric amides obtained with (S) -(−) -phenylethylamine. Reduction of the nitro group and intramolecular transamidation gave (R) -(−) - 1 and (S) -(+) - 1, respectively. CD spectra of both enantiomers of <b>rolipram</b> are reported and discussed. Both enantiomers of <b>rolipram</b> presented the same potency of inhibitory activity against recombinant cyclic-AMP-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE 4) subtypes...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effect of}} the specific type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor <b>rolipram</b> on intracellular cAMP concentration, nitric oxide (NO) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) formation in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. We found a dose-dependent increase of nitrite accumulation in LPS-stimulated macrophages from 17. 5 to 25. 1 microM nitrite with <b>rolipram,</b> whereas TNF synthesis was suppressed to less than 30 % of control. This was accompanied by an increase from 7. 4 to a maximum of 10. 5 nM cAMP in RAW cells incubated with <b>rolipram.</b> These results were confirmed with the stable cAMP analogue (S) -p-adenosine 3 ', 5 '-cyclic phosphorothioate [(S) -p-cAMPS]. These findings demonstrate that elevation of cAMP in RAW 264. 7 cells by <b>rolipram</b> decreases TNF synthesis and increases NO formation...|$|E
