40|$|Clinical case: A {{ten year-old}} girl, after a Yersinia gastroenteritis, {{developed}} an optic neuritis {{in the left}} eye. She was not treated and resulted ultimately in optic atrophy on the affected side. Six months later a similar episode occurred in the contralateral eye. On this occasion corticosteroid therapy was given.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: It was {{to report}} on Brazilian cases of {{neurological}} complications from bariatric surgery. The literature on the subject is scarce. METHOD: Cases attended by neurologists in eight different Brazilian cities were collected and {{described in the present}} study. RESULTS: Twenty-six cases were collected in this study. Axonal polyneuropathy was the most frequent neurological complication, but cases of central demyelination, Wernicke syndrome, <b>optical</b> <b>neuritis,</b> radiculits, meralgia paresthetica and compressive neuropathies were also identified. Twenty-one patients (80 %) had partial or no recovery from the neurological signs and symptoms. CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery, a procedure that is continuously increasing in popularity, is not free of potential neurological complications that should be clearly presented to the individual undergoing this type of surgery. Although a clear cause-effect relation cannot be established for the present cases, the cumulative literature on the subject makes it important to warn the patient of the potential risks of this procedure...|$|R

METHODS: The clinical characters of optic neuritis caused by antituberculosis drugs among those outpatients and ward patients from January 2003 to January 2013 were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: Optic neuritis caused by antituberculosis drugs was rare(17 / 60000), while retrobulbar neuritis was common. The drugs inducing <b>optical</b> <b>neuritis</b> were mainly ethambutol, followed by isoniazid and streptomycin.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{multiple}} sclerosis relapses refractory to intravenous corticosteroid therapy, plasma exchange is recommended. Immunoadsorption (IA) {{is regarded as}} an alternative therapy, but its efficacy and putative mechanism of action {{still needs to be}} established. Methods We prospectively treated 11 patients with {{multiple sclerosis}} who had <b>optical</b> <b>neuritis</b> and fulfilled the indications for apheresis therapy (Trial registration DE/CA 25 / 00007080 - 00). In total, five IA treatments were performed using tryptophan-IA. Clinical activity (visual acuity, Expanded Disability Status Scale, Incapacity Status Scale), laboratory values and visual evoked potentials were measured before, during and after IA, with a follow-up of six months. Moreover, proteomic analyses were performed to analyze column-bound proteins as well as corresponding changes in patients’ sera. Results After the third IA, we detected an improvement of vision in eight of eleven patients, whom we termed responders. Amongst these, the mean visual acuity improved from 0. 15 [*]±[*] 0. 12 at baseline to 0. 47 [*]±[*] 0. 32 after the third IA (P [*]=[*] 0. 0252) up to 0. 89 [*]±[*] 0. 15 (P [*] P [*]=[*] 0. 03), whereas in non-responders it did not. Proteomic analyses of proteins adsorbed to IA columns revealed that several significant immunological proteins as well as central nervous system protein fragments, including myelin basic protein, had been removed by IA. Conclusions IA was effective in the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory optic neuritis. IA influenced the humoral immune response. Strikingly, however, we found strong evidence that demyelination products and immunological mediators were also cleared from plasma by IA. </p...|$|R

Methods: Quantitative, cross-sectional survey, developed in a university rehabilitation research center between october and december 2012. The users from the Visual Rehabilitation Groups were invited; 13 of them agreed to participate. We performed an occupational therapy evaluation - with anamnesis, performance evaluation and functional vision assessment - an analysis of medical charts and patient description {{with the use of the}} ICF. Results: The major causes of visual impairment were diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, <b>optical</b> <b>neuritis</b> and keratoconus. Some functions and structures of the body, performance and capabilities in activities and participation, environmental factors facilitators or limiters were highlighted in this study, allowing the description of the characteristics of each participant through the functionality and the improvement of the therapeutic planning. Assistive technologies, optical and nonoptical aids used and their everyday benefits were presented. Conclusion: Visual loss, at any level, led to functional impairments, limiting and restricting the participation and performance in everyday activities, interfering with the individuals' independence, autonomy and quality of life. However, the use of optical aids, non-optical aids and environmental adaptations proved to be beneficial for increasing the functionality, showing the influence of external factors on the performance. Knowing and recognizing the existence of diversities within the visual impairment universe allows us to understand who the treated individual is, avoiding the generalization by the visual condition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Others have {{reported}} ocular toxicity after adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy, but this study looked at ocular toxicity in similarly treated patients from large randomized clinical trials. METHODS: Information was retrieved on incidence {{and timing of}} ocular toxicity from the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) database of 4948 eligible patients randomized to receive tamoxifen or toremifene alone or in combination with chemotherapy (either concurrently or sequentially). Case reports of patients with ocular toxicity were evaluated to determine whether ocular toxicity occurred during chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy. Additional information was obtained from participating institutions for patients in whom ocular toxicity occurred after chemotherapy but during administration of tamoxifen or toremifene. RESULTS: Ocular toxicity was reported in 538 of 4948 (10. 9 %) patients during adjuvant treatment, mainly during chemotherapy. Forty-five of 4948 (0. 9 %) patients had ocular toxicity during hormone therapy alone, but only 30 (0. 6 %) patients had ocular toxicity reported either without receiving any chemotherapy or beyond 3 months after completing chemotherapy and, thus, possibly related to tamoxifen or toremifene. In 3 cases, retinal alterations, without typical aspects of tamoxifen toxicity, were reported; 4 patients had cataract (2 bilateral), 12 impaired visual acuity, 10 ocular irritation, 1 <b>optical</b> <b>neuritis,</b> and the rest had other symptoms. CONCLUSION: Ocular toxicity during adjuvant therapy is a common side effect mainly represented by irritative symptoms due to chemotherapy. By contrast, ocular toxicity during hormonal therapy is rare and {{does not appear to}} justify a regular program of ocular examination. However, patients should be informed of this rare side effect so that they may seek prompt ophthalmic evaluation for ocular complaints...|$|R

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>neuritis</b> (ON) is {{characterized}} by inflammation of the optic nerve, {{and is one of}} the first clinical signs of multiple sclerosis (MS). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the animal model used to study MS and ON. the present study evaluated the induction, development and progression of ON using an EAE model induced by 100 mu g or 300 mu g of MOG(35 - 55). An EAE model was induced in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by tail base injection of 100 mu g or 300 mu g of MOG(35 - 55) in complete Freund's adjuvant, supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. On the day of injection and 48 h later, animals received intraperitoneally 300 ng of pertussis toxin. On days 7, 10, 14, 21 and 58 the optic nerve was dissected for histological analysis, production of CCL 5 and immunohistochemical detection of CD 4 and CD 8. the histological changes observed in the optic nerves consisted of inflammatory cell infiltrates showing varying degrees of ON in the two groups. the onset of ON in the 300 mu g of MOG(35 - 55) group was coincident with higher production of CCL 5, on day 10 after induction. However, the 100 mu g MOG(35 - 55) group showed more intense inflammatory infiltrate on day 14 after induction, with higher amounts of CD 4 and CD 8, reaching an excessive demyelination process on days 21 and 58 after induction. the results suggest that two different concentrations of MOG(35 - 55) lead to different forms of evolution of optic neuritis.

Zahvaćenost koštano-zglobnog sustava se javlja u 5 - 10 % bolesnika s ulceroznim kolitisom (UC) i u 10 - 20 % bolesnika s Crohnovom bolešću (CB). Simptomi variraju od blage artralgije do teškog akutnog artritisa. Primarni sklerozirajući kolangitis (PSC), autoimuni hepatitis, bolesti gušterače, kolestaza, kolelitijaza i porast aminotransferaza smatraju se hepatobilijarnim manifestacijama. Najčešće se prepoznaje PSC, osobito kod bolesnika s UC (oko 7, 5 %). Biološka terapija neučinkovita je u liječenju te nema utjecaja na prirodni tijek bolesti. Od kožnih manifestacija najčešće se javljaju nodozni eritem (3 - 20 %) i gangrenozna pioderma (0, 5 - 20 %). Oftalmološki poremećaji javljaju se u 2 - 5 % bolesnika s upalnim bolestima crijeva.

Komplikacije upalnih bolesti crijeva su fistule, stenoze I strikture crijeva, apscesi, perforacije, krvarenja iz probavnog sustava te nastanak karcinoma crijeva i drugih maligniteta. Liječenje anti-TNF lijekovima dokazano je učinkovito jedino u liječenju perianalnih fistula u bolesnika s CB. Extraintestinal manifestations {{occur in}} about 35 % of {{patients}} with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Most frequently affected are bones and joints, skin, eyes, liver and biliary ducts. Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD are divided in two groups: reactive manifestations which depend on activity of IBD – peripheral arthritis, erythema nodosum, aphthous stomatitis, episcleritis and other manifestations which are independent on activity of IBD – pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, axial arthropathy, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Most affected are bones and joints. Symptoms vary from mild arthralgia to severe arthritis with painful swallowing of joints. They occur in about 5 - 10 % {{of patients with}} ulcerative colitis (UC) and in 10 - 20 % of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). Both peripheral and axial joints can be affected. According to available data, most patients with active IBD and concomitant arthritis have benefit from infliximab therapy. Infliximab is also effective in maintenance of remission in group of patients with spondyloarthropathy. Adalimumab showed similar efficacy in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, {{but there are still}} no data about efficacy of adalimumab in treatment of patients with IBD and concomitant arthritis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, cholestasis, cholelithiasis and elevation of aminotransferase are also considered to be extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Most frequent is PSC which affects usually patients with UC (7. 5 % of patients). Course of liver disease is completely independent on activity of IBD, and destruction of biliary ducts is usually irreversible and refractory on treatment and most of the patients need liver transplantation. Anti-TNF therapy is also ineffective in treatment of PSC and has no impact on disease course and outcome. However, there is no contraindication for anti-TNF therapy of concomitant active IBD in this group of patients. Erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) are usual skin manifestations of IBD. Erythema nodosum occurs in about 3 - 20 %, and pyoderma gangrenosum in about 0. 5 - 20 % of patients with IBD. Infliximab is proven to be effective in treatment of PG,but there is still not enough evidence on efficacy of anti-TNF drugs in treatment of EN and other rare skin manifestations of IBD. About 2 - 5 % of patients with IBD have also some ophthalmological disorder. Symptoms vary from mild conjunctivitis to severe inflammation of eye membranes – iritis, episcleritis, scleritis and uveitis. It seems that infliximab and adalimumab can diminish uveitis and scleritis in patients with different autoimmune disorders and IBD. According to guidelines of American Gastroenterology Association (AGA), in group of patients with CD, infliximab is indicated in treatment of spondyloarthropathies, arthritis, arthralgia, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, uveitis and other ophthalmological manifestations of IBD except <b>optical</b> <b>neuritis</b> which can worse or be consequence of anti-TNF treatment. Similar indications exist for use of adalimumab except in case of erythema nodosum. In group of patients with extraintestinal manifestations of UC, infliximab is indicated in treatment of spondyloarthropathies and pyoderma gangrenosum. Complications of IBD are fistulas (perianal and non-perianal), stenosis and strictures, abscesses, bowel perforations, gastrointestinal bleeding and development of different malignomas. Anti-TNF drugs are proven to be effective and indicated only for treatment of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn’s disease. In group of patients with UC, there are only few case reports on beneficial effect of infliximab in treating chronic pouchitis and infliximab in treatment of these patients still cannot be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Background and PurposezzIt is {{exceedingly}} difficult to differentiate benign multiple sclero-sis (BMS) from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) based on clinical characteris-tics, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows quantification of retinal structures, {{such as the}} retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, at the optic disc and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) at the macula, on a micrometer scale. It {{can also be used}} to trace minor alterations and the progression of neurodegeneration, help predict BMS, and influence the choice of therapy. To utilize OCT to detect the extent of changes of the optic disk and macular microstructure in patients with BMS and RRMS compared to healthy con-trols (HCs), with special focus on changes related to the presence/absence of optic neuritis (ON). MethodszzSpectral-domain OCT was applied to examine eyes from 36 patients with multi-ple sclerosis (MS), comprising 11 with BMS and 25 with RRMS, and 34 HCs. ResultszzThe RNFL and GCL were significantly thinner in eyes previously affected by ON, irrespective of the type of MS (i. e., BMS or RRMS), than in HCs. Significant thinning of the GCL was also observed in non-ON RRMS (and not non-ON BMS) compared to HCs. Corre-spondingly, a significant association between disease duration and thinning rates of the RNFL and GCL was observed only in non-ON RRMS (- 0. 54 ± 0. 24 and- 0. 43 ± 0. 21 μm/year, mean± SE; p< 0. 05 for both), and not in non-ON BMS (- 0. 11 ± 0. 27 and- 0. 24 ± 0. 24 μm/year). ConclusionszzThe RNFL and GCL were thinner in both ON- and non-ON MS, but the change was more pronounced in ON MS, irrespective of the MS subtype studied herein. GCL thin-ning and the thinning rate of both the GCL and RNFL were less pronounced in non-ON BMS than in non-ON RRMS. These findings may help to predict the course of BMS.
