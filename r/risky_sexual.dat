25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in <b>risky</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in <b>risky</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E

The inebriated females’ abilities to analyze internal cues warning them of the risks of sex were inhibited by alcohol, while alcohol caused them to become more responsive to the salient cue of arousal.|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} of AIDS cases, {{whether in the}} United States or elsewhere in the world, invariably mirrors the prevalence of HIV in a population. In the United States, HIV first appeared in populations of injection-drug users (a majority of whom are male) and gay men.

Because these behaviors show a gender skew—Western {{men are more likely}} to take illegal drugs intravenously than Western women, and men are more likely to report higher levels of the <b>riskiest</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviors, such as unprotected anal intercourse—it is not surprising that a majority of U.S. AIDS cases have occurred in men.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the links between Internet addiction, engagement in online erotica (including pornography usage and usage of sex-based Internet chat sites), and engagement in <b>risky</b> online <b>sexual</b> behaviors, in this case, sending sexually-explicit pictures to those known only online (i. e., sexting) and expecting to engage in offline sex with those known only online.

2500|$|Alcohol myopia causes {{individuals}} to become increasingly aware of sexual arousal {{and more likely}} to respond rashly to the arousal stimulus. The decision about how to respond to sexual arousal involves cognitive function that synthesizes both impelling cues (those that draw attention to the benefits of an action) and inhibiting cues (those that focus on the consequences of an action). The alcohol myopia theory suggests that intoxicated individuals {{will be more likely to}} engage in <b>risky</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior. Intoxicated males subject to high levels of sexual arousal were more likely to engage in unprotected sex [...] than sober males subject to the same levels of arousal. [...] This is because the impelling cues (sexual arousal) are often more imminent than inhibitory cues (safety precautions), and those affected by alcohol myopia are limited to cognitive processing of the more immediate cues and often ignore the inhibitory cues.|$|E
2500|$|According to an 80-year old {{and ongoing}} study started in 1921 by {{psychologist}} Lewis Terman on over 1,500 gifted adolescent Californians, [...] "The strongest predictor of long life was conscientiousness."

Nine different behaviors that are among the leading causes of mortality—alcohol use, disordered eating (including obesity), drug use, lack of exercise, <b>risky</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior, risky driving, tobacco use, suicide, and violence—are all predicted by low conscientiousness. Health behaviors are more strongly correlated with the conventionality rather than the impulse-control aspect of conscientiousness. Apparently, social norms influence many health-relevant behavior, such as healthy diet and exercise, not smoking and moderate drinking, and highly conscientious people adhere the most strongly to these norms. Additionally, conscientiousness is positively related to health behaviors such as regular visits to a doctor, checking smoke alarms, and adherence to medication regimens.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{evidence}} of a positive SES-HIV gradient in some SSA countries, researchers and policy-makers frequently assume that a range of protective interventions [...] increasing awareness of mechanisms of HIV transmission, techniques for prevention, greater {{access to health care}} facilities, and greater availability of condoms [...] will reduce the likelihood of contracting HIV, even among higher SES populations. We therefore explore the relationships between SES and these intervening behaviors to illuminate the complex factors that link SES and HIV among women in Cameroon. METHODS: We use bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis to examine patterns among the 5, 155 women aged 15 - 49 who participated in the 2004 CDHS. RESULTS: The results show a strong pattern where higher SES women have greater access to and use of health care facilities, higher levels of condom use, more HIV knowledge, and command higher power within their relationships, yet also have higher rates of HIV. These traditionally protective factors appear to be offset by <b>riskier</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviors on the part of women with increased resources, most notably longer years of premarital sexual experience, multiple partners in last 12 months, and sexual encounters outside of relationship. Multivariate analyses suggests net of the effect of other factors, women who command higher decision-making power, have greater access to health care, more negative attitudes toward wife beating, longer years of premarital sexual exposure, and partners with professional/white collar jobs (characteristics associated with rising SES) had higher odds of testing positive for HIV. CONCLUSION: Results show that higher <b>riskier</b> <b>sexual</b> practices on part of high SES women offset benefits that may have accrued from their increased access to resources. The results suggest that traditional approaches to HIV prevention which rely on poverty reduction, improving access to health care, improving HIV knowledge, and boosting women's social and economic power may be insufficient to address other drivers of HIV infection among women in SSA...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 51 - 57). Over {{the past}} decade, {{a number of}} epidemiological studies have found a direct negative correlation between the practice of male circumcision (MC) and the prevalence of HIV in the general population. These studies were supported by three Randomised Control Trials in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa that found that MC can reduce the probability of female to male infection by between 51 and 60 %. Given this, male circumcision is becoming an increasingly discussed addition to HIV prevention programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Using DHS data from Swaziland and Lesotho and BAIS II data from Botswana this paper uses multivariate logistic regressions {{to assess the impact}} of MC on HIV. It further tests for any sample selection bias within the data as a result of non-response of HIV testing. The efficacy of MC in reducing the risk of HIV transmissions is dependent on circumcised men continuing to practice safe sex such as a single partner and condom use. To test for sexual risk a further logistic regression is run using condom use as the dependent variable to determine whether circumcised men engage in <b>riskier</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviour. After controlling for demographic, socio-economic and behavioural determinants of HIV, MC is found to be significant in reducing the probability of being HIV positive in Botswana and Swaziland. In these two countries circumcised men do not appear to engage in <b>riskier</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviour. In Lesotho, despite the high prevalence of MC it does not appear significant in explaining HIV status. This may he explained in part by the fact that circumcised men have a lower probability of using condoms, increasing their risk and negating the effect of MC. Other factors which may explain this relationship in Lesotho is the possibility that traditional circumcision does not remove the entire foreskin and the age at which the circumcision is taking place. All these need to be considered if implementing a large scalp MC programme...|$|R
2500|$|Manic {{states are}} always {{relative}} to the normal state of intensity of the afflicted individual; thus, already irritable patients may find themselves losing their tempers even more quickly and an academically gifted person may, during the hypomanic stage, adopt seemingly [...] "genius" [...] characteristics {{and an ability to}} perform and articulate at a level far beyond that which would be capable during euthymia. [...] A very simple indicator of a manic state would be if a heretofore clinically depressed patient suddenly becomes inordinately energetic, cheerful, aggressive, or [...] "over happy." [...] Other, often less obvious, elements of mania include delusions (generally of either grandeur or persecution, according to whether the predominant mood is euphoric or irritable), hypersensitivity, hyper vigilance, hypersexuality, hyper-religiosity, hyperactivity and impulsivity, a compulsion to over explain, (typically accompanied by pressure of speech) grandiose schemes and ideas, and a decreased need for sleep (for example, feeling rested after only 3 or 4 hours of sleep); {{in the case of the}} latter, the eyes of such patients may both look and feel abnormally [...] "wide" [...] or [...] "open," [...] rarely blinking, and this often contributing to some clinicians’ erroneous belief that these patients are under the influence of a stimulant drug, when the patient, in fact, is either not on any mind-altering substances or is actually on a depressant drug, in a misguided attempt to ward off any undesirable manic symptoms. Individuals may also engage in out-of-character behavior during the episode, such as questionable business transactions, wasteful expenditures of money (e.g., spending sprees), <b>risky</b> <b>sexual</b> activity, abuse of recreational substances, excessive gambling, reckless behavior (as [...] "speed driving" [...] or daredevil activity), abnormal social interaction (as manifest via, for example, over familiarity and conversing with strangers), or highly vocal arguments.

However, beyond the well-known case studies of South African miners and East African truck drivers, the evidence on the links between HIV and mobility is nuanced, contradictory and inconclusive and is in part attributed to the abstract definitions of mobility used in different studies. This problematic conception of mobility, with no reference to who moves, their motivations for moving, or the characteristics of sending and receiving areas, can have a dramatic impact on how one understands the influence which this structural factor has on HIV risk in different settings. Future research on mobility and HIV transmission must incorporate an understanding of migration and mobility as dynamic processes and link different patterns and forms of mobility with location-specific sexual networks and HIV epidemiology. ...|$|R
50|$|According to the hypothesis, <b>riskier</b> <b>sexual</b> {{behaviors}} are more exhilarating and pleasurable, {{and therefore they}} are more likely to stimulate repetitive engagement in such behaviors. When this idea was tested in individuals who were infected with HIV and were substance dependent, differences were found between persons who scored well in the Iowa gambling test, and those who scored poorly. The high scorers showed a correlation between the amount of distress they reported having over their HIV status, and their acceptance of risk during sexual behavior - the greater the distress, the greater the risk that these people would take. The low scorers, on the other hand, showed no such correlation. These results were interpreted as indicating that persons with intact decision-making abilities are better able to rely on past emotional experiences when weighing risks, than are persons who are deficient in such abilities, and that acceptance of risk serves to ameliorate emotional distress.|$|R

40|$|Many {{observers}} believe that wealthy men play a disproportionate {{role in the}} continuing spread of HIV/AIDS infection in sub-Saharan Africa through their involvement in informal exchange relationships, where money and gifts (referred to as “transfers”) are given {{to a range of}} nonmarital sexual partners. In this case, wealthier men are <b>riskier</b> <b>sexual</b> partners because they can afford to give larger transfers, which {{have been found to be}} negatively associated with condom use. Alternatively, wealthier men might have greater incentives to practice safe sex at later stages of the epidemic, or wealthier men might match with female partners who have particularly strong preferences for condom use. Accordingly, economic status would be positively associated with condom use. I use survey data from urban Kisumu, Kenya, to investigate the various mechanisms through which economic status is associated with sexual risk behavior. My results show that wealth is positively associated with transfers; however, wealth is uncorrelated with condom use. The characteristics of wealthier men’s female partners also do not differ from the characteristics of poorer men’s partners. I conclude that wealthier men have stronger preferences for condom use, which offsets the negative effect of larger transfers that they give to their sexual partners. ...|$|R
