500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest. Three {{weeks after}} Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled [...] "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak [...] there were news reports that there was a [...] "vast vault" [...] and [...] "dozens and dozens" [...] of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, [...] "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>are</b> selling in amazing numbers. I think we are going to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2014, Donovan {{was named}} in the {{preliminary}} squad for the 2014 World Cup and joined the team in training camp. However, on May 22, 2014, he was controversially omitted from the final U.S. squad by manager Jürgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann called it [...] "one of the toughest decisions in [...] coaching career", but said, [...] "I just think the other guys <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>are</b> a little bit ahead of him." [...] Klinsmann's decision, which was described by media staff as abruptly timed after Klinsmann had previously promised to {{wait until after the}} team's friendly matches to announce cuts, saw additional controversy when Klinsmann's son Jonathan published and later deleted a post on Twitter that appeared to ridicule Donovan following the announcement.|$|E

6000|$|Disease, {{from time}} to time, will ease the pressure. Diseases are parasites, and it must not be {{forgotten}} that {{just as there are}} drifts in the world of man, so are there drifts in the world of micro-organisms-- hunger-quests for food. Little is known of the micro-organic world, but that little is appalling; and no census of it will ever be taken, for there is the true, literal [...] "abysmal fecundity." [...] Multitudinous as man is, all his totality of individuals is as nothing in comparison with the inconceivable vastness of numbers of the micro-organisms. In your body, or in mine, <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>are</b> swarming more individual entities than there are human beings in the world to-day. It is to us an invisible world. We only guess its nearest confines.
