40|$|Developed countries' {{publicly}} funded {{health care systems}} all share the similar task of deciding which pharmaceuticals should be reimbursed. DECD countries' pharmaceutical <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> achieve this task {{through a number of}} institutions some of which use Health Technology Assessment (HTA) including health economic analysis to inform decision-making. The reimbursement decisions influence the health outcomes of patients, produce signals of the demand curve to manufacturers and may have political consequences. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the use of health economic analysis in DECD countries' <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> and the contribution of health economic analysis and other factors to decision-making. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of previous quantitative and qualitative studies examining the factors contributing to reimbursement decision-making in DECD countries. The review identified limited evidence for comparisons across DECD countries and outlined the methodological limitations of identifying influence. Chapters 3 and 4 categorise DECD <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> using a published framework. Application of the framework identified that Health Economic analysis is used by agencies operating in heterogeneous <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> with respect to the objectives, other institutions, processes, guidelines, interpretation and other factors considered alongside health economic analysis. Chapter 5 uses regression analysis to examine decisions by those agencies that similarly use clinical evidence and health economic analysis, and identifies common factors across four countries. Chapter 6 uses a qualitative methodology to match decisions for an agency using health economic analysis in comparison to one not and found evidence of the influence of health economic analysis alongside other evidence and process factors. Finally, chapter 7 concludes by outlining the differential contribution of health economic analysis depending on how it is used by the systems.

40|$|Most {{investigators}} and policymakers {{assume that the}} functional abilities of long-term care patients are stable over time. If short-run fluctuations in functional ability occur, then reimbursement and quality control systems based on case mix will have to account for whatever changes can be reasonably expected.

Analysis of 191 Veterans Administration extended-care patients over 12 weeks reveals that patient functional status is unstable in some wards and that patients in wards providing a higher level of care {{are more likely to be}} unstable and to be discharged in an improved condition.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system</b> and organizational structure on oral rehabilitation of adult patients with tooth loss. Materials and methods. Patient data were retrieved from the databases of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. The data consisted of treatment records of patients aged 19 years and above claiming reimbursement for dental care from July 1, 2007 until June 30, 2009. Before July 1, 2008, a proportionately higher level of subsidy was available for dental care in patients 65 years and above, but thereafter the system was changed, so that the subsidy was the same, regardless of the patient's age. Prosthodontic treatment in patients 65 years and above was compared with that in younger patients {{before and after the}} change of the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system.</b> Prosthodontic treatment carried out in the Public Dental Health Service and the private sector was also analyzed.

After the change of the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>system,</b> there was a decrease in the proportion of items in patients 65 years and above in relation to those under 65.

Methods: A comprehensive review of publicly available information from peer-reviewed literature (using a variety of bibliographic databases) and gray literature (eg, working papers, committee reports, presentations, and government documents) was conducted. Policy experts in each of the 23 countries were also contacted. All information collected was reviewed by two independent researchers. Results: Most European countries have established centralized <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> for making decisions on health technologies. However, the scope of technologies considered, as well as processes for identifying, selecting, and reviewing them varies. All systems include an assessment of clinical evidence, compiled in accordance with their own guidelines or internationally recognized published ones. In addition, most systems require an economic evaluation. The quality of such information is typically assessed by content and methodological experts. Committees responsible for formulating recommendations or decisions are multidisciplinary. While criteria used by committees appear transparent, how they are operationalized during deliberations remains unclear. Increasingly, <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> are expressing interest in and/or implementing reimbursement policy options that extend beyond the traditional &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;yes with restrictions&quot; options. Such options typically require greater involvement of manufacturers which, to date, has been limited. Conclusion: Centralized <b>reimbursement</b> <b>systems</b> have become an important policy tool in many European countries. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of transparency around critical elements, such as how multiple factors or criteria are weighed during committee deliberations.
