5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a freeway was {{proposed}} by the Delaware Valley <b>Regional</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission to alleviate traffic on US 130 between Camden and Burlington. This freeway was originally planned as a parkway between the two cities in 1932 that never materialized. The proposed freeway, which was to connect the Ben Franklin Bridge to I-295 near the Assicunk Creek, was to cost $53 million and mostly follow a Conrail railroad line between the two cities. However, the NJDOT never followed through with the proposal. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at the southern terminus of the US 30 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and <b>regional</b> <b>planning,</b> real estate development, and urban design.|$|E

In late 1982 Blackwell went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and received a Master's Degree in <b>Regional</b> <b>Planning.</b> Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and life experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the Nassau–Suffolk <b>Regional</b> <b>Planning</b> Board {{brought up}} plans to convert CR78 into a six-lane {{expressway}} with new service roads.

To aid this, ownership and maintenance of CR78 {{was transferred to the}} New York State Department of Transportation on March29, 1972, receiving the designation of NY454. The state immediately expanded NY454 to six lanes, with three in each direction from Holbrook to the terminus of NY347. In 1977, the state designated the portion of the highway in Hauppague as both NY454 and NY347 after {{it became clear that the}} Hauppauge Spur of the Long Island Expressway would not be constructed. The plans to expand NY454 and NY347 into full-blown freeways were discarded by the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Due to the city's {{population}} decline, {{beginning in}} the 1920s and accelerating through the 1950s, local government leaders made several attempts to consolidate services. A preGreat Depression annexation attempt by the city failed due to opposition from county voters, and only after World War II would more efforts be made toward consolidation. The first (and one of the few) successful attempts at consolidation resulted {{in the creation of}} the Metropolitan Sewer District, a citycounty water and sewer company formed in 1954. The next year, however, a citycounty mass transit agency was rejected by voters, followed by a failed charter revision in 1955 that would have unified the city and the county. As the County population grew, local subdivisions began multiplying and incorporating into cities and towns, producing more than 90 separate municipalities by the 1960s. <b>Regional</b> <b>planning</b> advocates succeeded in the 1965 creation of the EastWest Gateway Coordinating Council, a group given the power to approve or deny applications for federal aid from cities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, which {{eliminated}} several concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the designations of routes 25, 43, and 56 {{were removed from}} US30. Prior to the completion of I-676 across the Ben Franklin Bridge in the 1970s, US30 used Penn Street eastbound and Linden Street westbound to travel between the bridge and Admiral Wilson Boulevard. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for US30 in Camden County by the Delaware Valley <b>Regional</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission. The freeway, which was to cost $40million, was to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to I-295 in Barrington with a $16million extension to the planned Route90 freeway in Berlin. The segment between Camden and Barrington was to be complete by 1975 while the extension to Berlin was to be finished by 1985. However, the NJDOT did not build this US30 freeway.
