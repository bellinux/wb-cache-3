40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of {{explicit}} teaching on reading comprehension when EFL learners <b>read</b> <b>signaled</b> text or non-signaled text. The main concern is whether explicit teaching of <b>signal</b> words facilitates <b>reading</b> comprehension. Another issue is whether there is a difference in their reading comprehension scores when students are taught signal words explicitly but read non-signaled texts. The study was conducted at Anadolu University, Education Faculty, English Language Teaching Department. In order to analyze the data mean scores and two- independent-samples t-tests were run. The results of this study indicate that both explicit teaching of <b>signal</b> words and <b>reading</b> <b>signaled</b> texts contribute to the reading comprehension.

40|$|Abstract – The Optical Packet Switching (OPS) paradigm, where optical packets flow in {{the network}} within the optical layer, has the {{potential}} to solve the mismatch between the ever increasing link transmission capacity and the node switching capacity, limited by electronics constraints. Anyway, to make this solution feasible and cost-effective, some technological issues must be faced. In particular OPS network nodes, in analogy with current electronic packet network nodes, require some buffering capability to store the optical packets. Since optical Random Access Memories (RAM) are not available, current solutions exploit Fiber Delay Lines (FDL), whose drawbacks are the fixed and finite memorization time and the sequential access. In this paper we propose a novel approach for optical memories, which exploits Erbium-doped fiber fluorescence. In particular, an Erbium-doped fiber span serves as a one-bit all-optical memory cell associating the bit 1 to the fiber transparency state induced by a strong writing signal, and the bit 0 to the fiber absorption state without excitation. The memory state can be probed injecting a low power <b>reading</b> <b>signal</b> in the fiber span: if it reaches the output port the stored bit is 1, if it is completely absorbed the stored bit is 0. The advantages of this architecture are a long memorization time (up to millisecond range) and the possibility to read the cell at any time (rather than at fixed instants, as happens with FDL). If the memory needs to be reset, a proper erasing signal is sent to speed up the memory cleaning. Experimental results have shown the feasibility of the proposed approach: a one-bit optical memory cell with 2. 5 ms refresh time, 752 μJ writing energy, 316 μJ erasing energy, and contrast ratio up to 21 dB is experimentally demonstrated.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} myth in the Platonic dialogues. It seeks to demonstrate that Plato takes up the task of rewriting the old myths, not in order to clarify the real truth about ancient tales, but to make those tales serve higher&# 8212;ethical&# 8212;ends. Thus Plato makes a valiant effort to replace the old "truths" in order to displace and overcome ethically dangerous assumptions in the old tales. But I shall demonstrate that, despite the changes in mythical content, the old tropes endure in the new form and the dangerous elements of myth persist. The elements of myth that I consider to be most dangerous are the motifs of "fallenness" (as characteristic of the human condition) and the irredeemably tragic dimension of earthly existence (configuring mortal life as a matter for despair). These mythologems endure despite the new imagery that seeks to overcome them {{and they continue to}} breed a "nostalgia" of loss and tragic origins. This is the archaic infection that I see as the spawning ground of ritualistic patterns of human behaviour that are essentially violent. The infection is sublimated but carried along in new contextual forms in Platonic myth, concealed but dynamically present. The persistence of these dangerous elements, in my <b>reading,</b> <b>signal</b> the failure of the Platonic project of purification&# 8212;a failure most clearly evidenced in the tragic character of Eros and in the impotence of the philosopher in the city&# 8212;indeed in Socrates' being ever atopos (without or out of place) with regard to the city (in the Republic) and missing even from the lofty perches reserved for the philosopher (in the Theaetetus) and the lover (in the Symposium). There is no place for Socrates&# 8212;for the truly just and good man&# 8212;in the real cities down under the heavens. No place for him in the upper world of lofty contemplations. Without him, wealth and power and honour will ever rule the human scene and justice will be the ideal of simple fools. That is the essential tragedy of the human condition as it re-emerges in the Platonic corpus...|$|E
