40|$|The pin {{retainer}} band is a 1 - 1 / 4 in. wide by about 1 / 32 in. thick steel band that is stretched over the pins circumferentially {{at the joints}} of the solid rocket booster (SRB) motor case segments. Its purpose is to hold the retaining pins in place during flight. Since the band is thin and is mounted stretched, or under tension, over the pins which are greased in place, {{it is necessary to}} protect it thermally. Three typical areas of the band location on the SRB motor case joints were chosen for verifying the cork thermal prection system (TPS) performance on the band: the joint in front of the attach ring, at the aft skirt joint in front of the kick ring and in an unperturbed area at the forward segments of the SRB motor cases. The kick <b>ring</b> area pin <b>retainer</b> band cork TPS passed the test requirements in the region where there are no phenolic splice caps. In the splice cap areas where the band TPS is closed out around the splice with K 5 NA, additional amounts of K 5 NA material is required to adequately protect the steel band. TPS requirements were easily met in the one location where the ends of the steel band are joined together after installation and tensioning. The attack <b>ring</b> area pin <b>retainer</b> band TPS did not quite pass the heat load requirements with the. 375 in. thick cork TPS as used for the kick ring area band.

During the 1950s the major product {{manufactured}} at the company was miniature ball bearing <b>retainer</b> <b>rings.</b> In 1958 Acme Spring was featured in the April 7th edition of Life magazine. The company was featured because they were a supplier for General Motors. In February 1969 Acme Monaco supplied New Hampshire Ball Bearing Company with retaining rings which were then put onto the Apollo vessel. The product line was expanded to include orthodontic hardware in 1970 {{with the addition of}} rolling and wire shaping. By 1984 the company had merged with Monaco Spring, to create Acme Monaco, and its product line was increased to include springs, wireforms, and stampings. Non-sterile medical assemblies, such as surgical staples, guidewires, and stylets were added in 1983. In 1989 a second manufacturing facility was opened in Presque Isle, Maine, USA. This expansion allowed the company to double capacity. In 2006 another facility was opened in Presque Isle, Maine. Also in 2007 the company opened a medical division Acme Monaco Asia Pte.

40|$|LARES is {{a passive}} {{satellite}} {{designed to measure}} the gravitomagnetic field of Earth predicted by Einstein general relativity. The technique used to accurately measure the satellite position is the laser ranging technique. The satellite is uniformly covered with 92 cube corner reflectors that sends {{back to the ground}} station the laser pulses. Launch is foreseen in 2010 with the new VEGA launch vehicle. The material selected for building the satellite is a tungsten alloy. Due to this peculiar alloy used for LARES satellite, some concerns arise about the machinability of the material. Although several producers can provide several types of tungsten alloys, and there are applications that use bulk tungsten material, to our knowledge this material, very seldom used in space, was never machined with tight manufacturing tolerances and severe surface finish. Consequently some tests for machinability have been performed. Particular care has been adopted for manufacturing spherical cavities that are used to interface the separation system. Also the screws and the <b>retainer</b> <b>rings</b> for the cube corner reflector mounting system are difficult items to be manufactured in tungsten alloy, being the screw body and the ring thickness very small.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of evaluating the influence of different methods for end surface preparation of compressive strength test specimens. Four different methods were compared: a mechanical wear method through grinding using a diamond wheel established by NBR 5738; a mechanical wear method using a diamond saw which is established by NM 77; an unbonded system using neoprene pads in metal <b>retainer</b> <b>rings</b> established by C 1231 and a bonded capping method with sulfur mortar established by NBR 5738 and by NM 77. To develop this research, 4 concrete mixes were determined with different strength levels, 2 of group 1 and 2 of group 2 strength levels established by NBR 8953. Group 1 consists of classes C 20 to C 50, 5 in 5 MPa, also known as normal strength concrete. Group 2 is comprised of class C 55, C 60 to C 100, 10 in 10 MPa, also known as high strength concrete. Compression tests were carried out at 7 and 28 days for the 4 surface preparation methods. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the method established by NBR 5738 is the most effective among the 4 strengths considered, once it presents lower dispersion of values obtained from the tests, measured by the coefficient of variation and, in almost all cases, it demonstrates the highest mean of rupture test.

40|$|Since {{mechanical}} {{accuracy is}} of major {{importance in the}} field of optics, piece production is still prevailing and implementations of techniques of mass producti on are a challenge. Using injection molding of plastic elements onto sheet metal s (e. g. so-called OUTSERT-technology) provides a new approach to resolve this issue. Clearly, such a technique could save spacers and <b>retainer</b> <b>rings</b> as well as process time in assembly and allow an economical production of optics mounts at high production rates, if the required mechanical accuracy can be met. For a mob ile projection application, the lens barrel of a fix-focus projection lens has b een realized in this technology. The design is based on a segmented lens cage w ith fixed and loose plastic bearings parts for each optical element. Important f or accurate lens alignment is a 3 -fold symmetry of the cage. Due to the symmetrical layout, reproducibility of the injection molding process is of greater impor tance than absolute mechanical accuracy. A careful characterization of the const ituent parts has been performed, using non-contacting 3 d-shape measurements. The data obtained so far reveal satisfying results with respect to reproducibility and selected dimensions of the lens seats. Also, tilt deviations of the lens sur faces in the assembled mount were determined. Further, a preliminary measurement of the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), to check the optical performance, ha s been obtained and shows encouraging results...|$|R
40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). Boroscopic examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged labyrinth support ring of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR blades <b>retainer</b> <b>ring</b> were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to tip rubbing with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR blades <b>retainer</b> <b>ring</b> were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the labyrinth support ring with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The labyrinth support ring got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the labyrinth support ring from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the support ring was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated labyrinth support ring showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of labyrinth support ring is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of labyrinth support ring was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the labyrinth support ring of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the labyrinth support ring appears to be a remote possibility...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{configuration}} of the P&W SSME Alternate Fuel Turbopump turbine disk/blade assembly, combined with a severe thermal environment, resulted in several structural anomalies that were driven by frictional contact forces. Understanding the mechanics of these problems provides new quality checks for future turbo machinery designs. During development testing in 1997 of the SSME alternate fuel turbopump at Stennis Space Center, several potentially serious problems surfaced with the turbine disk/blade assembly {{that had not been}} experienced in extensive earlier testing. Changes to the operational thermal environment were noted based on analytical prediction of modifications that affected performance and on stationary thermal measurements adjacent to the rotor assembly. A detailed structural investigation was required to reveal the mechanism of distress induced by the change. The turbine disk experienced cracking in several locations due to increased thermal gradient induced stress during start and shutdown transients. This was easily predictable using standard analysis procedures and expected once the thermal environment was characterized. What was not expected was the curling of a piston ring used for blade axial retention in the disk, indentation of the axial face of the blade attachment by a spacer separating the first and second stage blades, and most significantly, galling and cracking of the blade root attachment that could have resulted in blade release. Past experience, in gas turbine environments, set a precedent of never relying on friction for help and to evaluate it only in specific instances where it was obvious that it would degrade capability. In each of the three cases above, friction proved to be a determining factor that pushed the components into an unsatisfactory mode of operation. The higher than expected temperatures and rapid thermal transients combined with friction to move beyond past experience. The turbine disk/blade assembly configuration contributed to the potential for these problems to occur by limiting the radial deflection from thermals and centrifugal loading. The cooled solid bore configuration was chosen to improve rotordynamic stability by limiting the length of rotor overhang while still protecting the roller bearing by maintaining zero slope under the inner race. During a start transient, the rim area of the disk heats rapidly and expands axially and circumferentially and requires corresponding radial and axial growth of the disk to maintain relative positioning of the disk, blades, spacers and <b>retainer</b> <b>rings.</b> The stiffness, large thermal mass, and bore cooling flow combine to severely limit the disk rim radial growth which results in the potential for relative movement between these parts. Friction then becomes a player in the determination of component stress...|$|R
