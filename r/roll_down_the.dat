5|$|Shortly before 10.00am as the Duke of Wellington arrived, a {{band played}} See, the Conquering Hero Comes in his honour, {{beginning}} {{a tradition of}} the song being played at almost every British railway station opening from then on. The Duke's party entered their carriage; a gun was then fired to mark {{the opening of the}} railway. The Duke's carriages had their brakes released and were allowed to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> incline under the force of gravity to be coupled to the waiting Northumbrian.|$|E
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his magnifying glass as well, proving that there never actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E

25|$|Pangolins, {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. Pangolins have been {{reported}} to roll away from danger, by both gravity and self-powered methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran {{to the edge of a}} slope and curled into a ball to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|An off {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the fingers <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> right side of the ball (for a {{right-handed}} bowler), giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler's perspective, this is to the left from the batsman's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the off side.|$|E
25|$|As Bryant {{drove down}} to Seascape, he shot at a red Ford Falcon coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, {{he got out of}} his car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so it was able to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E

25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, {{a slider}} {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning {{in the direction of the}} seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.|$|E
500|$|Desperate to {{retrieve}} them, Pascal and Maximus sneak {{out of the}} chapel while Rapunzel and Eugene say their wedding vows. [...] After pursuing the rings on tumultuous chase around the kingdom and encountering several obstacles along the way, they finally manage to recover them from a flock of flying doves, crashing into a tar factory in the process. Pascal and Maximus return to the chapel just as the bishop asks for the rings. Though shocked by their tar-covered appearance, Rapunzel and Flynn exchange rings nonetheless and share a kiss. Exhausted from their previous endeavors, Maximus sits down, nudging the wedding cake {{in the process and}} causing it, which has been positioned on wheels, to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. In his review for Breakaway, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of MSN considered [...] "Since U Been Gone", [...] "Walk Away", and [...] "You Found Me" [...] as {{the spine of}} the album. He added that the songs sound mainstream and youthful. Rohin of Blogcritics gave a positive response to the song, emphasizing that [...] "it is almost one of the best pieces of throwaway pop in recent history". He also thought that the song represents a song [...] "that you can <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> windows of your car and proudly headbang your way through a yellow light somewhere on a suburban side street." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought that Clarkson did a good impression of Pat Benatar in [...] "Since U Been Gone". He concluded his review by emphasizing that Breakaway proves that Clarkson has successfully dodged the sophomore slump but [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] helped her establish her success. The staff of Slant Magazine later ranked [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at number thirteen in their list of Best Singles of the Aughts, writing that the song proves Clarkson's powerful ability as a vocalist as well as her versatility as an artist.|$|E
500|$|Method Studios was {{contracted}} {{to handle the}} film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the [...] "car-crash" [...] sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person. Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a [...] "rotisserie" [...] in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot. Houdini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, [...] "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control." [...] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face.|$|E

2500|$|The Coal Creek War {{provided}} {{inspiration for}} some of the earliest Appalachian coal mining protest music. [...] Songs about the conflict include [...] "Coal Creek Troubles," [...] written {{in the wake of the}} conflict and recorded by Jilson Setters in 1937, and a banjo tune called [...] "Coal Creek March," [...] which was recorded by Kentucky banjoist Pete Steele for the Library of Congress in 1938 and is still popular among bluegrass musicians. [...] The song [...] "Buddy Won't You <b>Roll</b> <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> Line", written and performed by Grand Ole Opry pioneer Uncle Dave Macon, was based on the Coal Creek War.|$|E
2500|$|São Paulo {{is located}} in Southeastern Brazil, in southeastern São Paulo State, {{approximately}} halfway between Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro. The city is located on a plateau located beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for [...] "Sea Range" [...] or [...] "Coastal Range"), itself {{a component of the}} vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around [...] above sea level, although being at a distance of only about [...] from the Atlantic Ocean. The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see [...] "Transportation" [...] below) that <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically stable and no significant seismic activity has ever been recorded.|$|E
2500|$|When any {{of these}} sensors is activated, the game {{registers}} a [...] "tilt" [...] and locks out, disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end {{the ball in play}} on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a [...] "slam tilt" [...] switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the coin mechanism, or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{interests}} {{have continued to}} encroach on the land surrounding the state park, including the construction of several tall buildings (most of them hotels) on the Canadian side. The result is a significant alteration and urbanisation of the landscape. One study indicated it has caused the airflow near the falls to change direction. Students at the University of Guelph demonstrated, using scale models, that as air passes {{over the top of}} the new hotels it causes a breeze to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> south sides of the buildings and spill into the gorge below the falls, where it feeds into a whirlpool of moisture and air. The inference was that a documented rise in the number of [...] "mist days" [...] was a result of these breezes, where mist days refers to the mist plume of the falls reaching landside. In 1996 there were 29 mist days recorded, but by 2003 that number had risen to 68. Another study has discounted this opinion and linked mist production to the difference in air and water temperature at the falls. However, this study does not offer opinion as to why mist days have been increasing, just that the hotel breezes are an unlikely cause.|$|E
2500|$|Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia (HERDA), {{also known}} as hyperelastosis cutis (HC). [...] This is caused by an {{autosomal}} recessive gene, and thus, unlike HYPP, HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene. [...] When a horse has this disease, there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together. Thus, when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin, the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer, or it can tear off completely. It rarely heals without disfiguring scars. Sunburn {{can also be a}} concern. In dramatic cases, the skin can split along the back and even <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> sides, with the horse literally being skinned alive. [...] Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years. [...] The very hotly debated and controversial theory, put forth by researchers at Cornell University and Mississippi State University is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion Poco Bueno is implicated as the origin of the disease. [...] As of May 9, 2007, Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the University of California, Davis announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed. Over 1,500 horses were tested during the development phase of the test, which is now available to the general public through both institutions.|$|E
2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> side of the bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is {{based on the fact that}} we are now very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together. Speculating that [...] "when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination." ...|$|E
