50|$|In 2002, a new {{rating system}} was devised. Ranking {{programs}} and displaying the <b>rating</b> <b>symbols</b> became compulsory on every Hungarian television network.

The symbols were distracting to viewers, and networks feared that their constant presence could damage the television screen. Because of the complaints, the television authority allowed channels to choose to show the <b>rating</b> <b>symbols</b> on the left or {{on the right side}} of the screen.

An Unteroffizier is the lowest-ranking sergeant (OR-5), followed by Stabsunteroffizier (OR-6), Feldwebel and Oberfeldwebel (OR-7), Hauptfeldwebel (OR-8), Stabsfeldwebel (OR-9) and Oberstabsfeldwebel. Ranks of army and air force enlisted personnel are designated by stripes, chevrons, and [...] "sword knots" [...] worn on rank slides. Naval enlisted rank designations are worn on the upper (OR 1-5) or lower (OR-6 and above) sleeve along with a symbol based on an anchor for the service specialization (rating). Army and air force officer candidates hold the separate ranks of Fahnenjunker, Fähnrich and Oberfähnrich, and wear the appropriate rank insignia plus a silver cord bound around it. Officers candidates in the navy Seekadett (sea cadet; equivalent to OR-4) and Fähnrich zur See (midshipman second class; OR-5) wear the rank insignia of the respective enlisted ranks but with a gold star instead of the <b>rating</b> <b>symbol,</b> while an Oberfähnrich zur See (midshipman first class; OR-7) wears an officer type thin rank stripe.|$|E

50|$|In digital communications, <b>symbol</b> <b>rate,</b> {{also known}} as baud rate and {{modulation}} rate, {{is the number of}} symbol changes, waveform changes, or signaling events, across the transmission medium per time unit using a digitally modulated signal or a line code.

5000|$|Petty {{officers}} in the Kriegsmarine were known by the title Maat. Once advanced to the grade of petty officer, sailors were addressed, both verbally and in correspondence, by their rate followed by the term Maat. For instance, a boatswain petty officer would {{be referred to as}} Bootsmannmaat while a leading torpedoman petty officer would be known as Mechanikerobermaat. Petty officers wore special collar patches to denote their rank and a large rating badge on their left shoulder. On service coats and frocks, regular sailors wore a simple blue collar tab to differentiate between the petty officers.Chief petty officers wore shoulder epaulets on all uniforms as their primary means of rank with a <b>rating</b> <b>symbol</b> centered on the shoulder strap. Chief petty officer uniforms were nearly identical to those of officers, except that the chief's uniform rarely was worn in dress. Full dress uniforms also did not exist for chiefs, with the [...] "lesser dress" [...] typically the highest type of uniform a chief would wear at only the most formal of functions. The chief petty officers were known by the rank Matrosenfeldwebel ("sailor sergeants") but in both verbal and written correspondence were referred to by their rate. For instance, a medical chief petty officer would be known as a Sanitatsman while a senior engineering petty officer would be referred to as an Obermaschinist. For those chief petty officers with over ten to twelve years of service, the title Stabs would be added to their rate, i.e. Stabssteuermann or Stabsoberfunkmeister.|$|E
