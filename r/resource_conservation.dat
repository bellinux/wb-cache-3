Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the <b>Resource</b> <b>Conservation</b> and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E

Respondent appealed on the basis that the jury never determined the exact duration of the violation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, agreeing that the jury had not determined the duration of the violation, but holding that Apprendi did not apply to criminal fines.|$|E

25|$|Wildlife {{conservation}} in Canada was {{sparked by the}} protection of animals for tourism and recreation. Howard Douglas, an appointed superintendent of Rocky Mountains Park in 1897 first began to expand and preserve wildlife to attract more visitors to the park. However, between 1900 and 1920 Canada saw {{a dramatic change in}} national attitudes from focus in tourism {{to the creation of the}} National Parks Branch, world's first governmental organization dedicated to parks, and the development of other governmental organizations like the Commission of Conservation. Canadian Commission of Conservation that established in 1909 was intended to be an independent body dealing with questions of natural <b>resource</b> <b>conservation</b> in Canada. In the early years of the Commission, wildlife investigations were mostly focused on resource-commodity species such as fish and fur-bearing animals and later developed to include greater variety of species.|$|E
25|$|The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act is a United States {{environmental}} law that amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 {{and gave the}} Environmental Protection Agency the authority to establish health and environmental standards for the stabilization, restoration, and disposal of uranium mill waste. Title 1 of the Act required the EPA to set environmental protection standards consistent with the <b>Resource</b> <b>Conservation</b> and Recovery Act, including groundwater protection limits; the Department of Energy to implement EPA standards and provide perpetual care for some sites; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review cleanups and license sites to states or the DOE for perpetual care. Title 1 established a uranium mill remedial action program jointly funded {{by the federal government}} and the state. Title 1 of the Act also designated 22 inactive uranium mill sites for remediation, resulting in the containment of 40 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive material in UMTRCA Title 1 holding cells.|$|E
25|$|No {{matter how}} {{sustainable}} a building {{may have been}} in its design and construction, it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly. Ensuring operations and maintenance(O) personnel are part of the project's planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed {{at the onset of the}} project. Every aspect of green building is integrated into the O phase of a building's life. The addition of new green technologies also falls on the O staff. Although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design, construction and demolition phases of a building's life-cycle, it is in the O phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place. O staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency, <b>resource</b> <b>conservation,</b> ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices. Education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in O services.|$|E
