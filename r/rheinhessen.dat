25|$|Silvaner {{is another}} fairly neutral, but quite old grape variety that was Germany's most planted until the 1960s {{and after that}} has {{continued}} to lose ground. It has however remained popular in Franconia and <b>Rheinhessen,</b> where it is grown on chalky soils to produce powerful dry wines with a slightly earthy and rustic but also food-friendly character.|$|E
25|$|A {{semi-sweet}} QbA {{from the}} Rheingau, Nahe, <b>Rheinhessen</b> or Pfalz, consisting at least 70% of the varieties Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, Silvaner or Kerner. In practice {{there is very}} little Riesling in Liebfraumilch since varietally labelled Riesling wines tend to fetch a higher price. Liebfraumilch may not carry a varietal designation on the label. Liebfraumilch is probably Germany's most notorious wine type, and is in principle a medium-quality wine designation although more commonly perceived to be a low-quality wine both at home and on the export market.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{apocryphal}} legends about the grape's origins. In 1661, the German ampelographer F. J. Sachs, speculated that Pedro Ximénez originated in either the Canary Islands or Madeira and was later brought to the German wine regions of the Rheingau, <b>Rheinhessen</b> and eventually the Mosel before either a Spanish soldier named Pedro Ximen or a Catholic Cardinal named Ximenès brought the grape to Málaga and Sierras de Málaga. This theory, which was spread in various incarnations by other German wine writers such as Baron August Wilhelm von Babo and Balthasar Sprenger, also led to speculation that Pedro Ximénez was somehow related (or possibly even the same grape) as the German wine grapes Elbling and Riesling but DNA evidence in the late 20th and early 21st century has discounted those theories.|$|E
25|$|Outside of {{the regions}} {{discussed}} above, Chardonnay {{can be found}} in cooler climate sites in Italy, Greece, Israel and Lebanon as well as Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, England, Georgia, Germany, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Serbia and Switzerland. In Austria, the grape varieties known as Feinburgunder in Burgenland & Vienna and Morillon in Styria was not identified as Chardonnay till the late 1980s. Today, Austrian Chardonnays range from the rich, oaked aged varieties to leaner, more aromatic styles based on Austrian Rieslings to sweet late harvest styles. In nearby Germany, this distinctly French wine grape was slow to gain a footing being only officially sanctioned since 1991. Today it is most commonly found in the Baden, Palatinate and <b>Rheinhessen</b> regions. In Switzerland, Chardonnay is found mostly around Bündner Herrschaft, Geneva and Valais. In Spain, Chardonnay has been increasingly used in the sparkling wine Cava. It is also permitted in the Denominación de Origen (DO) wines of Costers del Segre, Navarra and Somontano. In the wine regions of the former Soviet Union, Chardonnay has lagged behind in white wine grapes plantings in favor Rkatsiteli, Aligote and Riesling. The Portuguese experimentation with Chardonnay has been mostly influenced by flying winemakers from Australia and the examples produced so far are very New World in style.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is also a}} smaller-berried, early ripening, lower yield variety called Frühburgunder (Pinot Noir Précoce, lit. [...] "Early Burgundian") {{which is}} grown in <b>Rheinhessen</b> and Ahr area and can produce good wines. In the last 20 years, efforts {{have been made to}} develop and husband good quality high health clones of Frühburgunder {{selected}} from Württemberg vineyards.|$|E
2500|$|... 10. <b>Rheinhessen</b> or Rhenish Hesse - {{the largest}} {{production}} area in Germany. Once known as Liebfraumilch land, but a quality revolution {{has taken place}} since the 1990s. Mixed wine styles and both red and white wines. The best Riesling wines are similar to Palatinate Riesling - dry and powerful. Despite its name, it lies in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, not in Hesse.|$|E

Thus, 50.Nfe4! threatened to capture both pawns with the knights. 50...dxe4 51.Nxe4 Kd5 52.Nxc5! would also achieve that goal. Black tried 50...d4, but agreed to a draw after 51.Nxc5+ Kd6 52.Nb5+!

2500|$|The wines of the Upper Mosel, {{especially}} {{along the}} Saar and Ruwer tributaries, {{are characterized by}} their low alcohol content in the 6-9% range with intense fruity notes and high acidity. An obscure local poet once described them as 'Sonnenfeuer, Sternengold, Kühlen Mondlichtschein' - The fire of the Sun, the gold of the stars, and cool moonlight. The wines of the Middle Mosel are considered the most complete examples of German wines {{with some of the}} finest examples being able to age gracefully for 50–100 years. Mosel Rieslings rely on a strong presence of tartaric acid to balance the grape's sugar and to help impart its fruity notes. A characteristic of all Mosel wines is their normally high acidity and transparency of clearly defined flavors. The wines of the Mosel region are traditionally packaged in a long green colored [...] "hock style" [...] wine bottle. Historically the green color distinguished Mosel wines from the brown bottles of the <b>Rheinhessen.</b>|$|E
