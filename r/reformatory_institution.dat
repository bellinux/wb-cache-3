5000|$|The Coffins {{spent months}} {{lobbying}} {{members of the}} Indiana General Assembly to support legislation to establish a women's prison and on May 13, 1869, the bill was approved. The Indiana <b>Reformatory</b> <b>Institution</b> for Women and Girls was established in Indianapolis, directed by a visiting board of men and women, with an all-male board of managers supervising its finances. The governor appointed Rhoda to the prison's first board of visitors. She believed in a new philosophy of prison reform that viewed prisons as rehabilitation centers and encouraged the incarcerated women to learn sewing and homemaking skills {{so that they would}} have work to do while they were in prison.|$|E
5000|$|In 1869, the Indiana State Legislature {{established}} the Indiana <b>Reformatory</b> <b>Institution</b> for Women and Girls stating that “There shall be established {{as soon as}} possible after the taking effect of this act, at or near the city of Indianapolis, an institution {{to be known as the}} Indiana <b>Reformatory</b> <b>Institution</b> for Women and Girls." [...] This was the first prison exclusively for females in the nation. Prior to the act, female juvenile offenders were taken care of by their county jails. In 1899, the girls were given separate quarters from the women (but were still on the same grounds), and the institution was renamed the Indiana Industrial School for Girls. However, the girls and the women were still housed under the same roof. Prior to the separation, the girls and the women would do activities together such as prayer services and household work. The women were thought to have a negative effect on the young girls’ morals, so in 1907 the girls moved to an entirely different facility. This facility was named the Indiana Girls’ School, and the women’s facility was renamed the Indiana Women’s Prison. According to correspondents of the time, the Indiana Girls’ School was built on the belief that firmness, fairness, and kindness were the keys to changing the girls’ attitudes. Girls who were “epileptic, insane, feeble-minded, paralytic, pregnant, or had a contagious disease” were not admitted to the facility. Instead, these girls were sent back to their homes. The school’s first superintendent was Charlotte Dye. A state law brought any girl who was convicted of activities which included but were not limited to: visiting gambling places, trespassing on railroad property, patronizing liquor saloons, using bad language, or smoking cigarettes to the school.|$|E
50|$|Coffin {{first became}} known in 1864 for her efforts in {{establishing}} a mission school with her husband and, a home for women in need with other local women in Richmond, Indiana.

Her lifelong interest in charitable work and social reform led to her assistance in securing the appointment of the first female physician to the staff of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane. After a bank scandal involving her husband and sons forced the Coffins to move to Chicago in 1884, Rhoda continued to advocate for prison reform, women's rights, and other causes.|$|E

5000|$|Established in 1873, the Indiana Women’s Prison was {{not only}} the United States’ first {{separate}} institution for female prisoners, but was also the first maximum-security female correctional facility in the nation. Formerly, female felons had been detained at the Indiana State Prison, located first in Jeffersonville and later in Clarksville. When Quaker prison reformers Rhoda Coffin and Sarah J. Smith learned of the abuses suffered by women prisoners {{at the hands of the}} male guards, they lobbied for an end to sexual abuse of women in state prisons. [...] Soon after, Ellen Cheney Johnson facilitated the opening of the Dedham Asylum for Discharged Female Prisoners in Massachusetts.

40|$|The Indiana Women’s Prison, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Indiana <b>Reformatory</b> <b>Institution</b> for Women and Girls, is considered the first separate prison {{for women in the}} United States. We believe that distinction belongs instead to Catholic institutions commonly referred to as “Magdalene Laundries” that were established throughout the nation beginning in the 1840 s and that served as private prisons for women whose sexuality offended mainstream society. We first discovered the existence of a Magdalene Laundry in Indianapolis as part of research on the early history of our prison. In digitizing records for the original inmates, we found that none were in for sex-related offenses. We discovered a Catholic prison that had opened in Indianapolis five months before the Indiana <b>Reformatory</b> <b>Institution</b> for Women and Girls. We have since found 15 Catholic women’s prisons that existed before the one in Indianapolis opened, beginning with Louisville, Kentucky, in 1843, and another 23 before 1900. We discuss attributes that clearly establish these institutions as private prisons to which state and city courts sentenced women and girls for sex- related crimes. As in the now-infamous Magdalene Laundries in Ireland, women in U. S. institutions were forced to perform hard labor without compensation and were subjected to cruel and sustained punishment, often for years. In incarcerating, abusing, and stigmatizing thousands of women, these prisons {{played an important role in}} shaping attitudes toward female sexuality and identity for 150 years, yet we seem to have lost all memory of them. We contend that this historical amnesia hinders our understanding of prisons and marginalized women, past and present...|$|E

In 1915 the General Assembly created the State Board of Controls to manage charity, penal, and <b>reformatory</b> <b>institutions.</b> This, in turn, was replaced by an Administration of State Institutions {{made up of the}} Governor, the State Treasurer, and a general manager of State Organizations.|$|R
40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Britain, {{the problem of the}} {{increase}} of young offenders raised the following connected statements. One statement stressed upon the need for the popular education, and the other improvement of the treatment of young offenders. In those days the discourses of reformation and education were formulated within the same framework. Today, however, educational thought can't be said equal to reformatory thought. That suggests that educational thought was gradually distinguished from reformatory thought. In this paper the writer has attempted to clarify the relation between educational thought and reformatory one through examining the "training system" of David Stow (1793 - 1864). The aim of Stow's training system was the formation of good habits of children in schools in place of the bad habits on the streets. Furthermore this training system was also introduced to <b>reformatory</b> <b>institutions,</b> such as <b>reformatory</b> schools and Parkhurst Prison (the first national 'separate juvenile prison' in Briatin). Nevertheless Stow emphasized "Prevention is better than cure". So he asserted that early education was needed for the formation of good habits. These Stow's thoughts showed the dual aspects of the relation of educational thought and reformatory one. On the one hand education in the training schools seemed to have the same function as the reformation in the <b>reformatory</b> <b>institutions.</b> On the other hand the formation of good habits was regarded as different from the reformation of bad habits. Consequently, therefore, {{it can be said that}} Stow's training system indicated the beginning of the distinction between educational thought and reformatory one...|$|R
40|$|The degree paper {{deals with}} the issues of {{juvenile}} delinquency and the factors which have impact on the origination of the juvenile delinquency. I have chosen this topic since {{it is a very}} serious problem and this phenomenon has been proliferating significantly. The crime in general, especially the juvenile delinquency, is a serious social-pathological phenomenon. Minors who do not reach the limit of criminal liability often became the offenders. In addition, the probability of threatening a young man by social pathological phenomena and his subsequent "criminal career is currently much higher than ever before. To recognize the occurrence of risk factors among the youth in time it is necessary for the families, teachers, educators and all professionals working with the juveniles to acquire sufficient knowledge, information and experience and be able to work with the factors and fight against them in time. The theoretical part {{deals with the}} definition of the term "youth, the personality of a young delinquent, structure of the juvenile delinquency, analyses of the risk factors which most frequently participate in the occurrence of juvenile delinquency, and outlines the possibilities of intervention against the juvenile delinquency and various kinds of prevention. The research is focused on the occurrence of risk factors among the young respondents and on protective factors and attitudes of the respondents in respect of the juvenile delinquency and the crime at all. Structured interviews were held with the youth which are placed in the reformatory or special correctional institutions in the territory of the Regional of Plzeň. The main objective of the degree paper is to describe the factors which significantly affect the occurrence of the juvenile delinquency and to map the occurrence and impact of such factors on the juveniles placed in the correctional and reformatory social retraining institutions in the Region of Plzeň. Hypothesis No. 1 is: The youth commit property crimes at the most. Hypothesis No. 2 : The youth behave improperly namely when in groups. Hypothesis No. 3 : The decisive factor affecting the juvenile delinquency is the family. I think that the objectives of the degree paper were fulfilled. Hypothesis No. 1 was confirmed. The respondents mostly stated that they were adjudicated treatment in special <b>reformatory</b> <b>institution</b> due to property crimes. Hypothesis No. 2 was also confirmed. The replies of the respondents mostly contained the possibility that they committed crime within a gang. Hypothesis No. 3 was confirmed, too: Analyses of the research proves that all factors participating in the occurrence of the juvenile delinquency are penetrated with the impact of the family and family environment on the juveniles. Results of the performed research will be used for further education of the students at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, {{as well as for the}} students of other auxiliary professions at other universities. The results will be further used as the source of information for parents and pedagogical professionals working with the youth and as source materials for seminars about the given topic...|$|E

5000|$|In Europe bastinado was a {{frequently}} encountered form {{of corporal}} punishment particularly in German areas, where it was mainly carried out to enforce discipline within penal and <b>reformatory</b> <b>institutions,</b> culminating during the Third Reich era. In several German and Austrian institutions it was still practised during the 1950s. Although bastinado has been practiced in penal institutions of the Western World until the late 20th century, it was barely noticed {{as there is no}} reference to ever being adjudged on a high level. Instead it was carried out on a rather low level {{within the confines of the}} institutions, typically to punish inmates during incarceration. If not specifically authorized the practice was usually condoned, while happening unbeknown to the public. Also foot whipping hardly attracts public interest in general as it appears unspectacular and relatively inoffensive compared to other punishment methods. As it was not executed publicly in the western world, it came to be witnessed only by the individuals directly involved. At this former prisoners rarely communicate incidents as bastinado is widely perceived as a degrading punishment (see public humiliation), while former executants are usually obliged to confidentiality.|$|R
