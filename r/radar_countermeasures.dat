5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size of}} the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasures</b> on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E

25|$|Radar was not {{installed}} on the surviving ships of this class {{until late in the}} war, possibly as late as 1944. They were given a Type 22 radar on the foremast, a Type 13 on the mainmast and a Type E-27 <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasures</b> device was carried high on the foremast.|$|E
25|$|Clutter {{refers to}} radio {{frequency}} (RF) echoes returned from targets which are uninteresting to the radar operators. Such targets include natural {{objects such as}} ground, sea, and when not being tasked for meteorological purposes, precipitation (such as rain, snow or hail), sand storms, animals (especially birds), atmospheric turbulence, and other atmospheric effects, such as ionosphere reflections, meteor trails, and Hail spike. Clutter may also be returned from man-made objects such as buildings and, intentionally, by <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasures</b> such as chaff.|$|E
25|$|Dresden's air {{defenses}} had been depleted {{by the need}} for more weaponry to fight the Red Army, and the city lost its last heavy flak battery in January 1945. By this point in the war, the Luftwaffe was seriously hampered by a shortage of both pilots and aircraft fuel; the German radar system had also been degraded, lowering the warning time to prepare for air attacks. The RAF also had an advantage over the Germans in the field of electronic <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasures.</b>|$|E
50|$|Laus (English: louse) was {{the name}} {{for a series of}} German ECCM {{equipment}} during World War II. They were additions to German radar equipment in order to counteract the Allied use of 'Window' (German: Düppel), a chaff <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure.</b>|$|R
50|$|No. 192 Squadron was a Royal Air Force {{squadron}} operational {{during the}} First World War as a night training squadron {{and during the}} Second World War as a <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure</b> unit.

25|$|Also {{new to the}} {{battlefield}} were artillery proximity fuses. These had been under development and used during selected battles for about a year. Rather than exploding upon {{direct contact with the}} target, the shells detonated near an aircraft or before they struck the ground. Shells armed with these fuses were very effective, but the Allies limited their use in Europe. The Pentagon feared that a dud would be recovered by the Germans who would reverse engineer it and use the information to design <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasures</b> and employ it against the Allies' aircraft and troops.|$|E

2500|$|Vacuum-tube {{amplifiers}} (also {{known as}} tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers {{can be much}} more cost effective in high power applications such as <b>radar,</b> <b>countermeasures</b> equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, {{as well as in}} musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for [...] "tube sound".|$|E
5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and the atomic bomb during the Second World War. She invented chaff, a <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure</b> technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} proximity fuse and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the atomic bomb.|$|R
50|$|Chaff, {{originally}} called Window by the British and Düppel by the Second World War era German Luftwaffe (from the Berlin suburb {{where it}} was first developed), is a <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure</b> in which aircraft or other targets spread a cloud of small, thin pieces of aluminium, metallized glass fibre or plastic, which either appears as a cluster of primary targets on radar screens or swamps the screen with multiple returns.|$|R
50|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure</b> effort {{came under}} RAF Bomber Command where they {{performed}} {{a variety of}} special operations activities. The missions included Window (Chaff), Jostle, Carpet, Mandrel, and other ramifications. Many of the jamming systems were developed and tested by Allied scientists associated with the Telecommunications Research Establishment, namely the American-British Laboratory Division 15 (ABL-15) located at Great Malvern. RCM operations were designed to deny the Germans effective utilization of radar and radio equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Physicists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) {{had decided}} that they too needed a {{cyclotron}}, and Robley Evans hired Livingston to build a [...] cyclotron there in 1938. Livingston became an instructor at MIT the following year, and an assistant professor the year after. The cyclotron was completed in 1940. During World War II, he worked with the cyclotron for the Office of Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), producing radioactive isotopes of phosphorus and iron that were used as tracers in medical experiments. The result {{of this research was}} new methods of stabilizing blood, so that it could be shipped to the troops in remote theaters of war. In 1944, Livingston joined Philip Morse's operations research group at the Office of Naval Research, and he worked in Washington, DC, and London on <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasures</b> to the U-boats.|$|E

50|$|The system {{comprises}} two multi-barrelled rocket launchers, a launcher {{control and}} firing panel and Chaff (<b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure)</b> rockets. Corvus offers distraction and centroid operating modes, {{with the two}} differing from {{one another in the}} azimuth angle at firing and the range at which chaff is released. The equipment's firing and control panel is ideally located in the host vessel's combat information centre and has a maximum load of 16 chaff rockets provides protection against three missile attacks before reloading.|$|R

50|$|After {{shakedown}} out of Little Creek, Virginia, and a {{few weeks}} of escort duty in that area, Instill was assigned to Service Force, Atlantic Fleet as a training ship. This duty continued until 11 August when she reported to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to operate with shakedown ships as a <b>radar</b> <b>countermeasure</b> ship. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia, 22 October, Instill remained there until 21 January 1946 when she sailed to Orange, Texas. The minesweeper decommissioned there 26 February 1947, joining the Reserve Fleet.|$|R

This third incarnation of the 36th BS (the first had been an Eleventh Air Force unit) went back to Alconbury in February 1945, and was administratively assigned to the 482d Bombardment Group. However operational control for the 36th's special missions and training were exercised by Eighth Air Force Headquarters.|$|R

30|$|Electronic {{countermeasure}} is {{an action}} where both sides {{interfere with the}} equipment’s usage {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} and electromagnetic information and attack the other side and their equipment by using electromagnetic energy or directional energy; in the meantime, it guarantees equipment normal function and personnel’s safety [7]. <b>Radar</b> <b>countermeasure</b> and counter-countermeasure is one of the important contents of electronic warfare. The interference of radar is mainly classified into background and artificial interference, and the latter is the focus of our study. Artificial interference can be classified into active jamming and passive jamming. Active jamming can be further classified into the suppression of jamming and deception jamming according to the principle of interference signal. Under the complex electromagnetic environment, how to analyze the jamming effect is of great value [8]. The mathematical modeling and analysis of common jamming signals are discussed in the following parts.|$|R
