Besides {{the use of}} ultraprecision machine tools and diamond {{machining processes}}, the clamping and alignment of work pieces within the machine tool coordinate system is {{an essential step to}} accuracy.

5000|$|Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) {{establishing}} the preliminary <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> differentiates between {{the right and}} the duty of national courts to seek a preliminary ruling. Under the discretionary reference stipulated in Article 267(2) TFEU, a national [...] "court or tribunal" [...] may ask the CJEU to give a preliminary ruling if it considers that a decision on the question is [...] "necessary" [...] to enable it to give a judgment in a particular case. The obligatory reference (duty to refer) is established in two cases: with respect to national courts adjudicating at last instance (Article 267(3) TFEU [...] ) and with respect of all courts faced with a question of the validity of EU law. The obligation of national courts of last instance to refer for a preliminary ruling when a question of the interpretation of EU law arises is subject to certain exceptions. In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court, a national court is relieved from the duty to refer (i) when EU law questions are not relevant to the decision in the main proceedings, (ii) in a situation before a national court is “materially identical with a question which has already been subject of a preliminary ruling in a similar case” (‘acte éclairé’), or (iii) when the proper interpretation of EU law is “so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt” (‘acte clair’).|$|E

This is usually done by passing the machine {{address of the}} parameters to the procedure so that the procedure's adjustments are to the original storage area.Thus {{in the case of}} call by <b>reference,</b> <b>procedure</b> Silly has an effect. Suppose that its invocations are expanded in place, with parameters identified by address: the code amounts to x:=7; b:=5; if x < 0 then a:=x + b else a:=-6; write(x); {a is changed.} if a < 0 then x:=a + b else x:=-6; write(x); {Because the parameters are swapped.} if b < 0 then b:=b + b else b:=-6; write(b); {Two versions of variable b in Silly, plus the global usage.}The compiler could then in this rather small example follow the constants along the logic (such as it is) and find that the predicates of the if-statements are constant and so... x:=7; b:=5; a:=-6; write(7); {b is not referenced, so this usage remains [...] "pure".} x:=-1; write(-1); {b is referenced...} b:=-6; write(-6); {b is modified via its parameter manifestation.}And since the assignments to a, b and x deliver nothing to the outside world - they do not appear in output statements, nor as input to subsequent calculations (whose results in turn do lead to output, else they also are needless) - {{there is no point in}} this code either, and so the result is write(7); write(-1); write(-6);A variant method for passing parameters that appear to be [...] "by reference" [...] is copy-in, copy-out whereby the procedure works on a local copy of the parameters whose values are copied back to the originals on exit from the procedure. If the procedure has access to the same parameter but in different ways as in invocations such as Silly(a,a) or Silly(a,b), discrepancies can arise. So, if the parameters were passed by copy-in, copy-out in left-to-right order then Silly(b,b) would expand into p1:=b; p2:=b; {Copy in. Local variables p1 and p2 are equal.} if p2 < 0 then p1:=p2 + b else p1:=-6; {Thus p1 may no longer equal p2.} b:=p1; b:=p2; {Copy out. In left-to-right order, the value from p1 is overwritten.}And in this case, copying the value of p1 (which has been changed) to b is pointless, because it is immediately overwritten by the value of p2, which value has not been modified within the procedure from its original value of b, and so the third statement becomes write(5); {Not -6}Such differences in behavior are likely to cause puzzlement, exacerbated by questions as to the order in which the parameters are copied: will it be left to right on exit as well as entry? These details are probably not carefully explained in the compiler manual, and if they are, they will likely be passed over as being not relevant to the immediate task and long forgotten by the time a problem arises. If (as is likely) temporary values are provided via a stack storage scheme, then it is likely that the copy-back process will be in the reverse order to the copy-in, which in this example would mean that p1 would be the last value returned to b instead.|$|E

Awarded the European Association of Tax Law Professors (EATLP) 2016 Tax Thesis Award in Munich, Germany, June 2016. This {{dissertation}} {{purports to}} connect the preliminary <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> with direct taxation. The aim of my dissertation is to lay down how this essential mechanism {{for the development of}} EU law – the preliminary <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> – deals with the cases in the field of direct taxation. By analyzing the preliminary rulings in the particular field, this thesis will shed light on the meaning of judicial cooperation between the Court of Justice of the European Union (“Court”) and the national courts. The almost absence of harmonized direct taxation reached at the European level enables the Court throughout the preliminary <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> to become the only available actor to safeguard the rights conferred to the individuals by EU law. In the area of direct taxation, it encompasses the rights of the individuals to exercise the fundamental Treaty freedoms of circulation. Therefore, the entrenchment of the rights of the individuals requires national courts requesting questions for preliminary rulings whereby national tax law in breach of EU law is challenged. Accordingly, this narrative of “protection of EU rights” which is embedded within article 267 TFEU enables the Court to adopt the role of a constitutional court assessing the compatibility of national law with EU law. The current asymmetries and conceptual mismatches of the substantive case law in the field of direct taxation are firmly anchored in a preliminary <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> in which the Court, as a constitutional court, is endowed with discretionary powers to drive it...|$|E

40|$|Auditory event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{have consistently}} {{been used in}} the investigation of auditory and cognitive processing in the research and clinical laboratories. There is currently no consensus on the choice of appropriate reference for auditory ERPs. The most commonly used references in auditory ERP research are the mathematically linked-mastoids (LM) and average referencing (AVG). Since LM and AVG <b>referencing</b> <b>procedures</b> do not solve the issue of electrically-neutral reference, Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) was developed to create a neutral reference for EEG recordings. The aim of the current research is to compare the influence of the reference on amplitude and latency of auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) as a function of magnitude of frequency deviance across three commonly used electrode montages (16, 32, and 64 -channel) using REST, LM, and AVG <b>reference</b> <b>procedures.</b> The current study was designed to determine if the three reference methods capture the variation in amplitude and latency of MMN with the deviance magnitude. We recorded MMN from 12 normal hearing young adults in an auditory oddball paradigm with 1, 000 Hz pure tone as standard and 1, 030, 1, 100, and 1, 200 Hz as small, medium and large frequency deviants, respectively. The EEG data recorded to these sounds was re-referenced using REST, LM, and AVG methods across 16 -, 32 -, and 64 -channel EEG electrode montages. Results revealed that while the latency of MMN decreased with increment in frequency of deviant sounds, no effect of frequency deviance was present for amplitude of MMN. There was no effect of <b>referencing</b> <b>procedure</b> on the experimental effect tested. The amplitude of MMN was largest when the ERP was computed using LM referencing and the REST referencing produced the largest amplitude of MMN for 64 -channel montage. There was no effect of electrode-montage on AVG referencing induced ERPs. Contrary to our predictions, the results suggest that the auditory MMN elicited as a function of increments in frequency deviance does not depend on the choice of <b>referencing</b> <b>procedure.</b> The results also suggest that auditory ERPs generated using REST referencing is contingent on the electrode arrays more than the AVG referencing...|$|R

Our study focuses on Triveneto, a broad geographical region in North-eastern Italy. A <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> for design flood estimation in Triveneto is available from the Italian NCR research project "VA. PI.

We consider a very detailed AMS database that we recently compiled for 76 catchments located in Triveneto. All 76 study catchments are characterized in terms of several geomorphologic and climatic descriptors. The objective of our study is threefold: (1)  to inspect climatic and scale controls on flood frequency regime; (2)  to verify the possible presence of changes in flood frequency regime by looking at changes in time of regional L-moments of annual maximum floods; (3)  to develop an updated <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> for design flood estimation in Triveneto by using a focused-pooling approach (i. e.

Our study leads to the following conclusions: (1)  climatic and scale controls on flood frequency regime in Triveneto are similar to the controls that were recently found in Europe; (2)  a single year characterized by extreme floods can have a remarkable influence on regional flood frequency models and analyses for detecting possible changes in flood frequency regime; (3)  no significant change was detected in the flood frequency regime, yet an update of the existing <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> for design flood estimation is highly recommended and we propose the RoI approach for properly representing climate and scale controls on flood frequency in Triveneto, which cannot be regarded as a single homogeneous region...|$|E

Following the positive results obtained on the trial batch, a second batch was produced in the same way. The homogeneity and the stability of this batch were assessed using an In Vitro Diagnostic assay. Then a feasibility study was carried out to characterise the material using a <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> from the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC). Twelve expert laboratories participated in the study and familiarised themselves with the protocol. Finally, the characterisation of the material was performed. A good agreement between the results of the 12 laboratories allowed the value assignment of AST in the material in terms of catalytic activity concentration of AST (U/L or µkat/L) in the reconstituted material. The material is aiming to control the IFCC <b>reference</b> <b>procedure</b> for AST at 37 °C. It {{can also be used to}} calibrate assays if the commutability of the material with patient samples is demonstrated for these assays. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, PSS {{lifecycle}} {{models are}} a crucial issue. The management {{of both the}} product and the service lifecycle together is recent: to date, {{there is no evidence}} of an accepted and operational combined lifecycle model. Furthermore, PSS lifecycle models are based on top-down approach, which are not always suitable from an engineering point of view. The aim of this paper is to propose a <b>reference</b> <b>procedure,</b> built on a bottom-up methodology, for the designing and modeling of PSSs and its lifecycles, applied to the automotive sector...|$|E

40|$|Glycated {{haemoglobin}} (HbA 1 c) {{measurements are}} used in clinical studies and {{for the management of}} diabetic patients. Various efforts were made to standardize the HbA 1 c measurements with consensus standards and standards based on a <b>reference</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> with external calibration. According to ISO 17511 a standard should meet highest accuracy possible, have a defined uncertainty of measurement and the calibration should be traceable to SI units. For HbA 1 c this has been realized using a LC-ID-MS procedure based on the existing <b>reference</b> measurement <b>procedure...</b>|$|R
40|$|TORTIS is {{a system}} of special {{terminals}} together with software {{which is designed to}} provide programming capability and be accesible for use by very young children. The system is designed to add capabilities in small increments so that the child is never overwhelmed by too much to learn at one time, and maintains a feeling of control over the environment. This system facilitates learning of various concepts such as relative size of numbers, frames of <b>reference,</b> <b>procedures,</b> conditionals, and recursion, but more importantly it teaches good problem solving techniques and a healthy approach to learning...|$|R
