40|$|<b>Enterprise</b> <b>Messaging</b> is a {{very popular}} message {{exchange}} concept in asynchronous distributed computing environments. The <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Messaging</b> Servers are heavily used in building business critical Enterprise applications such as Internet based Order processing systems, pricing distribution of B 2 B, geographically dispersed enterprise applications. It is always desirable that Messaging Servers exhibit high performance to meet the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). There are investigations {{in this area of}} managing the performance of the distributed computing systems in different ways such as the IT administrators configuring and tuning the Messaging Servers parameters, implement complex conditional programming to handle the workload dynamics. But in practice it is extremely difficult to handle such dynamics of changing workloads {{in order to meet the}} performance requirements. Additionally it is challenging to cater to the future resource requirements based on the future workloads. Though there have been attempts to self-regulate the performance <b>of</b> <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Messaging</b> Servers, there is a limited investigation done in exploring feedback control systems theory in managing the Messaging Servers performance. We propose an adaptive control based solution to not only manage the performance of the servers to meet SLAs but also to pro-actively self-regulate the performance such that the Messaging Servers are capable to meet the current and future workloads. We implemented and evaluated our solution and observed that the control theory based solution will improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Messaging</b> Servers significantly...|$|R

50|$|The ESB is {{implemented}} in software that operates between the business applications, and enables communication among them. Ideally, the ESB {{should be able}} to replace all direct contact with the applications on the bus, so that all communication takes place via the ESB. To achieve this objective, the ESB must encapsulate the functionality offered by its component applications in a meaningful way. This typically occurs through the use <b>of</b> an <b>enterprise</b> <b>message</b> model. The message model defines a standard set of messages that the ESB transmits and receives. When the ESB receives a message, it routes the message to the appropriate application. Often, because that application evolved without the same message model, the ESB has to transform the message into a format that the application can interpret. A software adapter fulfills the task of effecting these transformations, analogously to a physical adapter.|$|R

30|$|Second, {{while the}} raw gap {{decreases}} substantially following {{the onset of}} the crisis, the gap adjusted for observable worker characteristics is remarkably stable.

In turn, this indicates that the economic disadvantage pertaining to informality in Serbia is much more constant when taking observable characteristics of formal and informal workers into account. Third, in line with previous research, there are substantial returns to education, all industries experience an earnings premium relative to the reference category of agriculture, and similarly all occupations experience an earnings premium relative to the reference category of elementary occupations, workers in urban areas experience (mostly) an earnings premium relative to workers from rural areas, and workers from regions outside that of the capital (Belgrade) experience an earnings penalty.|$|R

30|$|For each survey, {{the results}} are remarkably {{consistent}} across the three informality measures. First, for all three measures the initial raw earnings gaps discussed previously decrease substantially when including controls (Table  8, bottom panel). For example, the gap decreases from 59.9 to 26.9 % when using formal <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>enterprise</b> as the informality measure in October 2008.19 This again suggests {{that at least some}} of the gap can be explained by observable characteristics (as will be further explored in the Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions shortly); the substantial increase in R 2 when moving from the specifications with only the informality measure to adding the controls also supports this. These findings again confirm the findings by Krstić and Sanfey (2011), where the raw formal-informal earnings gap decreases from about 43 percentage-points to about 22 percentage-points in 2007 once controls such as age, education, and industry are added. 20 These results again also confirm the predictions from the literature on segmented labor markets that the lower productivity, or “marginal,” sector also receives the lower wages (Lewis 1954; Kuznets 1955)—though now even when controlling for the worse characteristics of these workers in terms of, for example, education.|$|R
