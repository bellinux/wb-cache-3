5|$|Meditation is an {{integral}} part of the <b>rosary.</b> This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the <b>rosary.</b> With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the <b>rosary</b> had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the <b>Rosary</b> of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the <b>rosary</b> confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E

During religious conflict in 16th and 17th century Ireland severe legal penalties were prescribed against practicing Roman Catholics. Small, easily hidden <b>rosaries</b> were thus used to avoid identification and became known as Irish penal <b>rosaries.</b> Sometimes rather than a cross, other symbols of specific meanings were used, such as a hammer to signify the nails of the cross, cords to represent the scourging, a chalice to recall the Last Supper, or a crowing rooster signifying the denial of Peter.|$|R

5|$|Devotions to Mary {{are part}} of Catholic piety but are {{distinct}} from the worship of God. Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she {{is considered to be}} the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ. Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, the <b>Rosary,</b> the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices. Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the Church, such as Lourdes, Fátima, and Guadalupe, are also popular Catholic devotions.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the <b>Rosary</b> at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E

5|$|In the four-armed form, a {{right hand}} holds a parashu (axe) and another makes an abhaya mudra (gesture of reassurance), {{or one of}} the right arms is {{slightly}} bent and rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (<b>rosary)</b> are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E

The {{ceremony}} {{was attended by}} numerous political figures and sultans from Batavia, Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, as well as clergy from Malang and Lampung; Soegijapranata's first act as vicar was to issue a pastoral letter with Willekens that outlined the historical background {{that led to his}} appointment, including Pope BenedictXV's apolistic letter Maximum Illud, which called for more local clergy, and Pope PiusXI and Pope PiusXII's efforts to appoint more pastors and bishops from native ethnic groups worldwide. Soegijapranata began working on the Church hierarchy in the region, establishing new parishes.|$|E
