40|$|The {{capacity}} of the Rous chicken tumor to survive heterologous transplantation has been demonstrated in both early and late stages of development. '"' Such investigations were concerned with the transformed cell while the question at issue {{in the present study}} involves the cell during the process of transformation. It has been observed that adult rabbit skin infected either in vivo or in vitro with the Shope papilloma virus attained the ability to survive transplantation to the subcutaneous space of the hamster. " In contrast to the destructive foreign body reaction characteristic of the heterologous transfer of normal adult rabbit skin, the infected epithelial cells remained viable in the hamster for a sufficient time to develop a typical papillomatous transformation and occasionally survived as histologically intact epidermis without papilloma formation. It appeared, accordingly, that incident to infection and prior to neoplastic transformation, the cells of the adult rabbit's epidermis acquired the property of heterologous transplantability. The experiments described in the present paper were instituted to determine whether an analogous acquisition was associated with the process of <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> transformation <b>in</b> <b>chicken</b> cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS A filtrate of fresh Rous tumor was injected into the breast muscle of a group of adult Leghorn chickens, and the animals were killed at intervals from 1 to 24 hours.

40|$|Expression of the src gene of <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus <b>in</b> <b>chicken</b> embryo neuroretinal cells {{results in}} {{morphological}} transformation and sustained proliferation of this normally resting cell population. PA 101 and PA 104 are two mutants of <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus which induce neuroretinal cell proliferation {{in the absence}} of morphological transformation. Their mitogenic property is temperature sensitive, and they both encode p 60 src proteins with low kinase activity. To study the role of the mitogenic function and protein kinase activity of p 60 src in tumorigenesis, we investigated the oncogenicity of PA 101 and PA 104. Both mutants were less tumorigenic than wild-type virus when injected into chicks. Tumorigenicity was further assayed by inoculating infected chicken embryo fibroblasts and neuroretinal cells onto the chorioallantoid membrane of embryonated duck eggs. This system provides a nonpermissive and immunodeficient environment for xenogenic cell grafting and allows the study of cell tumorigenicity within a temperature range of 37 to 39. 5 degrees C. Chicken embryo fibroblasts and neuroretinal cells infected with PA 101 were as tumorigenic as wild type-infected cells at 37 degrees C, but tumor development was significantly reduced at 39. 5 degrees C. In contrast, both cell types infected with PA 104 displayed sharply reduced tumorigenicity. Cell cultures derived from PA 101 tumors induced on the chorioallantoid membrane were similar to the corresponding cells maintained in vitro in terms of morphology, production of plasminogen activator, relative amounts of phosphotyrosine in total cellular proteins, and phosphorylation of 34, 000 -molecular-weight protein. These results indicate that the expression of the mitogenic function of src does not account per se for cell tumorigenicity and that tumor formation is compatible with low levels of p 60 src protein kinase activity...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study of the fine {{structure}} of normal uninfected fibroblasts from regenerating tendon, periarticular granulation tissue (rabbit), and various other tissues (human, chicken, hamster), Movat and Fernando (1) have described a cell organelle not yet found elsewhere. This organelle is spindle-shaped and occurs irregularly within the cytoplasm, mainly in the Golgi region and in the peripheral portion of the cell. The inner structure of the organelle is apparently fibrous, bundles of fibrils being enveloped in a sheath or membrane. Staining of the cells with phosphotungstic acid showed that the fibrils had a high electron opacity, whereas the sheath or membrane possessed a lower affinity for the stain. The so called "spindle-shaped body " measures 500 to 600 A by 2, 500 to 3, 000 A. The function of these bodies is not known. However, their relation to secretion has been presumed.

In our current studies on the reproductive cycle of <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus (RSV) <b>in</b> <b>chicken</b> fibroblasts, we have only once encountered cell organelles similar to the "spindle-shaped body " described by Movat and Fernando.

We have previously reported {{the isolation of}} mutants of RSV which retain full growth-promoting activity while displaying reduced transforming properties. Two such mutants, PA 101 and PA 104, were used to investigate whether the p 60 src-associated kinase activity {{is required for the}} mitogenic function of src. A comparison of the patterns of phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant p 60 src revealed that the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of p 60 src of PA 104 was markedly reduced, whereas the relative amount of phosphotyrosine in p 60 src of PA 101 was comparable to that of the wild-type protein. In vitro kinase activity of p 60 src immunoprecipitated from NR cells infected with PA 101 or PA 104 as measured by phosphorylation of the heavy chains of specific immunoglobulin G molecules was 1 / 10 that of the wild-type molecule. Moreover, when NR cells infected with mutants temperature sensitive for mitogenic capacity were maintained at a temperature either permissive or restrictive for cell growth, quantitation of kinase activity indicated that proliferation of NR cells could not be linked to the absolute level of in vitro kinase activity of p 60 src. Transformation of NR cells by wild-type RSV resulted in a 10 -fold increase in total cellular phosphotyrosine and in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of a 34 K protein, a possible in vivo substrate for p 60 src. In contrast, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of cellular targets was markedly reduced in NR cells infected with PA 101 or PA 104. These results indicate that the mitogenic capacity of RSV in NR cells does not require elevated levels of p 60 src kinase activity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Electron {{microscope}} {{examination of}} progressing and regressing <b>Rous</b> virus-induced <b>sarcomas</b> <b>in</b> an inbred line of White Leghorns revealed that regressing tumors contained moderate to marked lymphocyte infiltration, frequent contact between lymphocytes and tumor cells, and extensive areas of necrosis. Lymphocytes infiltrating regressing tumors exhibited a polar accumulation of organelles {{at the point}} of contact between lymphocyte and target cell. On the otiier hand, progressing tumors contained low to moderate numbers of lymphocytes, infrequent lymphocyte-tumor cell interaction and less evidence of tumor cell degeneration. Lymphocytes from progressing tumors lacked the polar organization of organelles. This experimental system is offered as a means of studying the role of lymphocytes in tumor regression...|$|R
40|$|It is {{obviously}} impossible to draw definite conclusions {{as to the}} significance of the differences between our work and Gye's, and still less, of the differences between Gye's work and that of Murphy and of Flu. We can only say that in a fairly large series of experiments, extending over a period of 12 months, we have had absolutely no indication of the necessity of two factors in the production of the <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> <b>In</b> other words, we have been unable to duplicate either the results of Gye or the modified confirmations of his work by Murphy and Flu. We have shown that uncontrollable local and individual variations may produce results in occasional chicks which simulate satisfactory experiments, but when viewed as a whole, mean nothing. Because of the conflicting nature of results obtained by those who have undertaken to repeat the work, and on account of the difficulty of controlling all factors involved, we do not feel that it may be stated definitely that Gye's theory of the cause of cancer is wrong. On the other hand the theory apparently needs more evidence in its support if it is to receive further serious consideration. It is suggested, in order to untangle the subjéct as rapidly as possible, that future publications should include sufficient consecutive protocols to make the trend of the experiments obvious to the reader...|$|R
40|$|Sindbis {{virus was}} grown in four {{different}} host cells and the carbohydrate {{portions of the}} glycoproteins were analyzed. Sindbis virus grown in BHK- 21 cells has more sialic acid and galactose than Sindbis virus grown <b>in</b> <b>chicken</b> embryo cells. <b>In</b> other respects the carbohydrates from virus grown in these two hosts are very similar. Sindbis virus grown either in chick cells transformed by <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus or <b>in</b> BHK cells transformed by polyoma virus was also examined. In comparisons of virus from normal and transformed cells, differences {{in the amount of}} sialic acid were observed; but otherwise the carbohydrate structures appeared basically similar. The growth conditions used for the host cell also affected the degree of completion of the carbohydrate chains of the viral glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|The present work is {{undertaken}} {{to study the}} expression of levels of gelatinases <b>in</b> tumorogenesis by <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus(RSV) <b>in</b> layer chicks and explored {{the possibility of using}} gelatinases as potential biological markers in metastatic neoplasms. Two days old chicks (40) were divided into two groups (Gp I and Gp II). Gp-I (20) treated with <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus for tumor induction. The Gp II (control) was inoculated with RPMI- 1640. Tumors appeared earliest by three days post infection with RSV and were progressive leading to mortality of birds by twenty eight days. Distant tumors were observed in liver, heart, lung, and kidney on post mortem. A prominent band of gelatinase of around 75 kDa was detected in plasma of infected chicks by gelatin zymography. Results indicate over expression of gelatinases and are leaked into plasma on <b>Rous</b> <b>sarcoma</b> virus infection. Expression of gelatinases in primary tumors, metastasized liver, heart, lung and kidney and corresponding tissues in healthy control chicks was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Over expression of gelatinase gene was observed in metastaic tissues and primary tumors than control. The described assays {{could be used as a}} prognostic assay method for detection of proteases in metastatic neoplasms of animals. [Veterinary World 2010; 3 (11. 000) : 500 - 502...|$|R
