25|$|Projectional radiographs, more {{commonly}} known as x-rays, are often {{used to determine the}} type and extent of a fracture as well as for detecting pathological changes in the lungs. With the use of <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast media, such as barium, they {{can also be used to}} visualize the structure of the stomach and intestines - this can help diagnose ulcers or certain types of colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} mainly by plain and contrasted radiographical and ultrasound imaging. Colonic marker transit studies are useful to distinguish colonic inertia from functional outlet obstruction causes. In this test, the patient swallows a water-soluble bolus of <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast and films are obtained 1, 3 and 5 days later. Patients with colonic inertia show the marker {{spread throughout the}} large intestines, while patients with outlet obstruction exhibit slow accumulations of markers in some places. A colonoscopy {{can also be used}} to rule out mechanical obstructive causes. Anorectal manometry may help to differentiate acquired from congenital forms. Rectal biopsy is recommended to make a final diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal SEMS {{are placed}} after a {{gastroscopy}} is performed {{to identify the}} area of narrowing. The area {{may need to be}} dilated in order to allow the gastroscope to pass. The tumour is usually better seen with the direct vision of endoscopy than on a fluoroscopic image. As a result, <b>radio-opaque</b> markers are usually placed {{on the surface of the}} patient in order to mark the area of narrowing on fluoroscopy. The SEMS is placed through the channel of the endoscope into the esophagus over a guidewire, marked on fluoroscopy, and mechanically deployed (using a device that sits outside of the endoscope) such that it expands when in position. Hypaque or other water-soluble dye may be placed through the passage to ensure patency of the stent on fluoroscopy. Enteric and colonic SEMS are inserted in a similar fashion, but in the duodenum and colon respectively.|$|E
25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of <b>radio-opaque</b> dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{undertaking}} endoscopy, attempts {{should be}} made to locate the foreign body with x-rays or other non-invasive techniques. [...] For <b>radio-opaque</b> objects, x-rays of the neck, chest and abdomen can be used to locate the foreign body and assist endoscopy. [...] Alternative approaches, including the use of metal detectors, have also been described.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breast cancer}} studies [...] Cancer in the Augmented Breast: Diagnosis and Prognosis (1993) and Breast Cancer after Augmentation Mammoplasty (2001) {{of women with}} breast implant {{prostheses}} reported {{no significant differences in}} disease-stage {{at the time of the}} diagnosis of cancer; prognoses are similar in both groups of women, with augmented patients at a lower risk for subsequent cancer recurrence or death. Conversely, the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death. That patients with breast implants are more often diagnosed with palpable—but not larger—tumors indicates that equal-sized tumors might be more readily palpated in augmented patients, which might compensate for the impaired mammogram images. The ready palpability of the breast-cancer tumor(s) is consequent to breast tissue thinning by compression, innately in smaller breasts a priori (because they have lesser tissue volumes), and that the implant serves as a <b>radio-opaque</b> base against which a cancerous tumor can be differentiated.|$|E

50|$|The patient {{receives}} an intravenous injection of an iodine-containing contrast agent at a high-rate using an injector pump. Images are acquired with the maximum intensity of <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast in the pulmonary arteries. This {{can be done}} using bolus tracking.|$|E
5000|$|String sign, or {{gastrointestinal}} string sign, is {{a medical}} term for a radiographic finding on an upper GI series, in which the patient is given a <b>radio-opaque</b> material, such as barium, to drink. X-rays are then taken of the patient's stomach and intestines.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, an area {{of white}} lung is seen on a {{standard}} X-ray. Consolidated tissue is more <b>radio-opaque</b> than normally aerated lung parenchyma, {{so that it is}} clearly demonstrable in radiography and on CT scans. Consolidation is often a middle-to-late stage feature/complication in pulmonary infections.|$|E

50|$|A {{baseline}} radiograph (scout film) of {{the required}} salivary gland would be taken, the duct is dilated using graded lacrimal probes, a cannula then is inserted in this salivary gland duct's opening in the mouth, then a <b>Radio-opaque</b> fluid (Contrast medium) is injected in the duct through a small tube.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result is}} an image showing sharply the section along the {{mandible}} arch, and blurred elsewhere. For example, the more <b>radio-opaque</b> anatomical region, the cervical vertebrae (neck), shows as a wide and blurred vertical pillar overlapping the front teeth. The path where the anatomical elements are recorded sharply is called [...] "focal path".|$|E

50|$|Angiography or {{arteriography}} is {{a medical}} imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and the heart chambers. This is traditionally done by injecting a <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy.|$|E
50|$|Projectional radiographs, more {{commonly}} known as x-rays, are often {{used to determine the}} type and extent of a fracture as well as for detecting pathological changes in the lungs.

5000|$|Through this sheath, a long, flexible, {{soft plastic}} tube called a [...] "guiding {{catheter}}" [...] is pushed. The {{tip of the}} guiding catheter is placed {{at the mouth of}} the coronary artery. The guiding catheter also allows for <b>radio-opaque</b> dyes (usually iodine-based) to be injected into the coronary artery, so that the disease state and location can be readily assessed using real time X-ray visualization.|$|E
50|$|No {{treatment}} is required since the lesion is entirely benign. Some suggest that amalgam tattoos are best surgically excised {{so as to}} ensure the lesion does not represent a melanoma. Other say that excision should only be carried out {{if there is any}} doubt over the diagnosis, and that amalgam tattoos are managed by simple reassurance {{about the nature of the}} lesion. For example, if <b>radio-opaque</b> particles are demonstrated on the x-ray, biopsy is unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Lipiodol (labeled Ethiodol in the USA), {{also known}} as ethiodized oil, is a poppyseed oil used by {{injection}} as a <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast agent {{that is used to}} outline structures in radiological investigations. It is used in chemoembolization applications as a contrast agent in follow-up imaging. Lipiodol is also used in lymphangiography, the imaging of the lymphatic system. It has an additional use in gastric variceal obliteration as a dilutant that does not affect polymerization of cyanoacrylate.|$|E
50|$|Hysterosalpingography (HSG), {{also known}} as uterosalpingography, is a radiologic {{procedure}} to investigate {{the shape of the}} uterine cavity and the shape and patency of the fallopian tubes. It entails the injection of a <b>radio-opaque</b> material into the cervical canal and usually fluoroscopy with image intensification. A normal result shows the filling of the uterine cavity and the bilateral filling of the fallopian tube with the injection material. To demonstrate tubal rupture, spillage of the material into the peritoneal cavity needs to be observed.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{naturally}} dissolving stent is the 'Absorb' stent 'produced by Abbott that has several design components and features: base scaffold: a poly(L-lactide) polymer {{similar to that in}} dissolvable stitches is shaped into a tube made up of zigzag hoops linked together by bridges; drug-eluting layer': a mixture of poly-D, L-lactide (PDLLA) and everolimus; 'markers': a pair of <b>radio-opaque</b> platinum markers at the ends that allow the device to be visualized during angiography; 'delivery system': a balloon delivery system.|$|E
5000|$|With Jacques Forestier (1890-1978), he {{introduced}} lipiodol (<b>radio-opaque</b> iodized poppyseed oil) {{for use in}} radiological investigations. Lipiodol was injected into a patients' cerebrospinal fluid for myelographic diagnosis and localization of intraspinal cysts and tumors. Sicard is also credited for introducing injections of sodium salicylate for treatment of varicose veins, as well as alcohol injections for relief of trigeminal neuralgia. In addition, {{he was one of}} the first physicians to become interested in the possibilities of a procedure known as pneumoencephalography.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is clinical. Amalgam tattoo {{can be distinguished}} from other causes of localized oral pigmentation {{because it does not}} change significantly in size or color, although it may appear to slowly enlarge for several months after the initial implantation of the metal particles. Some amalgam tattoos appear <b>radio-opaque</b> on radiographs (i.e. they show up on x-rays), although in many cases amalgam tattoos have no radiographic features since the responsible particle(s) of amalgam are very small even though clinically the area of discolored mucosa is much larger.|$|E
5000|$|Bolus {{tracking}} is {{a technique}} used in computed tomography imaging, to visualise vessels more clearly. A small bolus of <b>radio-opaque</b> contrast media is injected into a patient via a peripheral intravenous cannula. Depending on the vessel being imaged, the volume of contrast is tracked using a region of interest (abbreviated [...] "R.O.I.") at a certain level and then followed by the CT scanner once it reaches this level. Images are acquired at a rate {{as fast as the}} contrast moving through the blood vessels.|$|E
50|$|The {{coronary}} guidewire, {{which is}} an extremely thin wire with a <b>radio-opaque</b> flexible tip, is inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery. While visualizing again by real-time X-ray imaging, the cardiologist guides the wire through the coronary artery {{to the site of}} the stenosis or blockage. The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage. The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently manipulating the end that sits outside the patient through twisting of the guidewire.|$|E
5000|$|Radiopaque marking: Before operation, sponges can be soaked {{through with}} ‘radio-opaque marker’. This allows a sponge {{to be easily}} seen on plain radiographs. When the markers are noticed, it can be assumed that it is {{revealing}} a retained sponge. A.P. Zbar, Surgical Directorate at Oldchurch and Harold Wood Hospitals stated “the diagnosis is easily made by plain abdominal radiography, when a <b>radio-opaque</b> marker is seen”. [...] This method is flawed in that it doesn’t work if the sponges have broken into smaller pieces over time.|$|E
50|$|In {{difficult}} cases or {{in situations}} where intervention to restore blood flow is appropriate, coronary angiography can be performed. A catheter is inserted into an artery (usually the femoral artery) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. A <b>radio-opaque</b> dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and angioplasty applied as a therapeutic measure (see below). Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in interventional cardiology.|$|E
5000|$|As in {{the picture}} on the right where both air and barium are used {{together}} (hence the term [...] "double-contrast" [...] barium enema) air {{can be used as a}} contrast material because it is less <b>radio-opaque</b> than the tissues it is defining. In the picture it highlights the interior of the colon. An example of a technique using purely air for the contrast medium is an air arthrogram where the injection of air into a joint cavity allows the cartilage covering the ends of the bones to be visualized.|$|E
50|$|X-ray {{images of}} {{avascular}} necrosis {{in the early}} stages usually appear normal. In later stages it appears relatively more <b>radio-opaque</b> due to the nearby living bone becoming resorbed secondary to reactive hyperemia. The necrotic bone itself does not show increased radiographic opacity, as dead bone cannot undergo bone resorption which is carried out by living osteoclasts. Late radiographic signs also include a radiolucency area following the collapse of subchondral bone (crescent sign) and ringed regions of radiodensity resulting from saponification and calcification of marrow fat following medullary infarcts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{infants with}} hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the pylorus is narrowed and the <b>radio-opaque</b> {{material}} {{will take on}} {{the appearance of a}} thin string as it passes through this narrowed channel. Often, there are several of these strings seen (called the [...] "railroad track sign"). The use of the upper GI series for the diagnosis of HPS, which was the primary diagnostic tool for this condition in the 1980s and 1990s, has been largely replaced by the use of ultrasound, which is less invasive and can visualize the thickened pylorus, giving actual measurements of this thickening.|$|E
