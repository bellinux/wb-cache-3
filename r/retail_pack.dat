40|$|The {{quality of}} fresh {{chillies}} changes rapidly {{and under the}} Thai ambient conditions (30 ± 5 °C and 75 ± 5 % RH), these products spoil {{in a short time}} frame. This rapid quality deterioration causes a direct loss in returns to growers and marketers. The objectives of this study were to design a modified atmosphere perforated plastic packaging system to extend shelf life and marketability of fresh chillies. Physiological data about fresh green 'Cayenne' chillies was measured; respiration rate, internal partial pressure of O (P O) and CO (p CO), skin permeance to O (P′O), CO (P′CO) and water vapour (P′HO) as well as, water activity (a). The extent to which these attributes were affected by a range of temperatures 5, 10, 20 and 30 °C was also characterised. Respiration dramatically increased as storage temperature was increased from 5 to 30 °C, whilst P′O and P′CO slightly increased. The differing effects of temperature on these two variables were responsible for the depression of internal partial pressure of O and elevation of CO internal partial pressure. The skin permeances to O and CO were very close (approximate ratio P′CO :P′O as 1. 06) and it was determined that the major pathway for gas exchange of green 'Cayenne' chillies was dominated by movement through pores (through the stem area), rather than the cuticle. Average value of skin permeance to water vapour of green 'Cayenne' chillies was 201. 78 nmol·s ·m ·Pa. Water vapour permeances were inconsistent over the 5 - 30 °C temperature range due to errors from thermistor probes and environment around chillies. Surface area of green 'Cayenne' chillies provided the positive relationship with fresh weight, volume and the rate of water loss (measured at ambient temperature ≈ 20 °C). Fresh weight and a of fresh chillies decreased as the storage temperature increased from 5 to 30 °C. Storage temperatures (5, 10, 20 and 30 °C) and packaging types (perforated/nonperforated plastic bags and unpackaging) had significant impact on storage qualities (colour, firmness, weight and decay) of fresh green 'Cayenne' chillies during a 2 -week storage trial period. Refrigerated storage temperatures and perforated plastic bag showed promise in reducing quality attributes changes and eliminating condensation. At 5 and 10 °C, no signs of chilling injury were detected on green 'Cayenne' in any packaging type used during the trial period. The atmospheres inside perforated plastic bag were similar to ambient air condition, thus ensuring that there were aerobic conditions inside. The rate of weight loss of packaged chillies varied with storage temperature, perforation area and size of perforation. The optimum storage condition and package for a 100 g <b>retail</b> <b>pack</b> of chillies during a 2 -week storage period is 5 °C and 152. 40 × 228. 60 mm plastic bag with 0. 49 % perforation area (2. 5 mm perforation size). Chillies stored under this condition had low percentage of weight loss (less than 2. 5 %) with no signs of chilling injury and their quality attributes were within the marketable levels. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) were used to study effects of postharvest disinfecting treatments (sodium hypochlorite (NaClO, 2 %w/v) and hot water dip (HWD, 53 °C 4 minutes)) on storage quality. Both disinfectants significantly reduced decay appearances on bell peppers particularly on those stored at high temperature (20 and 30 °C), during a trial 2 -week storage period. The application of these disinfecting treatments will be further researched on fresh chillies, for minimising decay appearance. The 'Weight Loss Simulator' model developed by Tanner (1998) was tested by comparing predicted weight loss with experimental data. The model had general agreement with the experimentally observed trends. Lack of fit of model predictions to experimental data however, was obvious in some cases. Variations, e. g. storage temperature/relative humidity, packaging and dynamic changes in biological properties of stored chillies can deviate the predicting result of this model. Sensitivity analyses performed on the model showed that the observed lack of fit could largely be explained by estimated uncertainties in the respiration rate data. From this model testing, the accuracy of the 'Weight Loss Simulator' model appeared to be limited by assumptions, input data and uncertainties occurred during data collection rather than by shortcomings in the model itself...|$|E

40|$|Once a {{nuisance}} by-catch, today the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) {{is a valuable}} UK fisheries commodity. Unfortunately, the species is very susceptible to quality deterioration post harvest as it quickly develops black spots and also spoils rapidly due to bacterial growth. Treatment with chemicals can stop the blackening and carefully monitored cold storage {{can result in a}} sensory shelf life of up to 6. 5  days. The high susceptibility to spoilage greatly restricts the extent to which N. norvegicus can be distributed to retailers and displayed for sale. The application of modified atmosphere (MA) could be extremely beneficial, allowing the chilled product to stay fresh {{for a long period of}} time, thus ensuring higher sales. In the present study, we identified a gas mix for the MA packaging (MAP) of whole N. norvegicus lobster into 200  g <b>retail</b> <b>packs.</b> Our results show that a shelf life extension to 13  days can be achieved when <b>retail</b> <b>packs</b> are stored in MAP at 1  °C.

40|$|The aims of this {{investigation}} were to enumerate coliforms in fresh mangoes, puree, cheeks, and cheeks-in-puree {{in order to determine}} the source of these organisms in the processed products, to determine methods for their control, and to identify coliforms isolated from cheeks-in-puree to determine whether they have any public health significance. Product from four processors was tested on two occasions. The <b>retail</b> <b>packs</b> of cheeks-in-puree having the highest coliform counts were those in which raw puree was added to the cheeks. Coliform counts in these samples ranged between 1. 4 × 103 and 5. 4 × 104 cfu/g. Pasteurisation reduced the coliform count of raw puree to < 5 cfu/g. Forty-seven percent of the 73 colonies, isolated as coliforms on the basis of their colony morphology on violet red bile agar, were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae using the ATB 32 E Identification System. Klebsiella strains were tested for growth at 10 °C, faecal coliform response, and fermentation of -melizitose, to differentiate the three phenotypically similar strains, K. pneumoniae, K. terrigena and K planticola. Results indicated that 41 % of K. pneumoniae isolates gave reactions typical of K. pneumoniae. A further 44 % of strains gave an atypical reaction pattern for these tests and were designated ‘psychrotrophic’ K. pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumoniae counts of between 2. 1 × 103 and 4. 9 × 104 cfu/g were predicted to occur in the <b>retail</b> <b>packs</b> of mango cheeks-in-puree produced by the processors who constituted this product with raw puree.
