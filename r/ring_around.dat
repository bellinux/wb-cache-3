5|$|The {{subspecies}} of the Australian ringneck differ {{considerably in}} colouration. It is a medium size species around 33cm (11in) long. The basic colour is green, and all four subspecies have the characteristic yellow <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the hindneck; wings and tail are {{a mixture of}} green and blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{white-eyes}} {{are small}} birds of rather drab appearance, the plumage above being typically greenish-olive, but some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast or lower parts, and several have buff flanks. As the name suggests, many species have a white <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> each eyes.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the flags used by the military, several other flag designs were inspired by the national flag. The former Japan Post flag consisted of the Hinomaru with a red horizontal bar placed {{in the center of}} the flag. There was also a thin white <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the red sun. It was later replaced by a flag that consisted of the 〒 postal mark in red on a white background.|$|E
5|$|In euryarchaea {{the cell}} {{division}} protein FtsZ, which forms a contracting <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the cell, and {{the components of}} the septum that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, the cell division machinery Cdv fulfills a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.|$|E

5|$|The German attack went {{according}} to plan, with 3rd Panzer Army {{pushing through the}} middle nearly unopposed and then splitting its mobile forces north to complete the encirclement of Vyazma with 4th Panzer Army, and other units south to close the <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> Bryansk in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Army. The Soviet defenses, still under construction, were overrun and spearheads of the Second and Third Panzer Groups met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941. Four Soviet armies (the 19th, 20th, 24th and 32nd) were encircled in a large pocket {{just west of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|These {{are often}} called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes {{like that of}} a {{flounder}} (Old English flóc). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts, a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E

5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and Črnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice {{by the end of the}} day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.|$|E

5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the eyes, {{which is more}} prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs in a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the edge, which {{grow up to}} 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E

5|$|A non-tropical frontal low {{developed}} from a cold front on November 1 {{to the west}} of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm on November 4 about 775 nautical miles (1435km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> the center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds near the center, and due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near the center, and Noel weakened to a tropical storm early on November 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later on November 6 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.|$|E
5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, Yugoslavia {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came under {{increasing}} pro-Axis political pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact. Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the <b>ring</b> <b>around</b> Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling <b>ring.</b> <b>Around</b> him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
