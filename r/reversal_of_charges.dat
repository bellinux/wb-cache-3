40|$|The {{measurement}} of the mass di erences for systems bound by the strong force has reached a very high precision with protons and anti-protons 1, 2. The extension of such measurement from (anti-) baryons to (anti-) nuclei allows one to probe any di erence in the interactions between nucleons and antinucleons encoded in the (anti-) nuclei masses. This force is a remnant of the underlying strong interaction among quarks and gluons and can be described by e ective theories 3, but cannot yet be directly derived from quantum chromodynamics.

40|$|Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion {{channels}} are key mediators underlying signal transduction in retinal and olfactory receptors. Genetic defects in CNGA 3 and CNGB 3, encoding two structurally related subunits of cone CNG channels, lead to achromatopsia (ACHM). ACHM is a congenital, autosomal recessive retinal disorder that manifests by cone photoreceptor dysfunction, severely reduced visual acuity, impaired or complete color blindness and photophobia. Here, we report the first canine models for CNGA 3 -associated channelopathy caused by R 424 W or V 644 del mutations in the canine CNGA 3 ortholog that accurately mimic the clinical and molecular features of human CNGA 3 -associated ACHM. These two spontaneous mutations exposed CNGA 3 residues {{essential for the}} preservation of channel function and biogenesis. The CNGA 3 -R 424 W results in complete loss of cone function in vivo and channel activity confirmed by in vitro electrophysiology. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed R 424 -E 306 salt bridge formation and its disruption with the R 424 W mutant. <b>Reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> in a CNGA 3 -R 424 E-E 306 R double mutant channel rescued cGMP-activated currents uncovering new insights into channel gating.

The isoelectric point determined under these conditions {{does not appear to be}} connected specifically with the immune body but is perhaps associated with phenomena incidental to red cell destruction and the presence of serum. The characteristic lowering of mobility by amboceptor occurs, however, from pH 4. 0 to pH 7. 4. The curves of mobility plotted against pH for normal and for immune sera support the viewpoint that the identity of the isoelectric points for normal and sensitized sheep cells is not primarily concerned with the immune reaction. It is most unlikely that an "albumin" or a "globulin" surface covers red cells with a complete protein film. Although serum protein reacts with red cells in acid solutions, this is not demonstrable for gelatin. The lowering of mobility usually ascribed to anti-sheep rabbit serum may also occur, but to a lesser degree, in normal rabbit serum. This diminution of mobility is not, in the first place, associated with sensitization to hemolysis induced by complement.

Circular dichroism measurements show an alpha-helical structure correlating with the ability of the peptides to interact with lipids and with the surface activity of peptide/lipid dispersions.

50|$|Three-dimensional droplet {{actuation}} {{has been}} made possible by implementing a closed system; this system contains a µL sized droplet in immiscible fluid medium. The droplet and medium are then sandwiched between two electromagnetic plates, creating an EM field between the two plates. The purpose of this method is to transfer the droplet from a lower planar surface to an upper parallel planar surface and back down via electrostatic forces. The physics behind such particle actuation and perpendicular movement can be understood from early works of N. N. Lebedev and I. P. Skal’skaya. In their research, they attempted to model the Maxwell electrical charge acquired by a perfectly round conducting particle {{in the presence of}} a uniform magnetic field caused by a perfectly-conducting and infinitely-stretching surface. Their model helps to predict the Z-direction motion of the microdroplets within the device as it points to the magnitude and direction of forces acting upon a micro droplet. This can be used to help accurately predict and correct for unwanted and uncontrollable particle movement. The model explains why failing to employ dielectric coating on one of the two surfaces causes <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> within the droplet upon contact with each electrode and in turn causes the droplets to uncontrollably bounce of between electrodes.|$|R
40|$|The prion {{diseases}} are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders {{linked to a}} pathogenic conformer (PrPSc) of the normal prion protein (PrPC). Accumulation of PrPSc occurs via a poorly defined process in which PrPSc complexes with and converts endogenous PrPC to nascent PrPSc. Recent experiments {{have focused on the}} highly charged first alpha helix (H 1) of PrP. It has been proposed that two putative asparagine-to-arginine intrahelical salt bridges stabilize H 1 in PrPC yet form intermolecular ionic bonds with adjacent PrP molecules during conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (M. P. Morrissey and E. I. Shakhnovich, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 : 11293 - 11298, 1999). Subsequent work (J. O. Speare et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278 : 12522 - 12529, 2003 using a cell-free assay of PrPSc conversion suggested that rather than promoting conversion, the salt bridges stabilize PrPC against it. However, the role of individual H 1 charges in PrPSc generation has not yet been investigated. To approach this question, we systematically reversed or neutralized each charged residue in H 1 and tested the effect on conversion to PrPSc in scrapie-infected murine neuroblastoma (ScN 2 a) cells.

The sample of this study consists of 182 public companies listed on Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) that reported <b>reversals</b> <b>of</b> their impairment <b>charges</b> during the period 2006 - 2009.

For example, mutations between or near residues 112 to 136 of cardiac troponin-T, the crucial TnT 1 (N-terminal domain of troponin-T) -tropomyosin-binding region, cause cardiomyopathy. The Drosophila upheld(101) Glu/Lys amino acid substitution lies C-terminally adjacent to this phylogenetically conserved sequence. Using a highly integrative approach, we sought to determine the molecular trigger of upheld(101) myofibrillar degeneration, to evaluate contractile performance in the mutant cardiomyocytes, and {{to examine the effects}} of the mutation on the entire Drosophila heart to elucidate regulatory roles for conserved TnT 1 regions and provide possible mechanistic insight into cardiac dysfunction. Live video imaging of Drosophila cardiac tubes revealed that the troponin-T mutation prolongs systole and restricts diastolic dimensions of the heart, because of increased numbers of actively cycling myosin cross-bridges. Elevated resting myocardial stiffness, consistent with upheld(101) diastolic dysfunction, was confirmed by an atomic force microscopy-based nanoindentation approach. Direct visualization of mutant thin filaments via electron microscopy and 3 -dimensional reconstruction resolved destabilized tropomyosin positioning and aberrantly exposed myosin-binding sites under low Ca 2 + conditions.

In all these molecules, the strongest ESA transition is found to arise from the same electronic process, exhibiting a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> parity. In addition, F 8 PFB and F 8 TFB are found to possess almost identical electronic behaviour. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{suggested}} for {{the structure of}} an adsorbed layer <b>of</b> a highly <b>charged</b> semi-flexible polyelectrolyte on a weakly <b>charged</b> surface <b>of</b> opposite <b>charge</b> sign. The adsorbed phase is thin, owing to the effective <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> sign <b>of</b> the surface upon adsorption, and ordered, owing to the high surface density of polyelectrolyte strands caused by the generally strong binding between polyelectrolyte and surface. The Poisson–Boltzmann equation for the electrostatic interaction between the array of adsorbed polyelectrolytes and the charged surface is solved for a cylindrical geometry, both numerically, using a finite element method, and analytically within the weak curvature limit under the assumption of excess monovalent salt. For small separations, repulsive surface polarization and counterion osmotic pressure effects dominate over the electrostatic attraction and the resulting electrostatic interaction curve shows a minimum at nonzero separations on the Ångstrom scale. The equilibrium density of the adsorbed phase is obtained by minimizing the total free energy under the condition of equality of chemical potential and osmotic pressure of the polyelectrolyte in solution and in the adsorbed phase. For {{a wide range of}} ionic conditions and <b>charge</b> densities <b>of</b> the <b>charged</b> surface, the interstrand separation as predicted by the Poisson–Boltzmann model and the analytical theory closely agree. For low to moderate <b>charge</b> densities <b>of</b> the adsorbing surface, the interstrand spacing decreases as a function <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> density <b>of</b> the <b>charged</b> surface. Above about 0. 1 M excess monovalent salt, it is only weakly dependent on the ionic strength. At high <b>charge</b> densities <b>of</b> the adsorbing surface, the interstrand spacing increases with increasing ionic strength, in line with the experiments by Fang and Yang [J. Phys. Chem. B 101, 441 (1997) ]. BiotechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Conditions of {{precipitation}} of nucleosome core particles (NCP) by divalent cations (Ca 21 and Mg 21) have been explored {{over a large}} range of nucleosome and cation concentrations. Precipitation of NCP occurs for a threshold of divalent cation concentration, and redissolution is observed for further addition of salt. The phase diagram looks similar to those obtained with DNA and synthetic polyelectrolytes {{in the presence of}} multivalent cations, which supports the idea that NCP/NCP interactions are driven by cation condensation. In the phase separation domain the effective <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the aggregates was determined by measurements of their electrophoretic mobility. Aggregates formed in the presence of divalent cations (Mg 21) remain negatively charged over the whole concentration range. They turn positively charged when aggregation is induced by trivalent (spermidine) or tetravalent (spermine) cations. The higher the valency of the counterions, the more significant is the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the effective <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the aggregates. The sign <b>of</b> the effective <b>charge</b> has no influence on the aspect of the phase diagram. We discuss the possible reasons for this charge reversal in the light of actual theoretical approaches...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the formation of}} cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB), a cationic surfactant quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), immobilized on kaolinite with different initial CPB concentrations ([CPB]i) and their effect on the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The CPB-immobilized kaolinites were characterized by a CHNS analyzer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential (ZP) analysis {{and the amount of}} CPB adsorbed on kaolinite. The antibacterial assay of the samples was studied through the disk diffusion technique (DDT) against E. coli as a model bacterium. The amount of CPB adsorbed on kaolinite did not affect the structure of the parent kaolinite but affected the overall <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the kaolinite and eventually affected their antibacterial activity. CPB-immobilized kaolinite with [CPB]i above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) possessed antibacterial activity because <b>of</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> from negative to positive on the kaolinite surfaces, as proven by ZP analysis, which could allow the action of CPB molecules against bacteria cells. This was due to the bilayer formation of surfactant molecules via hydrophobic bonding of their long hydrocarbon chains on the kaolinite surfaces at surfactant concentrations above the CMC value. Therefore, one of the important factors in producing antibacterial agents from surfactant immobilized kaolinite (organo-clay) is by loading excess surfactant on the clay above its CMC level to ensure bilayer formation of surfactant molecules on clay surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Tissue factor (TF) is {{the main}} {{physiological}} initiator of blood coagulation and its activation or de-encryption within plasma membranes is important for trapping, extravasation and angiogenesis {{in the development and}} spread of solid malignancies. Multidrug resistance is also an adaptive response in malignant (and normal) cells. It is often mediated by the over-expression of the P-glycoprotein (P-gP) efflux pump. Both TF and P-gP tend to be expressed together, perhaps as part of a coherent 'crisis management' response of cells to environmental change or challenge. An associated feature in such a response appears to be the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> normal phospholipid <b>charge</b> asymmetry in the plasma membrane bilayer. Responses to environmental stimuli affect function in normal and malignant tissue. Uniting the study of TF expression or de-encryption and MDR- 1 phenotype would be biologically enlightening and might ultimately influence clinical cancer management and the control of thrombotic problems associated with treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} correlation-corrected {{transport}} theory {{in order to}} predict ionic and polymer transport properties of membrane nanopores in physical conditions where mean-field electrostatics breaks down. The experimentally observed low KCl conductivity of open alpha-Hemolysin pores is quantitatively explained {{by the presence of}} surface polarization effects. Upon the penetration of a DNA molecule into the pore, these polarization forces combined with the electroneutrality of DNA sets a lower boundary for the ionic current, explaining the weak salt dependence of blocked pore conductivities at dilute ion concentrations. The addition of multivalent counterions into the solution results in the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the polymer <b>charge</b> and the direction of the electroosmotic flow. With trivalent spermidine or quadrivalent spermine molecules, the charge inversion is strong enough to stop the translocation of the polymer and to reverse its motion. This mechanism can be used efficiently in translocation experiments in order to improve the accuracy of DNA sequencing by minimizing the translocation velocity of the polymer.
