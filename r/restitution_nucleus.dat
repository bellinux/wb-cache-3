40|$|Embryological {{researches}} of an invasive plant Rudbeckia laciniata {{focused on}} the process of megasporogenesis, female gametophyte formation, and fertilization. A disturbed first meiotic division results in the formation of <b>restitution</b> <b>nucleus.</b> In some megaspore mother cells micronuclei or vacuoles were observed near the <b>restitution</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Different course of megasporogenesis {{led to the development of}} unreduced embryo sacs with various organization which is reflected in the embryo formation and capacity of seed germination. Our research confirmed the occurrence of hemigamy in the Polish representatives of R. laciniata. In spite of a reduced germination capacity of R. laciniata seeds, their production allows a long-distance dispersal and expansion of the species...|$|E
40|$|Total {{absence of}} callose in the ovules of diplosporous species has been {{previously}} suggested. This paper is the first description of callose events in the ovules of Chondrilla juncea, which exhibits meiotic diplospory of the Taraxacum type. We found the presence of callose in the megasporocyte wall and stated that the pattern of callose deposition is dynamically changing during megasporogenesis. At the premeiotic stage, no callose was observed in the ovules. Callose appeared at the micropylar pole of the cell entering prophase of the first meioticdivision restitution but did not surround the megasporocyte. After {{the formation of a}} <b>restitution</b> <b>nucleus,</b> a conspicuous callose micropylar cap and dispersed deposits of callose were detected in the megasporocyte wall. During the formation of a diplodyad, the micropylar callose cap decreased and the walls of a newly formed megaspores showed scattered distribution of callose. Within the older diplodyad, callose was mainly accumulated in the wall between megaspores, {{as well as in the}} wall of the micropylar cell; however, a dotted fluorescence of callose was also visible in the wall of the chalazal megaspore. Gradual degradation of callose in the wall of the chalazal cell and intense callose accumulation in the wall of the micropylar cell were related to the selection of the functional megaspore. Thus, our findings may suggest that callose fulfills a similar role both during megasporogenesis in sexual angiosperms and in the course of meiotic diplospory in apomicts and seems to form a regulatory interface between reproductive and somatic cells...|$|E
40|$|Two {{accession}}s {{were studied}} for male meiosis in Ranunculus laetus {{from the cold}} regions of Northwest Himalayas. One accession showed the presence of 14 bivalents at diakinesis and regular segregation of bivalents at anaphase I which lead to normal tetrad formation with four n microspores and consequently n pollen grains and 100 % pollen fertility. Second accession from the same locality revealed the erratic meiosis characterized {{by the presence of}} all the 28 chromosomes as univalents in meiocytes at metaphase I. Univalent chromosomes failed to segregate during anaphases and produced <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> at meiosis I and II. These <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> resulted into dyads and triads which subsequently produced two types of apparently fertile pollen grains. On the basis of size, the two types of pollen grains were categorized as n (normal reduced) and 2 n (unreduced, 1. 5 -times larger than the n pollen grains). The estimated frequency of 2 n pollen grains from dyads and triads (61. 59 %) was almost {{the same as that of}} the observed one (59. 90 %), which indicated that 2 n pollen grains in R. laetus were the result of dyads and triads. The present paper herein may provide an insight into the mechanisms of the formation of various intraspecific polyploids through sexual polyploidization in R. laetus...|$|R

40|$|Pollen mother cell (PMC) {{development}} in the apomictic Boechera species B. holboellii, B. gunnisoniana and B. divaricarpa were investigated by various cytological methods. In prophase I, in triploid species B. holboellii and B. gunnisoniana the individual chromosomes condensed into long strands within the nucleus. Then, in metaphase I, each PMC formed a restitutional nucleus thereby bypassing {{the rest of the}} first meiotic division. This is interpreted as representing apomeiosis. Subsequently, the <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> underwent a single cytokinesis as evidenced by the production of dyads. The cells within each dyad were separated by a callose wall. Most of the PMC in B. holboellii and B. gunnisoniana produced dyads, but a small proportion generated conspicuous tetrads. In contrast, diploid apomict B. divaricarpa produced only tetrads by simultaneous cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oleander glycosides on {{dividing}} endosperm cells of Haemanthus katherine {{was investigated in}} vitro. The disturbances in the successive cell division phases were analysed in reference to cytokinesis. A strong tendency was noted to <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> formation in all phases of mitosis, and particularly in prophase. The observed chromosome pattern {{is the result of}} disturbances in prometaphase and anaphase chromosome movements owing to disturbances in the function of 'the 'mitotic spindle. It is probable that oleander glycosides inhibit formatiom of 'the microtubules of the mitotic spindle and disorganize the already formed spindle. They cause minor disturbances in cytokinesis, although frequently cell plates arise in quite unexpected places. The {{results of the present study}} are compared with those obtained in the case of root meristematic cells (Tarkowska, 1971 a, b) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{solution}} of {{a mixture of}} glycosides from oleander (Nerium oleander L.) on the germination of pollen grains and on the mitosis of the generative nucleus in Tradescantia bracteata Small and Allium cepa L. has been studied. An inhibition of the germination and {{of the growth of}} pollen tubes was observed, proportionally to the concentration of glycosides. The pollen grains of A. cepa are more sensitive. The disturbances in mitosis lead to the formation of two or more uneven-sized doughter nuclei, or to the formation of <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei.</b> These anomalies are more numerous in T. bracteata. From these results d t appears that pollen grains of A. cepa are characterized by a generally high physiological sensitivity and a small mitotic sensitivity, wheras for T. bracteata the opposite is true...|$|R
40|$|The {{triploid}} hybrids between Arachis hypogaea L. and diploid {{species of}} section Arachis nom. nud. {{which had been}} observed to be sterile at Reading, England, produced pegs and pods at the ICRISAT Center. Cytological investigations {{of these and other}} triploid hybrids revealed (1) spindle abnormalities resulting in <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> and unreduced gametes, and (2) unequal segregation of chromosomes resulting in haploid to hyperdiploid gametes. Of the 225 F 2 plants derived from triploids, 82 % were hexaploid, 8 % were tetraploid, and 10 % had chromosome numbers from 20 – 59. This indicates that the above processes occurred both at micro- and mega-sporogenesis and that unreduced gametes were more effective in fertilization resulting in a higher percentage of hexaploid progenies. The implications of these results are that triploids can be used in Arachis interspecific breeding for increased recombination between chromosomes and quick recovery of Arachis hypogaea like tetraploid lines...|$|R
40|$|Cases of "distributive c-mitosis" (the term {{does not}} mean that {{colchicine}} has been used) in plant endosperm are described, in which the chromosomes of metaphase type (two-chromatid chromosomes) are distributed at random because of phragmoplast activity in a process similar to non-disjunction. There is some evidence that chromosmal fibres can be formed within the phragmoplast under special circumstances; during "distributive c-mitosis" some kinetochores show active movements due to cooperation with chromosomal fibres formed in the phragmoplast; while other chromosomes, as indicated by their arrangements and shape, are moved without any activity of kinetochores. Some components of the phragmoplast have the fastest movements occurring in mitosis. Some cases are described in which the phragmoplast divides telophase and interphase nuclei into two or more groups and moves the pieces a considerable distance apart. In a similar way, the phragmoplast may divide newly formed <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei.</b> This phenomenon leads to a reduction of chromosome numbers, and the course of the process itself is reminiscent of amitosis...|$|R
40|$|Arachis kempff-mercadoi is a {{wild species}} from the section Arachis. All kempff-mercadoi accessions {{originate}} from the Santa Cruz province of Bolivia and they represent Arachis species with the A genome. From molecular analysis {{it was found}} that although cultivated A. hypogaea is made up of A and B genomes, A. kempff-mercadoi may not be as closely related to it as are some of the other A genome species. Arachis kempff-mercadoi is of interest because it has multiple disease resistance. It was crossed with a Spanish A. hypogaea cultivar which is susceptible to foliar diseases and to the insect pest Spodoptera litura. The success rate of the cross A. hypogaea (2 n= 40) × A. kempff-mercadoi (2 n= 20) was very low, but it could be increased by culturing immature seeds in vitro. Although the hybrids were triploids, a few fertile pollen grains were obtained due to the formation of <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the F 1 plants. Interspecific derivatives at the BC 2 F 2 generation were scored for early leaf spot, late leaf spot and to Spodoptera damage. Screening results showed that 29 % of the derivatives had both early and late leaf spot resistance and that less than 5 % of the derivatives had resistance to both the foliar diseases and to Spodopter...|$|R
40|$|Somaclonal {{variation}} in plants regenerated by organogenesis from long-term cultured calluses of two diploid staminate genotypes of Asparagus officinalis cv. Argenteuil {{was characterized by}} plant phenotype, ploidy, meiotic behavior, pollen viability, fruit and seed set, and AFLP profiles. Phenotypic deviations from the donors were detected in foliage color, flower size, and cladode and flower morphology. Ploidy changes were observed in 37. 8 % of the 37 regenerants studied. Meiotic alterations in 12 out of 21 regenerants included laggards, dicentric bridges, micronuclei, <b>restitution</b> <b>nuclei</b> and polyads. Of the 408 AFLP markers screened in 43 regenerants and the donors, 2. 94 % showed polymorphism. High pollen viability was observed in the 22 regenerants analyzed. All crosses between one pistillate plant and 35 regenerants, {{as well as the}} controls, produced fruits and seeds; however, no plump seeds resulted in 35. 3 % of the crosses with regenerants, and no seeds germinated in 12. 5 % of those with apparently normal seeds. Fruit and seed set was similar in crosses with diploid regenerants with normal meiosis and the controls but was lower in crosses with diploid and polyploid regenerants with abnormal meiosis. Our results show that the regenerated plants exhibited conspicuous somaclonal variation that could be eventually exploited for in vitro selection systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{synchronization}} and micro-nuclei induction in a suspension culture of Beta vulgaris, was {{induced by the}} sequential treatment with the DNA-synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin (30 mu M, 24 h) and the spindle-toxin amiprophos-methyl (32 mu M, 24 h). Mitotic arrest of divisions, spreading of G 2 -metaphase chromosomes, re-grouping of chromosomes, formation of a nuclear cell wall around single and re-grouped chromosomes and <b>restitution</b> of <b>nuclei</b> with a doubled DNA content was observed. The process of micro-nucleation was induced much less efficiently in Beta vulgaris than in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Cytological observations and monitoring of the process with flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy, was essential to follow up {{the course of events}} and to monitor the development of an efficient procedure for micro-protoplast isolation. Micro-nucleated protoplasts were fractioned by iso-osmotic Percoll gradient centrifugation to obtain heterogeneous micro-protoplast populations with cytoplasts and micro-protoplasts of different size. An enriched fraction with small sub-diploid micro-protoplasts was obtained with the equivalent DNA content of 1 - 4 chromosomes, as revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. Sub-diploid micro-protoplasts with DNA amounts equivalent to 1 - 4 chromosomes were predominantly observed in the size classes of 1. 8 - 10. 2 mu m at a frequency of 34. 2 - 34. 5 %. The DNA measurements of micro-nuclei and micro-protoplasts, confirmed the hypothesis that the process of micro-nucleation followed the same course of cellular events as observed in N. plumbaginifolia. The correlation between DNA content and size of micro-nuclei and micro-protoplasts was not linear and affected by the degree of DNA condensation, total amount of DNA, and the presence of cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|Polyploidy is well {{recognized}} as {{a major force in}} plant speci-ation. Among the polyploids in nature, allopolyploids are pre-ponderant and include important crop plants like bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (2 n 5 6 x 5 42; AABBDD genomes). Al-lopolyploidy must result through concomitant or sequential events that entail interspecific or intergeneric hybridization and chromosome doubling in the resultant hybrids. To gain insight into the mechanism of evolution of wheat, we ex-tracted polyhaploids of 2 cultivars, Chinese Spring (CS) and Fukuhokomugi (Fuko), of bread wheat by crossing them with maize, Zea mays L. ssp. mays. The derived Ph 1 -polyhaploids (2 n 5 3 x 5 21; ABD) showed during meiosis mostly univa-lents, which produced first-division <b>restitution</b> (FDR) <b>nuclei</b> that in turn gave rise to unreduced (2 n) male gametes with 21 chromosomes. The haploids on maturity set some viable seed. The mean number of seeds per spike was 1. 45 ± 0. 161 in CS and 2. 3 ± 0. 170 in Fuko. Mitotic chromosome prepa-rations from root tips of the derived plantlets revealed 2 n 5 42 chromosomes, that is, twice that of the parental polyha-ploid, which indicated that they arose by fusion of unreduced male and female gametes formed by the polyhaploid. The Ph 1 -induced univalency must have produced 2 n gametes and hence bilateral sexual polyploidization and reconstitution of disomic bread wheat. These findings highlight the quantum jump by which bread wheat evolved from durum wheat in nature. Thus, bread wheat offers an excellent example of rapid evolution by allopolyploidy. In the induced polyhaploids (ABD) that are equivalent of amphihaploids, meiotic phenom-ena such as FDR led to regeneration of parental bread wheat, perhaps a simulation of the evolutionary steps that occurred in nature {{at the time of the}} origin of hexaploid wheat. Polyploidy—a condition with multiple sets of chromosomes— has long been {{recognized as}} a dominant factor in plant spe-ciation, particularly among angiosperms (Leitch and Bennet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background DIPLOSPOROUS (DIP) is {{the locus}} for diplospory in Taraxacum, {{associated}} to unreduced female gamete formation in apomicts. Apomicts reproduce clonally through seeds, including apomeiosis, parthenogenesis, and autonomous or pseudogamous endosperm formation. In Taraxacum, diplospory results in first division <b>restitution</b> (FDR) <b>nuclei,</b> and inherits as a dominant, monogenic trait, independent {{from the other}} apomixis elements. A preliminary genetic linkage map indicated that the DIP -locus lacks suppression of recombination, which is unique among all other map-based cloning efforts of apomeiosis to date. FDR as well as apomixis as a whole are of interest in plant breeding, allowing for polyploidization and fixation of hybrid vigor, respectively. No dominant FDR or apomixis genes have yet been isolated. Here, we zoom-in to the DIP -locus by largely extending our initial mapping population, and by analyzing (local) suppression of recombination and allele sequence divergence (ASD). Results We identified 24 recombinants between two most closely linked molecular markers to DIP in an F 1 -population of 2227 plants that segregates for diplospory and lacks parthenogenesis. Both markers segregated c. 1 : 1 in the entire population, indicating a 1 : 1 segregation rate of diplospory. Fine-mapping showed three amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) closest to DIP at 0. 2 cM at one flank and a single AFLP at 0. 4 cM at the other flank. Our data lacked strong evidence for ASD at marker regions close to DIP. An unexpected bias towards diplosporous plants among the recombinants (20 out of 24) was found. One third of these diplosporous recombinants showed incomplete penetrance of 50 - 85 % diplospory. Conclusions Our data give interesting {{new insights into the}} structure of the diplospory locus in Taraxacum. We postulate a locus with a minimum of two DIP -genes and possibly including one or two enhancers or cis- regulatory elements {{on the basis of the}} bias towards diplosporous recombinants and incomplete penetrance of diplospory in some of them. We define the DIP -locus to 0. 6 cM, which is estimated to cover ~ 200 - 300 Kb, with the closest marker at 0. 2 cM. Our results confirm the minor role of suppression of recombination and ASD around DIP, making it an excellent candidate to isolate via a chromosome-walking approach. </p...|$|R
