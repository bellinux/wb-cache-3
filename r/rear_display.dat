50|$|The Fujifilm X20 is {{a digital}} compact camera {{announced}} by Fujifilm on January 7, 2013. It is {{the successor to}} the Fujifilm X10, with which it shares its lens. However, instead of an EXR colour filter pattern as in the X10, the X20 uses an X-Trans pattern on its sensor. Another advance {{is that the new}} sensor supports phase detection autofocus. Concurrently, the image processor was upgraded to version II. The viewfinder no longer is a simple tunnel viewfinder, but includes an information overlay with focus confirmation and exposure data indicated. Another new focusing feature not available in the X10 is focus peaking on the <b>rear</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{solid-state}} dynamic parallax barrier autostereoscopic display mitigates some of {{the restrictions}} present in static barrier systems such as fixed view-distance range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating mode. By dynamically varying barrier parameters in real time, viewersmaymove closer to the display andmove faster laterally than with a static barrier system, and the display can switch between 3 D and 2 D modes by disabling the barrier on a per-pixel basis. Moreover, Dynallax can output four independent eye channels when two viewers are present, and both head-tracked viewers receive an independent pair of left-eye and right-eye perspective views based on their position in 3 D space. The display device is constructed by using a dual-stacked LCDmonitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and a modulated virtual environment composed of two or four channels is rendered on the <b>rear</b> <b>display.</b> Dynallax was recently demonstrated in a small-scale head-tracked prototype system. This paper summarizes the concepts presented earlier, extends the discussion of various topics, and presents recent improvements to the system.

40|$|A novel {{barrier strip}} autostereoscopic (AS) display is {{demonstrated}} using a solid-state dynamic parallax barrier. A dynamic barrier mitigates restrictions inherent in static barrier {{systems such as}} fixed view distance range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating mode. By dynamically varying barrier parameters in real time, viewers may move closer to the display and move faster laterally than with a static barrier system. Furthermore, users can switch between 3 D and 2 D modes by disabling the barrier. Dynallax is head-tracked, directing view channels to positions in space reported by a tracking system in real time. Such head-tracked parallax barrier systems have traditionally supported only a single viewer, but by varying the barrier period to eliminate conflicts between viewers, Dynallax presents four independent eye channels when two viewers are present. Each viewer receives an independent pair of left and right eye perspective views based on their position in 3 D space. The display device is constructed using a dual-stacked LCD monitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and the <b>rear</b> <b>display</b> produces a modulated VR scene composed of two or four channels. A small-scale head-tracked prototype VR system is demonstrated. Performance data are analyzed while advantages, disadvantages, ongoing and future work are identified...|$|E

40|$|Front {{projection}} is an economical {{method to}} produce large displays. However, the twin problems of occlusions, which create {{shadows on the}} screen, and light projected onto users near the screen, potentially blinding them, makes front projection a poor fit for large upright interactive surfaces. Virtual Rear Projection (VRP) uses multiple redundant front projectors to provide the user experience of using a <b>rear</b> projected <b>display.</b> By using a projector-camera system to mitigate shadows and blinding light, a virtual <b>rear</b> projected <b>display</b> significantly improves upon the user experience of a traditional front projected display, allowing it to replace a <b>rear</b> projected <b>display.</b> In this thesis we characterize the problems caused by shadows and occlusions and develop projection technologies that mitigate shadows and blinding light. We also present a laboratory performance evaluation, and a user evaluation of the technology showing that VRP improves the user experience with respect to traditional front projection. Ph. D.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used view in word processing software shows only the paragraphs of text immediately adjacent to the cursor position. Generally this is appropriate, for example when composing a single paragraph. However, when reviewing or working on the layout of a document {{it is necessary to}} establish awareness of current text {{in the context of the}} document as a whole. This can be done by scrolling or zooming, but when doing so, focus is easily lost and hard to regain. Furthermore, in a collaborative editing/review setting it is not only necessary for each user to understand their own context, but also to have an awareness of the contexts of the other participants. Although systems have been developed that provide awareness in collaborative settings, they usually rely on multiple windows, which use valuable screen real-estate. We have developed a system called DeepDocument using a two-layered LCD display in which both focussed and document-wide views are presented simultaneously. The overview is shown on the <b>rear</b> <b>display</b> and the focussed view on the front, maintaining full screen size for each. The physical separation of the layers takes advantage of human depth perception capabilities to allow users to perceive the views independently without having to redirect their gaze. DeepDocument has been written as an extension to Microsoft Word™. It also includes awareness features to track focus positions for both single and multiple users...|$|E

50|$|Also {{designed}} by Herman J. Schwarzmann, the Art Gallery building (now known as Memorial Hall) {{is made of}} brick, glass, iron and granite. Memorial Hall, the only exhibit building to survive on the Centennial site, was designed in the beaux-arts style and housed the art exhibits. It was the largest art hall in the country when it opened, with a massive 1.5-acre footprint and a 150-foot dome sitting atop a 59-foot-high structure with a 150-foot dome sitting on top. It provided 75,000 square feet of wall surface for paintings and 20,000 square feet of floor space for sculptures.The Centennial received so many art contributions that a separate annex was built to house them all. Another building was built for the display of photography. Schwarzmann based his design for Memorial Hall on Nicholas Felix Escaliers project for the Prix de Rome published in 1867-69. Constructed of granite, brick, glass and iron, Memorial Hall consisted of a central domed area surrounded by four pavilions on the corners with open arcades east and west of the main entrance. During the exhibition, the building along with the Art Gallery Extension directly to its <b>rear</b> <b>displayed</b> the art of many nations.20. Memorial Hall became the prototype, both from a stylistic and organizational standpoint, for other museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago (1892-1893), Milwaukee Public Museum (1893-1897), Brooklyn Museum (1893-1924), and Detroit Institute of Art (1920-1927). Libraries like the Library of Congress, New York Public Library and Free Library of Philadelphia also emulated its form.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{their low}} cost, {{conventional}} <b>rear</b> projection <b>displays</b> are bulky, and so not as attractive to consumers as other thin-panel <b>display</b> devices. <b>Rear</b> projection <b>displays</b> can, however, {{be made as}} thin as most flat panel displays if the image is projected via a wedge-shaped waveguide panel. Image overlapping {{has been found to}} be a major issue with conventional wedge waveguide design, but it can be removed with the insertion of a curved waveguide called the transition waveguide. This thesis reports several analysis techniques and methods for designing the transition waveguide for a wedge display panel. A simple simulation model and a parabolic prototype wedge panel were first built to demonstrate the effects of the insertion of the transition waveguide. The length and the curvature of the transition region curve were found to be the two factors that most influenced the linearity of the panel. Using various techniques of curve analysis, the curvature of the transition region was proved to be the determining factor out of the two and it was also shown that a short transition waveguide is more desirable than a long one, except when the structure of the wedge waveguide is pre-determined. A concept for generating the wedge surface profile iteratively is proposed in this thesis as a way to design the ideal transition waveguide. A prototype panel with a very short transition waveguide was built using an iterative algorithm developed by the author to prove the validity of the concept.
