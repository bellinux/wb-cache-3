2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{structural}} engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan, considered the [...] "father of tubular designs" [...] for high-rises, {{realized that the}} dominating <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> frame structure {{was not the only}} system apt for tall buildings, marking a new era of skyscraper construction in terms of multiple structural systems. His central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the concept of the [...] "tube" [...] structural system, including the [...] "framed tube", [...] "trussed tube", and [...] "bundled tube". These systems allow greater economic efficiency, and also allow skyscrapers to take on various shapes, no longer needing to be rectangular and box-shaped. The first building to employ the tube structure was the Chestnut De-Witt apartment building. Over the next fifteen years, many towers were built by Fazlur Rahman Khan and the [...] "Second Chicago School", including the massive [...] Willis Tower. Other pioneers of this field include Hal Iyengar and William LeMessurier.|$|E
2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E

50|$|In 1891, {{within months}} of Seth Carlo Chandler's {{discovery}} of the 14-month variation of latitude, now {{referred to as the}} Chandler wobble, Newcomb explained the apparent conflict between the observed motion and predicted period of the wobble. The theory was based on a perfectly rigid body, but Earth is slightly elastic. Newcomb used the variation of latitude observations to estimate the elasticity of Earth, finding it to be slightly more <b>rigid</b> than <b>steel.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the {{offshore}} industry the word catenary {{is used as}} an adjective or noun with a meaning wider than is its historical meaning in mathematics. Thus, an SCR that uses a <b>rigid,</b> <b>steel</b> pipe that has a considerable bending stiffness {{is described as a}} catenary. That is because in the scale of depth of the ocean, the bending stiffness of a rigid pipe has little effect on the shape of the suspended span of an SCR. The shape assumed by the SCR is controlled mainly by weight, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces due to currents and waves. Thus, in spite of using conventional, <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> pipe, the shape of an SCR can be closely approximated with the use of ideal catenary equations, used historically to describe the shape of a chain suspended between points in space. A chain line has by definition a zero bending stiffness and those described with the ideal catenary equations use infinitesimally short links.|$|E

50|$|In June 1926, the {{construction}} contract {{was awarded to}} the Philadelphia firm of Roberts and Roller. The work crews dug a new hole for the foundation, but work on the new building did not actually begin until July 17, 1926. As the weeks passed, the <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> skeleton of the Americus began to rise. At first, it {{was nothing more than}} a clatter of riveting jackhammers. But on the street level, its outline began to take shape. With its buff-colored brick, curved Romanesque arches and romantic if somewhat superfluous balconies, it echoed Coolidge-era America's passion for the exotic world of old Spain.|$|E
50|$|Insulated wires may be run in one {{of several}} forms between {{electrical}} devices. This may be a specialised bendable pipe, called a conduit, or one of several varieties of metal (<b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> or aluminium) or non-metallic (PVC or HDPE) tubing. Rectangular cross-section metal or PVC wire troughs (North America) or trunking (UK) may be used if many circuits are required. Wires run underground may be run in plastic tubing encased in concrete, but metal elbows {{may be used in}} severe pulls. Wiring in exposed areas, for example factory floors, may be run in cable trays or rectangular raceways having lids.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the seismic {{performance of the}} beam-to-column connections of <b>steel</b> <b>rigid</b> frame piers. The purpose of the authors’ research is to ascertain the elasto-plastic behavior of the beam-to-column connections of a <b>steel</b> <b>rigid</b> frame pier, as this {{has yet to be}} clarified. To this end, cyclic loading experiments were conducted on test specimens with structural parameters similar to actual structures. This was done with a particular focus on the connections’ web panels, which are shear panels, in order to examine their buckling modes, strength, and ductility. A review of the experiment results revealed that, depending on what parameters were set, there were differences in both the damage process and the buckling mode. This review also clarified that the difference in the mode of buckling had a particularly large impact on the web panels’ ductility...|$|R

The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw. The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow. When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and the teatcups are removed.|$|R
50|$|Marsyas {{consists}} of three steel rings joined together by a single span of specially-designed red PVC membrane. The two rings are positioned vertically, {{at each end of}} the space, while a third is suspended parallel with the bridge. Wedged into place, the geometry generated by these three <b>rigid</b> <b>steel</b> structures determines the sculpture’s overall form, a shiftform vertical to horizontal and back to vertical again. Using digital form-finding techniques that simulate the forces found in biological forms - i.e. surface tension, uniform and hydrostatic pressure, the design was inspired by multiple parallel and diverging concepts and processes.|$|E
