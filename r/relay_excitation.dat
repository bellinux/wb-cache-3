40|$|Calcium is {{a crucial}} element for {{striated}} muscle function. As such, myoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration is delicately regulated through the concerted action of multiple Ca 2 + pathways that <b>relay</b> <b>excitation</b> of the plasma membrane to the intracellular contractile machinery. In skeletal muscle, one of these major Ca 2 + pathways is Ca 2 + release from intracellular Ca 2 + stores through type- 1 ryanodine receptor/Ca 2 + release channels (RyR 1), which positions RyR 1 in a strategic cross point to regulate Ca 2 + homeostasis. This major Ca 2 + traffic point appears to be highly sensitive to the intracellular environment, which senses through a plethora of chemical and protein-protein interactions. Among these modulators, {{perhaps one of the}} most elusive is Triadin, a muscle-specific protein that is involved in many crucial aspect of muscle function. This family of proteins mediates complex interactions with various Ca 2 + modulators and seems poised to be a relevant modulator of Ca 2 + signaling in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The purpose of this review is to examine the most recent evidence and current understanding of the role of Triadin in muscle function, in general, with particular emphasis on its contribution to Ca 2 + homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Cortical columns are the {{functional}} {{units of the}} neocortex that are particularly prominent in the "barrel" field of the somatosensory cortex. Here we describe the morphology of two classes of synaptically coupled excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex, spiny stellate, and star pyramidal cells, respectively. Within a single barrel, their somata tend to be organized in clusters. The dendritic arbors are largely confined to layer 4, except for the distal part of the apical dendrite of star pyramidal neurons that extends into layer 2 / 3. In contrast, the axon of both types of neurons spans the cortex from layer 1 to layer 6. The most prominent axonal projections are those to layers 4 and 2 / 3 where they are largely restricted to a single cortical column. In layers 5 and 6, {{a small fraction of}} axon collaterals projects also across cortical columns. Consistent with the dense axonal projection to layers 4 and 2 / 3, the total number and density of boutons per unit axonal length was also highest there. Electron microscopy combined with GABA postimmunogold labeling revealed that most (> 90 %) of the synaptic contacts were established on dendritic spines and shafts of excitatory neurons in layers 4 and 2 / 3. The largely columnar organization of dendrites and axons of both cell types, combined with the preferential and dense projections within cortical layers 4 and 2 / 3, suggests that spiny stellate and star pyramidal neurons of layer 4 serve to amplify thalamic input and <b>relay</b> <b>excitation</b> vertically within a single cortical column...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen atoms are key {{species in}} {{combustion}} of hydrogen/hydrocarbon fuels. Interference-free detection of hydrogen atoms natively generated in flames using femtosecond laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was investigated employing two colors, i. e., 243 nm and 486 nm, as excitation source: two-photon excitation {{followed by a}} <b>relay</b> one-photon <b>excitation.</b> This strategy was compared with another commonly adopted two-photon LIF strategy using 205 nm for excitation. The potential interferences were investigated, and a direct verification method was proposed to prove this strategy be interference-free, and imaging of hydrogen atoms natively generated in methane/air flames was achieved...|$|R
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for {{the understanding of}} how a cortical column functions is a description of small and defined neuronal circuits consisting {{of only a few}} identified neurones. Here we summarise, with particular reference to the barrel cortex, the morphological and physiological properties of two synaptic connections, namely those between pairs of spiny neurones in layer 4 and pairs of pyramidal cells in layer 5. While layer 4 spiny neurones are the cortical input neurones that amplify and <b>relay</b> incoming <b>excitation</b> from the periphery, layer 5 pyramidal cells integrate neuronal activity both within and across cortical columns and subsequently distribute it to both cortical and subcortical brain regions...|$|R
40|$|The two-step energy-transfer {{process in}} a self-assembled complex {{comprising}} a cationic conjugated polymer (CCP) and a dsDNA is investigated by using pump-dump-emission spectroscopy and time-correlated single-photon counting; energy is transferred from the CCP to an ethidium bromide (EB) molecule intercalated into the dsDNA through a fluorescein molecule linked to one terminus of the DNA. Time-dependent anisotropy measurements indicate that the inefficient direct energy transfer from the CCP to the intercalated EB results from the near orthogonality of their transition moments. These measurements also show that the transition moment of the fluorescein spans a range of angular distributions and lies between that of the CCP and EB. Consequently, the fluorescein acts as a fluorescence resonance energy-transfer gate to <b>relay</b> the <b>excitation</b> energy from the CCP to the EB...|$|R
40|$|Theendocannabinoid {{system is}} {{involved}} inmultiplephysiological functions including reward. Cannabinoidspotently control theactivity of midbrain dopamine cells, but {{the contribution of}} cortical projections in this phenomenon is unclear. We show that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) efficient <b>relays</b> cortical <b>excitation</b> to dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Anatomical and in vivo electrophysiological evidence demonstrate that excitatory projections arising exclusively from the infralimbic cortex converge on BNST neurons, which in turn project to and excite 80 %VTA dopamine cells. At the ultrastructural level, cannabinoid type 1 receptors are detectedwithin the BNST on axon terminals arising from the infralimbic cortex. We found that intra-BNST infusion of a cannabinoid agonist inhibits the firing of dopamine cells evoked by stimulation of the infralimbic cortex. Our data identify a new neuronal substrate {{for the actions of}} cannabinoids in the reward pathway. Key words: cannabinoid; prefrontal cortex; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; ventral tegmental area; dopamine cells; rewar...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} {{studies of the}} branchial tuft retractor system of Tritonia hombergi and T. diomedia show a number of similarities and differences. In both species two homologous neurones in each pedal ganglion produce complete and partial contractions of the ipsilateral pinnae respectively. Three pleural neurones cause bilateral contractions in T. hombergi: L PI 6 and R PI 5 inducing complete, and R PI 6 partial, withdrawal of the tips. This differs from T. diomedia, where principal control is vested in the pleural giant cells. The latency of tuft withdrawal declines {{and the rate of}} contraction increases with increasing impulse frequency in the retractor neurones, the musculature apparently responding to the second impulse of a series. After due allowance for conduction delays, only a small interval remains unaccounted for. Until electrical activity can be recorded from the muscu-lature, the suggestion of the <b>relay</b> of central <b>excitation</b> through the peripheral plexus must be regarded as uncertain...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} {{we take a}} {{physiological}} perspective {{on the role of}} voltage-gated potassium channels in an identified neuron in the auditory brainstem. The large number of KCN genes for potassium channel subunits and the heterogeneity of the subunit combination into K(+) channels make identification of native conductances especially difficult. We provide a general pharmacological and biophysical profile to help identify the common voltage-gated K(+) channel families in a neuron. Then we consider the physiological role of each of these conductances {{from the perspective of the}} principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). The MNTB is an inverting <b>relay,</b> converting <b>excitation</b> generated by sound from one cochlea into inhibition of brainstem nuclei on the opposite side of the brain; this information is crucial for binaural comparisons and sound localization. The important features of MNTB action potential (AP) firing are inferred from its inhibitory projections to four key target nuclei involved in sound localization (which is the foundation of auditory scene analysis in higher brain centres). These are: the medial superior olive (MSO), the lateral superior olive (LSO), the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN) and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (NLL). The Kv families represented in the MNTB each have a distinct role: Kv 1 raises AP firing threshold; Kv 2 influences AP repolarization and hyperpolarizes the inter-AP membrane potential during high frequency firing; and Kv 3 accelerates AP repolarization. These actions are considered in terms of fidelity of transmission, AP duration, firing rates and temporal jitter. An emerging theme is activity-dependent phosphorylation of Kv channel activity and suggests that intracellular signalling has a dynamic role in refining neuronal excitability and homeostasis. 7567...|$|R
40|$|Waves of {{chemotactic}} movement {{during the}} early phase of aggregation in Dictyostelium discoideum are of 2 kinds, concentric waves produced by cells that emit cyclic AMP signals spontaneously, and spirals generated by <b>excitations</b> <b>relayed</b> continuously around loops of excitable cells. The period of a spiral wave is the time taken for the excitation to make one complete circuit of the pacemaker loop. We have compared signal emission from the 2 types of source in time-lapse films made {{at a variety of}} temperatures. Our results show that spiral waves have a characteristic period length throughout most if not all of the early phase of aggregation, and that the period of concentric waves is generally longer and more variable. Temperature has a pronounced effect on period length and a lesser effect on propagation velocity. We find that each individual wave is propagated at constant velocity over distances of 1 - 2 cm but that the velocity of successive waves declines. This decline probably reflects some cumulative effect of the chemotactic excitations on the excitable properties of the aggregating cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of ionic monomer and multimers of the ethylenic molecule TDMAE (tetrakis(dimethylamino) ethylene) {{have been studied}} under femtosecond stepwise excitation using an energy surface of the neutral molecule (or cluster) as a <b>relay.</b> This specific <b>excitation</b> {{takes advantage of the}} wave packet evolution in the neutral intermediate state to (i) allow access to different regions of the ionic potential surface and (ii) identify some aspects of the dynamics in the ionic state of either TDMAE+ or TDMAEn+. This original experimental approach we shall name double pump excitation. We have identified the existence of a double well in TDMAEn+ corresponding to a different localization of the positive charge, the most stable corresponding to a complete delocalization over the nitrogen atoms. A reaction in the dimer and higher multimer ions is observed that involves the formation of compounds of general mass 200 m 116 n+. This reaction is only observed in clusters and not in thermal ion molecule collisions between TDMAE+ and TDMAE. A tentative mechanism of formation for this product is proposed that involves the creation of a distonic ion via H-atom migrations. The double pump method could be extended to many other systems to explore competing pathways in ionic reactions, differently accessed via transient states of a neutral intermediate...|$|R
