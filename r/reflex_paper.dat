40|$|Dissociative {{identity}} disorder (DID; APA, 1994), previously labeled Multiple personality (APA, 1980) and Multiple Personality Disorder (APA, 1987), {{has good}} diagnostic validity (Gleaves, May, & Cardeña, 2001) and {{is supported by}} taxometric research, whereby two types of dissociation have been identified: Pathological dissociation, whose features are consistent with DID, and nonpathological dissociation (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, 1996). On these grounds, we aimed {{to contribute to a}} further validation of the construct of DID by (1) testing to which extent DID may be separated from other dissociative disorders on a series of clinical and psychophysiological measures, and (2) exploring the characteristics of DID within the framework of Personal construct theory. 14 persons with DID were compared with persons with other dissociative disorders, and non‐clinical comparison participants with regard to severity of PTSD related features, dissociative functioning, hypnotizability (Paper I), and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle eye‐blink <b>reflex</b> (<b>Paper</b> II). Persons with DID had reduced habituation of startle reflexes and increased PPI, compared to non‐DID participants. These data suggest the operation of an aberrant voluntary attentional processes in the face of unpleasant and threatening stimuli, and this may be a defining characteristic in DID. This finding supports the notion that DID is a separate clinical and nosological entity (Gleaves et al., 2001; Waller et al., 1996). Results also showed that persons with DID differed significantly from persons with other dissociative disorders with regard to the complexity and magnitude of dissociative symptomatology, and with regard to hypnotizability. These results are also indicative of DID being a separate clinical entity, qualitatively different from other dissociative disorders (Gleaves et al., 2001; Waller et al., 1996). As expected, histories of childhood sexual and physical assault were reported among persons with DID and persons with other dissociative disorders and both these groups attained high PTSD scores. Although the clinical groups did not differ significantly with regard to scores of current and lifetime PTSD, some differences were observable with regard to the type and occurrence of abuse, with, e. g., a higher percentage of the DID group having experienced sexual assault by a close relative during childhood compared to the group with other dissociative disorders. This is consistent with findings that DID is linked {{to the nature of the}} assault and to the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator (Boon & Drajer, 1993). In a design involving test technology developed within the framework of Personal construct theory (Kelly, 1955), 13 persons with DID were compared to persons with other clinical conditions and non‐diagnosed comparison participants with regard to cognitive complexity (Paper III). Contrary to expectations, results showed that displaying alternate personalities does not imply a more multidimensional level of thinking. However, persons with DID seemed to have a more advanced social skill in role thinking and role conceptualization, in comparison with non‐dissociative persons. The results have important implications for the identification, treatment, and understanding of DID...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{control of}} body posture is {{enforced}} by {{a multitude of}} corrective actions operating over a range of time scales. The earliest correction is the short-latency reflex which occurs between 20 - 45 ms following a sudden displacement of the limb and is generated entirely by spinal circuits. In contrast, voluntary reactions are generated by a highly distributed network but at a significantly longer delay after stimulus onset (greater than 100 ms). Between these two epochs is the long-latency reflex (around 50 - 100 ms) which but acts more rapidly than of voluntary reactions but shares some supraspinal pathways and functional capabilities. In particular, the long-latency reflex accounts for the arm’s biomechanical properties rather than only responding to local muscle stretch like the short-latency <b>reflex.</b> This <b>paper</b> will review how the long-latency reflex accounts for the arm’s biomechanical properties and the supraspinal pathways supporting this ability. Relevant experimental paradigms include clinical studies, non-invasive brain stimulation, neural recordings in monkeys, and human behavioral studies. The sum of this effort indicates that primary motor cortex and reticular formation contribute to the the long-latency reflex either by generating or scaling its structured response appropriate for the arm’s biomechanics whereas the cerebellum scales {{the magnitude of the}} feedback response. Additional putative pathways are discussed as well as potential research lines...|$|R

40|$|In most neurotoxicological studies {{morphological}} assessment {{focuses on}} pathological effects, like degenerative changes in neuronal perikarya, axonopathy, demyelination, and glial and endothelial cell reactions. Similarly, {{the assessment of}} physiological and behavioral effects center on evident neurological symptoms, like EEG and EMG abnormalities, resting and intention tremor, abnormal gait, and abnormal <b>reflexes.</b> This <b>paper</b> reviews briefly another central nervous system target of harmful environmental agents, which results in behavioral abnormalities without any qualitatively evident neuropathology. This is called microneuronal hypoplasia, a retardation of brain development characterized by a quantitative reduction in the normal population of late-generated, short-axoned neurons in specific brain regions. Correlated descriptive and experimental neurogenetic studies in the rat have established that all the cerebellar granule cells and a very high proportion of hippocampal granule cells are produced postnatally, and that focal, low-dose X-irradiation either of the cerebellum or of the hippocampus after birth selectively interferes with the acquisition of the full complement of granule cells (microneuronal hypoplasia). Subsequent behavioral investigations showed that cerebellar microneuronal hypoplasia results in profound hyperactivity without motor abnormalities, while hippocampal microneuronal hypoplasia results in hyperactivity, as well as attentional and learning deficits. There is much indirect clinical evidence that various harmful environmental agents affecting the pregnant mother and/or the infant lead to such childhood disorders as hyperactivity and attentional and learning disorders. As the developing human brain is more mature at birth than the rat brain, the risk for microneuronal hypoplasia and consequent behavioral disorders may be highest at late stages of fetal development, in prematurely born and small-for-weight infants, and {{during the early stages}} of infant development. Recent technological advances in brain imaging techniques make it possible to test this hypothesis and to assess the possible relationship between the degree of retarded brain development and ensuing behavioral disorders...|$|R

The current work at JPL in this area has focused on enhancing the technologies and transferring the control architecture to hardware and software environments which are more compatible with projected ground and space operational environments. At the local site, the operator updates the remote worksite model using stereo video and a model overlay/fitting algorithm which outputs the location and orientation of the object in free space. That information is relayed to the robot User Macro Interface (UMI) to enable programming of the robot control macros. This capability runs on a single Silicon Graphics Inc. machine. The operator can employ either manual teleoperation, shared control, or supervised autonomous control to manipulate the intended object.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} carbamylated erythropoietin, a modified erythropoietin lacking erythropoietic activity, on brain edema and functional recovery in a model of diffuse traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: Adult male Wistar rats. SETTING: Neurosciences and physiology laboratories. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty minutes after diffuse traumatic brain injury (impact-acceleration model), rats were intravenously administered with either a saline solution (traumatic brain injury-saline) or carbamylated erythropoietin (50 μg/kg; traumatic brain injury-carbamylated erythropoietin). A third group received no traumatic brain injury insult (sham-operated). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three series of experiments were conducted to investigate: 1) the effect of carbamylated erythropoietin on brain edema before and 1 hr after traumatic brain injury using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (n = 10 rats per group), and the phosphorylation level of brain extracellular-regulated kinase- 1 /- 2 was also determined to indicate {{the presence of an}} activated cell signaling pathway; 2) the time course of brain edema using magnetic resonance imaging between 4 and 6 hrs postinjury and the gravimetric technique at 6 hrs (n = 10 rats per group); and 3) motor and cognitive function over 10 days post traumatic brain injury, testing acute somatomotor <b>reflexes,</b> adhesive <b>paper</b> removal, and two-way active avoidance (n = 8 rats per group). Compared to traumatic brain injury-saline rats, rats receiving traumatic brain injury-carbamylated erythropoietin showed a significant reduction in brain edema formation at 1 hr that was sustained until 6 hrs when results were comparable with sham-operated rats. This antiedematous effect of carbamylated erythropoietin was possibly mediated through an early inhibition of extracellular-regulated kinase- 1 /- 2 phosphorylation. Compared to traumatic brain injury-saline rats, traumatic brain injury-carbamylated erythropoietin rats showed improved functional recovery of the acute somatomotor reflexes post traumatic brain injury, took less time to remove adhesive from the forelimbs, and showed higher percentages of correct avoidance responses. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that early posttraumatic administration of carbamylated erythropoietin reduces brain edema development until at least 6 hrs postinjury and improves neurologic recovery. Carbamylated erythropoietin can thus be considered as a potential agent in the treatment of traumatic brain injury-induced diffuse edema...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{eyes are}} big both in {{relative}} and absolute terms, thus {{the importance of}} vision to birds is obvious. Even though the general eye plan is rather conservative throughout the group, {{there is a great}} variation in visual capabilities. In this thesis I present four studies on different aspects of spatial vision in parrots, procellariiform seabirds and birds of prey. In Paper I we studied retinal ganglion cell topography and anatomical spatial resolution in two Australian parrots, budgerigar and Bourke’s parrot, inhabiting open terrain. Differently than expected, we did not find a horizontal visual streak, an elongated area of increased ganglion cell density, which would be predicted by the “terrain theory”. In addition, we found that anatomical spatial resolution based on ganglion cell density is lower than behaviourally determined visual acuity. In Paper II, we compared spatial resolution and optical sensitivity in two procellariiform seabirds with contrasting nesting and foraging strategies. As predicted, the Leach’s storm-petrel had lower visual acuity than the Northern fulmar, however similar optical sensitivity at the level of single rod photoreceptor. Additionally, both species had a well-pronounced horizontal visual streak that supports the “terrain theory”. In Paper III, we studied the development of the visual and olfactory system in the Leach’s storm-petrel juveniles. Our results indicated, that fine-tuning of retinal ganglion cell topography does not happen early in development, and that the ganglion cell layer continues to mature throughout the nest period. In addition, we found that two-weeks old juveniles lack basic phototactic and optokinetic <b>reflexes.</b> In <b>Paper</b> IV we used transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to investigate the presence of double cones in the foveae of the red kite, common buzzard, Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon. The double cone-free zones in the central fovea differed in size between species. We also found double cone-free zone in the temporal fovea of the common buzzard and peregrine falcon, but not in the Eurasian sparrowhawk. In three species of raptors, in which we studied opsin expression, we found violet and green sensitive cones in the central fovea, and thus assume that raptors have all four types of single cones in the central fovea. These findings indicate, that single cones, not double cones, mediate the high spatial resolution in the raptor fovea...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) {{microphones}} focusing on their applications in automatic speech recognition. A NAM microphone {{is a special}} acoustic sensor attached behind the talker’s ear and able to capture very quietly uttered speech (non-audible murmur) through body tissue. Previously, we reported experimental results for non-audible murmur recognition using a Stethoscope microphone in a clean environment. In this paper, we also present a more advanced NAM microphone, the so-called Silicon NAM microphone. Using {{a small amount of}} training data and adaptation approaches, we achieved a 93. 9 % word accuracy for a 20 k vocabulary dictation task. Therefore, in situations when privacy in humanmachine communication is preferable, NAM microphone can be very effectively applied for automatic recognition of speech inaudible to other listeners near the talker. Because of the nature of non-audible murmur (e. g., privacy) investigation of the behavior of NAM microphones in noisy environments is of high importance. To do this, we also conducted experiments in real and simulated noisy environments. Although, using simulated noisy data the NAM microphones show high robustness against noise, in real environments the recognition performance decreases markedly due to the effect of the Lombard <b>reflex.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we also report experimental results showing the negative impact effect of the Lombard reflex on non-audible murmur recognition. In addition to a dictation task, we also report a keyword-spotting system based on non-audible murmur with very promising results. 1...|$|R
40|$|In Aplysia, the {{neurotransmitter}} dopamine {{is involved}} in the regulation of various physiological processes and motor functions, like feeding behaviour, and in the siphon-gill with-drawal <b>reflex.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we report the characterization of the first Aplysia D 1 -like dopamine receptor (Apdop 1) mainly expressed in the CNS, heart and buccal mass. Following expression of the Apdop 1 receptor in HEK 293 cells, a higher level of cAMP was observed {{in the absence of the}} receptor ligand, showing that Apdop 1 is constitutively active. This activity was blocked by the inverse agonist flupentixol. Appli-cation of dopamine (EC 50 of 35 nM) or serotonin (EC 50 of 36 lM) to Apdop 1 -transfected HEK 293 cells further increased the level of cAMP, suggesting that the receptor is linked to the stimulatory Gs protein pathway. When expressed in cultured sensory neurons, Apdop 1 immunoreactivity was observed in the cell body and neurites. Control sensory neurons respon-ded to dopamine with a decrease in excitability mediated by a pertusis toxin-sensitive G protein. Expression of Apdop 1 pro-duced an increase in hyperpolarization in the absence of agonist and an increase in membrane excitability following stimulation by dopamine. In the presence of pertussis toxin to inhibit the Gi protein inhibitory pathway responsible for decrease in excitability mechanism, Stimulation of membrane excitability was observed.

40|$|A key {{component}} of much current research in behavioral ecology, cognitive science, and economics {{is a model of}} the mind at least partly based on beliefs and desires. However, despite this prevalence, there are still many open questions concerning both the structure and the applicability of this model. This is especially so when it comes to its ‘desire’ part: in particular, it is not yet entirely clear when and why we should expect organisms to be desire-based—understood so as to imply that they consult explicit tokenings of what they ought to do—as opposed to being drive-based—understood so as to imply that they react to the world using behavioral <b>reflexes.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> I present the beginnings of an answer to this question. To do this, I start by showing that an influential recent attempt to address these issues—due to Kim Sterelny—fails to be fully successful, as it does not make sufficiently clear what the relative benefits and disadvantages of drive-based and desire-based cognitive architectures are. I then present an alternative account of this matter {{based on the idea that}} organisms that can follow explicit behavioral rules (i. e. which have desires) avoid having to memorize a large set of state of the world–action connections—which can (though need not) be adaptive. Finally, I apply this account to the question of what the cognitive value of mental representations should be seen to be; here, I conclude that—contrary to some recent claims—relying on mental representations can make decision making easier, not harder, but also that—in line with these recent claims—whether it does so depends on the details of the case...|$|R
