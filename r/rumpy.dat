5000|$|In {{the breed}} of Cymrics, four {{different}} tail types are produced. The [...] "rumpy" [...] {{is the most}} valued for cat show purposes, {{and is the only}} show cat type in some organizations. This is a cat born entirely tailless. Instead, <b>rumpies</b> often have a dimple {{at the base of the}} spine where the tail would be. Next, there are [...] "rumpy-risers". These cats have a short knob of tail that is made up of one to three vertebrae connected to the spine. [...] "Stumpies" [...] have a short tail stump, up to about 1/3 of a normal tail length. Finally, [...] "longies" [...] or [...] "fully tailed" [...] have tails as long or almost as long as an ordinary cat’s. It is impossible to predict what tail types will appear in any given litter.|$|R

50|$|The Rumpless Game is a British {{breed of}} tail-less chicken. It may have {{originated}} on the Isle of Man and may thus {{be known as}} the Manx <b>Rumpy.</b> There are both standard-sized and bantam Rumpless Game.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} days of breed {{recognition}} in the late 19th century, Manx show cats have been <b>rumpy</b> through stumpy specimens, with stubby and longy Manx not qualifying to be shown except in the [...] "Any Other Variety" [...] or household pet class. Kittens with complete tails may be born in a purebred Manx litter, having not inherited the taillessness appearance at all. Depending on the country and cat organization referenced, <b>rumpy,</b> <b>rumpy</b> risers and stumpies are the only Manx cat tail types that fit the breed standard for Manx cats. The longer cat tail lengths seen in some Manx cats are considered a breed fault, although they occur as naturally in the breed, but not as often, as the shorter tails. Although these longer tail types are of purebred Manx ancestry, they do not possess the dominant gene so cannot pass it on. However, since the Manx tail mutation gene is dominant, these longer-tailed purebred Manx cats may still be used in breeding programs and may even be considered in an effort to help avoid the fatal spinal deformities that sometimes result in tailless Manx cats.|$|E

5000|$|Radio Corazón is a 2007 Chilean Spanish-language film {{directed}} by and starring Roberto Artiagoitía (nicknamed El <b>Rumpy).</b> It portrays three stories based on phone calls made to El Rumpy's radio program in Chile, El chacotero sentimental. It {{was the highest}} grossing film for the week in Chile upon its release in October 4, 2007. [...] The film is a sequel to the 1999 film El Chacotero Sentimental: La película.|$|E

5000|$|The story {{takes place}} in Africa where an enormous, greedy {{crocodile}} is telling a smaller crocodile {{that he is going}} to eat children for his lunch. The smaller crocodile objects, because children taste [...] "nasty and bitter" [...] in his opinion compared to fish, and because of what happened the last time the larger crocodile tried to eat children. The larger crocodile leaves the big, brown muddy river anyway, and announces his intention to Humpy <b>Rumpy</b> the Hippopotamus, Trunky the elephant, Muggle-Wump the monkey and the Roly-Poly Bird. The other animals insult him and hope that he will fail and will himself be killed and eaten, after which the crocodile briefly and unsuccessfully attacks Muggle-Wump and the Roly-Poly Bird.|$|E
50|$|Most Pixie-bobs {{have black}} fur and {{skin on the}} bottom of their paws, tipped ears, heavy ear hair, black lips, and white fur around the eyes but with black eye skin. Their chins have white fur, but often have black skin under the white fur. Some of their {{whiskers}} change from black (root - about 25%) to white (to the tip - about 75% of the whisker). Bobcat-like fur pattern, but often have reddish tones mixed in. Most are short-haired, but some are long-haired. The brow should be heavy and the eyes should have a triangular shape. Eyes are blue when kittens, then change to green or gold when several months old. Tails can be non-existent (<b>rumpy),</b> or 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) (desired - TICA required), or long tails (StoneIsland Pixie was a long-tail). The head is pear shaped. The head is considered {{to be the most important}} characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Populations of {{tailless}} cats {{also exist}} in a few other places in Europe, most notably Cornwall, only 250 mi from the Isle of Man. A population on the small, isolated Danish peninsula (former island) of Reersø in the Great Belt {{may be due to}} the arrival on the island of cats of Manx origin, by ship. Similar cats are also found in Crimea, a near-island peninsula in the Black Sea, though whether they are genetically related to maritime Manx cats or are a coincidentally similar result of insular genetic diversity limitations, like the unrelated Kuril Islands Bobtail, Karelian Bobtail, Japanese Bobtail, and Indonesian Lombok cats, is unknown. The Manx gene may be related to the similarly dominant tail suppression gene of the recent American Bobtail breed, but Manx, Japanese Bobtails and other short-tailed cats are not used in its breeding program, and the mutation seems to have appeared in the breed spontaneously. Possible relation to the Pixie-bob breed, which also ranges from <b>rumpy</b> to fully tailed, is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the initial}} {{fundraising}} goal was reached in December 2015, the first cat sequenced was a purebred Manx calico <b>rumpy</b> named Bonnag, selected because the registry of this dam (breeding female) and her kittens in the British Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) aids controlled {{study of a}} specific bloodline. Bonnag's samples were sent for sequencing in April 2016, with raw gene sequence results received by MCGP in August 2016; the laborious process of genome assembly has begun, {{to be followed by}} comparison with previously collected cat genomic data from 99 Lives, and eventual peer-reviewed publication of the results in a scientific journal. [...] Fundraising for the second genome to be sequenced by the project began September 2016; costs dropped to UK£1,400 per cat in November 2015, and as of April 2016 dropped to about £1,200, using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencer, down from original projections of £10,000 before the X Ten was available for non-human sequencing. The dramatic drop in costs allowed the first cat's sequencing to be done well ahead of the original schedule. [...] MCGP has already identified the location of the mutation responsible for suppression of Bonnag's tail, the deletion of a single bit of genetic data among 2.8 billion making up the genome.|$|E
5000|$|Manx cats {{have been}} {{exhibited}} in cat shows, as a named, distinct breed (and {{with the modern}} spelling [...] "Manx"), since the late 1800s. In that era, few shows provided a Manx division, and exhibited specimens were usually entered under the [...] "Any Other Variety" [...] class, where they often could not compete well unless [...] "exceptionally good in size and markings". Early pet breeding and showing expert Charles Henry Lane, himself {{the owner of a}} prize-winning rare white <b>rumpy</b> Manx named [...] "Lord Luke", published the first known (albeit informal) breed standard for the Manx in his 1903 Rabbits, Cats and Cavies, but noted that already by the time of his writing [...] "if the judge understood the variety" [...] a Manx would be clearly distinguishable from some other tailless cat being exhibited, [...] "as the make of the animal, its movements and its general character are all distinctive." [...] Not all cat experts of the day were favourable toward the breed; in The Cat: Its Points and Management in Health and Disease, Frank Townend Barton wrote in 1908: [...] "There is nothing [...] to recommend the breed, [...] the loss of the tail in no way enhances its beauty." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Manx syndrome" [...] or [...] "Manxness" [...] is a colloquial name {{given to}} the {{condition}} which results when the tailless gene shortens the spine too much. It can seriously damage the spinal cord and the nerves, causing a form of spina bifida, as well as problems with the bowels, bladder, and digestion. Very small bladders are indicative of the disease, and {{it is often difficult}} to diagnose. Death can occur quite suddenly, and some live for only 3-4 years; the oldest recorded was 5 years when affected with the disease. In one report, it was shown to affect about 30% of Manx cats studied, but nearly all of those cases were rumpies, which exhibit the most extreme phenotype. Such problems can be avoided by breeding <b>rumpy</b> Manx cats with stumpy specimens, and this breeding practice is responsible for a decline in spinal problems among modern, professionally bred Manx cats today. Most pedigreed cats are not placed until four months of age (to make sure that they are properly socialised) and this usually also gives adequate time for any such health problems to be identified. Feline expert Roger Tabor has stated: [...] "Only the fact that the Manx is a historic breed stops us being as critical of this dangerous gene as of other more recent selected abnormalities." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{leaving the}} group, Nolan {{went on to}} play the role of Maggie May at Blackpool's Central Pier for eight summer seasons (1986-93), {{clocking}} up more than 1,000 performances. She then starred for two seasons in a similar show on Blackpool's South Pier called Rosie O' Grady's (1994-95). From 1996 to 1997, she starred as the prison governor in two UK tours of Prisoner: Cell Block H - The Musical, alongside Paul O'Grady. From 2000, she starred as Mrs. Johnstone in Blood Brothers for three years in the West End, and regularly played the role in the UK touring production until 2008. She was the third Nolan sister {{to play the role}}, after Bernie and Denise. Maureen Nolan has also since played the role in the West End on the UK tour for several years, earning the sisters a place in the Guinness World Records, as the most siblings to play the same role in a musical. In 2015 Linda embarked on a tour of her native home Ireland with Menopause The Musical, Touring along side with Mary Byrne Sue Collins and eurovisions Niamh Kavanagh. In December it was reveled that the show would tour Ireland again in January of 2016 due to high demand. The Line up of the tour would change with Niamh Kavanagh not returning to be replaced by Ruth Berkeley from Penny Dreadful. Linda then joined Menopause The Musical for a UK tour for another 10 week tour up and down the UK where the line up changed again keeping Linda as the [...] "Soap Star" [...] and Ruth as the [...] "Power Woman", Eastenders star Cheryl Ferguson played the [...] "Earth Mother" [...] and Casualty's Rebecca Wheatley played the [...] "House Wife".

40|$|Multiple {{time series}} models with {{stochastic}} regressors are considered and primary attention {{is given to}} vector autoregressions (VAR's) with trending mechanisms that may be stochastic, deterministic or both. In a Bayesian framework, the data density in such a system implies {{the existence of a}} time series "Bayes model" and "Bayes measure" of the data. These are predictive models and measures for the next period observation given the historical trajectory to the present. Issues of model selection, hypothesis testing and forecast evaluation are all studied within the context of these models and the measures are used to develop selection criteria, test statistics and encompassing tests within the compass of the same statistical methodology. Of particular interest in applications are lag order and trend degree, causal effects, the presence and number of unit roots in the system, and for integrated series the presence of cointegration and the rank of the cointegration space, which can be interpreted as an order selection problem. In data where there is evidence of mildly explosive behavior we also wish to allow for the presence of co-motion among variables even though they are individually not modelled as integrated series. The paper develops a statistical framework for addressing these features of trending multiple time series and reports an extended empirical application of the methodology to a model of the US economy that sets out to explain the behavior of and to forecast interest rates, unemployment, money stock, prices and income. The performance of a data-based, evolving "Bayes model" of these series is evaluated against some rival fixed format VAR's, VAR's with Minnesota priors (BVARM's) and univariate models. The empirical results show that fixed format VAR's and BVARM's all perform poorly in forecasting exercises in comparison with evolving "Bayes models" that explicitly adapt in form as new data becomes available.
