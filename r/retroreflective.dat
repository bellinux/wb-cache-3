25|$|Photo-luminescent {{signs are}} {{sometimes}} wrongfully {{described as being}} reflective. A reflective material will only return ambient light {{for as long as}} the light source is supplied, rather than storing energy and releasing it over a period of time. But, many fire extinguishers and extinguisher-mounting posts have strips of <b>retroreflective</b> adhesive tape placed on them to facilitate their location in situations where only emergency lighting or flashlights are available.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{change was}} gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, {{but with the}} {{development}} of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke, painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally <b>retroreflective</b> for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of <b>retroreflective</b> overhead road signs.|$|E

500|$|The {{technique}} {{consisted of}} a separate scenery projector set at a right-angle to the camera, and a half-silvered mirror placed at an angle in front that reflected the projected image forward {{in line with the}} camera lens onto a backdrop made of <b>retroreflective</b> material. The reflective directional screen behind the actors could reflect light from the projected image a hundred times more efficiently than the foreground subject did. The lighting of the foreground subject had to be balanced with the image from the screen, making the image from the scenery projector on the subject too faint to record. The exception was the eyes of the leopard in the [...] "Dawn of Man" [...] sequence, which glowed orange from the projector illumination. Kubrick described this as [...] "a happy accident".|$|E

2500|$|Most marked police {{vehicles}} are white or silver, although more recently silver {{becoming more common}} due to higher resale values after police use is finished, with <b>retroreflective</b> livery markings on the side. These markings usually {{take the form of}} a blue, yellow or red strip down the side of the vehicle, or use high visibility battenburg markings (with blue and yellow the accepted Home Office colours for police use). Some carry adverts for police initiatives, slogans such as the Metropolitan Police's [...] "Working for a safer London" [...] (withdrawn in 2012 following rebranding), or the force crest.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pivoting}} arm {{equipped with}} a stop sign {{is a piece of}} equipment required by law on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat {{on the left side of}} the bus, and is deployed by the driver while picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The stop sign is <b>retroreflective</b> and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the [...] legend, or with a [...] legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign requires other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted.|$|E
2500|$|Most police {{vehicles}} in Hong Kong are white, {{with a blue}} and red 3M <b>retroreflective</b> stripe around {{on the sides of}} the vehicle with wording [...] "警 Police 察" [...] in white, the only exception being the armoured personnel carriers specially designed for the Police Tactical Unit, which are wholly dark blue and with wording [...] "警 Police 察" [...] on a light blue background in white {{on the sides of the}} vehicle. Most police {{vehicles in}} Hong Kong are equipped with both red and blue emergency vehicle lighting. The vehicles which are assigned to airport duties have additional yellow emergency vehicle lighting. All police vehicles are government property and so bear licence plates starting with [...] "AM".|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{stop signs}} have a size of 750mm across {{opposite}} flats {{of the red}} octagon, with a 20mm white border. The white uppercase letters in small caps forming the [...] legend are 250mm tall. Larger signs of [...] with [...] legend and 25mm (⅞in) border are used on multi-lane expressways. Regulatory provisions exist for extra-large [...] signs with [...] legend and [...] border for use where sign visibility or reaction distance are limited, and the smallest permissible stop sign size for general usage is [...] with a [...] legend and 15mm (⅝in) border. The metric units specified in the US regulatory manuals are rounded approximations of US customary units, not exact conversions. The field, legend, and border are all <b>retroreflective.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Flotation {{devices are}} also found in near water-edges and at {{swimming}} pools. They may {{take the form of}} a simple vest, a jacket, a full-body suit (one piece coverall), or their variations suited for particular purposes. They are most commonly made of a tough synthetic fiber material encapsulating a source of buoyancy, such as foam or a chamber of air, and are often brightly colored yellow or orange to maximize visibility for rescuers. [...] Some devices consist of a combination of both buoyancy foam and an air chamber. [...] <b>Retroreflective</b> [...] "SOLAS" [...] tape is often sewn to the fabric used to construct life jackets and PFDs to facilitate a person being spotted in darkness when a search light is shone towards the wearer.|$|E
2500|$|Passive visual {{warnings}} are {{the markings}} on the vehicle. Police vehicle markings usually {{make use of}} bright colors or strong contrast with the base color of the vehicle. Modern police vehicles in some countries have <b>retroreflective</b> markings which reflect light for better visibility at night. Other police vehicles may only have painted on or non-reflective markings. Most marked police vehicles in the United Kingdom and Sweden have reflective Battenburg markings on the sides, which are large blue and yellow rectangles. These markings are designed to have high contrast and be highly visible on the road, to deter crime and improve safety. [...] Another passive visual warning of police vehicles is simply the interceptor's silhouette. [...] This is easily observed in the United States, where the ubiquitous nature of the Ford Crown Victoria in police fleets has made the model synonymous with police vehicles.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Retroreflective</b> {{sheeting}} {{is flexible}} <b>retroreflective</b> material primarily used {{to increase the}} nighttime [...] of traffic signs, high-visibility clothing, and other items so they are safely and effectively visible {{in the light of}} an approaching driver's headlamps. They are also used as a material to increase the scanning range of barcodes in factory settings. The sheeting consists of <b>retroreflective</b> glass beads, microprisms, or encapsulated lenses sealed onto a fabric or plastic substrate. Many different colors and degrees of reflection intensity are provided by numerous manufacturers for various applications. As with any retroreflector, sheeting glows brightly when there is a small angle between the observer's eye and the light source directed toward the sheeting, but appears nonreflective when viewed from other directions.|$|E
