50|$|The first commercially {{available}} <b>renderer</b> {{to implement a}} micropolygon displacement mapping approach through REYES was Pixar's PhotoRealistic RenderMan. Micropolygon renderers commonly tessellate geometry themselves at a granularity suitable for the image being <b>rendered.</b> That is: the modeling application delivers high-level primitives to the <b>renderer.</b> Examples include true NURBS- or subdivision surfaces. The <b>renderer</b> then tessellates this geometry into micropolygons at <b>render</b> time using view-based constraints derived from the image being <b>rendered.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The factory made <b>render</b> has an {{advantage}} over the site mixed <b>render</b> in that {{the composition of the}} <b>render</b> and all the raw materials are closely controlled and accurately measured. [...] Supplying a <b>render</b> in this way allows the manufacturer to include performance enhancing additives into the formulation. Whilst many site mixed <b>renders</b> are subsequently painted, factory made <b>renders</b> can be supplied as a wide variety of self-coloured products, eliminating the additional expense of painting.|$|R

5|$|<b>Rendering</b> was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; <b>rendering</b> was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
