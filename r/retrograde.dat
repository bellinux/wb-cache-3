40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>retrograded</b> rice on body weight gain, gut functions, and hypolipidemic actions in rats were examined. When the <b>retrograded</b> rice was {{produced}} by repetitive heating and cooling cycles, it contained significantly higher amounts of resistant starch (13. 9 ± 0. 98 %) than is found in common rice (9. 1 ± 1. 02 %) (P < 0. 05). Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either common rice powder or <b>retrograded</b> rice powder, and mean body weight gain was significantly lower in the <b>retrograded</b> rice group (P < 0. 05). The liver weight of the <b>retrograded</b> rice group (14. 5 ± 0. 5 g) was significantly {{lower than that of}} the common rice group (17. 1 ± 0. 3 g, P < 0. 05). However, the weights of other organs, such as the kidney, spleen, thymus, and epididymal fat pad were not significantly affected by rice feeding. Intestinal transit time tended to be lower in rats fed <b>retrograded</b> rice when compared to rats fed the common rice, but the difference was not significant. The <b>retrograded</b> rice diet significantly increased stool output when compared to that in the common rice powder diet (P < 0. 05), whereas fecal moisture content (%) was significantly higher in the <b>retrograded</b> rice group (23. 3 ± 1. 2) than that in the common rice group (19. 1 ± 1. 2) (P < 0. 05). The <b>retrograded</b> rice group had significantly lower plasma cholesterol (P < 0. 05), liver cholesterol (P < 0. 05), and triacylglycerol contents in adipose tissue (P < 0. 05) when compared to those in the common rice group. In conclusion, <b>retrograded</b> rice had higher resistant starch levels compared with those of common rice powder, and it lowered body weight gain and improved lipid profiles and gut function in rats...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retrograded</b> starch {{is known}} to be {{resistant}} to digestion. We used enzyme kinetic experiments to examine how retrogradation of starch affects amylolysis catalysed by porcine pancreatic amylase. Parallel studies employing differential scanning calorimetry, infra red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy were performed to monitor changes in supramolecular structure of gelatinised starch as it becomes <b>retrograded.</b> The total digestible starch and the catalytic efficiency of amylase were both decreased with increasing evidence of retrogradation. A purified sample of <b>retrograded</b> high amylose starch inhibited amylase directly. These new findings demonstrate that amylase binds to <b>retrograded</b> starch. Therefore consumption of <b>retrograded</b> starch may not only be beneficial to health through depletion of total digestible starch, and therefore the metabolisable energy, but may also slow the rate of intestinal digestion through direct inhibition of α-amylase. Such physiological effects have important implications for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease...|$|R

5|$|<b>Retrograde</b> {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a <b>retrograde</b> (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{rate and}} extent of {{digestibility}} of starch were analysed using the logarithm of the slope (LOS) method. Digestibility curves with α-amylase were obtained for starches in their native, gelatinised and 24 h <b>retrograded</b> form. A LOS plot of the digestibility curves was then constructed, which allowed the rate constant (k) and the concentration of the product {{at the end of}} the reaction (C∞) to be calculated. It also allowed the identification of rapid and slow phases in starch digestion. Upon gelatinisation, both k and C∞ increased with dramatic changes notably in C∞; however after starch samples had been stored for 24 h at room temperature, k was not affected but C∞ decreased. This suggests that <b>retrograded</b> starch is virtually inert to amylase action. Both k and C∞ were strongly related to the increase in degree of order of the α-glucan chains, monitored by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, in <b>retrograded</b> starch...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} α-amylase {{resistant}} corn starches were in vitro fermented (72 h) using cecal content of rat as inoculum. Resistant starches were prepared from native (NCS), <b>retrograded</b> (RSA), and <b>retrograded</b> and boiled (RSB) corn starch by treatment with α-amylase to remove digestible starch. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, molar ratios (acetate: propionate: butyrate), fermentability {{with respect to}} lactulose and dry matter disappearance were measured. SCFA production was significantly correlated with non-fermented residue (P < 0. 001). The three starches showed a similar fermentability, although the rate of SCFA production and disappearance of substrate were slower for <b>retrograded</b> starches. NCS was fermented early while RSA and RSB prolonged their degradation to 72 h. There were slight differences in the molar ratios of acetate, propionate and butyrate. Structural changes in the materials were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In summary, commonly utilised domestic cooking and technological treatments modified the in vitro fermentative characteristics of resistant corn starches probably due to structural changes. © Springer-Verlag 2000.

40|$|The {{influence}} of 6 % dietary raw or <b>retrograded</b> high-amylose corn starch on protein, fat, carbohydrate, energy and mineral utilization was studied in rats and ileum-cannulated pigs fed the same conventional diets. Ileal nitrogen digestibility tended to decrease and faecal nitrogen excretion {{to increase in}} pigs fed one of the tested enzyme resistant starch (RS) sources. In rats, the effect from RS intake on faecal nitrogen excretion was more pronounced (P< 0. 05). These effects were paralleled by a shift of the nitrogen excretion from the renal to the faecal output. As a result, no significant effects from RS on nitrogen retention could be established in pigs and rats. RS consumption tended to lower apparent faecal fat digestibility in rats as well as apparent ileal and faecal fat digestibility in pigs. This effect on faecal fat digestibility was significant in pigs fed <b>retrograded</b> high-amylose corn starch. Faecal starch digestibility was significantly decreased in rats fed RS. Similar effects were found at the terminal ileum in pigs, {{but not at the}} anal level possibly due to more intensive fermentation in the large intestine of these animals. Apparent faecal digestible and metabolizable energy values were significantly lower in rats receiving RS. These effects were less pronounced in pigs, although RS intake significantly lowered apparent ileal energy digestibility when <b>retrograded</b> high-amylose corn starch was fed. In vivo determination of the RS concentrations in both test diets using ileum-cannulated pigs revealed values of 2. 9 % raw and 5. 7 % <b>retrograded</b> high-amylose corn starch instead of the 6 % RS as measured in vitro, indicating that the tested <b>retrograded</b> starch behaved more like RS in the small intestine as compared with the raw starch. RS did not significantly affect apparent faecal absorption or retention of Ca, P, Mg and Zn in rats and pigs. In pigs, RS intake tended to decrease ileal absorption of the minerals, but these effects appeared to be neutralized in the large intestine. Despite the moderate dietary RS content, increases in faecal water content and bulking were found in rats and pigs. In conclusion, the investigated effects from RS ingestion were in general qualitatively similar in both species. <b>Retrograded</b> high-amylose corn starch, as compared with raw high-amylose corn starch, often exerted more pronounced effects, but the differences were not always significant.

Starch gels were frozen to − 30 °C and stored at 4, 0, − 3, − 5, and − 8 °C for 5 days. The results indicated that the value of gelatinized starch gel annealed at − 7 °C for 15 [*]min was − 3. 5 °C. Waxy rice starch gels <b>retrograded</b> significantly when stored at 4 °C with a decrease in the enthalpy of melting <b>retrograded</b> starch in samples stored for 5 days at − 3, − 5, and − 8 °C, respectively, perhaps due to the more rigid glass matrix and less molecular mobility facilitating starch chain recrystallization at temperatures below.

Clear trends in intestinal alginate degradation were observed.
