40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the past}} decade the {{healthcare}} workforce has diversified in several directions with formalised <b>roles</b> for health care assistants, specialised <b>roles</b> for nurses and technicians, advanced <b>roles</b> for physician associates and nurse practitioners and new professions for new services, such as case managers. Hence the composition of health care teams has become increasingly diverse. The exact extent of this diversity is unknown across the different countries of Europe, as are the drivers of this change. The research questions guiding this study were: What extended professional <b>roles</b> are emerging on health care teams? How are extended professional <b>roles</b> created? What main drivers explain the observed differences, if any, in extended <b>roles</b> in and between countries? Methods We performed a case-based comparison of the extended <b>roles</b> in care pathways for breast cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. We conducted 16 case studies in eight European countries, including in total 160 interviews with physicians, nurses {{and other health care}} professionals in new <b>roles</b> and 600 + hours of observation in health care clinics. Results The results show a relatively diverse composition of <b>roles</b> in the three care pathways. We identified specialised <b>roles</b> for physicians, extended <b>roles</b> for nurses and technicians, and independent <b>roles</b> for advanced nurse practitioners and physician associates. The development of extended <b>roles</b> depends upon the willingness of physicians to delegate tasks, developments in medical technology and service (re) design. Academic training and setting a formal scope of practice for new <b>roles</b> have less impact upon the development of new <b>roles.</b> While specialised <b>roles</b> focus particularly on a well-specified technical or clinical domain, the generic <b>roles</b> concentrate on organising and integrating care and cure. Conclusion There are considerable differences in the number and kind of extended <b>roles</b> between both countries and care pathways. The main drivers for new <b>roles</b> reside in the technological development of medical treatment and the need for more generic competencies. Extended <b>roles</b> develop in two directions: 1) specialised <b>roles</b> and 2) generic <b>roles...</b>|$|R

5|$|Before casting Keira Knightley as Gretta, Carney {{considered}} {{casting a}} pop singer such as Adele {{in the main}} <b>role,</b> {{as well as a}} number of other actresses including Scarlett Johansson, who was at one point attached to the project. Knightley, who had never sung professionally before, prepared for the <b>role</b> by training with a vocal coach and learning how to play a guitar. Mark Ruffalo was Carney's first choice for the <b>role</b> of Dan, and agreed to star in the film after Carney sent him the first draft of the screenplay. Singer Adam Levine was also the only person Carney considered casting as Dave, and won the <b>role</b> after talking with Carney over Skype and recording some dialogue as an audition; he declined to be paid for appearing in the film. Although he had had minor acting parts on television before, Begin Again marked his first <b>role</b> in a film. Carney approached James Corden to appear in the film after admiring Corden's performance in the lead <b>role</b> in a Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Roles</b> are {{important}} concepts {{in order to}} consider practical instance managements. Although <b>roles</b> have been discussed by many researchers, there remains some room to investigate to clarify ontological characteristics of them. This paper focuses on <b>roles</b> which are dependent on the future or past event/process, such as candidate, departing passenger, murderer, and product etc. In {{order to deal with}} such kinds of <b>roles</b> based on an ontological theory of <b>roles,</b> we introduce a model of derived <b>roles</b> with its temporal model. It could provide a computational model to represent temporal characteristics of <b>roles...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{find out}} what happens with the <b>roles</b> that are {{seemingly}} left behind. Are there <b>roles</b> that are harder or easier to exercise? Available <b>roles</b> with us through life and affect our future decisions or we switched completely away from them and create new <b>roles</b> based on the situations we find ourselves in at the moment? The aim is also to see how the relationship looks like between closed <b>roles</b> and new <b>roles</b> in life. To try to find this out, I have used the narrative method. The study is based largely on Goffman's theories of <b>roles,</b> behind and above the front- and back stage. It seems to change <b>roles</b> and adapt to the new situations is relatively simple for this particular respondent, despite the severity of <b>roles.</b> However, when it relates to <b>roles</b> that have the responsibility makes adapting more difficult...|$|R

Results confirmed the hypothesis and, in particular, showed that the 8 <b>roles</b> can be divided into two groups: Pro-social <b>Roles,</b> supporting the Victim (Defender, Mediator and Consoler) and Pro-bullying <b>Roles,</b> in favour of the Bully (Assistant, Reinforcer and Outsider). Prosocial <b>Roles</b> positively correlated with measures of Empathy, and Social Desirability, whereas Pro-bullying <b>Roles</b> showed negative correlations...|$|R

5|$|Bryant Haliday {{was cast}} in the lead <b>role</b> as Professor Steiner. He was chosen for the <b>role</b> as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title <b>role,</b> and the budget would not allow a Hollywood star to be used. The fact that Gordon was already {{familiar}} with him, as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll, was also a factor. Haliday, a fan of horror movies, enjoyed doing The Projected Man. British stage actress Mary Peach {{was cast in}} the lead <b>role</b> as Dr. Patricia Hill. It was insisted that she be given top billing for her <b>role.</b> Norman Wooland, a German-born British character actor, was cast as Dr. Blanchard, the film's villain.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Ursula Iguaran?s struggles in {{performing}} her multiple <b>roles</b> in the family as seen in Gabriel Garcia Marquez?s One Hundred Years of Solitude. The thesis writer decides to discuss woman?s multiple <b>roles</b> {{in the family and}} the struggle in performing the multiple <b>roles</b> since she is interested in woman issue. The purpose of this analysis is to find out Ursula Iguaran?s struggle in performing the multiple <b>roles</b> in her family. By doing this analysis, the thesis writer wants to show the readers about the complexity of women?s multiple <b>roles</b> in the family so that the readers will {{have a better understanding of}} women?s multiple <b>roles,</b> particularly in the family. The thesis writer limits the analysis only on Ursula Iguaran and focuses the analysis on Ursula Iguaran?s multiple <b>roles</b> in the family. In doing the analysis, the thesis writer uses literary approach and applies literary tools of conflict and characterization to analyze Ursula?s struggles in performing her multiple <b>roles.</b> The thesis writer also uses the concepts of woman?s multiple <b>roles</b> in the family in order to discuss Ursula Iguaran?s multiple <b>roles</b> in her family. From the analysis, the thesis writer finds out the conflicts that Ursula has to face while performing her multiple <b>roles</b> in the family. There are outer conflicts, inner conflicts, and also conflicting <b>roles</b> between two different <b>roles.</b> As a conclusion, the thesis writer believes that Ursula has already tried her best to perform her multiple <b>roles</b> in the family well. She is a great woman who can endure the hard situations in her life. It is possible to justify the fact that sometimes she cannot perform one of her <b>roles</b> properly with the consideration that the Buendia is a big family. Moreover, Ursula is only an ordinary woman who has limitation in controlling all of her <b>roles</b> in her family...|$|R
