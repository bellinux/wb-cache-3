40|$|The {{possible}} {{scenario of}} what happens in the plane during the doping of cuprates with oxygen holes is subject of this brief communication. The simultaneously inserted oxygen holes and electrons create two components plasma. The oxygen holes driven by the repelling Coulomb force create a quasi-static lattice, the dimension of which depends on the doping level. The stability of such a lattice, according to the equipartition theorem, depends on the temperature. On this basis one can define the temperature at which the Coulomb <b>repelling</b> <b>energy</b> is balanced by thermal energy of the displacements of oxygen holes from their equilibrium positions in the hole lattice. This balance temperature is amazingly close to the superconducting transition temperature within range defining by doping dome for cuprates.

40|$|Abstract Single {{electron}} transistor (SET) {{is a novel}} {{idea and}} has been intensively studied. This review gives a general picture of SET, such as its mechanism, fabrication, application and problems faced. Key words SET quantum dot tunneling Chemical self-assembly During 1980 s, the main discoveries in mesoscopic physics are the tunneling of single electron and Coulomb blockade phenomena[1, 2, 13], which make many scientists predict that if {{the size of the}} quantum dots is reduced to several nanometers, it is highly possible to produce applicable single electron transistor (SET) which works above liquid nitrogen temperature, and this will bring a revolution to electronic science. Since then SET has been a hot research area. The breakthrough of nanotech as well as its successful combination with semiconductor technologies gives hope to SET, and some think {{that it will be a}} mature technique in the coming decade. 1 Mechanism of SET Usually electrons move continuously in the common transistors, but as the size of the system goes down to nanoscale (for example, the size of metal atoms can be several nm, and the size of semi-conductive particles can be several tens nm), the energy of the system is quantumized, that is, the process of charging and discharging is discontinuous. The energy for one electron to move into the system is: CeEc 2 / 2 where C is the capacitance of this system. This Ec is called Coulomb blockade energy, which is the <b>repelling</b> <b>energy</b> of the previous electron to the next electron. For a tiny system, the capacitance C is very small, thus Ec can be very high, and the electrons cannot move simultaneously, but must pass through one by one. This phenomenon is called "Coulomb blockade", and has been observed in 1980 s. If two quantum dots(QD) are joined at a point and form a channel, it is possible for an electron to pass from one dot over the energy barrier and move to the other dot, this is called "tunneling phenomenon". In order to overcome the barrier (Ec), the applied voltage on the quantum dots (V/ 2) should be V> e/C In order to observe Coulomb blockade and tunneling, the energy an electron assumes must be higher than the thermal scattering energy, that i...|$|E

40|$|We {{study with}} lattice Monte Carlo {{simulations}} the interactions and macroscopic behaviour {{of a large}} number of vortices in the 3 -dimensional U(1) gauge+Higgs field theory, in an external magnetic field. We determine non-perturbatively the (attractive or <b>repelling)</b> interaction <b>energy</b> between two or more vortices, as well as the critical field strength H_c, the thermodynamical discontinuities, and the surface tension related to the boundary between the Meissner phase and the Coulomb phase in the type I region. We also investigate the emergence of vortex lattice and vortex liquid phases in the type II region. For the type I region the results obtained are in qualitative agreement with mean field theory, except for small values of H_c, while in the type II region there are significant discrepancies. These findings are relevant for superconductors and some models of cosmic strings, as well as for the electroweak phase transition in a magnetic field.

40|$|Low-blow {{experiments}} {{carried out}} with a Charpy machine and with an elastically behaving, strain gauge instrumented, high strength steel test piece {{do not appear to}} behave elastically {{in the sense that the}} input energy is not completely recovered by the <b>repelled</b> hammer. <b>Energy</b> losses of more than 30 percent have been measured. The analysis shows that about 1 / 3 of the losses are absorbed by the sample and 2 / 3 by the C-shaped hammer blade of this machine. Elastic oscillations of the sample and of the hammer blade are initiated and keep this energy trapped for a long time. Spreadsheet procedures are used for data evaluation. It is shown that due to these effects the common evaluation procedures necessarily lead to considerable errors in sample bending and Charpy energy determination. It seems that the correct sample-related data can he separated only from the total set of data when the correlated quantities are directly determined at the sample under test...|$|R
50|$|When Speedball {{uses his}} superhuman powers, his voices alters in an unknown fashion and solid force bubbles of residue kinetic field energy appear {{on his body}} and, when he bounces, in his wake. While bouncing, he is immune {{to any kind of}} harm caused by {{physical}} contact. Speedball's power activates automatically when any physical contact occurs above a low level that has not yet been precisely determined. When Speedball's kinetic field activates, his body increases in height and mass (drawn from an extradimensional source); he reverts to his normal size and mass on deactivating the field. Early in his career, the slightest touch, such as snapping his fingers, would turn on this field, but he eventually gained conscious control over it. The field <b>repelled</b> all <b>energy</b> that struck it, especially kinetic energy. As such, bullets, punches, and all other physical attacks bounced off him. A side effect of this, though, was that he, too, would bounce in the opposite direction. Baldwin often used this to his advantage, such as purposely running into a wall in order to gain momentum and thus hit an opponent with twice the force.|$|R

25|$|The {{possible}} {{observation of}} CNS effects in astronauts who were participating in past NASA missions {{is highly unlikely}} for several reasons. First, the lengths of past missions are relatively short and the population sizes of astronauts are small. Second, when astronauts are traveling in LEO, they are partially protected by the magnetic field and the solid body of the Earth, which together reduce the GCR dose-rate by about two-thirds from its free space values. Furthermore, the GCR in LEO has lower LET components compared to the GCR that will be encountered in transit to Mars or on the lunar surface because the magnetic field of the Earth <b>repels</b> nuclei with <b>energies</b> that are below about 1,000 MeV/u, which are of higher LET. For these reasons, the CNS risks are a greater concern for long-duration lunar missions or for a Mars mission than for missions on the ISS.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of 2 pi domain walls in ferromagnetic nanorings is investigated via {{calculation of the}} minimum energy path that separates a 2 pi domain wall from the vortex state of a ferromagnetic nanoring. Trapped domains are stable when they exist between certain types of transverse domain walls, i. e., walls in which the edge defects {{on the same side}} of the magnetic strip have equal sign and thus <b>repel.</b> Here the <b>energy</b> barriers between these configurations and vortex magnetization states are obtained using the string method. Due to the geometry of a ring, two types of 2 pi walls must be distinguished that differ by their overall topological index and exchange energy. The minimum energy path corresponds to the expulsion of a vortex. The energy barrier for annihilation of a 2 pi wall is compared to the activation energy for transitions between the two ring vortex states. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{beta decay}} {{lifetime}} {{of the free}} neutron is an important input to the Standard Model of particle physics, but values measured using different methods have exhibited substantial disagreement. The UCNtau experiment in development at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) plans to explore better methods of measuring the neutron lifetime using ultracold neutrons (UCNs). In this experiment, UCNs are confined in a magneto-gravitational trap formed by a curved, asymmetric Halbach array placed inside a vacuum vessel and surrounded by holding field coils. If any defects present in the Halbach array are sufficient to reduce the local field near the surface below that needed to <b>repel</b> the desired <b>energy</b> level UCNs, loss by material interaction can occur at a rate similar to the loss by beta decay. A map of the magnetic field near {{the surface of the}} array is necessary to identify any such defects, but the array 2 ÃÜ 7 s curved geometry and placement in a vacuum vessel make conventional field mapping methods difficult. A system consisting of computer vision-based tracking and a rover holding a Hall probe has been designed to map the field near the surface of the array, and construction of an initial prototype has begun at LANL.
