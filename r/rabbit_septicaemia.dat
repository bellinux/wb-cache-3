40|$|The {{history of}} Pasteurella multocida (sometimes called Pasteurella septica) as a {{pathogen}} of animals {{dates back to}} the mid-nineteenth century. It has long been held responsible for the disease known as haemorrhagic septicaemia in a large variety of animals, both tame and wild. In the 1850 â€™s, many workers {{in the course of their}} investigations found in varied sick or dead animals, an organism that is now called Pasteurella but was not known by any name at that time. These organisms, apparently pathogenic, were isolated from animals suffering from a disease of a haemorrhagic nature. Hueppe (1886) collected strains of these organisms from various sources. His study included organisms from fowl cholera, <b>rabbit</b> <b>septicaemia,</b> haemorrhagic septicaemia of cattle, including wild deer, wild boar and swine plague. He was endeavouring to show that this organism was a soil bacterium, similar in behaviour in respect to infectivity, to the anthrax bacillus. In this he was not too successful, although there are still some workers in Europe today who hold tentatively to this view. What Hueppe did show was a relationship of the organisms isolated from various sources to one another. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|End {{of project}} reportsS. aureus {{can also cause}} a number of infections in animals such as tick-associated pyaemia in lambs, staphylococcosis in <b>rabbits,</b> <b>septicaemia,</b> abscesses and chondronecrosis in {{chickens}} and pneumonia and osteomyelitis complex in turkeys. S. aureus is the most frequent cause of bovine mastitis, a disease that is of economic importance worldwide (Beck et al., 1992). Typically staphylococcal mastitis is chronic in nature, with subclinical mastitis being the most common form...|$|R
40|$|Pasteurella multocida is {{associated}} with hemorrhagic septicaemia in cattle and buffaloes, pneumonic pasteurellosis in sheep and goats, fowl cholera in poultry, atrophic rhinitis in pigs and snuffles in <b>rabbits.</b> Haemorrhagic <b>septicaemia</b> is caused by Pasteurella multocida type B: 2, B: 2, 5 and B: 5 in Asian countries and type E: 2 in African countries. Pasteurella multocida have five types of capsular serotype i. e. type A, B, D, E and F. Diagnosis of the disease is mainly based on the clinical sign and symptom, post mortem findings. Confirmatory diagnosis is done by isolation and identification of causative agent. A variety of laboratory diagnostic techniques have been developed over the years for pasteurellosis and used routinely in the laboratory. Among these techniques molecular techniques of diagnosis is most important. This technique not only gives diagnosis but it also provides information regarding capsular type of Pasteurella multocida. Techniques which are used for molecular diagnosis of haemorrhagic septicaemia are PCR based diagnosis, Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), Ribotyping, Colony hybridization assay, Filled alternation gel electrophoresis (FAGE), Detection of Pasteurella multocida by Real Time PCR. Among these techniques real tim...|$|R
