The Kingdom of Burmecia, whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated Cleyran civilization, which is nestled in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a powerful sandstorm. Treno, a large, perpetually dark city, heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers, {{is located in the}} southeast part of the continent. The Mist Continent is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations.|$|E
