40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possible protective effect of whey protein isolate (WPI) on the oxidative stability of vitamin A in an aqueous phase. The first part of the study focused on the development of a reliable method to extract retinol from the samples for analysis. Direct solvent extraction and saponification were both tested, with saponification, which converts <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> into retinol, chosen for the experimental work. Extracted retinol was quantified using reversed phase HPLC, to obtain the degradation trends of the samples that had been subjected to various conditions. During the second part of the study, the degradation trends were obtained for the samples of <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> in the presence and absence of WPI, when subjected to fluorescent light, pasteurisation, UHT treatment or storage at 5 or 40 °C. Samples exposed to fluorescent light at 4 °C showed exponential degradation of <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate.</b> Within 48 hours of light exposure, almost 60 % of the <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> had degraded regardless of the initial concentration. However, samples containing WPI retained slightly more <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> at initial <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> concentrations > 25 μg/ml. The presence of WPI had a protective effect on <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> during pasteurisation at 72 °C for 15 seconds. This protective effect appeared to be associated with the WPI concentration. However, there was no difference between samples with or without WPI after UHT treatment at 144 °C for 3 - 4 seconds, presumably due to the denaturation of the whey proteins. The effect of WPI on <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> during storage was minimal at 40 °C, where total degradation of retinol occurred within 48 hours of storage regardless of the initial <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration. In contrast, WPI showed a significant protective effect on <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> at 5 °C, especially when the initial <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration was > 25 mg/ml. Overall, the presence of WPI and higher initial <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> concentrations showed better stability than the control samples when exposed to light, stored at 5 °C or during pasteurisation...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we have {{reported}} that retinoic acid (RA), similarly to <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate,</b> is able to reinitiate spermatogenesis in vitamin A-deficient rats. Here, we investigated the expression of RA receptors RAR alpha, RAR beta, RAR gamma, and retinoid X receptor RXR alpha by Northern blot analysis of poly(A) + RNA of testes of vitamin A-deficient rats before and after reinitiation of spermatogenesis induced by injection of <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> or RA and testes of 21 -day-old and 10 -week-old normal rats. In the testis of vitamin A-deficient rats 1. 9 -, 2. 8 -, and 3. 8 -kilobase (kb) transcripts of RAR alpha; 2. 8 - and 3. 3 -kb transcripts of RAR beta; 1. 8 -, 2. 8 -, and 3. 4 -kb transcripts of RAR gamma; and two transcripts of RXR alpha of 2. 5 and 4. 8 kb are expressed. When vitamin A-deficient rats receive RA or <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate,</b> a 3 -fold increase {{in the amount of}} poly(A) + RNA per testis can be observed after 8 h, while the amounts of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and sulfated glycoprotein- 1 mRNA hardly change. Also, the expression of several transcripts of each RAR type is significantly increased from 1. 8 - up to 3. 6 -fold. Moreover, additional transcripts of RAR beta and RXR alpha (1. 8 and 1. 0 kb, respectively) can be detected. In the testes of 21 -day-old rats, three transcripts of each RAR type and two RXR alpha transcripts are expressed. In contrast, in the normal adult rat testis the expression of all RARs, if present, is lower than that in the 21 -day-old rat testis or the adult vitamin A-deficient rat testis. The expression of all transcripts of each RAR in the testis of 21 -day-old rats shows great similarity with the expression in the testis of the vitamin A-deficient rat after replacement of <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> or RA. These changes in expression indicate that RARs and RXR alpha {{may play a role in}} the process of proliferation and differentiation of A spermatogonia, which is induced in vitamin A-deficient rats shortly after replacement of RA or retinol acetat...|$|E

After 24 -h culturing of involved skin with medium only, dissociation of keratinocytes, which was also observed prior to culturing, was exacerbated, and the epidermis became edematous, with a large section detaching from the dermis. These phenomena were not suppressed even when betamethasone, <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate,</b> or camostat mesilate (serine protease inhibitor) {{was added to the}} medium. On the other hand, in the cultures of uninvolved skin explants with medium only, widened intercellular spaces were observed 24 – 48 h after initiation of culture, and dissociation of keratinocytes and acantholytic clefts became apparent after 72 h.

While it is widely accepted that RA signaling {{is involved in the}} regulation of neural stem cell differentiation, little is known about vitamin A utilization and biosynthesis of active retinoids in the neurogenic niches, or about the details of retinoid metabolism in neural stem cells and differentiating progenies. Here we provide data on retinoid responsiveness and RA production of distinct neural stem cell/neural progenitor populations. In addition, we demonstrate differentiation-related changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins of the retinoid machinery, including components responsible for uptake (Stra 6) and storage (Lrat) of vitamin A, transport of retinoids (Rbp 4, CrbpI, CrabpI-II), synthesis (Rdh 10, Raldh 1 - 4), degradation of RA (Cyp 26 a 1 -c 1) and RA signaling (Raralpha,beta,gamma, Rxralpha,beta,gamma). We show that both early embryonic neuroectodermal (NE- 4 C) stem cells and late embryonic or adult derived radial glia like progenitors (RGl cells) are capable to produce bioactive retinoids but respond differently to retinoid signals. However, while neuronal differentiation of RGl cells can not be induced by RA, neuron formation by NE- 4 C cells is initiated by both RA and RA-precursors (<b>retinol</b> or retinyl <b>acetate).</b> The data indicate that endogenous RA production, at least in some neural stem cell populations, may result in autocrine regulation of neuronal differentiation...|$|R

40|$|The four most {{important}} non-specific carboxylesterases from rat liver were assayed {{for their ability}} to hydrolyse retinyl esters. Only the esterases with pI 6. 2 and 6. 4 (= esterase ES- 4) are able to hydrolyse retinyl palmitate. Their specific activities strongly depend on the emulsifier used (maximum rate: 440 nmol of retinol liberated/h per mg of esterase). Beside retinyl palmitate, these esterases cleave palmitoyl-CoA and monoacylglycerols with much higher rates, as well as certain drugs (e. g. aspirin and propanidid). However, no transacylation between palmitoyl-CoA and <b>retinol</b> occurs. Retinyl <b>acetate</b> also is a substrate for the above esterases and for another one with pI 5. 6 (= esterase ES- 3). Again the emulsifier influences the hydrolysis by these esterases (maximum rates: 475 nmol/h per mg for ES- 4 and 200 nmol/h per mg for ES- 3). Differential centrifugation of rat liver homogenate reveals that retinyl palmitate hydrolase activity is highly enriched in the plasma membranes, but only moderately so in the endoplasmic reticulum, where the investigated esterases are located. Since the latter activity can be largely inhibited with the selective esterase inhibitor bis-(4 -nitrophenyl) phosphate, it is concluded that the esterases with pI 6. 2 and 6. 4 (ES- 4) represent the main retinyl palmitate hydrolase of rat liver endoplasmic reticulum. In view of this cellular localization, the enzyme could possibly be involved in the mobilization of retinol from the vitamin A esters stored in the liver. However, preliminary experiments in vivo have failed to demonstrate such a biological function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Retinoids are {{lipophilic}} isoprenoids {{composed of}} a cyclic group and a linear chain with a hydrophilic end group. These compounds include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, retinyl esters, and various derivatives of these structures. Retinoids are used as cosmetic agents and effective pharmaceuticals for skin diseases. Retinal, an immediate precursor of retinoids, is derived by β-carotene 15, 15 '-mono(di) oxygenase (BCM(D) O) from β-carotene, which is synthesized from the isoprenoid building blocks isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Retinoids are chemically unstable and biologically degraded via retinoic acid. Although extensive studies have been performed on the microbial production of carotenoids, retinoid production using microbial metabolic engineering has not been reported. Here, we report retinoid production using engineered Escherichia coli that express exogenous BCM(D) O and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for the building blocks synthesis in combination with a two-phase culture system using a dodecane overlay. Results Among the BCM(D) O tested in E. coli, the synthetic retinoid synthesis protein (SR), based on bacteriorhodopsin-related protein-like homolog (Blh) of the uncultured marine bacteria 66 A 03, showed the highest β-carotene cleavage activity with no residual intracellular β-carotene. By introducing the exogenous MVA pathway, 8. 7 mg/L of retinal was produced, which is 4 -fold higher production than that of augmenting the MEP pathway (dxs overexpression). There was a large gap between retinal production and β-carotene consumption using the exogenous MVA pathway; therefore, the retinal derivatives were analyzed. The derivatives, except for retinoic acid, that formed were identified, and the levels of retinal, <b>retinol,</b> and retinyl <b>acetate</b> were measured. Amounts as high as 95 mg/L retinoids were obtained from engineered E. coli DH 5 α harboring the synthetic SR gene and the exogenous MVA pathway in addition to dxs overexpression, which were cultured at 29 °C for 72 hours with 2 YT medium containing 2. 0 % (w/v) glycerol as the main carbon source. However, a significant level of intracellular degradation of the retinoids was also observed in the culture. To prevent degradation of the intracellular retinoids through in situ extraction from the cells, a two-phase culture system with dodecane was used. The highest level of retinoid production (136 mg/L) was obtained after 72 hours with 5 mL of dodecane overlaid on a 5 mL culture. Conclusions In this study, we successfully produced 136 mg/L retinoids, which were composed of 67 mg/L retinal, 54 mg/L retinol, and 15 mg/L retinyl acetate, using a two-phase culture system with dodecane, which produced 68 -fold more retinoids than the initial level of production (2. 2 mg/L). Our results demonstrate the potential use of E. coli as a promising microbial cell factory for retinoid production. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain greater understanding of the behaviour of bovine β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) during thermal denaturation. The first part of the study was focused on gaining more knowledge of the structural changes in β-lg during heat-induced and urea-induced denaturation and the effect of ligands and the genetic variants of β-lg. The second part of the study explored the mechanism of the heat-induced interaction of β-lg with κ-casein (κ-CN) and the effects of genetic variants. The reversible early steps during thermal denaturation of β-lg are not readily separated from the later irreversible steps which involve sulphydryl-disulphide interchange reactions. However, it should be possible to examine the behaviour of β-lg in the early steps without reactive thiols either by using a porcine β-lg, that does not have cysteine residue equivalent to Cys- 121 of bovine β-lg, by blocking the free thiol or by using solvent denaturation. Heating to 80 °C irreversibly altered near- and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra, and 1, 8 -anilinonaphthalene sulphonate and retinol binding fluorescence spectra for bovine β-lg, but not for porcine β-lg which unfolded reversibly. Also the examination of the induced CD spectral changes of retinol and cis-parinaric acid (PnA) on binding to bovine β-lg B upon heating revealed that bovine β-lg lost the ability to bind retinol and PnA in a chiral environment. In contrast, porcine β-lg did not show significantly induced CD bands upon mixing with retinol, but PnA/β-lg mixtures showed induced CD bands of low intensity. In addition to the lack of a free thiol group in porcine β-lg, the sequence differences between bovine β-lg and porcine β-lg are also likely to affect the behaviour of these β-lgs during heat treatment and the binding of ligands. Although palmitic acid does not show any absorbance in CD spectra, it enhanced the stability of the bovine β-lg and porcine β-lg mixture. The urea-induced unfolding of bovine β-lg at neutral pH (6. 7) revealed that the stability of the genetic variants followed the order, β-lg B<β-lg A<β-lg C, as observed during thermal denaturation and tryptic hydrolysis. The stabilisation effect was also observed by adding retinol, retinoic acid and palmitic acid during urea denaturation of β-lg, and by <b>retinol,</b> retinyl <b>acetate</b> and PnA during ammonium sulphate denatuation of β-lg. Blocking the sulphydryl group of β-lg destabilised the native protein against urea denaturation through the introduction of a bulky group to the compact structure of β-lg. This result, together with the results for porcine β-lg, confirms that the sulphydryl group plays an important role in the unfolding of bovine β-lg. In the second part of the study, an attempt was made to investigate the effect of bovine κ-CN on the established heat-induced unfolding and aggregation pathway of bovine β-lg, by adding κ-CN A or κ-CN B to native or pre-heated β-lg A, B or C and heating the mixture. The CD band intensity of the mixture of β-lg and κ-CN at 270 nm, an index of significant alteration to the disulphide bond dihedral angle, indicated increasing structural changes involving disulphide bonds during heat treatment. The rates of loss of β-lg and the distributions of intermediate products were determined using alkaline- and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). During reaction with β-lg, some monomeric κ-CN was found by SDS-PAGE, probably as a result of disulphide bond interchanges between κ-CN and β-lg, and two-dimensional PAGE also revealed disulphide-bonded β-lg/κ-CN aggregates. In the presence of κ-CN, the loss of monomeric β-lg increased and less non-native monomer and dimer were observed compared to β-lg alone and κ-CN reacted more rapidly with β-lg that had been unfolded by prior heat treatment than with native β-lg. This suggested that β-lg probably denatured (unfolded) independently and either simultaneously or consequently and contained higher sulphydryl reactivity than native β-lg, which lead to the reactions with κ-CN via disulphide bond interchange. It is possible that the equilibrium between native β-lg and denatured β-lg shifted rapidly, because κ-CN preferred to interact with denatured (unfolded) β-lg that has higher sulphydryl reactivity than native β-lg. The kinetics of the interaction between β-lg and κ-CN were evaluated from the heat-induced loss of alkaline-monomeric β-lg at 80 °C. The interaction between β-lg and κ-CN could not be described by any reaction order between 1. 0 and 2. 0. The slopes of the plots changed at about 7. 5 - 10 min heating time and this corresponded to intensity changes in the alkaline-monomeric, non-native monomeric and dimeric β-lg bands, which increased during the first 10 min of heating and then slightly decreased or remained relatively constant for the rest of the heating. The loss of native β-lg in β-lg/κ-CN mixtures during heating at 80 °C was shown to be significantly influenced by the genotypes of both β-lg and κ-CN. The κ-CN B variant showed considerably higher reactivity than κ-CN A, while the β-lg B variant was the most reactive. The greatest loss of native β-lg was observed from the β-lg B/κ-CN B mixtur...|$|R

It was found that vitamin E showed no effect on the enzyme activity and fate of cosubstrate radicals from the group of benzidine derivatives. Vitamin C proceeds enzymatic reaction showing its antioxidative character, and absorbs electrons from radicals, bringing cosubstrate back to its relaxed state. On the other hand, vitamin A plays a role of uncompetitive peroxidase inhibitor, which is visible through decreasing initial rate of catalytic reaction, and is reflected as virtual decrease of enzyme concentration. Furthermore, it prolongs life of endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which could potentially lead to oxidative stress of cells. This inhibitory effect can be used in analytical purpose, for determination of <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> content in a sample...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Human and rabbit corneas {{were stored}} at 4 °C in K-Sol {{with and without}} {{antioxidants}} (ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, a-tocopherol, and <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate)</b> {{for two to three}} weeks. All the corneas were then examined visually and by scanning electron microscopy. They appeared clear and slightly oedematous. Scanning electron micrographs were used to grade corneal endothelial cell morphology in a masked manner in terms of cell shape, cell borders, cell swelling, and apical holes. Corneas stored in K-Sol without antioxidants showed changes in cell shape, cell borders, and apical holes. Human corneas showed more morphological changes than rabbit corneas. The results suggest that antioxidants in K-Sol have {{an important role in the}} preservation of endothelial cell morphology. K-Sol corneal preservation medium allows better long-term storage of corneas than storage in McCarey-Kaufman (M-K) medium. ' " Chondroitin sulphate, the major component of K-Sol, acts as an antioxidant 5 apart from its role in maintaining osmolality. Lipid peroxides are known to cause considerable damage to membranes by altering their structural and functional components. 6 Since the maintenance of endothelial cell viability is the most important consideration in long-term preservation o...|$|E
40|$|The {{embryonic}} rat ventricle H 9 c 2 cells {{maintain a}} proliferative state (P condition) {{in the presence}} of 10 % FCS. However, by reducing serum concentration and {{in the presence of}} <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate,</b> proliferation is stopped, myogenic transdifferentiation is inhibited while cardiac differentiation is preserved (D condition). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis was used to define the modifications of the nuclear proteome occurring during the P-to-D transition. Among the proteins observed as modified, a reduced expression of the SM 22 /transgelin protein was associated with the D state. Also SM 22 mRNA levels were reduced during P-to-D transition. Cell transfection experiments indicated that this decrease was partially due to a reduction of the SM 22 promoter activity. GATA- 4 had a repressive effect on SM 22 promoter activity. Thus, since GATA- 4 is known as a target of retinoids and may act as a transcriptional repressor, a mechanism to explain the SM 22 reduction during the P-to-D transition is tentatively proposed. Immunohistochemical studies on heart cells confirmed the nuclear localization of SM 22. Moreover, a differential expression of this protein in different districts of the human heart embryo was detected. Therefore, these data suggest that SM 22 expression is regulated during heart development...|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{anthropogenic}} {{impact on the}} environment requires a detailed study of the features of the influence of heavy metals and ionizing radiation on living organisms, and provides for the development and use of effective means of protecting the body from its negative influence. The purpose of the work was to study the characteristics of the exchange of bile pigments of rats under the action of eсopathogenic factors (ionizing radiation and cadmium) on the organism and the corrective properties of liposomes on the basis of milk phospholipids. An analysis of the chromatographic studies of bilirubin and derivatives (nonconjugated bilirubin, bilirubin sulfate, billirubin glucuronide, urobilin and stercobilin) in the whole blood, liver, jejunum contents and feces under the action on the animal organism of eсopathogenic factors (ionizing radiation and cadmium) indicate material violation of the exchange bile pigments that {{may be due to the}} destabilization of the structural and functional hot hepatocytes. Correction of the liposomal form of biologically active additive (BAA) FLP-MD is reco­mmended; the latter is a mixture of phospholipids isolated from milk, with a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, linolenic) and antioxidants (α-tocopherol and <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate).</b> The additive components exhibit the reparative effect of the action in respect of the damaged membrane structures with simultaneous improving of cholepoietic and billiation liver function, and therefore contribute to the normalization of exchange og bile pigments in terms of action on the body ecopathogenic factors...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin A is {{required}} for male fertility and normal spermato-genesis. Retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, is necessary for spermatogonial maturation and proper entry of germ cells into meiotic prophase in the postnatal testes. The expression of Stra 8, which is essential for successful meiosis in {{both male and female}} gonads and normal spermatogenesis, {{is directly related to the}} availability of RA. This study examined the developmental expression pattern of Stra 8 transcript in both male and female gonads, provided specific cellular localization of STRA 8 protein in the postnatal and adult testis, and investigated RA actions in adult germ cells in a vitamin A-sufficient condition. The peak of Stra 8 mRNA expression coincided with the onset of meiosis in postnatal testes. STRA 8 protein was detected in gonocytes as early as 5 days postpartum. The expression of STRA 8 protein in the neonatal testes was not uniform among spermatogonia, perhaps heralding the asynchro-nous beginning of spermatogenesis. In adult testes, the highest level of Stra 8 mRNA and protein was found in seminiferous epithelial stages VI–VIII. STRA 8 protein was localized to some type A and B spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, and early leptotene spermatocytes. In the vitamin A-sufficient adult testes, RA but not <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> stimulated Stra 8 mRNA expression. STRA 8 protein expression in adult spermatogonia was induced by RA stimulation, suggesting its role in spermato-gonial differentiation. Retinoic acid also increased the number of preleptotene spermatocytes exhibiting 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine incorporation, indicating a more synchronized premeiotic DNA replication. in vivo, preleptotene spermatocytes, retinoic acid, spermatogonia, STRA...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{antioxidant}} vitamins on hypoxia-induced erythropoietin production. An {{important role}} in O 2 sensing has been assigned to microsomal and membrane-bound b-type cytochromes which generate regulatory reactive O 2 species (ROS). Recently, ROS {{have been shown to}} suppress the in vitro synthesis of erythropoietin (Epo). We investigated the potential of the antioxidant vitamins A, E and C to enhance renal and hepatic Epo production. Renal effects were studied in isolated serum-free perfused rat kidneys. In control experiments without antioxidant vitamins, Epo secretion amounted to 441 ± 23 mU/g kidney (mean ± SEM, N = 5) during the three hour period of hypoxic perfusion (arterial pO 2 35 mm Hg). Epo secretion significantly increased to 674 ± 92 mU/g kidney (N = 7) when vitamins A (0. 5 µg/ml), E (0. 5 µg/ml) and C (10 µg/ml) in combination were added to the perfusion medium. The effects of the single vitamins were studied in Epo-producing hepatoma cell cultures (lines HepG 2 and Hep 3 B). Vitamin A induced a dose-dependent increase (half-maximal stimulation at 0. 2 µg/ml) in the production of immunore-active Epo during 24 hours of incubation (such as 680 ± 51 U Epo/g cell protein in HepG 2 cultures with 3 µg/ml <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> compared to 261 ± 15 U/g in untreated controls; N = 4). In contrast, vitamin E (tested from 0. 05 to 500 µg/ml) and vitamin C (tested from 2 to 200 µg/ml) did not increase Epo production in hepatoma cell cultures. Thus, while vitamins E and C may have the potential to protect cells from oxidative damage, vitamin A exerts a specific stimulation of Epo production. Preliminary evidence suggests that this effect of vitamin A involves increased mRNA levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α...|$|E
40|$|Polyamines are {{essential}} compounds to all living organisms {{and in the}} specific case of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, they are exclusively obtained through transport processes since this parasite is auxotrophic for polyamines. Previous works reported that <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> inhibits Leishmania growth and decreases its intracellular polyamine concentration. The present work describes a combined strategy of drug repositioning by virtual screening followed by in vitro assays to find drugs able to inhibit TcPAT 12, the only polyamine transporter described in T. cruzi. After a screening of 3000 FDA-approved drugs, 7 retinoids with medical use were retrieved and used for molecular docking assays with TcPAT 12. From the docked molecules, isotretinoin, a well-known drug used for acne treatment, showed the best interaction score with TcPAT 12 and was selected for further in vitro studies. Isotretinoin inhibited the polyamine transport, {{as well as other}} amino acid transporters from the same protein family (TcAAAP), with calculated IC 50 values in the range of 4. 6 - 10. 3 μM. It also showed a strong inhibition of trypomastigote burst from infected cells, with calculated IC 50 of 130 nM (SI = 920) being significantly less effective on the epimastigote stage (IC 50 = 30. 6 μM). The effect of isotretinoin on the parasites plasma membrane permeability and on mammalian cell viability was tested, and no change was observed. Autophagosomes and apoptotic bodies were detected as part of the mechanisms of isotretinoin-induced death indicating that the inhibition of transporters by isotretinoin causes nutrient starvation that triggers autophagic and apoptotic processes. In conclusion, isotretinoin is a promising trypanocidal drug since it is a multi-target inhibitor of essential metabolites transporters, in addition to being an FDA-approved drug largely used in humans, which could reduce significantly the requirements for its possible application in the treatment of Chagas disease...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> (retinol, known as an inhibitor of tumor promotion) on 3 '-methyl- 4 -dimethyl-aminoazobenzene (3 'MeDAB) -induced hepatocarcinogenesis, rats were fed with a diet containing 0. 06 % 3 'MeDAB for 4 or 7 weeks {{and then with a}} normal diet for 21 or 18 weeks. Rats were given retinol (0, 6. 25, 12. 5 and 25. 0 mg/rat, dissolved in DMSO) i. p. every 5 days from the 10 th week to the 20 th week. As a control, rats were fed a basal diet and given retinol at the same doses as mentioned above. At the 25 th week, the incidence of hepatoma (hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma) of each group was checked. In rats fed diet containing 3 'MeDAB for 7 weeks, significant increases in the incidence of hepatoma were seen in retinol-treated groups at various doses. In rats fed 3 'MeDAB diet for 4 weeks, all three doses also moderately, though not significantly, increased the incidence of hepatoma. No liver tumor was found in rats fed normal diet followed by treatment with retinol at any dose. Except for slight but detectable elevation of cellular retinoic acid binding protein levels in tumor tissues obtained from rats treated with retinol, no obvious differences in cellular retinol binding protein and 7 -glutamyl transpeptidase in the tumor tissues were observed between retinol-treated and untreated rats. Phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis of the tumor-bearing rats with or without retinol treatment showed — 50 % inhibition compared with that of rats fed normal diet without retinol treatment. These results indicated that the administration of retinol {{in the early stages of}} hepato-carcinogenesis enhanced the tumor induction, possibly due to the fixation of malignant transformation of the cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{positive}} correlation {{has been established}} between increased oxidative stress and cardiovascular diseases in diabetes mellitus. We evaluated the effects of single or combined treatments with vitamin A (<b>retinol</b> <b>acetate,</b> 30 mg/kg/day, for 12 -weeks) and insulin (8 - 10 IU/rat/day for the final 6 -week) on vasomotor activity, oxidative stress and retinol metabolism in 12 -week streptozotocin diabetic rats. The vasomotor activity was determined by measuring in vitro responsiveness of aorta rings to phenylephrine (PE) and acetylcholine (ACh) in the absence or {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Preincubation with H 2 O 2 (10 μM) produced a significant decrease in PE (1 mM) -induced contraction in untreated-diabetic but not in control rats. Single treatment with insulin counteracted this effect of H 2 O 2 and also reversed the increased contractile response of diabetic aorta to PE, while vitamin A was found to be ineffective. H 2 O 2 (10 μM) also inhibited ACh (1 mM) -stimulated endothelium- dependent relaxation two fold more in diabetic than in control aorta. In the prevention of H 2 O 2 -induced inhibition of vascular relaxation to ACh, vitamin A alone was markedly effective while insulin alone was not. The combination of vitamin A plus insulin removed the inhibitory action of H 2 O 2 in diabetic aorta. Diabetic animals displayed an increased level of aorta thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in association with decreased levels of plasma retinol and retinol-binding protein (RBP). Single treatment with insulin, in spite of allowing recovery of normal growth rate and improved glucose and retinol metabolism in diabetic rats, was unable to control TBARS production to the same extent as vitamin A alone. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of ACh-stimulated endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant tone in normal physiological levels depends largely on the prevention and/or inhibition of peroxidative stress, which is achieved by combined treatment with vitamin A plus insulin. The use of vitamin A together with insulin provides a better metabolic control and more benefits than use of insulin alone in the reduction of diabetes-induced vascular complications...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} use of dietary supplements in today's society {{has been attributed to}} the general public's greater awareness of what constitutes a healthy diet. The elemental content (Ca, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn) of seventy-four dietary supplements (tablets, capsules and powders) was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Different digestion methods (wet open vessel and microwave) were developed for the dissolution of dietary supplements, utilising both concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Both digestion procedures were found to give no significant statistical difference between the experimental results and certified values at a 99 % confidence limit (Paired t-test) for all element values in two certified reference materials, namely NIES Rice Flour and IGGE Tea. For both certified reference materials, there was. The elemental content of the dietary supplements ranged from 0. 1 - 200 mg/g for macro essential elements (Ca, Fe and Mg), 1 - 500 mug/g for trace essential elements (Cr, Co, Cu, Mn. Mo, Ni and Zn) and 0. 4 - 10 mug/g for non-essential elements (Cd and Pb), all on a dry weight basis. Comparison of experimental results with commercial label values for dietary supplements showed: (1) calculated Ca and Mg concentrations were systematically lower than the label values; and (2) the experimental results for the other essential elements were in good agreement. The essential element contribution of base materials was investigated, though the results were inconclusive. Dietary supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins were analysed for <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate,</b> ergocalciferol (D 2), cholecalciferol (D 3), tocopherol (E), tocopherol acetate and phylloquinone (K 1) using a modified simultaneous high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method.

An in vitro study into the bioavailability of iron and zinc in yeast-based supplements was accomplished.

Linolenic acid {{was found to}} be the main fatty acid in both species, which was followed by palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), stearic acid (C 18 : 0), oleic acid (C 18 : 1 n 9), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 n 6) and stearidonic acid (C 18 : 4). In addition, the two Origanum species were recorded as containing high levels of stigmasterol. It was also found that Origanum vulgare L. subsp. gracile (C. Koch) Ietswaart had a high β-sitosterol content (152. 8 ± 2. 6 µg/g); high amounts of D 3 (33. 1 ± 0. 8 µg/g), K 1 (29. 4 ± 0. 8 µg/g), K 2 (26. 0 ± 0. 8 µg/g) vitamins; and low amounts of α-tocopherol (7. 8 ± 0. 2 µg/g) and D 2 (1. 8 ± 0. 1 µg/g), while Origanum acutidens (Hand. -Mazz.) Ietswaart contained high amounts of D 2 (42. 9 ± 1. 5 µg/g) vitamin; and low amounts of D 3 (2. 9 ± 0. 1 µg/g), α-tocopherol (3. 1 ± 0. 1 µg/g), r-tocopherol (3. 5 ± 0. 2 µg/g), K 2 (1. 3 ± 0. 1 µg/g), retinol (1. 3 ± 0. 2 µg/g) and <b>retinol</b> <b>acetate</b> (1. 2 ± 0. 1 µg/g) vitamins. The present study showed that Origanum vulgare L. subsp. gracile (C. Koch) Ietswaart and Origanum acutidens (Hand. -Mazz.) Ietswaart contained the lowest amount of flavonoid. Furthermore, methanol extracts were recorded to be the most effective agent against the DPPH radical in both Origanum L. species examined. Experimental results showed that the vitamins, flavonoids and fatty acid extracts of both Origanum L. species were effective in the inhibition of the growth of the tested microorganisms at varying levels.

El ácido linolénico (C 18 : 3) mostró ser el principal ácido graso en ambas especies, seguido por los ácidos palmítico (C 16 : 0), esteárico (C 18 : 0), oleico (C 18 : 1 n 9), linoleico (C 18 : 2 n 6) y estearidónico (C 18 : 4). Además, las dos especies de orégano mostraron contener altos niveles de estigmasterol. También se constató que Origanum vulgare L. subsp. gracile (C.
