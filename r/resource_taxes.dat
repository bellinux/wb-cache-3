40|$|Natural {{resources}} are typically subject both to taxation under {{the income tax}} system and to special <b>resource</b> <b>taxes.</b> Properly designed income taxes attempt to include capital income on a uniform basis. But in most countries the income tax treats resource industries more favorably than most other industries - through favorable treatment of such capital expenses as depletion, exploration and development, {{and the cost of}} acquiring resource properties. The case for special <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> is precisely to tax resource rents over and above the levies implicit in general income taxes. There are two justifications for this: (a) the efficiency-based argument that a tax on resource rents is nondistorting and complementary; and (b) the equity argument that the property rights to resources ought to accrue to the public at large rather than to private citizens since the rents represent the bounty nature has bestowed on the economy rather than a reward for economic effort. If the main purpose of a resource tax is to capture rents for the public sector, the base of <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> should be economic rents (or their present value equivalent), contend the authors. Actual <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> differ from rent taxes in significant ways. Unlike a general income tax - which allows the resource industries to understate capital income - <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> often overstate rents. This is because they typically do not offer full deductions for all costs, especially capital costs. Some systems tax revenues without allowing any deductions for costs; others allow the deduction of current costs only. As a result, they discourage investment activity in resource industries, encourage the exploitation of high-grade relative to low-grade resources, and make it difficult to impose high tax rates for fear of making the marginal tax rate higher than 100 percent. The authors discuss three alternative ideal ways for the government to divert a share of rents to the public sector: levy a tax on rents, ideally {{in the form of a}} cash flow tax; require firms to bid for the rights to exploit resources; and take a share of equity in the firm. They discuss these options in terms of their implications for the ability of firms to obtain finance, the allocation of risk, the share of rents accruing to the public sector, the extent of involvement of foreign firms, and other factors. The time has come in many countries, they say, when gains from further refinement of imperfect existing taxes on {{resources are}} less than replacing them with simpler, more efficient forms of pure rent taxes.

Us-ing a two country optimal growth model integrating both a non-renewable resource and pollution we characterize the optimal policies and study their implications. First, we analyze the distributional implications of different policies which crucially depend on the interaction of taxes and permits. We then look at the case where nationally different taxes on resource con-sumption are in place and study the optimal pollution permit system. The results suggest that a global permit trading scheme is not optimal in the presence of highly varying national <b>resource</b> <b>taxes.</b> While an international permit trading system (like the International Emissions Trading (IET) in-cluded in the Kyoto protocol) makes perfectly sense for a region with more homogenized taxes like in Europe, it leads to a distortion when it includes countries with very different resource (e. g., fuel) taxes. ∗Master’s Thesis Presented for the ECOMATH Programm...|$|E

40|$|The "green paradox" by Hans-Werner Sinn {{suggests}} that increasing <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> accelerate global warming because resource owners increase near-term extraction {{in fear of}} higher future taxation. In this note we show that this effect does only occur for the specific set of carbon taxes that increase at a rate higher than the effective discount rate of the resource owners. We calculate a critical initial value for the carbon tax {{that leads to a}} decreased cumulative consumption over the entire (infinite) time horizon. Applying our formal findings to carbon taxes for several mitigation targets, we conclude that there is a low risk of a green paradox in case the regulator implements and commits to a permanently mal-adjusted tax. This remaining risk can be avoided by emissions trading scheme as suggested by Sinn [...] as long as the emission caps are set appropriately and the intertemporal permit market works correctly.

One particular global environmental problem, i. e., climatic change, could eventually lead to shifts in agricultural and forestry growing zones, changes in freshwater supply and a rise in sea level, and eventually to migration and "environmental refugees". This could further result in civil unrest, political instability, militarism, and terrorism which could pose as large a threat to world security as the ideological struggle from which we appear to be emerging. The trace gases leading to climatic change, especially carbon dioxide and methane, are closely linked with the production of energy.

Assuming uncoordinated maximization of domestic welfare, national governments wish to deviate (i) from inefficient laissez-faire equilibria as well as (ii) from efficient equilibria in which domestic distortions are internalized. The incentive of resource-rich countries to subsidize hinges on slower productivity growth and is disconnected from the typical incentive of importers to tax resource inflows. i. e., rent extraction.

40|$|We present {{conceptual}} and empirical insights {{on the issue}} of resource taxation, an intrinsic regional environmental policy. It deals with the implementation of environmental taxes and environmental planning at regional level, as tools aimed at achieving weak sustainability for non renewable resources like aggregates, extracted for a diverse set of economic aims. We frame the discussion in the spirit of refreshing the need of ecological and resource tax reforms at national and regional level-. We do note and discuss the intrinsic peculiarities of <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> with respect to emission taxes, namely the integration with regional planning, the use of revenue for weak sustainability objectives, the different role by played technology and efficiency. Factors that are {{to be taken into account}} in any specific implementation. We empirically investigate resource taxation issues by focusing on aggregate extraction management and policy of two large Northern Italian regions, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. We conclude that the possible effects of extraction charges for the aggregate market development in Italy can be very limited. The level of charges is generally too low to be expected to have an effect on demand (through aggregate prices) and supply of aggregates. The environmental objectives of planning are, at least for the moment, other than reducing extraction, and they generally consist of minimising external impacts, to support sustainable management of landscapes, and to provide multi-value public goods within the local area. The evidence shows that even more for <b>resource</b> <b>taxes</b> a political economy analysis that encompasses institutional and planning issues is needed to effectively shape environmental policies. The complementarity of land use planning and economic instruments is a key driver of sustainability performances and witness reciprocal influences. The unintended effects of economic instruments are also a crucial thing for evaluating effectiveness and efficiency. Those include positive effects of ‘institutional kind’ on the governance and organizational performance of the integrated policy-planning framework.
