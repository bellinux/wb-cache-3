5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their <b>rear</b> <b>legs.</b> Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{during the}} tadpole stage, {{one of the}} {{developing}} <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E
5000|$|Dancing Doberman disease {{primarily}} affects the gastrocnemius muscle in Dobermans. It usually starts {{between the ages}} of 6 and 7 months. [...] One <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> will flex while standing. Over the next few months, it will begin to affect the other <b>rear</b> <b>leg.</b> Eventually, the dog is alternatively flexing and extending each <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> in a dancing motion. Dancing Doberman disease progresses over a few years to <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> weakness and muscle atrophy. No treatment is known, but most dogs retain the ability to walk and it is painless.|$|R
50|$|The backstool {{represents}} an intermediate step between {{the development of}} the stool and the chair. A simple three-legged turned stool would have its <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> extended outwards and a crossways pad attached. Backstools were always three-legged, with a central <b>rear</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R
50|$|In application, it is popularly {{used for}} attacking. The {{structure}} of the stance partially protects the groin and allows the martial artist to punch with greater power by driving the <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> into the ground. Additionally, the <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> can be quickly drawn forward for kicking attacks.|$|R
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>legs.</b> Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a {{condition}} where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and {{at the base of}} the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and <b>rear</b> <b>legs.</b> Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is no genetic test for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
25|$|Dancing Dobermann {{disease is}} a type of {{myopathy}} that primarily affects the gastrocnemius muscle in Dobermanns. It usually starts between the ages of 6 to 7 months. One <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> will flex while standing. Over the next few months it will begin to affect the other <b>rear</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the <b>rear</b> <b>legs.</b> Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E
5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

50|$|In {{mountaineering}} and hiking, {{the rest}} step {{is a human}} walking gait used in ascending steep slopes. Its essential characteristic is a pause of motion with the <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> vertical and fully extended, while the front leg is relaxed except as needed to adjust the balancing of the climber's body and burden on the <b>rear</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a pipe crawler having a midsection that provides the stability and flexibility to allow the pipe crawler to negotiate curved and uneven segments of piping while traveling through piping systems. The pipe crawler comprises a front <b>leg</b> assembly, a <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> assembly, a midsection with a gimbal at each end for connecting the midsection {{to the front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> assemblies in a flexible manner, and an air cylinder for changing the distance between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> assemblies. The pipe crawler moves in ``inch worm`` fashion with the front and <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> assemblies alternating between an extended and a retracted position as the air cylinder moves the retracted leg assembly forward. The midsection has a plurality of legs extending radially for holding the midsection within a maximum displacement from the piping axis so that the gimbals are not pivoted to extreme angles where they might lock up or seize. When the midsection is displaced sufficiently, its legs with wheels on each end engage the interior surface of the piping and prevent further displacement. Using two gimbals divides the angle between the planes defined by the front and <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> assemblies which also helps to prevent excessive gimbal pivoting...|$|R
25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is a heritable condition {{where the}} femur {{does not fit}} securely in the pelvic socket of the hip joint. This problem can exist with or without clinical signs, meaning some dogs feel pain in one or both <b>rear</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{figure of}} Centaurus {{can be traced}} back to a Babylonian {{constellation}} known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM). This being was depicted in two major forms: firstly, as a 4-legged bison with a human head, and secondly, as a being with a man's head and torso attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> and tail of a bull or bison. It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.|$|E
25|$|A dog may misuse its <b>rear</b> <b>legs,</b> or adapt its gait, to {{compensate}} for pain in the forelimbs, notably osteoarthritis, osteochondritis (OCD) or shoulder or elbow dysplasia, as well as pain in the hocks and stifles or spinal issues. It is important to rule out other joint and bodily issues before concluding that only hip dysplasia is present. Even if some hip dysplasia is present, {{it is possible for}} other conditions to co-exist or be masked by it.|$|E

25|$|Boots {{and wraps}} are worn by almost all horses, {{due to the}} fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide {{protection}} for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the <b>rear</b> <b>legs,</b> primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.|$|E
25|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of a gold shield with a lion standing on its <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> and silverplated nails grasping a silver coiled parchment between its front claws. The lion also shows a red tongue. Above the lion in the superior part of the shield are located three heraldic roses arranged horizontally with red petals and green leaves. A golden crown of three towers rests on the shield. The three towers are united by walls, simulating masonry blocks. The shield {{is surrounded by a}} crown of coffee tree branches with their berries, all in natural colors.|$|E
25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the <b>rear</b> <b>legs,</b> which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E

50|$|If {{the kick}} is being thrown from the <b>rear</b> <b>leg,</b> {{another option is}} available. The <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> lifts with the knee bent and {{pointing}} to the side, and the entire body rotates as the knee swings {{around to the front}} (picture swinging one's leg over to mount a bicycle). The rotation of the body and lateral movement of the leg add to the momentum of the lower leg, which moves in and out the same as above.|$|R

25|$|Dogs might exhibit {{signs of}} {{stiffness}} or soreness after rising from rest, reluctance to exercise, bunny-hopping or other abnormal gait (legs move more together when running rather than swinging alternately), lameness, pain, reluctance {{to stand on}} <b>rear</b> <b>legs,</b> jump up, or climb stairs, subluxation or dislocation of the hip joint, or wasting away of the muscle mass in the hip area. Radiographs (X-rays) often confirm the presence of hip dysplasia, but radiographic features may not be present until two years of age in some dogs. Moreover, many affected dogs do not show clinical signs, but some dogs manifest the problem before seven months of age, while others do not show it until well into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The Keladi Nayakas (period: 1499 – 1763) built {{some fine}} temples in Ikkeri and Keladi using a {{combination}} of late Kadamba, Hoysala, Vijayanagara and Dravida styles. The use of granite for their construction shows that they simply followed the Vijayanagar model of architecture. The Aghoreshwara Temple at Ikkeri and the Rameshwara Temple at Keladi are the best examples of the Nayakas' art. Vijayanagar-style pillars with hippogryphs are common; called yali columns (depiction of horses and lions as seen in Hampi) is found here. These are pillars with lions, either with their forepaws raised or simply in a sitting position, and pillars with a mythical horse-like animal with front legs raised, balancing on its <b>rear</b> <b>legs,</b> and with an armed rider on its back. A roof sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda (see image in infobox), the mythical two-headed bird of Karnataka, symbol of the state, is found in Keladi.|$|E
25|$|The playfield is a {{planar surface}} {{inclined}} upward {{from three to}} seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the <b>rear</b> <b>legs</b> and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble {{down the center of the}} playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{calculate}} the kinematics and kinetics of the <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> drive in fast bowling, and then investigate whether any of these variables are associated ball release speed. Eighteen young fast bowlers (17. 2 ± 1. 7 years) were recruited from the Cricket NSW development squad, and their bowling actions captured by a Cortex 2. 0 motion analysis system. The data shows that <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> drive primarily consisted of hip and knee motions in the flexion-extension plane, subject to a complex control strategy involving time-varying torques. The most prominent kinematic feature was rear knee extension velocity (r= 0. 55, p= 0. 019), which was moderately correlated with ball speed. However, more research is needed to evaluate the control of this variable, since none of the <b>rear</b> <b>leg</b> joint torques was correlated with rear knee extension velocity...|$|R
