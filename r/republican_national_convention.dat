5|$|Harding, as a {{politician}} respected by both Republicans and Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Convention</b> and to deliver the keynote address.

5|$|Long was {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Convention,</b> and was a personal favorite of McKinley's for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E
5|$|McKinley's {{original}} vice president, Garret Hobart, {{had died}} in 1899, and McKinley left {{the choice of a}} running mate to the 1900 <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> <b>Convention.</b> In advance of the convention, New York's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C.

Lincoln's success depended on {{his reputation as a}} moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.|$|E
