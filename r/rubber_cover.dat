5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with <b>rubber</b> <b>cover.</b> Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E
25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or <b>rubber)</b> <b>cover,</b> or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the flush valve seat) by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user pushes a lever, which lifts the flush valve from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|E
500|$|Band Hero {{was also}} ported to the Nintendo DS by Vicarious Visions, {{expanding}} the play to include vocals (through the DS microphone) and drumming. The drumming uses a special [...] "drum skin" [...] adapter {{designed for the}} Nintendo DS Lite to map the unit's face buttons to four drum pads. However, the peripheral is not compatible with the original Nintendo DS model or the Nintendo DSi. However, since the drum skin is not electronic but a <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> switch that duplicates certain buttons on the DS Lite, a player can simply press the buttons in time to play the drums. The game includes four-player local wireless play {{in a similar manner}} as Guitar Hero 5 allowing any combination of instruments to be used. The game has a set of 30 songs; some are from Band Hero and others are from several Guitar Hero games' set lists.|$|E
40|$|We wish to {{estimate}} the pressure distribution on the <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller from the experimental curve using the same apparatus {{as described in the}} paper I in the range of surface speed 39 - 360 cm/sec and roller weights 8. 2 - 36. 3 kg. 　We assume pressure distribution curve to be quadratic, sine and cubic curves on <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller and then calculate the out-put voltage from the block diagram of this apparatus. 　From the comparing of the result of experimental curve with calculated one, we assure three phenomena. 　(1) When the softer <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller rotates at the low speed under the high pressure, the pressure distribution curve becomes a quadratic one. 　(2) When the soft <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller rotates at the low speed, it becomes a sine one. 　(3) When the <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> roller rotates at the high speed, it transferes to the asymmetric distribution from a symmetric one...|$|R

50|$|A ceiling-mounted {{light fixture}} was {{installed}} in each room, usually controlled by a single switch mounted near a door. At most, one outlet was installed per room, since plug-connected appliances were expensive and uncommon. Wiring was performed using type NM (nonmetallic sheathed cable), insulated with asbestos-reinforced <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> with jute and tar.|$|R
60|$|Job Haskers nodded, to {{show that}} he understood, and both of the intruders tiptoed their way towards the stores. Noiselessly they raised the <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> {{and placed it on the}} ground. Then both {{commenced}} to pack the stores in the cloth.|$|E
60|$|Farrar {{took the}} helm and hauled in the sheet, while the Celebrity, Mr. Cooke, and the guests donned their rain-clothes. The water ahead was now like blue velvet, {{and the rain}} pelting. The Maria was heeling to the squall {{by the time the}} Celebrity {{appeared}} at the cabin door, enveloped in an ample waterproof, a <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> on his yachting cap. A fool despises a danger he has never experienced, and our author, with a remark about a spanking breeze, made a motion to take the wheel. But Farrar, the flannel of his shirt clinging to the muscular outline of his shoulders, gave him a push which sent him sprawling against the lee refrigerator. Well Miss Thorn was not there to see.|$|E

5000|$|To meet US safety {{regulations}} for the 1968 model year, the MGB received a plastic and foam <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> [...] "safety" [...] dashboard, dubbed the [...] "Abingdon pillow", and dual circuit brakes. Other markets continued with the steel dashboard. Rubery Owen RoStyle wheels {{were introduced to}} replace the previous pressed steel versions in 1969 and reclining seats were standardized.|$|R
50|$|The F-1s {{eyepiece}} was threaded {{and could}} take a metal (later soft <b>rubber</b> <b>covered)</b> ring, an eyecup or several different diopter adjustment lenses. Th Magnifier R and Angle Finders A2 and B could also be attached to allow critical focusing and / or waist-level use (if one {{did not want to}} fit either the Speed Finder or Waist Level Finder).|$|R
50|$|Most direct-buried {{cable is}} built to {{specific}} tolerances to heat, moisture, conductivity, and soil acidity. Unlike standard telecommunications and power cables, which {{have only a}} thin layer of insulation and a waterproof outer cover, DBC consists of multiple layers of heavy metallic-banded sheathing, reinforced by heavy <b>rubber</b> <b>covers,</b> shock absorbing gel, wrapped thread-fortified waterproof tape, and stiffened by a heavy metal core.|$|R

50|$|Krabi's {{farmland}} {{is dominated}} by a duopoly of rubber and palm oil plantations. Palm plantations alone occupy 980,000 rai (1,568 km2), or 52 percent of the province's farmland. Together, palm oil and <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> 95 percent of Krabi's cultivated area with many smallholder farms amidst industrial plantations.|$|E
5000|$|Its motard variant, {{introduced}} and discontinued in 2009, due its price being 10% {{higher than the}} Lander. It was identical to the Lander, save for minor details. It had plastic front fork suspension protectors instead of full <b>rubber</b> <b>covers,</b> 17" [...] front and rear wheels, thicker sport tires, taller front fender and few other design changes. The available colors were black and orange.|$|R
25|$|Firing {{tests showed}} that the M14, when {{equipped}} with the selector switch, hinged buttplate and bipod, performed {{as well as the}} M15. As a result, the M15 was dropped and the modified M14 became the squad automatic weapon. Accuracy and control problems with this variant led to the addition of a pistol grip, a folding <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> metal foregrip and a muzzle stabilizer. However, it was a poor suppressive fire weapon owing to 20-round magazines and it overheated rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} film, Chaney did not undergo an on-screen transformation from man to wolf, as featured in all sequels. The lap-dissolve progressive make-ups were seen {{only in the}} final ten minutes, and then discreetly: Talbot removes his shoes and socks, and it is his feet which are seen to grow hairy and transform into huge paws (courtesy of uncomfortable [...] "boots" [...] made of hard <b>rubber,</b> <b>covered</b> in yak hair). In the final scene, the werewolf does gradually become Larry Talbot through the standard technique.|$|R

50|$|The Type 4 grenade had a {{fragmentation}} body made of {{terra cotta}} or porcelain materials. The grenade was round-shaped {{with a bottle}} neck with a <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> and a simple fuse. This detonator {{was no more than}} a blasting cap crimped on to a five-second length of fuse. The other end of the fuse, which was outside the rubber plug, was covered with a match-head composition. A slip-on rubber cap covered the whole neck, and fuse. A small, loose wooden block with an abrasive composition on one side was contained in the rubber fuse cover.|$|E
50|$|The PMA-3 is a Yugoslavian blast {{resistant}} minimum metal anti-personnel mine. It is circular, {{consisting of a}} plastic upper and lower half joined together by a <b>rubber</b> <b>cover.</b> A safety collar is normally wrapped around {{the outside of the}} mine, preventing the upper half of the mine tilting when in transit. Once deployed the safety collar is removed. Sufficient pressure on the top surface of the mine causes it to tilt. The tilting drives a pin through a friction sensitive pyrotechnic compound, which fires the detonator and then the main explosive charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{footwear}} {{can change the}} impact of prolonged standing. Shoes should support the foot, have shock-absorbing cushions, fit the foot well, and be comfortable. Shoes should not be flat, have heels higher than 5 cm, or change {{the shape of the}} foot. There are also special insoles for shoes that can be used when soft mats or chairs are not available. Additionally the floors in a work area should not be metal or concrete. It is best to have cork or <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> floors. Floors should not be slippery.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{process of}} {{extrusion}} coating involves extruding resin from a slot die at temperatures up to 320°C {{directly onto the}} moving web which may then passed through a nip consisting of a <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> pressure roller and a chrome plated cooling roll. The latter cools the molten film back into the solid state and also imparts the desired finish to the plastic surface. The web is normally run much faster than {{the speed at which}} the resin is extruded from the die, creating a coating thickness which is in proportion to the speed ratio and the slot gap.|$|R

5000|$|The PM-79 is a small, {{circular}} Bulgarian blast-resistant anti-personnel mine, superficially {{similar to}} the Russian PMN. The mine uses a unique trigger design; {{on the top of}} the mine, beneath a thin <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> is a dish shaped pressure plate. Pressure on the outer rim of the dish shaped plate levers up a central post, which triggers the mine. The mine also incorporates a mechanical arming delay using a pin cutting through a thin lead strip. The mine arms in between two minutes and four hours depending on the temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{units were}} made in a simple stamped sheet metal box, painted grey, with a blue Univox sticker on the top. Around 1970 {{production}} was changed to a die-cast metal box, with a large pedal featuring a <b>rubber</b> <b>cover</b> that had the words [...] "Super-Fuzz" [...] embossed on it. The first die cast units were either grey or black, with a green or black foot pedal. Around 1973 or so, they were all produced with an orange pedal, with a green or blue foot pedal. The later models also featured an internal trim pot for controlling the octave balance.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Ampeg {{was bought by}} MTI in Japan, and the SVT was {{produced}} there. Functionally identical, its primary cosmetic differences consisting of: white lettering on a black faceplate, black grill cloth, [...] "elephant hide" [...] or rougher textured tolex, and rack case-style spring-loaded handles, updated from the previous (and painful) <b>rubber</b> <b>covered</b> metal strap handles. Other notable differences of this era of SVT are found on the back panel, including a toggle switch for 2 or 4 ohm speaker impedance loads and a longer and thicker gauge 3-prong power cable. Apparently the transformers used are also of Japanese origin {{as opposed to the}} previous manufacturer in Chicago.|$|R
