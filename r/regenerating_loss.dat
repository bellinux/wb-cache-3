40|$|Abstract—In {{distributed}} storage systems, {{a substantial}} {{volume of data}} are stored in a distributed fashion, across {{a large number of}} storage nodes. To maintain data integrity, when existing storage nodes fail, lost data are regenerated at replacement nodes. <b>Regenerating</b> multiple data <b>losses</b> in batches can reduce the consumption of bandwidth. However, existing schemes are only able to achieve lower bandwidth consumption by utilizing a large number of participating nodes. In this paper, we propose a cooperative pipelined regeneration process that <b>regenerates</b> multiple data <b>losses</b> cooperatively with much fewer participating nodes. We show that cooperative pipelined regeneration is not only able to maintain optimal data integrity, but also able to further reduce the consumption of bandwidth as well. I...|$|R

The adsorption equilibria of Cu, Pb and Cd could be represented by Langmuir isotherms and the capacity of fresh alga for Cu, Pb and Cd was approximately 85 - 94, 227 - 243 and 83. 5 mg/g dry alga, respectively. The rate of adsorption onto the marine alga was high. The alga particle size {{played an important role}} in the adsorption behaviour. The coarse alga particles had a higher adsorption capacity and slower adsorption kinetics and could be <b>regenerated</b> without significant <b>loss</b> of capacity. In contrast, the fine alga particles had a lower adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics and could not be <b>regenerated</b> without significant <b>loss</b> of capacity.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that bleeding activates the hematopoietic system to <b>regenerate</b> the <b>loss</b> of mature blood elements. We have shown that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from animals challenged with an acute bleed regulate osteoblast differentiation from marrow stromal cells. This suggests that HSCs participate in bone formation where the molecular basis for this activity is the production of BMP 2 and BMP 6 by HSCs. Yet, what stimulates HSCs to produce BMPs is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that erythropoietin (Epo) activates Jak-Stat signaling pathways in HSCs {{which leads to the}} production of BMPs. Critically, Epo also directly activates mesenchymal cells to form osteoblasts in vitro, which in vivo leads to bone formation. Importantly, Epo first activates osteoclastogenesis which is later followed by osteoblastogenesis that is induced by either Epo directly or the expression of BMPs by HSCs to form bone. These data for the first time demonstrate that Epo regulates the formation of bone by both direct and indirect pathways, and further demonstrates the exquisite coupling between hematopoiesis and osteopoiesis in the marrow...|$|R

Despite substantial improvements in acute management, survivors of myocardial infarction often progress to heart failure. Since adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) do not <b>regenerate,</b> their <b>loss</b> permanently compromises myocardial contractile function. Heart transplantation is currently the last resort for end-stage heart failure, but is hampered by a severe shortage of donor organs and rejection. Cell-based therapies are a promising alternative: Various cell types such as human fetal CMs, skeletal muscle myoblasts and smooth muscle cells have been tested but these approaches are also limited by cell availability or side effects (e. g. due to their non-cardiac identity). In recent years, clinical studies exploiting adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for transplantation in patients with coronary artery disease have reported favorable outcomes but their cardiomyogenic ability is limited. By contrast, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst-stage embryos, are pluripotent and can self-renew and differentiate into all cell types including CMs. Furthermore, hESC-derived CMs (hESC-CMs) are viable human heart cells that can functionally integrate with the recipient organ after transplantation.

Therefore, {{early detection of}} the onset and the active periods of bone loss are crucial for prevention of extensive peri-implant bone resorption. This study aimed to determine a possible association between the presence of collagenases (MMP- 1, MMP- 8 and MMP- 13) in peri-implant sulcular fluid (PISF) and active periods of bone loss by annually adjusted vertical bone loss (AVBL) measurements. MethodsIntended sample consisted of 76 consecutive patients who received oral implant treatment at the Fixed Prosthodontic Clinic of Okayama University Hospital from 1990 to 2000. Twelve subjects were lost to follow-up or refused to participate. Consequently, the actual sample consisted of 64 patients who were followed-up {{for at least one}} year. Those patients with AVBL> 0. 6 mm were included in the severe peri-implantitis group, and randomly selected, age-, gender- and implantation site-matched healthy patients (AVBL< 0. 3 mm) comprised the control group. PISF samples were collected from both groups and further analyzed by western blot for detection of collagenases. ResultsFour patients presented severe peri-implantitis. MMP- 8 was the only collagenase detected in peri-implant sites with ongoing bone loss. PISF samples from control group showed no positive reactions to any collagenase. ConclusionThis study showed MMP- 8 as a possible marker for progressive bone loss in peri-implantitis...|$|R

As astronauts lose bone mass and strength during their mission due to microgravity and the resulting lack of exercise, it is especially important for the bones to be able to <b>regenerate</b> these <b>losses.</b> In this study it was evaluated if increased radiation has an influence on osteoblast commitment capabilities of bone maintaining stem cells. To do so, human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells were isolated out of lipoaspirate, induced towards the osteogenic lineage and exposed to X-rays of 2 Gy and 4 Gy. It was found that X-rays at this dose do not act as an unspecific trigger for osteogenic differentiation. A quantitative analysis of calcium depositions during osteogenesis showed that early disturbance of the differentiation process by X-rays caused a delay or even an impairment of osteoblast commitment in vitro. On the other hand, no significant differences in osteoblast commitment during four weeks of differentiation were found when the cells were exposed after week two of induction. This suggests an effect of ionizing radiation only in early osteogenesis...|$|R

Mesoporous SSZ- 13 zeolites can be synthesized in one step by combining TMAdOH and the diquaternary ammonium-type surfactant C 22 - 4 - 4 Br 2.

Hierarchical SSZ- 13 zeolites display increased lifetime in packed-bed MTO experiments than conventional SSZ- 13 at similar light olefins yield.

Apoptosis of cochlear cells {{is an important factor}} in animal models of ARHI. As these cells cannot <b>regenerate,</b> their <b>loss</b> leads to irreversible {{hearing impairment}}. Identification of molecular mechanisms can facilitate disease prevention and effective treatment. In this study, we compared the expression of the genes BAK 1 and BCL 2 as two arms of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway between patients with ARHI and healthy subjects. ARHI and healthy subjects were selected after an ear nose throat examination, otoscopic investigation, and pure tone audiometry. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples, and relative gene expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. BAK 1 and the BAK 1 /BCL 2 ratio were statistically significantly upregulated in the ARHI subjects. The BAK 1 /BCL 2 ratio was positively correlated with the results of the audiometric tests. Our results indicate that BAK-mediated apoptosis may be a core mechanism in the progression of ARHI in humans, similar to finding in animal models. Moreover, the gene expression changes in peripheral blood samples could be used as a rapid and simple biomarker for early detection of ARHI.

40|$|Deafness {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} diffused disabilities because of increasing people age and environmental noise levels. Hearing damage caused by age, noise or ototoxic drugs is generally irreversible since cochlear neurons and hair cells are not able to <b>regenerate.</b> Noise-induced hearing <b>loss</b> and ototoxic drugs are significant sources of hearing impairment among humans. The causing mechanisms can be attributed to: direct mechanical damage and damage caused by metabolic stress, mediated by an increased of the oxidative metabolism in the inner ear. It has already been observed that routine blood pressure values recorded in young adult patients complaining of sudden sensorineural hearing loss have been significantly lower when compared with those of an age-matched control group, thus indicating a possible role of hypothension in the genesis of inner ear disorders. For the study of sudden hearing loss, in literature are available several in vivo protocols for deafening noise and ototoxic drugs and few in vitro for hipoxic damage. This research aims to develop in rat model, the techniques to induce damages to inner ear following ischemic events like hypoxia, deafening noise or cisplatin toxicity, and to investigate in deep the amount of damage.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} liver <b>regenerates</b> upon tissue <b>loss,</b> which induces quiescent hepatocytes {{to enter}} the cell cycle and undergo limited replication {{under the control of}} multiple hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Endocannabinoids acting via cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB 1 R) promote neural progenitor cell proliferation, and in the liver they promote lipogenesis. These findings suggest the involvement of CB 1 R in the control of liver regeneration. Here we report that mice lacking CB 1 R globally or in hepatocytes only and wild-type mice treated with a CB 1 R antagonist have a delayed proliferative response to two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PHX). In wild-type mice, PHX leads to increased hepatic expression of CB 1 R and hyperactivation of the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the liver via an in vivo pathway involving conjugation of arachidonic acid and ethanolamine by fatty-acid amide hydrolase. In wild-type but not CB 1 R−/− mice, PHX induces robust up-regulation of key cell-cycle proteins involved in mitotic progression, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk 1), cyclin B 2, and their transcriptional regulator forkhead box protein M 1 (FoxM 1), as revealed by ultrahigh-throughput RNA sequencing and pathway analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Treatment of wild-type mice with anandamide induces similar changes mediated via activation of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway.

40|$|Auditory {{hair cells}} of birds, unlike hair {{cells in the}} {{mammalian}} organ of Corti, can <b>regenerate</b> following sound-induced <b>loss.</b> We have identified several genes that are upregulated following such an insult. One gene, WDR 1, encodes the vertebrate homologue of actin-interacting protein 1, which interacts with actin depolymerization factor (ADF) to enhance the rate of actin filament cleavage. We examined WDR 1 expression in the developing, mature, and noise-damaged chick cochlea by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. In the mature cochlea, WDR 1 mRNA was detected in hair cells, homogene cells, and cuboidal cells, all of which contain high levels of F-actin. In the developing inner ear, WDR 1 mRNA was detected in homogene cells and cuboidal cells by embryonic day 7, in the undifferentiated sensory epithelium by day 9, and in hair cells at embryonic day 16. We also demonstrated colocalization of WDR 1, ADF, and F-actin in all three cell types in the normal and noise-damaged cochlea. Immediately after acoustic overstimulation, WDR 1 mRNA was seen in supporting cells. These cells contribute to the structural integrity of the basilar papilla, {{the maintenance of the}} ionic barrier at the reticular lamina, and the generation of new hair cells. These results indicate that one of the immediate responses of the supporting cell after noise exposure is to induce WDR 1 gene expression and thus to increase the rate of actin filament turnover. These results suggest that WDR 1 may play a role either in restoring cytoskeletal integrity in supporting cells or in a cell signaling pathway required for regeneration. J. Comp.

In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, M.D., revealed extensive injury. The brain itself weighed only , only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal neurons that comprise some 70% of cortical cells – critical to the functioning of the cortex – were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen {{from the front of the}} cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) – another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS.

However the causal relationship between these shifts in protein expression and cortical plasticity remains unclear. The mouse visual system would be a powerful animal model to study developmental or injury-induced brain plasticity, since there is a vast array of commercially available knock-out mice, which could help elucidating this causal relationship between molecular expression patterns and neocortical plasticity. Since little is known about its visual system in comparison to higher mammals, we initiated a series of investigations on mouse visual cortex (Van der Gucht et al., 2007, Van Brussel et al, in progress). We managed to establish the exact boundaries of the visually driven cortical region by in situ hybridisation analysis of immediate early gene expression (zif 268) in binocularly enucleated mice and identified within this region several visual areas with a monocular zone, proving that in mouse also higher visual areas like V 2 M are partly monocularly driven. In this study we investigated the effect of monocular enucleation on mouse visual cortex through in situ hybridisation for zif 268 and arc, two excellent neuronal activity markers. Analysis of the activity patterns at different survival times provided us with a precise timeline in which cortical reorganisation occurs in mouse. Together these data provide an excellent basis for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of cortical plasticity in the mouse visual system. status: submitte...|$|R
5000|$|After her death, Schiavo's {{body was}} taken to the Office of the District 6 Medical Examiner for Pinellas and Pasco counties, based in Largo, Florida. The autopsy {{occurred}} on April 1, 2005. It revealed extensive brain damage. The manner of death was certified as [...] "undetermined". The autopsy was led by Chief Medical Examiner Jon R. Thogmartin, M.D. In addition to consultation with a neuropathologist (Stephen J. Nelson, M.D.), Dr. Thogmartin also arranged for specialized cardiac and genetic examinations to be made. The official autopsy report was released on June 15, 2005. In addition to studying Terri Schiavo's remains, Thogmartin scoured court, medical and other records and interviewed her family members, doctors and other relevant parties. Examination of Schiavo's nervous system by neuropathologist Stephen J. Nelson, M.D., revealed extensive injury. The brain itself weighed only 615 g, only half the weight expected for a female of her age, height, and weight, an effect caused by the loss of a massive number of neurons. Microscopic examination revealed extensive damage to nearly all brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the midbrain. The neuropathologic changes in her brain were precisely of the type seen in patients who enter a PVS following cardiac arrest. Throughout the cerebral cortex, the large pyramidal neurons that comprise some 70% of cortical cells - critical to the functioning of the cortex - were completely lost. The pattern of damage to the cortex, with injury tending to worsen {{from the front of the}} cortex to the back, was also typical. There was marked damage to important relay circuits deep in the brain (the thalamus) - another common pathologic finding in cases of PVS. The damage was, in the words of Thogmartin, [...] "irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have <b>regenerated</b> the massive <b>loss</b> of neurons." ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. Sensorineural hearing {{impairment}} {{is a consequence}} of hair cells (HC) and/or spiral ganglion neurons loss. In mammals, HCs are unable to <b>regenerate,</b> so their <b>loss</b> cause irreversible damages. For this reason {{it is very important to}} study the mechanisms to stimulate cochlear tissues regeneration with stem cells. Moreover it is necessary to choose the correct animal model. The NOD-SCID is a mouse with hampered immune system useful for stem cells transplantation, but there are no information about its auditory capacity. The aim of the project is to characterize the functionality and the morphology of the NOD-SCID inner ear because it derives from NOD mouse which presents a progressive hearing loss. METHODS. Animal models: 4 - 8 - 12 week-old CBA/J (non hearing-impaired), NOD (hearing-impaired) and NOD-SCID. Investigations: electrophysiology (ABR), histology of cochlea, spleen and tongue. All tissues were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and the sections were Hematoxylin-Eosin stained. The cochleae were cut into ten series of slides with sequential sections (thick 5 um), for each section we evaluated inner and outer hair cells number, neuronal density, stria vascularis (SV) area and spiral ligament (SL) area. The percentage of fungiform and filiform papillae was counted along the superficial side of the tongue sections (1). The morphological changes of red and white pulp of the spleen were studied. All data were analyzed with ANOVA Bonferroni’s test. RESULTS. NOD-SCID mice show a progressive {{hearing impairment}} at high frequencies from 4 to 12 weeks. The deafness appears to be associated with hair cells loss in the medium/basal region of the cochlea, likely as a consequence of SV and SL morphological and functional alterations. The histological study of NOD-SCID tongue demonstrates abnormalities in the organ development and an erythroid cells accumulation is observed in the spleen red pulp. CONCLUSIONS. Deafness of NOD-SCID mice could be due to premature aging, or could be a consequence of physiological/metabolic alterations that interfere with Organ of Corti functionality causing hair cells death...|$|R
40|$|A {{principal}} {{cause of}} {{sensorineural hearing loss}} is injury to or loss of cochlear hair cells, which are critical components of sound transduction. These auditory hair cells do not naturally <b>regenerate</b> in mammals. <b>Loss</b> of hair cells often leads to a degeneration of the processes that innervate them along with the ganglion cell bodies of the auditory nerve. The only currently accepted treatment for hearing loss of this type is the cochlear implant, an auditory prosthesis {{that has been in}} clinical use for over 30 years. While the cochlear implant has been successful in providing or restoring hearing to over 100, 000 patients, there are limitations to the hearing provided by the implant, particularly for complex sounds such as speech in noise and music. The peripheral processes and ganglion cell bodies receive and process the electrical stimulation from the implant, and thus the survival of these components of the auditory nerve is critical to the perception of sound from the cochlear implant. This dissertation presents two novel methods of promoting auditory nerve survival and regrowth following hair cell loss. The first method used an adenoviral construct containing a gene insert for brain – derived neurotrophic factor, designed to increase endogenous production of this growth factor. The introduction of this adenovirus into the cochlea led to a decrease in electrophysiological and psychophysical thresholds to cochlear implant stimulation and promoted long – term ganglion cell survival. This study was unique in addressing the psychophysical effects of the anatomical changes induced by growth factor treatment. In the second method, a specialized implant coating was designed to attract growth of peripheral processes to make contact with a cochlear implant in vivo. In this study, a new histological technique was developed, which allowed visualization of peripheral processes and evaluation of their spatial relationship with an implant. This coating attracted significant neuronal growth in close proximity to the implant and decreased the impedance between implant electrodes. These studies together demonstrate the significant plasticity of the auditory nerve to survive following deafness, and indicate the potential for nerve regeneration efforts to improve cochlear implant performance...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, whose cardinal pathology is {{the loss}} of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current treatments for PD have side effects in the long term and do not halt disease progression or <b>regenerate</b> dopaminergic cell <b>loss.</b> Attempts to compensate neuronal cell loss by transplantation of dopamine-producing cells started more than 30 years ago, leading to several clinical trials. These trials showed safety and variable efficacy among patients. In addition to variability in efficacy, several patients developed graft-induced dyskinesia. Nevertheless, they have provided a proof of concept that motor symptoms could be improved by cell transplantation. Cell transplantation in the brain presents several immunological challenges. The adaptive immune response should be abolished to avoid graft rejection by the host. In addition, the innate immune response will always be present after transplanting cells into the brain. Remarkably, the innate immune response can have dramatic effects on the survival, differentiation and proliferation of the transplanted cells, but has been hardly investigated. In this review, we analyze data on the functional effects of signals from the innate immune system on dopaminergic differentiation, survival and proliferation. Then, we discussed efforts on cell transplantation in animal models and PD patients, highlighting the immune response and the immunomodulatory treatment strategies performed. The analysis of the available data lead us to conclude that the modulation of the innate immune response after transplantation can increase the success of future clinical trials in PD by enhancing cell differentiation and survival.

40|$|The adult {{human heart}} has a minimal ability to <b>regenerate</b> myocardium. Therefore, <b>loss</b> of viable cardiomyocytes in cardiac disease, such as {{myocardial}} infarction (MI), {{may lead to}} heart failure. After evaluating the regenerative potential of several stem cell sources of cardiac myocytes and vascular cells (chapter 2), we created a mouse model of MI and cell transplantation which allows long term phenotypical analysis of engrafted human stem and progenitor cells, and used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor cardiac function (chapter 3). We thus performed the first long term study of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) in uninjured and infarcted mouse hearts, and found that hESC-CM survive, integrate and mature in the host myocardium for at least 12 weeks. HESC-CM transplantation improved heart function post-MI at 4 weeks compared to differentiated hESCs devoid of cardiomyocytes, {{but this was not}} sustained at 12 weeks (chapter 4). Comparing the effects of injection of hESC-CM at different dosages with hESC-non-CM derivatives, culture medium or no injection in the same experimental model, we demonstrate that both hESC-CM and hESC-non-CM provide long term functional improvement compared to vehicle- or no injection even though only cardiomyocytes formed persistent grafts. Importantly, increasing numbers of hESC-CM for transplantation resulted in no additional functional benefit. In addition, we confirmed evidence of a paracrine contribution of the transplanted hESC-CM by demonstrating increased vascularization in the infarcted heart associated specifically with transplantation of these cells (chapter 5). Because the grafted cells were usually surrounded by a fibrotic layer, we determined its composition with respect to extracellular matrix type and origin, and found a contribution of both host and donor cells. In addition, we characterized the integrin expression of hESC-CM in vitro and at various time points post-transplantation. Co-transplanted hESC-derived endothelial cells formed a capillary network through the fibrotic layer that communicated with the mouse vasculature, supporting extended graft survival and maturation over a 6 month period (chapter 6). We further specified the role and suitability of vasculogenic cells in cardiac regeneration using mice and human cells with a deficiency of endoglin, an accessory TGFbeta-receptor present on mononuclear cells (MNCs). Defects in mutant mice in vascularization and cardiac function post-MI could be rescued by intravenous injection of healthy donor MNCs, but not MNCs from patients with the gene mutation. This indicates that cardiovascular patients, who often have defects in their MNCs and endothelial progenitor cells, may benefit from transplantation of cells with high endoglin expression, and matched heterologous cells may be preferred (chapter 7). Finally, we show that human heart-derived cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) and CMPC-CM prevented cardiac dilatation and deterioration of cardiac function for at least 12 weeks after MI. In addition, CMPCs differentiated in vivo into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (chapter 8). In conclusion, several cell types improve cardiac function but some problems need to be solved, and further investigation into the underlying mechanisms is required for optimization in the choice of cell number and type so that clinical strategies can be properly defined...|$|R
40|$|Yabbies {{have the}} ability to <b>regenerate</b> lost limbs. <b>Loss</b> of a limb results in the growth of a limb bud. Development of this new limb {{involves}} many developing stages until the new limb becomes morphologically and physiologically virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor. In the yabby, the claw becomes functional after the first moult when the dactyl becomes moveable. However, the muscle fibres are able to develop force and appear to be functioning before the dactyl becomes moveable and the claw is operational (West et al., 1995). This study aimed to document morphological stages of claw regeneration and determine sequence and protein appearance of all fibre types in the claw closer muscle of yabby, Cherax albidus. The regenerating limbs were harvested at strategic stages, and the contralateral pristine claw was taken as a control. The stages of re-growth sampled were an unsegmented limb (papilla), a limb with a closed dactyl, an early stage of the limb with an open dactyl, and a fully regenerated limb. Fast (SL 3 ̆c 4 µm) and slow (SL 3 ̆e 8 µm) fibres were isolated from pristine and regenerating claw muscle of the yabby, C. albidus. Muscle tissue was taken from the papilla and closed dactyls. Myofibrillar proteins in fibres from the pristine claw closer muscle were identified using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Fibres contained numerous isoforms of structural and regulatory proteins in assemblages correlated with fibre type. One fast (F) and one slow (S 2) fibre types were identified. All F fibres possessed two isoforms of paramyosin (P 1 and P 2), while all slow (S 2) fibres contained only the P 2 variant. Slow (S 2) fibres were distinguished by the distribution of a large isoform of troponin T (T 1), while fast fibres contained an unidentified 75 K protein. Fast and slow fibres also differed in the assemblage of other regulatory proteins. The ratio between myosin heavy chain to actin in both fast and slow (S 2) fibres was greater than one. During the initial stages of claw regeneration, the tissue contained undifferentiated muscle mass surrounded by large numbers of dense structures that were possibly haemocytes or nuclei. Protein profiles by SDS-PAGE revealed an extremely large amount of an 88 K protein. The closer muscle does not differentiate until the closed dactyl stage where myofibrils were found to contain scattered fragments of sarcomeres. Sarcomere length of these myofibrils were of intermediate type. Mature, fully differentiated myofibrils (complete sarcomeres) had a short sarcomere length characteristic of fast fibres. Myofibrillar protein analysis by SDS-PAGE could not confirm fibre type. Most proteins from both fibre types were present at this stage. Throughout this phase, the ratio of myosin heavy chain to actin was less than one. Once the dactyl opened, the appearance, sarcomere lengths and protein profiles of the muscle fibres were indistinguishable from pristine fibres, and both fast and slow fibres were present. However the ratio of myosin heavy chain to actin in slow muscle fibres was approximately equal to one, fast muscle fibres contained a ratio greater than one. Results obtained also showed there was a greater proportion of slow fibres (65...|$|R
