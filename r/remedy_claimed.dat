The screenshot shows Alan Wake in a different attire, with a flannel shirt and jeans, next to a road sign that says the town of Night Springs is 15 miles away. Night Springs is a fictional television show in Alan Wake, and is the setting of said show. On 10 November, a short teaser trailer was unveiled. During {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the first screenshot, Remedy employees made a number of comments on the official Alan Wake community forums about the new game. It was shared that the new title is [...] "structured like a full release complete with a pretty damn impressive storyline that expands the originals in some interesting ways." [...] Although no specifics were revealed, Remedy responded to fans who were worried that being an Xbox Live Arcade game meant that the amount of content in the game would be too small. <b>Remedy</b> <b>claimed</b> that there will definitely be enough [...] "value for money" [...] for the players of the game, and that fans [...] "will be blown away by the proportion of things pretty soon".|$|E

40|$|The pages below on {{forgiveness}} {{are from}} the much-celebrated, thought-provoking book by Arendt (The human condition, 238 – 43) {{in which it is}} argued that the unpredictable and irreversible effects of human actions do have cor-rections. The <b>remedies,</b> <b>claims</b> Arendt, are our twin capacities to forgive and promise. For a self made of others (a node of relationships?), to promise is a capacity to create the ground for lasting relationships with others, whereas to forgive allows one to repair the injuries that occur between people (often by lack of thinking) and develop a rich communal life. Arendt’s text: Forgiveness [238] The Discoverer of the role of forgiveness in the realm of human affairs was Jesus of Nazareth. The fact that he made this discovery in a religious context and articulated it in religious language is no reason to take it any less seriously in a strictly secular sense.

5000|$|In the U.S. Copyright Act, {{only two}} {{sections}} deal with improper assertions of copyright on public domain materials: Section 506(c) criminalizes fraudulent uses of copyright notices, and Section 506(e) punishes knowingly making a false {{representation of a}} material fact in the application for copyright registration. Section 512(f) additionally punishes using the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove material the issuer knows is not infringing. But the U.S. Copyright Act does not expressly provide for any civil actions to <b>remedy</b> <b>claims</b> of copyright on public domain materials, nor does the Act prescribe relief for individuals who refrain from copying or pay for copying permission to an entity that engages in copyfraud. Professor Peter Suber argued in a 2011 article that the United States should [...] "make the penalties for copyfraud (false claim of copyright) at least as severe as the penalties for infringement; that is, take the wrongful decrease in the circulation of ideas at least as seriously as the wrongful increase in the circulation of ideas." ...|$|R

40|$|Recent Supreme Court cases {{regarding}} Congress 2 ̆ 7 s abrogation authority have seriously impaired Congress 2 ̆ 7 s {{ability to}} demonstrate a valid exercise of its Section 5 power under the Fourteenth Amendment to subject nonconsenting states to suit for money damages in federal court. During its 2003 term, the Supreme Court has again granted certiorari to a case involving the proper scope of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s section 5 power, Lane v. Tennessee. Lane involves a suit for money damages under Title II of the ADA based on the alleged failure of the State of Tennessee to make its courthouses accessible. Many commentators suggest that the Supreme Court will follow its current precedent and deny a damage remedy in Lane, particularly since the Court barred a suit for damages brought by a state employee for an alleged violation of Title I of the ADA in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett. This article critiques the Court 2 ̆ 7 s current analysis as seen in Garrett and proposes that the Court should evaluate the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s Title II damage remedy against the states differently than it did Title I 2 ̆ 7 s. It suggests that the Court should adopt an 2 ̆ 2 as applied 2 ̆ 2 analysis when deciding Title II damage <b>remedy</b> <b>claims.</b> By examining the specific state program or service alleged to discriminate against the disabled, the Court may apply a different level of scrutiny to the state 2 ̆ 7 s action than the rational basis scrutiny that applied in Garrett. For example, in Lane, the fundamental right {{of access to the}} state court system has been denied to disabled plaintiffs in Tennessee because the courthouses are inaccessible to those who cannot walk up the stairs.

50|$|Russell {{wrote about}} the plant and animal life of Madras as he had of Aleppo. As a {{physician}} {{as well as a}} naturalist to the East India Company in the Carnatic he was concerned with the problem of snakebite and made it his aim to find a way for people to identify venomous snakes. He also made a large collection of plants. One of the snakes he identified was Katuka Rekula Poda which he noted was not well known to Europeans but was second only to the cobra in its lethality. Russell attempted to classify the snakes using the nature of scales but his quest was to find an easy way to separate the venomous snakes from the non-venomous. He conducted envenomation experiments on dogs and chicken and described the symptoms. He tested <b>remedies</b> <b>claimed</b> for snakebite including a pill from Tanjore which was very popular and found that it did not work. In one case a soldier in torpor was brought to him and the common treatment used by Europeans was tested. Two bottles of warm Madeira wine was forcibly poured into the patient's mouth, who then completely recovered. Patrick, his brother Claud and the family left for England in January 1791. Some of the collections he made were placed in the museum at Madras although he took back some snake skins that are now {{in the collection of the}} Natural History Museum at London. Returning to England, he worked on the book on snakes, which was to be published by the East India Company. The first volume of his An Account of Indian Serpents Collected on the Coast of Coromandel was published in 1796 with 44 plates. The second volume appeared in four parts, the first two of which were published in 1801 and 1802. These included 46 coloured plates. Patrick Russell died on 2 July 1805, three days after an illness. He was never married. The third and fourth parts of the second volume of his book was published after his death in 1807 and 1809. Two scientific papers were read on the pits of the pit viper Trimeresurus which he demonstrated as not being associated with hearing. Another paper demonstrated the voluntary mechanism by which the cobra spread its hood.|$|R
40|$|Version 4 / 09 Abstract: In theory, {{property}} rights allow markets to achieve Pareto optimal allocations. But {{property rights}} are often imperfectly defined and enforced. Modeling imperfect rights, I find that contracts are robust to imperfect enforcement in common situations. However, exclusionary rights, which protect against expropriation by third parties, can create overlapping claims when rights are ill-defined. Different patterns of imperfect rights generate different behavior, affecting institutional performance. For example, I find that stronger penalties for violating rights sometimes decrease Pareto efficiency, contrary {{to a common}} view.

40|$|The road is the same, up- hill or down-hill. And it’s {{our choice}} {{to choose one}} of the two. But the {{destination}} {{at the end of}} the road is different. Let us all appreciate the fact that there is a big difference between advertising a commodity such as a table, chair, mobile phone and a Medicine. In the first case, if the advertised claims are not met, the commodity such as a chair or a table may last for only 2 years in place of 5 years. We may even forget the original guarantee period given at the time of purchase and buy another new commodity, but in case of medicines the story is different. If you are taking a medicine for say reducing blood pressure and if it fails to do so as indicated, you are likely to end up in an emergency ward of a hospital for the treatment of heart-attack. We often come across advertisements, which make tall claims, such as Increase your male stamina, Improve your memory instantly, Lose 10 kg of weight in 10 days etc. Beyond doubt, there are certain medicines, which work wonders, but surely not in all patients and certainly not in 10 days. Furthermore, there are some medicines very popular in the society at large for their beneficial effects and are likely to be consumed without consulting a physician. Recently, Media has done a wonderful job by making a common man aware about the expiry date of goods. This noble initiative can also be extended to medicines, which would help in saving several innocent lives. Furthermore, there are a few physicians, who are unable to keep themselves up-to-date due to patient rush and ambitious lifestyle. The authors would like to make a mention of few such medicines, which though popular in every house hold are likely to cause life-threatening side effects. Pioglitazone, a powerful anti-diabetic medicine, analgin, a promising pain killer and de-anxit, an anti-depressant drug have all been banned recently by Drugs Controller General of India for their serious adverse effects. A common man, who is busy in earning his daily bread, needs to be informed about these Banned Drugs. The authors advocate that media persons can play a positive role here.
