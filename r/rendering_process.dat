5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the <b>rendering</b> <b>process</b> was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E

After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the <b>rendering</b> <b>process,</b> and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap, and collagen-derived glycerine, used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>rendering</b> <b>process,</b> {{the filter}} graph {{searches}} the Windows Registry for registered filters and builds its graph of filters {{based on the}} locations provided. After this, it connects the filters together, and, at the developer's request, executes (i.e., plays, pauses, etc.) the created graph. DirectShow filter graphs are widely used in video playback (in which the filters implement functions such as file parsing, video and audio demultiplexing, decompressing and rendering) {{as well as for}} video and audio recording, editing, encoding, transcoding or network transmission of media. Interactive tasks such as DVD navigation may also be controlled by DirectShow.|$|E

25|$|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter began {{life when}} LucasArts {{was asked to}} make an Episode II-based game which {{featured}} Jango Fett. In March 2001 game design documents were presented, and development began shortly after. The PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube versions of the game have different custom in-house graphics engines, each designed specifically {{to take advantage of}} the two platforms' unique strengths and work around their unique limitations, but the core game engine is identical. In the PS2 version they took advantage of both vector unit (VU) chips to drive the graphics to maximum performance. The DMA bandwidth was taken advantage of to use a high number of textures. There is full-screen antialiasing and texture mip mapping support. They used the second VU1 chip to handle all the character skinning and VU0 to handle all the skeletal animation transforms. Which enabled dozens of characters to be on-screen without bogging down the frame rate. They had 10 individually optimized rendering loops on VU1 to speed up the <b>rendering</b> <b>process.</b> Their PS2 graphics engine could move 10,000,000 triangles per second, and adding the gameplay, collision, logic, textures, sound would go down accordingly to around 30,000 to 50,000 triangles per frame, all at an average frame rate of 30 frames per second.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the <b>rendering</b> <b>process</b> of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies â€” but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E
500|$|Rhapsody in Blue is {{the first}} Fantasia segment with music from an American composer. It {{originated}} in 1992 when director and animator Eric Goldberg approached Al Hirschfeld {{about the idea of}} an animated short set to Gershwin's composition in the style of Hirschfeld's illustrations. Hirschfeld agreed to serve as artistic consultant and allowed the animators to use and adapt his previous works for the segment. Goldberg's wife Susan was art director. Duke is named after jazz artist Duke Ellington. The bottom of his toothpaste tube reads [...] "NINA", an Easter egg referencing Hirschfeld's newborn daughter Nina. Rachel was designed after the Goldbergs' daughter and John is based on animation historian and author John Culhane and Hirschfeld's caricature of Alexander Woollcott. Goldberg took Hirschfeld's original illustration of Gershwin and animated it to make him play the piano. Featured in the crowd emerging from the hotel are depictions of Brooks Atkinson and Hirschfeld, along with his wife Dolly Haas. The segment was completed two months ahead of schedule. Despite this, the sequence was so chromatically complex that the <b>rendering</b> <b>process</b> using the CAPS system delayed Tarzan.|$|E
