40|$|Abstract. Most of {{the fatigue}} damage in {{aircraft}} structures {{can be linked}} to the stress concentration arising at the rivet joints. Interference-fit riveting of a flush rivet can form the uniform interference fit. Thanks to the uniform interference fit, large stress concentration can be avoided. The radial deformation, which is directly relative to interference fit, is therefore of prime importance. Parameters associated with a riveting process that directly affect the quality of rivets {{must be taken into account}} to observe the effect on radial deformation at rivet holes. This paper presents an effective variation analysis to calculate radial deformation at rivet holes by assuming that the axial stresses are constant both along the axial and radius of the rivet slug. Firstly, the rivet process model is built before variation analysis. Secondly, theoretical relationships between radial deformations and contact loads are proposed using elasto-plastic analysis. Later, the expressions of the contact loads are given according to geometrical relationships and analysis of deforming forces. Thirdly, an instance made up of the rivet, top sheet and bottom sheet is used to verify the analysis model. The model paves an efficient way to study the deforming law of the <b>riveting</b> <b>press</b> process and build the pre-estimate model of the rivet deformations and the parameter optimization model...|$|E
40|$|WO 2003080270 A UPAB: 20031105 NOVELTY - The {{mechanical}} {{joining method}} uses a deformable auxiliary joining element (1), e. g. a clinch <b>rivet,</b> which is <b>pressed</b> into the overlapping parts (2, 3) by compression forces provided between an axially displaced upper tool (6) {{operated by a}} and a cooperating flat lower tool (4), causing plastic deformation of both the joining element {{and each of the}} parts. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A tumble movement may be superimposed on the axial displacement of the upper tool, provided via a mechanical, electromechanical or piezoelectric drive. Also included are INDEPENDENT CLAIMS for the following: (a) a device for providing a mechanical joint between overlapping parts; (b) a joining element for a mechanical joining method USE - The method is used for providing a mechanical joint between 2 flat overlapping parts. ADVANTAGE - Joining process does not require pre-punching...|$|R
40|$|As {{the nation}} watches {{the impact of}} the recent {{stimulus}} bill on job creation and economic growth, a group of academics continues to dispute the notion that the fiscal and job creation programs of the New Deal helped end the Depression. The work of these revisionist scholars has led to a public discourse that has obvious implications for the controversy surrounding fiscal stimulus bills. Since we support a new stimulus package—one that emphasizes jobs for the 9. 8 percent of the workforce currently unemployed—we have been concerned about this debate. With Congress, the White House, pundits, and the <b>press</b> <b>riveted</b> on the all-important health care debate, we worry that they are also distracted by skirmishes over economic theory and history, while millions wait for a new chance to do meaningful work and effective, if imperfect, policy tools are readily at hand.
