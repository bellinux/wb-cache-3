6000|$|... "Ah is that he--really?" [...] Our friend felt {{a certain}} surprise, for the personage before him seemed to trouble a vision {{which had been}} vague only while not confronted with the reality. As soon as the reality dawned the mental image, {{retiring}} with a sigh, became substantial enough to suffer a slight wrong. Overt, who had spent a considerable part of his short life in foreign lands, made now, {{but not for the}} first time, the reflexion that whereas in those countries he had almost always recognised the artist and the man of letters by his personal [...] "type," [...] the mould of his face, the character of his head, the expression of his figure and even the indications of his dress, so in England this identification was as little as possible a matter of course, thanks to the greater conformity, the habit of sinking the profession instead of advertising it, the general diffusion of the air of the gentleman--the gentleman committed to no particular set of ideas. More than once, on returning to his own country, he had said to himself about people met in society: [...] "One sees them in this place and that, and one even talks with them; but {{to find out what they}} do one would <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a detective." [...] In respect to several individuals whose work he was the opposite of [...] "drawn to"--perhaps he was wrong--he found himself adding [...] "No wonder they conceal it--when it's so bad!" [...] He noted that oftener than in France and in Germany his artist looked like a gentleman--that is like an English one--while, certainly outside a few exceptions, his gentlemen didn't look like an artist. St. George was not one of the exceptions; that circumstance he definitely apprehended before the great man had turned his back to walk off with Miss Fancourt. He certainly looked better behind than any foreign man of letters--showed for beautifully correct in his tall black hat and his superior frock coat. Somehow, all the same, these very garments--he wouldn't have minded them so much on a weekday--were disconcerting to Paul Overt, who forgot for the moment that the head of the profession was not a bit better dressed than himself. He had caught a glimpse of a regular face, a fresh colour, a brown moustache and a pair of eyes surely never visited by a fine frenzy, and he promised himself to study these denotements on the first occasion. His superficial sense was that their owner might have passed for a lucky stockbroker--a gentleman driving eastward every morning from a sanitary suburb in a smart dog-cart. That carried out the impression already derived from his wife. Paul's glance, after a moment, travelled back to this lady, and he saw how her own had followed her husband as he moved off with Miss Fancourt. Overt permitted himself to wonder a little if she were jealous when another woman took him away. Then he made out that Mrs. St. George wasn't glaring at the indifferent maiden. Her eyes rested but on her husband, and with unmistakeable serenity. That was the way she wanted him to be--she liked his conventional uniform. Overt longed to hear more about the book she had induced him to destroy.|$|E

50|$|Informal {{economic}} activity accounts for between 25 and 40 percent of Gross National Income. Meaning, some informal income {{is not really}} accounted for in the aggregate production figures. Informal {{economic activity}} <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed, and {{perhaps one of the}} best ways <b>to</b> do so <b>is</b> <b>to</b> study the roots of such activity and phenomenon, namely the loopholes of the legal system and mercantilist thought. In the legal system, there always seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> injustice and in such a system, there would always be favored entities and forgotten entities. The current legal system also appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full of loopholes which give rise to many illegitimate opportunity structures, giving people some chance to actually get around the legal system. Thus, it would definitely <b>be</b> important <b>to</b> constitute reforms in the legal system to ensure fair play in the economy. If the atmosphere of fair play can be fostered and taken care of, then it is likely that informal players would go back to the formal economy.|$|R

Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|R

In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>to</b> accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure that allows you <b>to</b> <b>have</b> these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] in a way it could play out".|$|R

Acharia was surprised {{when she found out}} that Irri died, but felt that the death served a purpose making Daenerys more isolated. A scene depicting how Irri was strangled was actually filmed but {{was not included in the}} final montage. The actress revealed: [...] "I think it's hard to be strangled onscreen because obviously to an extent to make it look real, you <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bit strangled.

5000|$|The {{problem of}} {{identity}} centers upon whether bisexuals build an identity around their bisexuality, what being a bisexual means socially, {{and how it}} relates to other identities such as feminism. One debate {{is whether or not}} it is valuable to establish bisexuality as a sexual identity. As author Jennifer Baumgardner writes:It is feminist to understand bisexuality as its own identity too, because it's a chapter of women's history that has been repressed and misunderstood, and one that has contributed substantially to current ideas about queernessHowever the author recognizes that there are also political limitations to identifying as bisexual, saying that:The thing about being bisexual is that you don't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out in the same ways. You can often pass for straight. This can be a weak position politically - how can we organize people around gay rights if we don't identify, and can't be identified by others, as gay?Out of this debate, a variety of identity terms have expanded to include the many ideas surrounding this complex issue of identity and sexuality including, pansexuality (omnisexuality), polysexuality, and just [...] "being sexual".|$|E
5000|$|Funimation Entertainment's DVD and Blu-ray {{releases}} {{of the film}} were also the subject of several reviews {{by a number of}} publications for films and anime.

Bamboo Dong, another reviewer of Anime News Network, said that the film's pace is [...] "anything but smooth" [...] and that the battles are [...] "cobbled together". She commented that the film is [...] "syrupy good fun" [...] for those who are fans of the series, but noted that for non-fans it will hold only [...] "limited appeal". Although Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD talk said that [...] "you <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affirmed in One Piece lore in order to full [...] appreciate it" [...] and commented that it felt [...] "incomplete and unbalanced", he still recommended the film, stating that it is [...] "short on story but ... a lot of fun."

However, a lot of work <b>was</b> required <b>to</b> get here, and designing a TP 52 is still considered a good choice, since it was a good chance to get deep in many of the areas that designing a boat implies. It is also a good thing to design a box ruled yacht, because it sets the design in the right path to look like a boat, a TP 52 will always be a TP 52, it may be faster or slower, but it will look like one of them due to these limitations.
