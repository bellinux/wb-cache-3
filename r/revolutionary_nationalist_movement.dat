25|$|With {{the failure}} of the Indo-German Zimmermann Plan, in 1917 Chattopadhyaya shifted the Berlin Committee to Stockholm. In 1918, he {{contacted}} the Russian leaders Troinovski and Angelica Balabanova, the First General Secretary of the Communist International. In December, he dissolved the Berlin Committee. In May 1919, he arranged for a secret meeting of Indian revolutionaries in Berlin. In November 1920, in his search of financial and political support exclusively for the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> in India, Chattopadhyaya was encouraged by M. N. Roy (with Mikhail Borodin's approval).|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of these conflicts, the {{campaign}} for the 1954 elections continued. Unhappy with some of Gálvez's gestures toward liberalization, Carías, despite his advanced age, {{decided to run for}} president and secured the PNH nomination. This move, however, split the party, and more moderate members broke away to form the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Movement</b> (Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario, MNR). Their nominee was former vice president Abraham Williams Calderón. The split in the ruling party encouraged the PLH, who united behind Ramón Villeda Morales, a Tegucigalpa physician who was seen as somewhat to the left of center in the party's political spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|Since the Medieval Ages, the {{population}} of the region of Chameria was of mixed and complex ethnicity, with a blurring of group identities such as Albanian and Greek, along with many other ethnic groups. Information on the ethnic composition of the region over several centuries is almost entirely absent, with the strong likelihood that they did not fit into standard [...] "national" [...] patterns, as the 19th-century <b>revolutionary</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> wanted.|$|R

500|$|United States {{officials}} moved thereafter {{to expand}} containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, {{in order to}} counter <b>revolutionary</b> <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements,</b> often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere. In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the [...] "Pactomania"), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.|$|R
25|$|Standing {{alongside}} the Mexican Revolution, the Bolivian National Revolution {{is one of}} the most significant sociopolitical events to occur in Latin America during the 20th century. The <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Movement</b> (MNR) emerged from the ashes of the Chaco War in 1941 as a middle-class political coalition eschewing Marxism for nationalism. The MNR participated in the military-civilian regime of Gualberto Villarroel (1943–46), but was deposed of in 1946 by the mining oligarchy and the Partido Izquierda Revolucionario (PIR). The party initiated a brief but bloody civil war in October 1949, but was defeated. The MNR emerged victorious in the 1951 elections, but the results were called fraudulent by the opposition, and its right to the presidency was denied.|$|E
500|$|Morales {{presented}} the coca growers {{as victims of}} a wealthy, urban social elite who had bowed to U.S. pressure by implementing neoliberal economic reforms. He argued that these reforms were {{to the detriment of}} Bolivia's majority, and thus the country's representative democratic system of governance failed to reflect the true democratic will of the majority. This situation was exacerbated following the 1993 general election when the centrist <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Movement</b> (Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario – MNR) won the election and Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada became President. He adopted a policy of [...] "shock therapy", implementing economic liberalization and widescale privatization of state-owned assets. Sánchez also agreed with the U.S. DEA to relaunch its offensive against the Bolivian coca growers, committing Bolivia to eradicating [...] of coca by March 1994 in exchange for $20 million worth of US aid, something Morales claimed would be opposed by the cocalero movement.|$|E

Although attended by delegates representing more than two dozen ethnic entities of the Middle and Far East, the Baku Congress was dominated by the lengthy speeches of leaders from the Russian Communist Party (RCP), including: Grigory Zinoviev, Karl Radek, Mikhail Pavlovich, and Anatoly Skachko.
