I then went into the kitchen (which, {{along with the rest of}} the house, belonged to a very square and sensible old woman in a Sussex village), and asked the owner and occupant of the kitchen if she had any brown paper. She had a great deal; in fact, she had too much; and she mistook the purpose and the rationale of the existence of brown paper. She seemed to have an idea that if a person wanted brown paper he must be wanting to tie up parcels; which was the last thing I wanted to do; indeed, it is a thing which I have found to be beyond my mental capacity. Hence she dwelt very much on the varying qualities of toughness and endurance in the material. I explained to her that I only wanted to draw pictures on it, and that I did not want them to endure in the least; and that from my point of view, therefore, it was a question, not of tough consistency, but of <b>responsive</b> <b>surface,</b> a thing comparatively irrelevant in a parcel. When she understood that I wanted to draw she offered to overwhelm me with note-paper, apparently supposing that I did my notes and correspondence on old brown paper wrappers from motives of economy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Responsive</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{have been}} {{suggested}} to enhance longevity and antifouling performance of materials in many applications from industrial coatings to tissue engineering and drug delivery. We present a molecular dynamics study investigating de-swelling and swelling {{of some of the}} most commonly used responsive materials - PEG-functionalised silica and polymer surfaces - as a function of hydration and temperature. We show that PEG chains grafted onto the hard silica substrates exhibit a dehydration-induced collapse that is far more pronounced compared to chains grafted onto the soft polyester surface. The difference between the hard and soft substrates is particularly notable at low coverage densities where the chains are sufficiently separated from one another. We also show that inter-molecular hydrogen bonding responsible for the conformational state of the tethered chains in water can be temperature controlled. It can be suggested that the hard substrates with the intermediate-to-high coverage densities of low molecular weight hydrophilic grafts may be more appropriate for anti-fouling applications due to their ability to trap greater amount of water molecules. Soft substrates may be detrimental for the efficient response of the functionalised surfaces to changes in hydration and enhancement of the surface hardness must be considered when designing <b>responsive</b> <b>surfaces</b> for solution-based applications, such as antimicrobial coatings for industry and biomedicine...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis will discuss {{the current state of}} <b>responsive</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Various {{polymers}} and monolayers which respond to particular external stimuli are included. The second chapter deals with general surface modification techniques commonly used to tailor surface properties. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), grafting-from and grafting-to techniques, and in particular polymer brushes are detailed and compared. The advantages of ATRP over other polymerization techniques, particularly in the surface domain, are also discussed. The third chapter describes in detail the efforts made to synthesize and characterize a <b>responsive</b> polymer <b>surface</b> composed of zwitterionic groups. A thickness dependent wettability and reversible UCST behaviour will be demonstrated, in line with the properties of the same polymer in solution. The fourth chapter considers the use of photolabile protecting groups (PGs) as a means to create latent hydrophilic surfaces. Naturally hydrophobic PGs are used on polymer side changes, poised for cleavage upon exposure to UV light. Removal of the PGs liberates the hydrophilic polymer thereby switching the surface wettability. This system is also shown to be spatially addressable; a highly desirable property for applications which require specific regions of a <b>surface</b> to be <b>responsive.</b> The fifth chapter discusses the formation of well-defined polymer films which change their wettability in response to acid. The development of a self-developing film, by using the chemistry of photoacid generators (PAGs) is the culmination of this research chapter. Again, since UV light is used to trigger the <b>responsive</b> behaviour, <b>surfaces</b> could be patterned allowing for the formation of single films with regions of different wettabilities. The sixth chapter concludes the thesis with an overview of the research performed, and considers the potential directions in which the projects developed could be taken. Further fundamental research into <b>responsive</b> polymer <b>surfaces</b> or their exploitation in developing technologies are both interesting areas for research.

Covalent LbL assembly based on facile ?click? covalent bond formation is an effective alternative, especially for the applications where a more robust ultrathin films or nanocomposites is desired. The subject of this dissertation focuses on the design of three different covalent LbL assemblies and their applications on conductive thin films, superhydrophobic <b>surfaces,</b> and solute <b>responsive</b> <b>surfaces,</b> respectively. Surface modification of PE substrates using covalent LbL assembly with PEI and Gantrez is a successful route to prepare a surface graft. The procedure is relative easy, fast and reproducible. Grafting multiple layers of PEI/Gantrez to the PE powder surface provided excellent coverage and promoted stable LbL film growth and excellent adhesion. This carbon black (CB) coated powder was compression molded into films, and their conductivity was measured, which revealed a percolation threshold below 0. 01 wt % CB for the PEI-grafted system. Electrical conductivity of 0. 2 S/cm was achieved with only 6 wt % CB, which is exceptional for a CB-filled PE film. Direct amination of MWNTs with PEI is a convenient and simple method leading to highly functionalized product that contains 6 - 8 % by weight PEI. Superhydrophobic PE films can be formed either from ionic LbL self-assembly of MWNT-NH-PEIs and poly(acrylic acid) or from covalent LbL self-assembly of MWNTNH- PEIs and Gantrez when the final graft is acrylated with octadecanoic acid. While the ionically assembled nanocomposite graft is labile under acid, the covalently assembled graft is more chemically robust. <b>Responsive</b> <b>surfaces</b> with significant, reversible, reproducible wettability changes can be prepared by covalent LbL grafting using PNIPAM-c-PNASI and aminated silica nanoparticles. A 65 ? ?? value was observed with water vs. 1. 4 M Na 2 SO 4. The prepared film shows a high surface roughness of ~ 300 nm, which contributes to the large solute <b>responsive</b> ?? values. The <b>surfaces</b> are reconfigurable in different solute conditions and that the changes in water contact angle are likely due to combination of change in surface roughness along with swell and intercalation of the solute ions into the PNIPAM surface...|$|R

We report the design, synthesis and characterisation of an enzyme <b>responsive</b> peptide based <b>surface</b> whose chemical properties change upon catalytic action of alkaline phosphatase (AP). AP is a membrane-anchored enzyme involved in osteogenesis (bone formation), making it a suitable biomolecule to facilitate interactivity between the cell and the biomaterial surface. Surface analysis is used to follow dephosphorylation and a phosphate assay is used to determine the amount of phosphate removed by the enzyme. This analysis reveals significant differences in the dephosphorylation rate at the surface compared to that in solution. The ability of the surface to respond to native enzymes expressed by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was indirectly explored by assessing the response of the cells to phosphorylated, non-phosphorylated and enzymatically dephosphorylated surfaces. No {{differences were found between the}} surfaces, suggesting that cell expressed enzymes are able to dephosphorylate the peptide surfaces rapidly.

Here we show a reversible and reproducible collapse of the brushes, increasing with the shear rate. Using two brushes of greatly different chain lengths and grafting densities, we demonstrate that the dynamics responsible for the structural change of the brush are governed by the free chains in solution rather than the brush itself, within the range of parameters examined.

We have developed a noncontact nanoscale method to apply quantified positive and negative force at defined positions to the soft <b>responsive</b> <b>surface</b> of living cells. The method uses applied hydrostatic pressure (0. 1 - 150 kPa) through a pipette, while the pipette-sample separation is kept constant above the cell surface using ion conductance based distance feedback.

We show that we can probe the local mechanical properties of living cells using increasing pressure, and hence measure the nanomechanical properties of the cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton {{in a variety of}} cells (erythrocytes, epithelium, cardiomyocytes and neurons).

We present a novel three-step method to produce nanostructures that are selectively decorated with functional molecules.

However, when the same chains are tethered onto a soft substrate (polyester), interfacial adhesion is strengthened. We find that the deformable substrate allows significant rearrangement of the subsurface and grafted segments during loading. Asperities along the rough soft surface also provide free volume for the tethered chains to occupy, enabling them to carpet the surface and increasing the density at the interface. Our results explain the molecular basis of the mechanical response of PEG when grafted onto hard and soft substrates and provide a rationale for surface protection using PEG...|$|R
50|$|Certified Missile Round (PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement and canister) - The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missile is the {{baseline}} interceptor for MEADS. The interceptor increases the system's range and lethality over {{the baseline}} PAC-3 missile, which {{was selected as}} the primary missile for MEADS when the design and development program began in 2004. The MSE missile increases the engagement envelope and defended area by using more <b>responsive</b> control <b>surfaces</b> and a more powerful rocket motor.|$|R
