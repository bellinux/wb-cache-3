6000|$|... “Still {{you might}} discover, in some {{roundabout}} way. Write to them, under as assumed name of course, for subscriptions {{to one or}} other cause—or, better still, send a stamped type-written <b>reply</b> <b>postcard,</b> with {{a request for a}} declaration for or against vivisection; people who would hesitate to commit themselves to a subscription will cheerfully write Yes or No on a prepaid postcard. If you can’t manage it that way, try and meet them at some one’s house and get into argument on the subject. I think Milly occasionally has one or other of them at her at-homes; you might have the luck to meet both of them there the same evening. Only it must be done soon. My invitations ought to go out by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest, and to-day is Friday.|$|E

50|$|Some {{well known}} tagging {{programs}} in the United States are the South Carolina Marine Game Fish Tagging Program and the Virginia Game Fish Tagging Program. The South Carolina Marine Game Fish Tagging Program began in 1974 {{and it is now}} the largest public tagging program in the Southeastern United States. Anglers are trained and then receive a tag kit with tags, applicator, and instructions. When they tag a fish, anglers use a <b>reply</b> <b>postcard</b> they receive in advance to send the information on the tag number, tag date, location, species, and size. This program issues anglers who tag and release 30 or more eligible species within a year a conservation award. When an angler recaptures a tagged fish, he then should report the recapture. If possible the tag number and the mailing address should be reported along with the location and date of the recapture as well with the measurement of the fish. The objective is to provide biologists with the necessary information to determine growth rate through an accurate measurement. The Virginia Game Fish Tagging Program started operations in 1995 and keeps records on recaptured fish since then. This is an annual program that starts in January and it is limited to 160 anglers. Anglers receive training workshops in February and March.|$|E

And much like the Midwest, the poetry featured will be plainspoken but no less profound for that...|$|E

50|$|In July 1879, the Post Office of India {{introduced}} a quarter anna postcard {{that could be}} posted {{from one place to}} another within British India. This was the cheapest form of post provided to the Indian people to date and proved a huge success. The establishment of a large postal system spanning India resulted in unprecedented postal access: a message on a postcard could be sent from one part of the country to another part (often to a physical address without a nearby post office) without additional postage affixed. This was followed in April 1880 by postcards meant specifically for government use and by <b>reply</b> <b>postcards</b> in 1890. The postcard facility continues to this date in independent India.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} Edwardian postcards {{has a unique}} {{capacity}} to contribute {{to our understanding of}} communicative practices of the early twentieth century. Traditionally, studies of historical writing tend {{to be related to the}} elite, owing to the importance of the events which are being studied, the likelihood of the preservation of works and interest in the writers (Laitinen, 2015). As a cheap, attractive and fast new medium, with up to six deliveries a day, the picture postcard appealed to a society conscious of rapid social change and “acceleration of technological advance” (Readman 2005 : 185). People were taught how to write letters in formal education and etiquette manuals abounded, but these ignored postcards, which offered relative brevity and opportunity for spontaneity (Gillen, in press). Between 1902 and 1910 in Great Britain almost six billion cards were sent, approximately 200 per person. The Edwardian Postcard Project has collected and transcribed three thousand Edwardian postcards. This paper reports on initial corpus and discourse analyses. Postcard writing is shown to be particularly dialogic. Writers draw on their linguistic repertoires for conversations, posing questions to elicit rapid <b>replies.</b> Yet <b>postcard</b> writing also displays a dual orientation to the letter, in frequently alluding to alternation with letters in chains of correspondence and in borrowings from the letter genre. The project has also collected census data from all addressees and senders where these could be found. We briefly outline preliminary findings and possible future directions. Finally, we point to our freely available interactive online resource for further study. References Gillen, J.
