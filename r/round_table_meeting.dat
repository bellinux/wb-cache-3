50|$|The {{process is}} based on the Ministerial Conferences that have been convened with an {{interval}} of 3 to 5 years. These Conferences represent the highest decision-making body of the process, as well as its most important event. At Ministerial Conferences, the ministers responsible for forests in Europe take decisions on issues of highest political and social relevance regarding forests and forestry through decisions and resolutions. Between ministerial conferences, the Expert Level Meeting (ELM) is a decision-making body of FOREST EUROPE. On top of that, ad hoc <b>Round</b> <b>Table</b> <b>Meetings,</b> Working Groups, Seminars and Workshops are being established to work on specific subjects of scientific, technical or political nature.|$|R

40|$|Background: Large disease {{registries}} are {{the preferred}} method to assess long-term treatment safety. If psoriasis registries collaborate in a network, {{their power to}} assess safety is increased. Objective: To identify heterogeneity in psoriasis registries and methodological challenges for synthesising the data they provide. Methods: We surveyed the registries in PSONET and identified and addressed the challenges to collaborative analysis for the network in several <b>round</b> <b>table</b> <b>meetings.</b> Results: Eight out of 10 registries had a prospective comparator cohort with similar disease characteristics but not on biologics. Registries differed in the coding and validation or follow-up of adverse events {{and in the way}} they sampled their population. Fifteen challenges to registries collaborating were identified in the areas of operational governance, structural conduct, bias and analysis. Conclusions: Participation in PSONET, a network of psoriasis registries, helps identify and solve common issues, enhancing the individual registries, and provides larger sets of more powerful safety data in a diverse population. Challenges to interpreting data collectively include heterogeneity in sampling, variable penetration of biologics and compatibility of different datasets. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSituational {{awareness}} is achieved naturally {{by the human}} senses of sight and hearing in combination. Automatic scene understanding aims at replicating this human ability using microphones and cameras in cooperation. In this paper, audio and video signals are fused and integrated {{at different levels of}} semantic abstractions. We detect and track a speaker who is relatively unconstrained, i. e., free to move indoors within an area larger than the comparable reported work, which is usually limited to <b>round</b> <b>table</b> <b>meetings.</b> The system is relatively simple: consisting of just 4 microphone pairs and a single camera. Results show that the overall multimodal tracker is more reliable than single modality systems, tolerating large occlusions and cross-talk. System evaluation is performed on both single and multi-modality tracking. The performance improvement given by the audio–video integration and fusion is quantified in terms of tracking precision and accuracy as well as speaker diarisation error rate and precision–recall (recognition). Improvements vs. the closest works are evaluated: 56 % sound source localisation computational cost over an audio only system, 8 % speaker diarisation error rate over an audio only speaker recognition unit and 36 % on the precision–recall metric over an audio–video dominant speaker recognition method...|$|R

50|$|During the 1980s, Syracuse {{students}} again {{advocated the}} administration to widen the pool of African American faculty applicants, hire a department chairperson {{and in order to}} increase the staff in the AAS department. The department has stayed without a chair and other key positions for more than a year. Members of the Syracuse African-American Students Association (SAS) were at the forefront of this movement. In 1989, 120 SAS member students confronted Chancellor Melvin Eggers at a <b>round</b> <b>table</b> <b>meeting</b> in order to air their grievances. The group's efforts led to a 400-student protest in 1990 led by SAS President Quentin Stith. The students also advocated for a program that allowed all students (not just those of African-American descent) to learn about the contribution of African Americans in American history. The students were concerned with preserving Black identity and saw their dedication towards African studies as a collective struggle. Throughout the 1980s, students continued to play an active role on the university campus.|$|E

Following those in Paris (1992), Budapest (1996), Barcelona (2000) and Stockholm (2004), the Fifth European Congress of Mathematics (5 ECM) took place in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, July 14 - 18, 2008, with about 1000 participants from 68 different countries. Ten plenary and thirty-three invited lectures were delivered. Three science lectures outlined applications of mathematics in other sciences: climate change, quantum information theory and population dynamics. As in the four preceding EMS congresses, ten EMS prizes were granted to very promising young mathematicians. In addition, the Felix Klein Prize was awarded, for the second time, for an application of mathematics to a concrete and difficult industrial problem. There were twenty-two minisymposia, spread over the whole mathematical area. Two <b>round</b> <b>table</b> <b>meetings</b> were organized: one on industrial mathematics and one on mathematics and developing countries.
