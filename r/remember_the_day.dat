500|$|The song's lyrics {{revolve around}} the pursuit of love, {{functioning}} as an ode to Fantasia's husband Kendall Taylor. Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When I met you, I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen to me when I tell you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still." [...] The song ends with a spoken word monologue, in which Fantasia details the first time she met Taylor. This part of the track includes lines such as: [...] "I still <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> it was beautiful. And if I hadn’t went through the things I went through before then I wouldn’t know how special you are." ...|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

2500|$|Lennon first {{conceived}} [...] "Please Please Me" [...] as a bluesy, slow tempo song.

2500|$|There {{is barely}} any {{recalled}} memory {{in cases of}} fear and trauma exposure, brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, pain, or anxiety. Recall memory is very limited, since the only memory people have that suffer from these problems is the flash backs of what happened when the event took place. People can only recall the memory that happened on that day when they hear or see something that brings the memory into existence. They cannot recall how they felt or what they saw, but through images or audio people can recall that tragic event. For example, the day of September 11, 2001, first responders <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{and what it was}} like; but the feelings they could not recall. The only way to recall the feelings they had were when sirens of police vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances drove by their house they feel the exact feelings that were in effect on that day.|$|E

2500|$|The band went by {{the name}} [...] "Feedback" [...] for a few months, before {{changing}} to [...] "The Hype" [...] later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from [...] "The Hype" [...] to [...] "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, [...] "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'" [...] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher {{as a means to}} improve his songwriting.|$|E
