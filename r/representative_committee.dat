5|$|As the British {{government}} has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a <b>representative</b> <b>committee</b> according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the Duke himself appoint a council. Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, and the manager of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.|$|E

2500|$|Via Christi (Macmillan, October, 1902) was {{a volume}} of missionary annals, which {{in less than two}} years reached a sale of nearly 50,000 copies. During the Ecumenical Missionary Conference, held in New York, April 21-May 1, 1900, a long-contemplated plan to unite all Women's Boards of Missions in the United States and Canada in a more {{thorough}} study of missions had taken shape. At a meeting held at the close of the conference, a <b>representative</b> <b>committee</b> was appointed, and was given discretionary power to arrange the course of study and provide the method to pursue it. Via Christi, an Introduction to the Study of Missions, was the first of a series proposed by the committee, to be followed by studies of India, China, Japan, and other countries, each volume treating of the history of all missions in the country to which it was devoted, and beginning, in each case, with the 19th century. William Fairfield Warren, President Boston University, said of it, [...] "Via Christi shows scholarly estimate of the value and enjoyableness of historic sources, as contrasted with rhetorical elaboration merely suggested by the sources. Though but a little US$0.50 volume, it would be hard to find in any book three times its size an equal number of prayers, hymns, and striking appeals, written by the great historic representatives of the missionary spirit themselves." [...] The Christian Endeavor World remarked, [...] "One of the results of the Ecumenical Missionary Conference of 1900 was the uniting of all the Women's Missionary Boards in the United States and Canada for the publication of a thorough and complete course of a study of missions. The initial volume is entitled Via Christi, and is by a most competent and attractive writer, Miss Louise Manning Hodgkins. In six chapters the reader is conducted through the vast course of history, extending from the days of Paul to those of Carey and Judson. The author has not made the mistake of putting in so much that the charm and vividness of the narrative are crowded out. One of the most attractive features of the volume is the set of selections from the period under review at the close of each chapter and the effectively arranged chronological tables." [...] The New York Tribune also reviewed the book, stating, Via Christi gives a bird's-eye view of the missionary efforts of the world from the time of Paul to the nineteenth century. Contemporaneous events in the secular world are mentioned, with names of prominent people and places of the period, giving a perspective as satisfying as it is unusual." ...|$|E
