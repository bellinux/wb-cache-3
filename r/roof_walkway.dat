2500|$|Around 600 BC, {{this was}} {{replaced}} by a structure without parallel in contemporary Celtic Europe. A limestone foundation supported a sun-dried mudbrick wall of circa 4 m height, probably topped by a <b>roofed</b> <b>walkway,</b> thus reaching a total height of 6 m. The wall was clad with bright white lime plaster, regularly renewed; this was necessary to prevent the northern weather from eroding the unbaked mudbrick. [...] Towers protruded outwards from the wall at intervals. It must have been widely visible in the area, as the modern reconstruction of a section is. [...] No other mudbrick structures are known from Celtic Central Europe at this time. It is generally accepted that this structure imitated contemporary walls in the Mediterranean region, and nearest occurrence of the combination of mudbrick and lime plaster is in Phoenician settlements in the Western Mediterranean. [...] A master builder trained in Phoenician methods may have been used.|$|R
5000|$|Built in {{the late}} Ming dynasty and occupying an area of 235 m², the Caiyi Hall is the third hall along the central axis of the whole residence. Serving as the main hall, it was first called [...] "Sengui" [...] (森桂) and was renamed as [...] "Conggui" [...] (丛桂) [...] " [...] afterwards. When Weng Xincun rebuilt it, he {{changed its name to}} [...] "Caiyi Hall". This name is taken from the story of Old Laizi and it carries the meaning that {{children}} should try to make their parents laugh by any means possible. The hall is 3 bays wide and features a [...] "yingshan" [...] (firm-mountain-sloped) roof (硬山顶) with nine rafters and [...] "five purlins cross-beam". On either side of the hall stands a room and a <b>roofed</b> <b>walkway</b> connects it with other halls at its back.

25|$|The Ambaji Fair {{is held in}} the Hindu {{month of}} Bhadrapad (around August–September) at Ambaji, during a time which is {{particularly}} suitable for farmers, when the busy monsoon season is about to end. The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji {{which is in the}} Danta Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a <b>roofed</b> <b>walkway.</b> Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45km away), Palanpur (65km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.|$|R
50|$|The parish {{church is}} {{dedicated}} to Saint James, but Podbrezje is better known for its second church. The picturesque fortified Tabor Church on a rock above the motorway from Ljubljana to the Karawanken Tunnel is a well-known landmark on the route. It was built some time soon after 1471 as a fortification where the locals could escape from Ottoman raids. The worst Ottoman incursions across Upper Carniola and into Carinthia were in 1476 and 1477. The building of the walls around the church was conditioned by the favourable natural position on an elevation {{in the middle of}} a plain, affording a view in all directions. The walls surrounding the church are irregularly shaped and were built on two levels with a <b>roofed</b> <b>walkway,</b> balistraria, and defense tower. The defence tower overlooked the only entrance over a drawbridge. On the western side the church was fortified with a moat and dike. This was also where valuables, food, and livestock were kept. The church {{is dedicated to}} Saint Benedict and Our Lady of Sorrows. One of the paintings in the church is by Ivana Kobilca, who lived in the village for a while.|$|R

Bioretention can be used in commercial areas, parking lots, and highways to treat roof and road runoff. Bio-retention can also be used in residential landscapes or parks; however, steps should be taken to minimize sedi-ment. Bioretention cells that receive sediment loading tend to clog and hold water rather than infiltrate it. Figure 2. Note how the cell’s vertical profile is exaggerated...|$|R
50|$|A {{rain garden}} is a planted {{depression}} or a hole that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas, like <b>roofs,</b> driveways, <b>walkways,</b> parking lots, and compacted lawn areas, {{the opportunity to}} be absorbed. This reduces rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground (as opposed to flowing into storm drains and surface waters which causes erosion, water pollution, flooding, and diminished groundwater). They should be designed for specific soils and climates. The purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as groundwater rather than being sent through stormwater drains straight out to sea. Rain gardens can cut down on the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30%.|$|R
