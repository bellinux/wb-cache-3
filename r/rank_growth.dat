Shade provided by trees will discourage them {{and they may be}} prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging luxurious growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens sufficiently rapidly to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite Nosema locustae can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects. [...] On a small scale, neem products can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development. Insecticides can be used, but adult grasshoppers are difficult to kill, and as they move into fields from surrounding <b>rank</b> <b>growth,</b> crops may soon become reinfested.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Linear {{complexity}} iterative and log-linear complex- ity direct solvers {{are developed}} for the volume integral equation (VIE) based general large-scale electrodynamic analysis. The dense VIE system matrix is first represented by a new cluster- based multilevel low-rank representation. In this representation, all the admissible blocks associated with a single cluster are grouped together and represented by a single low-rank block, whose rank is minimized based on prescribed accuracy. From such an initial representation, an efficient algorithm is developed to generate a minimal-rank H 2 -matrix representation. This representation facilitates faster computation, and ensures the same minimal <b>rank’s</b> <b>growth</b> rate with electrical size as evaluated from singular value decomposition. Taking into account the <b>rank’s</b> <b>growth</b> with electrical size, we develop linear-complexity H -matrix-based storage and matrix-vector multiplication, and thereby an O(N) iterative VIE solver regardless of electrical size. Moreover, we develop an O(NlogN) matrix inversion, and hence a fast O(NlogN) direct VIE solver for large-scale electrodynamic analysis. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of large-scale 1 -, 2 - and 3 -D structures on a single- core CPU, resulting in millions of unknowns, have demonstrated ty and superior performance of the proposed VIE electrodynamic solvers...|$|R

A distant man in a yellow hunting shirt stumbled, and was drowned in the tangle as in water. Around me men dropped plough-handles and women baskets, and as we ran our legs grew numb and our bodies cold at a sound which had haunted us in dreams by night--the war-whoop.

[...] The creepers were torn down this way and that. The horrid daylight poured in brighter and brighter. The Owls had barely time to pass a new resolution, namely, [...] "That we do stand by the Constitution," [...] when a ray of the outer sunlight flashed into their eyes, and sent them flying headlong to the nearest shade.

A repellent river in itself, a repellent river in its surroundings, a repellent river even in its name. It was called The Loke. Neither popular tradition nor antiquarian research could explain what the name meant, or could tell when the name had been given. [...] "We call it The Loke; they do say no fish can live in it; and it dirties the clean salt water when it runs into the sea."

The thought that Rima had perished, that she was lost, was unendurable. It could not be! No doubt the Indians tract come and destroyed the house during our absence; but she had returned, and they had gone away again to come no more. She would be somewhere in the forest, perhaps not far off, impatiently waiting our return.

60|$|The station {{buildings}} were long, low huts, made of sundried, mud-colored bricks, laid up without mortar (adobes, the Spaniards call these bricks, and Americans shorten it to 'dobies).

The building consisted of barns, stable-room for twelve or fifteen horses, and a hut for an eating-room for passengers. This latter had bunks in it for the station-keeper and a hostler or two. You could rest your elbow on its eaves, and you had to bend in order to get in at the door. In place of a window there was a square hole about large enough for a man to crawl through, but this had no glass in it. There was no flooring, but the ground was packed hard. There was no stove, but the fire-place served all needful purposes. There were no shelves, no cupboards, no closets.

60|$|In {{due course}} we left Lamu, and ten days {{afterwards}} {{we found ourselves}} at a spot called Charra, on the Tana River, having gone through many adventures which need not be recorded here. Amongst other things we visited a ruined city, {{of which there are}} many on this coast, and which must once, to judge from their extent and the numerous remains of mosques and stone houses, have been very populous places. These ruined cities are immeasurably ancient, having, I believe, been places of wealth and importance {{as far back as the}} Old Testament times, when they were centres of trade with India and elsewhere. But their glory has departed now -- the slave trade has finished them -- and where wealthy merchants from all parts of the then civilized world stood and bargained in the crowded market-places, the lion holds his court at night, and instead of the chattering of slaves and the eager voices of the bidders, his awful note goes echoing down the ruined corridors. At this particular place we discovered on a mound, covered up with <b>rank</b> <b>growth</b> and rubbish, two of the most beautiful stone doorways that it is possible to conceive. The carving on them was simply exquisite, and I only regret that we had no means of getting them away. No doubt they had once been the entrances to a palace, of which, however, no traces were now to be seen, though probably its ruins lay under the rising mound.|$|E

40|$|Universities {{and higher}} {{education}} institutions form {{an integral part of}} the national infrastructure and prestige. As academic research benefits increasingly from international exchange and cooperation, many universities have increased investment in improving and enabling their global connectivity. Yet, the relationship of university performance and its global physical connectedness has not been explored in detail. We conduct, to our knowledge, the first large-scale data-driven analysis into whether there is a correlation between university relative ranking performance and its global connectivity via the air transport network. The results show that local access to global hubs (as measured by air transport network betweenness) strongly and positively correlates with the <b>ranking</b> <b>growth</b> (statistical significance in different models ranges between 5 % and 1 % level). We also found that the local airport’s aggregate flight paths (degree) and capacity (weighted degree) has no effect on university ranking, further showing that global connectivity distance is more important than the capacity of flight connections. We also examined the effect of local city economic development as a confounding variable and no effect was observed suggesting that access to global transportation hubs outweighs economic performance as a determinant of university ranking. The impact of this research is that we have determined the importance of the centrality of global connectivity and, hence, established initial evidence for further exploring potential connections between university ranking and regional investment policies on improving global connectivity...|$|R

This night was still and clear, the west all yellow with the departing light, and the mists coming on the river.

The palisades that held its earthenwork were rotten and crumbling, and the mighty bastions of its corners sliding away. Behind the fort, at the end farthest from the river, we came upon gravelled walks hidden by the <b>rank</b> <b>growth,</b> where the soldiers of his Most Christian Majesty once paraded.

Such a phenomenon often meets us in life; oftener than we recognize, because a certain tact and exterior decency generally hide the moral deficiency. But often there is a mind well polished, married to a conscience and natural impulses left as they were in childhood, except that they have sprouted up into evil and poisonous weeds, richly blossoming with strong-smelling flowers, or seeds which the plant scatters by a sort of impulse; even as the Doctor was now half-consciously throwing seeds of his evil passions into the minds of these children. He was himself a grown-up child, without tact, simplicity, and innocence, and with ripened evil, all the ranker for a native heat that was in him and still active, which might have nourished good things as well as evil.

One comes out of prison in the same clothes one wore on the day of condemnation, no matter how long one has been put away there. Oh, they last! They last! But there is something which is preserved by prison life even better than one's discarded clothing. It is the force, the vividness of one's sentiments.
