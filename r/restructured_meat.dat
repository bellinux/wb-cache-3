40|$|Reformed and <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> are {{two major}} {{categories}} of processed meat products. Reformed meat products require intact meat pieces to bind together while <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> products are extensively minced prior to restructuring. Salts such as sodium chloride and phosphates together with mechanical treatment and heat, {{have been used to}} bind meat pieces together. In the process the proteins in muscle become soluble, bind large amounts of water and gel on heating. While heat-induced gelation of soluble meat protein provides binding in reformed meat products and reduces cook losses in <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> products, no binding occurs in raw meat systems. Non-meat proteins, especially soya protein, are routinely used in processed meat products, often in conjunction with salts, to increase water and fat binding during the cooking process. However, such proteins do not bind intact meat pieces in either the raw or cooked state. Transglutaminase (TGase) is a food-grade commercially available enzyme which can crosslink suitable proteins leading to the formation of a protein matrix (gel) and immobilisation of large quantities of water. This property could improve the water-binding properties of non-meat proteins in <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> products. The prospect of crosslinking native meat proteins and non-meat proteins or native meat proteins on adjacent meat pieces would make salt-free reformed meat products a realistic objective. Hence, the main objective of this project was to study protein-protein interactions in reformed and restructured meats, especially between meat proteins and added non-meat proteins in the absence of salts but {{in the presence of a}} protein crosslinking enzyme.

40|$|Background: Diet and {{lifestyle}} are modifiable factors {{involved in the}} development and prevention of non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Nut consumption, particularly walnut intake, has been inversely related to incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational studies and to improved lipid profiles in short-term feeding trials. Objective: To assess the potential functional effect associated with the regular consumption of walnut-enriched <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> products in subjects at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design: A crossover single-dose bioavailability study (n = 3) using γ-tocopherol as exposure marker and a crossover unblinded dietary intervention study (5 weeks) in subjects at risk (n = 25). Dietary intervention consisted of regular consumption of the meat product, with or without walnuts, five times per week for five weeks with a 1 -month washout in between. Overnight fasting blood samples were collected on days 0, 12, 21, 28 and 35, coinciding with blood pressure and body weight recordings. Participants were asked to complete a diet record throughout the study. The functional effects were assessed using clinically relevant and related biomarkers of CHD: serum total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerols, homocysteine, vitamins B 6 and B 12, folic acid, α-tocopherol and platelet function test (obturation time). Results: The regular consumption of walnut-enriched meat products compared with that of the <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> products without added walnuts provokes a decrease in total cholesterol of 6. 8 mg/dl (CI 95 %: - 12. 8, - 0. 85). Compared to baseline (mixed diet), meat products with walnuts decreased total cholesterol (- 10. 7 mg/dl, CI 95 %: - 17. 1, - 4. 2), LDL cholesterol (- 7. 6 mg/dl, CI 95 %: - 2. 2, - 13. 0) and body weight (- 0. 5 kg, CI 95 %: - 0. 1, - 0. 9) and increased γ-tocopherol (8. 9 mg/dl, CI 95 %: 1. 0, 16. 8). Conclusions: The <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> products with added walnuts supplied in this study can be considered functional foods for subjects at high risk for CVD, as their regular consumption provokes a reduction in total cholesterol of 4. 5 % with respect to baseline values (mixed diet) and 3 % with respect to the <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> without walnuts.

40|$|Recent {{international}} agreements for controlling emissions {{of greenhouse gases}} have focused the attention of both the climate research and policy communities on strategies for reducing the production and emission of these radiatively active substances. Most approaches have adopted a 2 ̆ 2 top down 2 ̆ 2 perspective, where mitigation strategies are framed at the level of national governments. However, emissions occur at local, rather than national scales. We describe a study aimed at documenting greenhouse gas emissions from a local area in the High Plains of southwestern Kansas that is currently undergoing marked economic change and population increase in response to <b>restructuring</b> of the <b>meat</b> packing industry. We estimate volume and source of emissions for three greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, and contrast the relative importance of gas emissions at the local, state, and national level. The relative amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and the processes that produce them were found to vary considerably across these three geographic scales. In the study area, agribusiness is the leading source of methane and the greatest overall contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Utilities and the natural gas industry contributed the largest amounts of carbon dioxide, ranking second and third in overall contribution to greenhouse gas levels, respectively. The proportion of total global warming potential (GWP) contributed by CH. is somewhat higher at the local level than at the state or national levels.

The effect of two muscle types (i. e. white-glycolytic (W) and red-oxidative (R)) and frozen storage (lasting 0, 30, 60 and 90 days) on quality characteristics were assessed. Significant differences were found between the W and R Iberian restructured preparations in most physicochemical and some colour, texture and sensory traits, and in the fatty acid profile and oxidative measurements, sug-gesting that the R muscles are more suitable; however, the microbial contamination should be reduced. Frozen storage reduced but did not eliminate the initial microbial contamination, and it enhanced some quality traits in the Iberian restructured preparations, i. e. increased a * values, cohesiveness and juiciness and decreased adhesiveness and pastiness, without negatively affecting any parameter.

40|$|Origin- claimed food {{products}} mainstream gives diverse features over the world. The food labelling practices based on origin or provenance are frequently {{developed as a}} reaction to global trading system: private and NGO's initiatives (Fair Trade), enterprises in UK (Local Foods) and USA (Food Alliance), medals for winners in local exhibitions awards, or public regulation in European Union (PDO, PGI, Organic Farming). These practices claim at reaching consumer expectations. For a consumer who is frequently being uprooted and is stressed by his/her urban environment, the emotional content of where one's food is produced is greater than ever. With a longing for one's home, the consumer becomes an identity seeker. Origin, organic or fair trade {{food products}} respond to this need of native tangs revival. Such food products help consumer to identify his/her lost roots, to have recall of exotic holidays, to resist against ethical values' decline and finally to accept globalisation of food trading system. Because of their historical and cultural content, these foods give a meaning to taste. The demand for origin, organic and fair- trade food products is to be found somewhere between lifestyle habits and changes. The future of these products is supported, strangely enough, by the development of novel food products such as fat - or sugar - free foods, <b>restructured</b> <b>meat,</b> alcohol- free wine, and GMOs. The reference to tradition makes modernity tolerable. The arrival of High Tech food products should also result in a demand for compensatory products, and thereby favour those that can help to remove the guilty feelings of ready- to- eat consumers. Therefore, origin-, organic- and fair- trade- labelled foods seem to contribute to the modern food globalisation. The paper focuses on the place of these products within European food consumption. It examines in turn the rare estimation of market share of labelled food products, and their consumers' perception and purchasing behaviour in different sales channels, with a special focus on fair- trade and organic farming. It concludes with consideration of the marketing dynamics, which should be followed in order to favour consumption of origin- claimed food products. fair- trade, organic farming, consumer expectations, food, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{have become}} very {{conscious}} about their nutrition and well being due to changes in their socio-economic lifestyle and rapid urbanization. Therefore, development of technology for production of low cost and functional meat products is urgently required. One such approach is innovative restructuring technology in which binding of meat pieces still remains the main challenge and extension of product is generally associated with poor binding and texture. Thus, {{the present study was}} envisaged as an attempt to solve this problem by the incorporation of flaxseed flour (FF) as bind enhancing agent. The FF was used at three different levels viz., 0. 5 %, 1 %, and 1. 5 % to replace lean meat in pre-standardized restructured mutton chops formulation. The products were subjected to analysis for physico-chemical, sensory and textural properties. Cooking yield, moisture percentage and fat percentage increased with increase in the level of incorporation of FF, however, protein percent and pH decreased with increase in the level of incorporation. Shear force value of product incorporated with 1. 5 % FF was significantly higher (p< 0. 01) than control and product containing 0. 5 % FF level. Among the sensory attributes, product with 1 % flaxseed flour showed significantly higher values (p< 0. 05) for general appearance, binding, texture and overall acceptability. Hardness showed significant increasing (p< 0. 01) values with increasing levels of incorporation of flaxseed flour, however all other parameters of texture profile analysis showed a decreasing trend. On the basis of sensory scores and physico-chemical properties, the optimum incorporation level of FF was adjudged as 1 %. Products incorporated with optimum level of flaxseed flour (1 %) were also assessed for water activity and microbiological quality during the storage period of 15 days. It was found that the extended restructured product could be safely stored under refrigeration (4 °C± 1 °C) in low density polyethylene (LDPE) pouches for 15 days without marked deterioration in sensory and microbiological quality.

Comparou-se a influência das modificações nas formulações e processos de fabricação de uma carne suína reestrurada, pré-cozida e congelada, através de análises físicas, químicas, sensoriais e de custos de matérias primas. Em linhas gerais, o processamento desenvolvido nessa pesquisa envolve a mistura de carne cortada em cubos a 1 °C, com adição de sal, tripolifosfato e gelo em escamas, até que ocorra uma intensa liberação de proteínas miofibrilares. Adiciona-se, então a carne moída, a 1 °C, e os demais ingredientes, misturando até que a massa atinja 5 °C, quando é adicionada a gordura e mais gelo. Mistura-se por mais 4 min., sem vácuo, e mais 1, 5 min. sob vácuo. O embutimento da massa é feito em envoltório de poliamida e o cozimento com elevação gradual da temperatura da água até o produto atingir 72 °C. O produto é, então, resfriado, fatiado, embalado à vácuo e armazenado a - 18 °C. As fatias são aquecidas em chapa elétrica a temperatura de 180 °C até atingirem a temperatura interna de 75 °C, antes das análises sensoriais, de cor e textura objetivas. Avaliou-se sensorialmente os tratamentos do experimento 1 através de teste triangular, onde verificou-se diferença (p 0, 05) nas medidas de LH (luminosidade), aH (teor de vermelho) e bH (teor de amarelo) entre os tratamentos A e B. Os valores TBA encontrados foram de 0, 5 e 0, 6 mg malonaldeídolkg de amostra para os tratamentos B e A respectivamente, não observando-se diferença significativa. A avaliação sensorial não revelou diferença significativa quanto a preferência em relação a suculência entre os tratamentos, que receberam pontuação média de 4, 68 (TratA) e 5, 74 (TratB), próximas do valor 5, considerado ideal. Também não houve diferença estatística para sabor e aceitação global, porém, o TratB obteve valores de avaliação um pouco superiores ao TratA. No experimento 2, estudou-se a substituição parcial e total da carne de pernil por carne de paleta, para reduzir os custos da formulação. Comparou-se três formulações contendo carragena, STP e água, denominadas tratamentos 1, 2 e 3. O Tratl contendo 100 % de carne de pernil suíno; o Trat 2 com 50 % carne de pernil e 50 % carne de paleta, e o Trat 3 com 100 % carne de paleta. Não houve diferenças (p> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas medldas de cor, exceto para a medida aH (p 0, 05) entre os tratamentos. Também não houve diferença (p. 0, 05) na aceitação das amostras, porém, o Trat 2 apresentou escores um pouco superiores aos demais. No experimento 3, estudou-se a influência do congelamento rápido criogênico, com gás de nitrogênio líquido (TratR), em comparação com o congelamento convencional (Trat C) em carne suína reestruturada, durante a estocagem em freezer a - 18 °C. Calculou-se as formulações dos dois tratamentos para serem isoprotéicas e com baixo teor de gordura, utilizando-se a mistura comercial de carragena e tripolifosfato. Não se detectou diferença (p> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas medidas de cor feitas nas porções pré-cozidas frias. Porém, após o aquecimento, observou-se diferenças (p 0, 05) entre os tratamentos, porém o Trat R apresentou valores menores tanto para o pico 1 como para a força máxima. Os valores TBA apresentaram aumento linear relativamente intenso nas três primeiras semanas e um aumento relativamente mais lento nas semanas seguintes. Os valores de TBA para o Trat R foram inferiores aos do Trat C. Não se detectou qualquer tendência de aumento ou redução de valores sensoriais quanto ao sabor que pudessem ser relacionados aos valores TBA. Three {{experiments were}} carried out with the following objectives: (1) to {{study the effects of}} partial replacement of fat by water using 0, 6 % of a commercial mixture (Bekaplus C 4 @) of carrageenan and sodium trypoliphosfate (stp) in equal parts; (2) to evaluate the possibility of partial and total replacement of boneless fresh pork ham by blade plus shoulder meat, and (3) to quantify the influence of two freezing methods - cryogenic versus conventional - on the <b>restructured</b> <b>meat</b> portions. The effects of these changes in fonnulation and processing of the restructured, precooked and frozen pork were compared through physical, chemical, sensorial and raw material cost analysis. In general tenns, the processing methods, developed in this research, involve the mixture of chunked meat (at 1 °C) with addition of salt, stp and flaked ice, until the release of a fair amount of myofibrilar proteins. Ground meat trimmings (at 1 °C) and the other ingredients were then added while mixing until the temperature of the meat reaches 5 C, when more flaked ice and fat trimmings are added. The meat batch is then mixed for another 4 min. with the blender (or tumbler) lid opened, and 1, 5 min. under vacuum. Stuffing is made in poliamide casings and the cooking process is done by gradual rise of the water temperature until the internal product reaches 72 °C. The product is then chilled, sliced, vacuum packed and kept at - 18 °C. The experiment 1 treatments were evaluated through a sensory analysis triangle test and later through a preference test for flavor, tenderness, juiciness and global acceptance. In the experiment 2, it was applied a difference test with a structured hedonic scale. In the experiment 3, a scale was used to measure the intensity of characteristic, strange, and rancid fat (WOF) taste throughout the frozen storage period. Objective color measurements of LH, aH and bH were made with a Minolta CR 300 colorimeter, and objective texture measurements of peak 1 and maximum force were determined with a TA. XT 2 / 25 texture system coupled with a burger punch device. In the experiment 1, two formulations with the same protein level, labeled treatments A and B, were compared. Treatment A was calculated to have 16 % fat and 65 % moisture, and Treat. B, with carrageenan and stp to have 8 % fat and 73 % moisture. There was a difference (p 0, 05) between treatments A and B, for LH (luminance), aH (redness), and bH (yellowness) values. The TBA number for treatments A and B were 0, 5 and 0, 6 mg malonaldehydelkg of sample, and no signifícant difference was found. No difference (p> 0, 05) was found for juiciness between A and B treatments, with scores of 4, 68 (A) and 5, 74 (B), close to 5, which was previously established as the most desirable score for this trait. Also, no signifícant differences were found for flavor and general acceptance, but Treat. B had slightly higher scores than Treat A. In the experiment 2, the partial and total replacement of ham by blade plus shoulder were intended to reduce formulation costs. Three formulations containing carrageenan, stp and water, were labeled treatments 1, 2 and 3. Treatment 1 had 100 % ofthe meat from ham; Treat. 2 had 50 % ofthe meat from ham and 50 % from blade plus shoulder, and Treat 3 had 100 % ofthe meat from blade plus shoulder. There were no differences (p> 0, 05) between treatments for color measurements of the non-heated samples, except for aH value (p< 0, 05). However, differences (p< 0, 05) were found for the LH and bH values measured on the heated samples. The objective analyses of texture have not shown any difference among treatments. Also, there was no detectable sensorial differences, but Treat 2 had slightly higher scores than the other two. In the experiment 3, the influence offast cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen gas (Treat. R) compared to the conventional freezing (Treat. C) on the restructured pork during frozen storage at - 18 °C was studied. The formulations for both treatments were calculated to have equal composition, with a low fat content and 0, 6 % of the commercial rnixture of carrageenan and stp. No differences (P. 0, 05) were found between treatments for the color measurements made on the non-heated samples, but differences (p 0, 05) between treatments in the objective texture analysis, but Treat. R showed smaller peak 1 and maximum force values. The TBA number showed strong linear increases in the fírst two weeks and slower increases in the following weeks. TBA numbers for Treat. R were lower than for Treat. C, but were not statistically compared. No trend of increase or reduction in the sensorial nevalution of flevor scores was detected that coyld be related to TBA numbers...|$|E
