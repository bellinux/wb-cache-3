500|$|Several weeks later, Hastings {{represented}} Mosley {{and three}} {{other members of the}} British Union of Fascists (BUF) in a criminal case after they were indicted for [...] "causing a riotous assembly" [...] on 9 October 1934 at a BUF meeting. The trial opened at the Sussex Assizes on 18 December 1934 in front of Mr Justice Branson, with Hastings for the defence and John Flowers KC prosecuting. According to Mosley, Hastings told him that Flowers, a former cricketer, had a poor reputation at the bar, and that Mosley should not show him up too much. The prosecution claimed that after a BUF meeting, Mosley and the other defendants had marched around Worthing, threatening and assaulting civilians. Hastings argued that the defendants had been deliberately provoked by a crowd of civilians, and several witnesses testified that the crowd had been throwing tomatoes and threatening Mosley. The judge eventually directed the jury to return a verdict of [...] "not guilty". Hastings and Mosley were less successful in another libel action, against the Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen who had accused him of instructing his blackshirts to arm themselves. The defence, led by D. N. Pritt KC, called several witnesses to a fight in Manchester between blackshirts and their opponents. Hastings, taking the view that the incident was too long in the past to be relevant, did not call any <b>rebutting</b> <b>evidence.</b> Although Mosley won the case, he was awarded only a farthing in damages, traditionally a way for the jury to indicate that the case should not have been brought.|$|E

However, rebuttal is one of the few vehicles whereby a party may introduce surprise evidence or witnesses. The basic process is as follows: both sides of a controversy are obliged to declare in advance of trial what witnesses they plan to call, and what each witness is expected to testify to. When either a plaintiff (or prosecutor) or defendant brings direct evidence or testimony which was not anticipated, the other side may be granted a specific opportunity to rebut it. In rebuttal, the rebutting party may generally bring witnesses and evidence which were never before declared, so long as they serve to <b>rebut</b> the prior <b>evidence.</b>|$|R

5000|$|If {{necessary}} <b>rebutting</b> <b>evidence</b> may be called, {{the prosecutor}} {{is not allowed}} to reply {{in the case of the}} defendant. On the completion of the evidence the court proceeds to convict or acquit. Where the case is proved but is trifling the court may, without proceeding to conviction, make an order dismissing the information subject to payment of damages for injury or compensation for loss up to fio or any higher limit fixed by statute as to the offence, and costs, or discharging the accused conditionally on his giving security for good behaviour and on paying damages and costs (1907, c. 17, s. I [...] ). To this order probationary conditions may be attached (s. 2). Subject to this provision, the punishment depends, as a general rule on the statute or by-law that defines the offence, and consists in imprisonment and (or) fine, except in cases where a minimum fine is stipulated for by a treaty, &c., with a foreign state, e.g. in sea fishery conventions. The court may mitigate the fine in the case of a first offence, even in a revenue case, or may reduce the period of imprisonment and impose it without hard labour, or substitute a fine not exceeding 25 for imprisonment. A scale is prescribed for imprisonment on failure to pay money, fines, or costs, adjudged to be paid on a conviction, or in default of a sufficient distress to satisfy the sum adjudged (1879, s. 5). Instead of sending the defendant to prison for not paying fine and costs the court may direct its levy by distress warrant, or may accept payment by instaiments. In the case of distress the wearing apparel and bedding of the defendant and his family, and to the value of 15 the tools and implements of his trade, may not be taken (act of 1879, s. 21). If the defendant after going to prison can pay part of the money his imprisonment is reduced proportionally (Prison Act 1898, s. 9). The imprisonment is without hard labour unless hard labour is specially authorized by the act on which the conviction is founded. The maximum term of imprisonment without the option of a fine is in most cases six months, but depends on the particular statute. Imprisonment under order of a court of summary jurisdiction is in the common gaol (5 Hen. IV. c. so), i.e. in a local prison declared by the home secretary to be the common gaol for the county, &c., for which the court acts. The place of imprisonment during remands or in the case of youthful offenders may in certain cases be elsewhere than in a prison.|$|E
40|$|Any {{reasoning}} system is fallible, so crew members and flight controllers {{must be able}} to cross-check automated diagnoses of spacecraft or habitat problems by considering alternate diagnoses and analyzing related evidence. Cross-checking improves diagnostic accuracy because people can apply information processing heuristics, pattern recognition techniques, and reasoning methods that the automated diagnostic system may not possess. Over time, cross-checking also enables crew members to become comfortable with how the diagnostic {{reasoning system}} performs, so the system can earn the crew s trust. We developed intelligent data visualization software that helps users cross-check automated diagnoses of system faults more effectively. The user interface displays scrollable arrays of timelines and time-series graphs, which are tightly integrated with an interactive, color-coded system schematic to show important spatial-temporal data patterns. Signal processing and rule-based diagnostic reasoning automatically identify alternate hypotheses and data patterns that support or rebut the original and alternate diagnoses. A color-coded matrix display summarizes the supporting or <b>rebutting</b> <b>evidence</b> for each diagnosis, and a drill-down capability enables crew members to quickly view graphs and timelines of the underlying data. This system demonstrates that modest amounts of diagnostic reasoning, combined with interactive, information-dense data visualizations, can accelerate system diagnosis and cross-checking...|$|E

5000|$|The {{second issue}} was whether, by {{providing}} library patrons {{with access to}} photocopiers, the library was implicitly authorizing copyright infringement. McLachlin dismissed this argument by stating that providing access to a machine {{that could be used}} to infringe copyright does not suggest sufficient [...] "authorization" [...] to violate copyright. It is presumed that a patron with access to the machines would use them lawfully. However the presumption can be <b>rebutted</b> by <b>evidence</b> that shows [...] "a certain relationship or degree of control existed between the alleged authorizer and the persons who committed the copyright infringement". The publishers presented no such evidence. The fact that the library posted a notice to patrons stating that photocopiers should not be used to infringe on copyrights was not an acknowledgment that such infringement occurred. Finally, the Law Society did not have direct control of its patrons, as with a master-servant relationship, and therefore could not be said that it exercised control over its patrons.|$|R

40|$|This {{position}} paper argues that students' understanding {{and acceptance of}} evolution may be supported, rather than hindered, by classroom discussion of creationism. Parallels are drawn between creationism and other scientific misconceptions, both {{of the scientific community}} in the past and of students in the present. Science teachers frequently handle their students' misconceptions as they arise by offering appropriate socio-cognitive conflict, which highlights reasons to disbelieve one idea and to believe another. It is argued that this way of working, rather than outlawing discussion, is more scientific and more honest. Scientific truth does not win the day by attempting to deny its opponents a voice but by engaging them with evidence. Teachers can be confident that evolution has nothing to fear from a free and frank discussion in which claims can be <b>rebutted</b> with <b>evidence.</b> Such an approach is accessible to children of all ages and is ultimately more likely to drive out pre-scientific superstitions. It also models the scientific process more authentically and develops students' ability to think critically...|$|R
5000|$|The {{court said}} that [...] "a variety of factors can rebut a prima facie case." [...] The fact that the {{government}} can establish a prima facie case through evidence on only one factor, market concentration, does not negate the possible breadth of the analysis: [...] "Evidence of market concentration simply provides a convenient starting point for a broader inquiry into future competitiveness." [...] The court pointed to examples such as United States v. General Dynamics Corp., in which the Court held that the presumption raised by a combined market share of 50% in a concentrated market was <b>rebutted</b> by <b>evidence</b> of [...] "weak competitive stature." [...] The court cited other cases in which a [...] "multiplicity of relevant factors" [...] were considered as rebutting the presumption. In the case before it, the HHUDR market involved sales of from 20 to 40 units a year, so that market share statistics were unreliable and misleading. Further, the customers were highly sophisticated and purchased on the basis of competitive bidding. This too undercut the significance of the government's statistics.|$|R
50|$|Evidentiary {{standards}} are codified by the Evidence Act of 2005. The Act includes many modern, liberal English common law provisions including {{the exclusion of}} evidence that is unfairly prejudicial, exclusion of evidence of attempts to settle outside court, and exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures. The Act, however, does not guarantee parties before a court to confront the witnesses against them when the court believes the witness' identity needs to be protected. Physical evidence on an issue renders documentary evidence on the same issue inadmissible unless the court finds there is substantive and reasonable ground for the physical evidence to be untrue and irrelevant. Thus, judges retain {{a high level of}} discretion in the admission of evidence in all cases and the ability to <b>rebut</b> witness <b>evidence</b> in certain others. Witnesses may be impeached by prior inconsistent statements or by evidence of prior bad acts involving dishonesty or fraud. There are also provisions protecting witnesses and victims of sexual crimes which render evidence about the witness or victim's sexual behavior inadmissible in most situations. Hearsay (including non-hearsay and hearsay exceptions), party admissions, burdens, and presumptions are also codified in a fashion similar to the United States Federal Rules of Evidence.|$|R
40|$|The {{oxygenation}} of the Earth's {{atmosphere was}} {{of great importance}} because it dramatically altered the evolutionary paths of organisms. It is widely accepted that the oxygenation of the previously anaerobic Earth was initiated by the oxygenic photosynthesis of cyanobacteria. However, {{our understanding of the}} key steps and timing of oxygenation is still limited. The presence of cyanobacteria at least as early as 2. 7 Ga has been suggested by the presence of 2 -methylhopanes, diagnostic biomarkers for cyanobacteria. This is well before the Great Oxidation Event at 2. 4 Ga, when atmospheric free oxygen first appeared in appreciable quantities on the Earth. However, some researchers have <b>rebutted</b> this <b>evidence,</b> by demonstrating that some of the biomarkers are contaminants. The purpose of our research is to critically assess the evidence for cyanobacteria at 2. 7 - 2. 8 Ga by focusing on the record preserved in the Fortescue Group of the Pilbara region in Western Australia. The Fortescue Group crops out over a large area and drill core of the group is also available. The rocks are of a very low metamorphic grade (prehnite-pumpellyite facies), and they contain microfossils, abundant stromatolites, and hydrocarbon biomarkers. Extraction of hydrocarbons is being performed on carbonates and cher ts containing stromatolites, and early results will be reported. 1 page(s...|$|R
