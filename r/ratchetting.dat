40|$|Many {{components}} in conventional {{and nuclear power}} plants and chemical plants {{are likely to be}} subjected to 'severe' loading conditions, i. e. loads which would cause cyclic plastic straining and/or incremental deformation (i. e. <b>ratchetting).</b> For operating temperatures above the creep threshold, creep strain also occurs, which may exacerbate the <b>ratchetting</b> of components. If <b>ratchetting</b> occurs, the components may fail either due to excessive deformation so that the components cannot function properly or due to incremental collapse. For simple component geometries, loadings and material behaviour models, the mechanism of <b>ratchetting</b> and the behaviour of components are well understood and analytical solutions (closed form or simplified model) are available. However, for components with complicated stress distributions, loading and material behaviour, the mechanisms of <b>ratchetting</b> are not fully understood and closed form solutions, in general, cannot be obtained. An understanding of the mechanisms of <b>ratchetting</b> is important as an aid to the design process and to apply bounding techniques. Also information on the effect of the material <b>ratchetting</b> phenomena on the <b>ratchetting</b> of components is still scarce. Components with different geometries and loading conditions have been analysed by using the finite element method. The results have been used to investigate <b>ratchetting</b> mechanisms and to obtain ratchet strain data. The effects of complete stress redistributions due to creep have also been investigated. The effects of material <b>ratchetting</b> on the behaviour of components were also investigated.

This technique builds on a previously developed critical plane concept that has been used to calculate the number of cycles to crack initiation in rolling contact fatigue under <b>ratchetting</b> failure conditions. The critical element concept simplifies the analytical difficulties of critical plane analysis. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to identify the critical element in the mesh, and then the strain values of the critical element are used to calculate the <b>ratchetting</b> rate analytically.

40|$|Kinematic {{hardening}} and {{the associated}} concept of back-stress and its evolution are fundamental constitutive ingredients of classical plasticity theory used to simulate the inelastic material response under stress reversals. Cyclic plasticity addresses such response under a sequence of repeated stress reversals, which results in plastic strain accumulation, called <b>ratchetting.</b> Biaxial <b>ratchetting</b> occurs whenever the material is loaded in two directions although typically the cyclic loading is only in one direction. The realistic description of the material response during cyclic loading depends strongly {{on the kind of}} kinematic hardening used. This paper investigates the performance of some existing and novel kinematic hardening rules in the prediction of <b>ratchetting.</b> The multiplicative AF model by Dafalias et al. (2008 a,b), which was originally applied to the simulation of uniaxial <b>ratchetting,</b> will be used here to simulate also biaxial <b>ratchetting</b> and will be compared with a model using the concept of a hardening stress threshold. The suggestion of Delobelle et al. (1995) to combine the Armstrong/Frederick and Burlet and Cailletaud (1986) kinematic hardening rules is incorporated in the aforementioned model and used to obtain improved simulations of biaxial <b>ratchetting.</b> After showing a deficiency of the foregoing suggestion which results in the possibility for the back-stress to cross it's bounding surface and induce a negative plastic modulus, a variation is proposed void of the foregoing deficiency, which is successfully tested in the simulation of multiple biaxial <b>ratchetting</b> experimental results on carbon steel 1026.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of T terms in the evolution equation of kinematic hardening on the prediction of a viscoplastic material model of the Chaboche type was studied under thermomechanical loading of the austenitic steel AISI 316 L(N). T terms considerably influence the <b>ratchetting</b> behavior predicted by the material model under cyclic thermomechanical loads. The known material models of the Caboche type {{with or without a}} T term do not describe the <b>ratchetting</b> behavior under thermomechanical loading in an adequate manner. During the investigations presented here, T terms known from literature were considered and new T terms were developed with the objective of improving the model prediction of the <b>ratchetting</b> behavior. Thermodynamic consistency of the modified material model was evaluated. Uniaxial isothermal experiments were performed at several temperatures for parameter determination. In addition, uniaxial thermomechanical experiments were carried out for model verification. For the performance of these experiments, a one-bar test system was designed. In addition, thermomechanical experiments were planned and performed using a two-bar test system for the purpose of model verification. These experiments were carried out in cooperation with the Institute of Materials Research I of Karlsruhe University. The model parameters for the temperature range between 200 C and 650 C were determined as a basis for modeling the thermomechanical alternating load deformation behavior of the material AISI 316 L(N). In both the cyclic thermomechanical experiments using the one-bar system and the cyclic thermomechanical experiments using the two-bar system <b>ratchetting</b> strains of up to 1 % were observed. Usually, the <b>ratchetting</b> rate was found to decrease considerably {{in the course of the}} first load cycles. In several experiments, the decrease in the <b>ratchetting</b> rate was found to be rather significant such that a saturation of <b>ratchetting</b> strain was observed after few load cycles already. In other experiments, this saturation of <b>ratchetting</b> strain is to be expected after a higher number of load cycles only. It was explained that <b>ratchetting</b> mainly results from the temperature dependence of the material properties. Comparison of model prediction with the experiment has demonstrated that the T term proposed in this work leads to a significantly improved description of the <b>ratchetting</b> behavior of the material AISI 316 L(N).

40|$|Abstract: In the {{framework}} of crystal plasticity, a new cyclic polycrystalline viscoplastic model is constructed to describe the uniaxial <b>ratchetting</b> of a body centered cubic (BCC) metal. At the intra-granular scale, a combined kinematic hardening rule similar to the Ohno-Abdel-Karim model is employed to address the <b>ratchetting</b> within each single crystal grain; and two sets of slip systems with different resistances to dislocation slip, i. e., primary and secondary ones, are considered to capture the physical nature of dislocation slips in a body centered cubic (BCC) metal. At the inter-granular scale, an explicit transition rule is adopted to extend the single crystal approach into a polycrystalline version. It is shown that the proposed model describes the uniaxial <b>ratchetting</b> of annealed 42 CrMo steel, a body centered cubic (BCC) metal, reasonably. Also, it is seen that the crystal orientation influences significantly the <b>ratchetting</b> of body-centered cubic (BCC) single crystals...|$|E
40|$|Many {{components}} in conventional {{and nuclear power}} plant, chemical plant and aero engines may be subjected to severe loading conditions, i. e. loads which cause reverse plasticity and/or incremental growth (<b>Ratchetting).</b> If operating temperatures are high, creep strains may also be significant and may exacerbate the <b>ratchetting</b> process. Also the residual stress fields associated with the cycling of load in the plastic region for a material will influence the accumulation of strain during the dwell periods between cycles when steady loading is sustained. Some analytical solutions for the cyclic behaviour of simple components and loadings are available, however very little information {{on the effects of}} stress concentrations and complex loading conditions on <b>ratchetting</b> is published. A better understanding of the mechanisms of <b>ratchetting</b> for complex components and loadings is essential in order to identify characteristic behaviours which can be used to aid the design process for {{components in}} potential <b>ratchetting</b> situations. A range of component geometries, uniform sections and stress concentrations, and loading conditions have been analysed by the finite element method to investigate <b>ratchetting</b> mechanisms and to obtain ratchet and dwell period strain data. The effects of stress concentrations, material behaviour models, loading conditions and stress redistribution due to creep on <b>ratchetting</b> mechanisms and strain accumulations are described. Dwell period creep effects are bounded by the 'no creep' (zero dwell period) condition {{on the one hand and}} by complete redistribution between cycles at the other extreme. The results of the analyses have been successfully used to 'extend existing approximate design rules for simple components to these more complex components and loadings. It has been shown that reasonable estimates (in some cases exact solutions) can be obtained from either a limited finite element analysis or by using approximate methods of solution. Comparisons between experimental <b>ratchetting</b> data for two components made from a lead alloy material and equivalent finite element predictions are presented. Simple material behaviour models are used and the results highlight both the benefits and shortfalls of these models. Improvements to modelling techniques for more accurate predictions are suggested although it is shown that, in certain circumstances, more realistic material behaviour modelling is unwarranted...|$|E
