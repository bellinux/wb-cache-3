In {{order to establish}} this, a ‘total chain approach’ must be followed, starting with the consumer. In this paper the cut flower logistical chain is partly analyzed {{by focusing on the}} consumer. A model -of the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> by consumers has been developed. In the model both consumers' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> offered, and consumers' <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> expectations are assumed to affect perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> quality, which, in turn, affects consumer satisfaction/dissatisfaction. Survey analysis of Dutch consumers, with roses as the product under investigation, was used to quantify the relationships in the model with regard to <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> provided by specialist retail florists. The relationships in the model were analyzed by means of regression analysis. The insights in the use <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> as a marketing instrument, obtained from this study, can be used in order to develop effective service programs throughout the floral distribution channel...|$|R

Nigeria, {{notorious for}} its overdependence on oil, is the eighth largest oil {{producer}} in the world, {{and the largest}} in Africa. Yet, instead of transforming the country {{into one of the}} most prosperous in the continent, Nigeria's abundant natural resources have enriched a small minority while the vast majority remains impoverished (Manby, 1999). However, Increased privatization, foreign investment, globalization and competition have served to stimulate growth and competition in the service sector and the economy as a whole (Oshikoya, 2008). This study explored the role and definition <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> in service companies located in Lagos, the financial, economic and business capital of Nigeria, and how <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> practices are evolving in response to changes in the economy. Interviews with upper level managers in targeted areas were analyzed through thematic analysis (Boyatzis, 1998) to draw insights into the emergent <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> culture in Lagos. Five themes and multiple sub-­‐themes emerged in analysis. Themes included: conceptualization <b>of</b> quality <b>customer</b> <b>service,</b> importance <b>of</b> quality <b>customer</b> <b>service,</b> facilitation <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> goals, current Nigerian <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> and barriers to development <b>of</b> quality <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Themes and sub-­‐themes reflected participants‘ views of the importance <b>of</b> quality <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> to their organizations, the service sector and the economy, and their optimism about the growth <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> within Nigerian organizatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> and the {{relationship}} with level of patronage in the Nigerian aviation industry by comparing the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>services</b> <b>of</b> Aero contractors and Arik air using Port Harcourt international airport. The survey method was used for data collection. In order to effectively determine the service gap of the airlines, a 5 point Likert scale measurement was used to measure the customer satisfaction level, a regression analysis was done to determine the relationship between service quality and the airlines patronage and lastly the correlation analysis was carried out to determine if there is a relationship and to what extent it exists between the patronage of passengers and their servqual index. Thus the study found revealed that the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> in Nigerias‟ local airline industry is relatively low. The two airlines under study have poor servqual index; of - 0. 199 for Aero Contractors and - 0. 073 for Arik air. It was further revealed that patronage is not strongly dependent on the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service,</b> that is there is no significant relationship between the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> (offered by both airlines) and the level of patronage from passenger...|$|R
40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> {{ideas in}} {{government}} {{continues to be}} wide- spread, although the concept {{and its implications for}} public sector service production and delivery remain poorly developed. This paper presents a series of paradoxes related to <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> and its use in government. The central and most troubling paradox is that <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> techniques and tools applied to government may lead to increased political inequality even as some aspects of service are improved. The argument is structured by examination of the following: the predominant structural features of service management in the private sector, the assumption that customer satisfac- tion is a central objective of service firms, the understanding <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> that informs current federal reform efforts, and the operational and political challenges <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> as a public management objective...|$|R
40|$|This study {{measures}} expectations <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> {{and perceptions}} <b>of</b> outcome for 183 customers and 81 {{employees in the}} Pilgrims Management and Fund Board in Malaysia. The data collection strategy used {{is that of the}} triangulation method. The findings from structured questionnaires were supplemented by interviews where possible and selected observation of operations. The structured questionnaire was statistically analysed by SPSS computer programme. Gaps are detected between :- customers' expectation and employees' perception of that expectation (Gap A),- customers' and employees' perception of the service delivery process during and after transaction (Gaps A&B),- customers' expectation and their overall perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> delivery. The first mentioned is greater than the second mentioned in each case. Parameters which give rise to customers' expectation were further explored. Gender, age, marital status,educational level, income, media exposure and a monopoly supplier situation were found not to have a significant correlation with expectation. Dwelling area was significantly correlated but in the opposite way to the expected; the less sophisticated rural dwellers had higher expectation. Personality was inversely related,again contrary to the researcher's initial belief; weaker personalities had higher expectations. Only 2 out of 17 values are significantly correlated to customer expectation; mature love and self respect. Similarly parameters which may give rise to employees' perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> delivery were explored. Organizational climate, gender, age, marital status and length of service were found not to have a significant correlation with perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> delivery. However, the higher the position in the organization, educational level and salary (all of which may be auto correlated) the better the perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> delivery. It was found that the greater the value placed by the employees on the organizational offer the greater their perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> delivery. There is a distinct lack of significant correlation between cultural and environmental factors and expectation and perception <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Expectations are high even in unsophisticated areas and are not fully met. This suggest that expectation may be fundamental by-product of social interaction rather than the product of any particular kind of consumer culture. This in turn suggests that there were few barriers in Malaysia to the spread <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> ideas common in the west over a number of years...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{consumers}} demand {{much more}} than quality products – they also value the service that is provided in the retail environment highly (Arnold, 2003 : 78; Samson&Little, 1993 : 390) From retailers’ perspective, <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> may have become {{the only way to}} differentiate them from competitors because the products that they offer often differ insignificantly from one store to another. Excellent <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> therefore may be the only opportunity to attract and to attain customers {{to the extent that it}} results in store loyalty. Unfortunately limited research could be found on <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> that would conquer the hearts and wallets of consumers in specific retail settings for the sake of store loyalty. Extant research mostly address single, very specific elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> or <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> in general in terms of its effect on buyer behavior or store patronage in general. It was proposed that retailers could enhance customers’ repeat purchase behaviour if they could successfully increase customer satisfaction through improved service quality. In order to identify the elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> that are considered crucial in terms <b>of</b> excellent <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> and repeat purchase behaviour, an attempt was made to determine why consumers often divide their purchases across different supermarkets that apparently stock the same goods. The research thus required the identification of the elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> that individually and/or collectively affect consumers’ preference for specific supermarket/s and their probable repeat purchase behaviour. This study also explored how consumers rate the service of supermarkets and attempted to make suggestions in terms of how retailers could improve <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> to ensure consumer loyalty. The systems theory approach was used to guide discussions, as it enabled a study and understanding of the sequence, relationship and interdependency of fundamental elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> (as subsystems) within a larger complex system (retail environment). The cognitive perspective was incorporated in the discussion of the elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> as it enabled the understanding of customers’ interpretation <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Participants were recruited by means of snowball sampling within the area of Pretoria East in the geographical area of Tshwane. In this area, major supermarkets are located within close proximity, which is conducive for shop hopping. It was required that participants either resided and/or shopped in the specific area; they were from LSM groups 5 and higher; older than 25 years, but no requirements were set in terms of race or gender. A quantitative data collection method was used (a survey: questionnaire). A qualitative data collection technique (focus group discussions) was however implemented beforehand to include every day constructs and to include additional constructs that might have been overseen. It became evident that consumers apparently patronage different supermarkets on a regular basis and that the <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> some of the supermarkets are viewed significantly better than others. The elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> that are more severely criticized seem to be mostly PROCESS and PERSONNEL related. Through factor analysis and linear regression, three elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> were identified as those that are apparently regarded crucial in terms <b>of</b> excellent <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Two familiar elements, namely PROCESSES and PERSONNEL as well as a newly structured element, namely VALUE FOR MONEY was identified to design a model that depicts the elements <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> that were identified to be crucial in terms <b>of</b> excellent <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Dissertation (M (Consumer Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Excellent quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> is so {{important}} for government agencies {{even though they are}} not-for-profit. Better service enhances productivity, and treating customer right the first time saves time and money. Creating satisfied customers reduces the likelihood irate citizens take their complaints to higher sources, or to a public forum where negative word-of-mouth can be damaging. A common criticism of the public in Malaysia has been the poor quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> rendered by employees in government agencies. As the largest organization in Malaysia, the quality of service they provide has a tremendous influence on public perceptions of the quality of public service. A study was, therefore, performed to measure the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> provided by public agencies in Malaysia. Focus was given to the Road Transport Department as this study could not cater to all departments throughout the government agencies. One hundred respondents who experienced interactions with this department were chosen to participate in this study. They were required to answer online questionnaires and expressed their feedback regarding the quality <b>of</b> <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> this department provided. The result demonstrated that most of the respondents were unsatisfied with the quality <b>of</b> <b>Customer</b> <b>Service</b> Representatives, facilities, procedure/policies, and the atmosphere of the department itself.
