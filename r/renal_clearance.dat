5|$|Salicylates are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in <b>renal</b> <b>clearance</b> occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{measurement}} of <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> was adapted in a novel manner to the conscious marmoset. Twenty-four hours before an experiment, animals underwent surgery for placement of both femoral arterial and venous catheters. A catheter was also implanted into the urinary bladder through the abdominal wall. The urinary catheter consisted of two tubes. One tube was connected to a pump, which removed the urine, while the other tube remained open to prevent {{the formation of a}} vacuum inside the bladder. Using this technique, we kept <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> stable for at least 3 h. All catheters were removed the day after the clearance experiment, and the bladder was reconstructed using microsurgical techniques. The bladder operation did not appear to produce lasting anatomical or functional changes, since the animals were able to void spontaneously and, after 3 mo, the bladder had regained its normal size and shape. Reimplantation of both the vessel and bladder catheters at this time allowed for an additional study of <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> within the same animals. Administration of the renin inhibitor CGP 29287 (1 mg/kg) to furosemide-pretreated conscious marmosets lowered blood pressure and increased renal blood flow. Glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged by CGP 29287, leading to a fall in the effective filtration fraction. Urinary volume and urinary sodium excretion also were unchanged by the renin inhibitor. We describe a novel method for the study of <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> in a small conscious primate and suggest that the renin-angiotensin system {{plays an important role in}} the control of renal function in the sodium-depleted marmoset...|$|R

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} on {{the occurrence of}} spontaneous hypertension in dogs. All dogs with spontaneous hypertension exhibited normal renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Clearances on nephrogenic hypertensive dogs revealed that some exhibited normal kidney function, while others had significant depression of renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. In the latter, the filtration fraction {{may or may not}} be elevated. Serial <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> were done at intervals on 3 dogs with spontaneous hypertension during their 3 rd year of known hypertension. They exhibited no tendency to develop impaired renal function in the face of prolonged benign hypertension. Serial <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> on nephrogenic hypertensive dogs revealed no tendency for kidney function to become progressively impaired. This was true, whether the immediate postoperative clearance values were normal or depressed. It was also true regardless of the duration of the hypertension. It is suggested that mechanisms other than elevated blood pressure per se operate to produce progressive kidney damage and impairment of renal function. No tendency was revealed over the course of a year or more for the kidney function to improve in Goldblatt dogs exhibiting depressed clearances immediately postoperatively. This is interpreted as evidence against the postoperative development in persistently hypertensive Goldblatt dogs of a renal collateral circulation sufficient to augment significantly effective renal blood flow. Pathological studies on 2 dogs with spontaneous hypertension revealed slight to moderate chronic focal lesions in the kidneys, and bilateral adrenal cortical adenomatous hyperplasia. Both lesions may have no pathogenetic significance. In accord with previous observations, autopsies on 3 Goldblatt dogs revealed minimal renal changes in one, and unilateral kidney atrophy with contralateral hypertrophy in the 2 others. The adrenals were normal. In general, data on <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> showed correlation with postmortem kidney findings. However, normal <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> are found in the presence of anatomically abnormal kidneys.

Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose. [...] Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin.

40|$|Four {{patients}} with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina were studied, {{all of whom}} exhibited the hyperornithinemia characteristic of this disorder. Elevated plasma histidine and diminished plasma lysine and branched-chain amino acids were also noted. The <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> of these four amino acids were not sufficiently elevated to explain their low plasma levels. In one subject, an arginine-deficient diet led to progressive reduction in plasma ornithine from 13 times normal to the upper limits of normal, along with the disappearance of ornithinuria and lysinuria. Orally administered alpha-aminoisobutyric acid facilitated the fall in plasma ornithine by increasing renal losses of ornithine. It also increased the clearances of most other amino acids. When plasma ornithine approached normal (less than 200 microM), plasma lysine became normal, plasma arginine became subnormal, and <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> of basic amino acids decreased.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Residual renal {{function}} (RRF) contributes substantially to {{the adequacy}} of peritoneal dialysis (PD). In the presence of RRF, maintenance of an adequate fluid balance is facilitated, level of systemic inflammation is lower, and renal endocrine functions are preserved. The beneficial impact of RRF also {{may be related to}} the preservation of specific renal elimination mechanisms, such as tubular metabolism or secretion, which are crucial for the removal of some uremic retention solutes. METHODS: Time profiles of peritoneal and <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> of urea nitrogen (60 d), creatinine (113 d), phosphate (96 d), the middle molecule beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 M; 11. 8 kd), and the protein-bound solute p-cresol (108 d) were investigated prospectively in 24 incident PD patients. Data were analyzed by using the linear mixed models procedure. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7. 2 months (range, 5. 6 to 8. 6 months), RRF (P = 0. 001) and 24 -hour urine volume (P = 0. 004) declined significantly. Twenty-four-hour peritoneal drainage volume increased (P < 0. 0001). <b>Renal</b> <b>clearances</b> of urea nitrogen (P = 0. 0002), creatinine (P = 0. 001), and phosphate (P = 0. 001) decreased. Peritoneal clearances of these solutes increased (P = 0. 002, P < 0. 0001, and P < 0. 0001, respectively). There was a decline in <b>renal</b> <b>clearances</b> of beta 2 M (P = 0. 0004) and p-cresol (P < 0. 0001). No change in peritoneal clearances of these solutes was noted (P = 0. 188 and P = 0. 559, respectively). CONCLUSION: Increasing PD dose may compensate for deteriorating RRF with respect to the elimination of water-soluble solutes. This is not the case for the middle molecule beta 2 M and the protein-bound solute p-cresol. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this open-label study, the {{disposition}} of fleroxacin in liver disease in 12 healthy male volunteers, 6 male cirrhotics without ascites (group A), and 6 male cirrhotics with ascites (group B) was evaluated. Fleroxacin (400 mg) was administered orally and intravenously to each subject in a random crossover fashion. Fleroxacin was completely absorbed and achieved similar peak concentrations in plasma in all three study groups (P greater than 0. 05). The volume of distribution exceeded 1 liter/kg in healthy controls and was not affected by liver impairment (P greater than 0. 05).
