This paper presents measurements of fading on the modulated signal backscattered from a transponder for backscatter radio systems that use multiple antennas at the <b>interrogator</b> and <b>transponder.</b> Measurements were performed at 5. 8 GHz and estimates of the backscatter channel envelope distributions and fade margins were calculated. Results show that multipath fading can be re-duced using multiple <b>transponder</b> antennas, bistatic <b>interrogators</b> with widely separated transmitter and receiver antennas, and conventional diversity combining at the interrogator receiver.

The SRO-2 transponders installed in Soviet export MiGs enabled Cuban ground-controlled interception (GCI) radars to identify and control their fighters. A testbed EC-121 called Quick Look had flown with College Eye in January 1967 to test the QRC-248 and found that North Vietnamese MiGs used the same transponder. QRC-248 accurately discriminated MiG radar returns from the myriad returns picked up during a mission, and extended the range of low-altitude detection to more than 175 miles, covering virtually all important North Vietnamese target areas.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} {{one of the}} main {{problems}} of multitag passive transponders was the stack problem. The transponders became detuned if arranged in a stack. Hence they could not receive enough power delivered by the interrogator. In this communication we have shown how to solve the problem by empolying network theory. The behaviour of the transponders is determined by the mesh impedance matrix Z(M) of the transponder network. Hence the coil currents of the transponders reach no maximum at the frequency of the power transmitter if they get too close to another. Note that the solution proposed in this communication requires no modification of the existing passive transponders only of the interrogator. An external tuning device has to be added. Simulation results and measurements have confirmed that it works. In theory stacks of passive inductive transponders can now be powered at a fixed frequency within an ISM band. Simulations and measurements have verified that an additional maximum can be generated by an external tuning device and its frequency can be controlled by tuning the device. A demonstrator for an <b>interrogator</b> for <b>transponder</b> stacks is now under development...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of SSR/IFF equipment, i. e. the <b>transponder</b> or the <b>interrogator,</b> {{can be tested}} {{by means of an}} SSR/IFF test set, which is usually extremely expensive, hard to transport and requires end-user certificates.

Trains equipped with CBTC have a <b>transponder</b> <b>interrogator</b> antenna beneath each carriage, which communicates with the fixed trackside transponders and report the trains' location to a wayside Zone Controller via radio. Then, the Controller issues Movement Authorities to the trains. This technology upgrade will allow trains {{to be operated}} at closer distances, slightly increasing capacity; will allow the MTA {{to keep track of}} trains in real time and provide more information to the public regarding train arrivals and delays; and will obviate the need for complex interlocking towers. The trains are also equipped with high-tech computers inside the cab so that the conductor could monitor the train's speed and relative location. The wayside controllers themselves are located in enclosed boxes that can withstand floods and natural disasters. The traditional block systems will remain on these lines despite the installation of CBTC.|$|R
50|$|In 1940, English {{engineer}} Freddie Williams {{began work}} on the Mark III system at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, which was to become the standard for the Western Allies {{for most of the}} war. Mark III transponders were designed to respond to specific 'interrogators', rather than replying directly to received <b>radar</b> signals. These <b>interrogators</b> worked on a limited selection of frequencies, no matter what radar they were paired with. The system also allowed limited communication to be made, including the ability to transmit a coded 'Mayday' response. The IFF sets were designed and built by Ferranti in Manchester to Williams' specifications. Equivalent sets were manufactured in the US, initially as copies of British sets, so that allied aircraft would be identified upon interrogation by each other's radar.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to provide novel {{solutions}} for robust radio communication for longer range microwave RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), systems {{through the use of}} retrodirective arrays (RDA). The retrodirective Array is a self-steering antenna array which automatically transmits a radio signal back in the direction of signal arrival without the requirement of complex signal processing. Analogue implementation of retrodirective arrays allows real time, multi functional and signal tracking operations at low physical complexity and power consumption. To date the majority of the research undertaken on retrodirective array technology, focuses heavily on passive implementation such as transponder and retroreflector for radar application. The work presented in this thesis places largely emphasis on the integration of active retrodirective array as a basestation technology in RFID situations, where high quality performance and multifunctional operations are required. The systems presented in this thesis exploit various features of retrodirective array such as automatic beam forming, multipath signal recombination and multiple beams forming. Theoretical analysis of retrodirective arrays and implementation techniques for various applications are discussed. By deploying different retrodirective array architecture such as Van Atta and phase conjugating at the RFID <b>interrogator</b> and <b>transponder,</b> the self-steering action of retrodirective anays is shown to relax antenna alignment requirements and lead through to range extension for RFID systems. The retrodirective signal recombination/focusing effect in multipath rich environments improves signal strength at the target position. Therefore, instead of transmitting a high EIRP line-of-sight signal to the interrogator, the same power density can occur by utilizing the presence of multipath.

40|$|Transponders were {{originally}} electronic circuits that {{were attached to}} some item whose position or presence was to be determined. The transponder operated by responding to an interrogation request received from an interrogator, either by returning some data from the transponder such as an identity code, or returning the original properties of the signal received from the interrogator with a minimum time delay. Because the interrogator signal was generally much stronger than the returned signal, the former would swamp the latter unless some characteristic of the response was changed. This was generally the frequency, {{but it could be}} polarisation. 16. 2. History and Applications Transponders were developed for aircraft in WWII for identification friend or foe (IFF) application. Both commercial and military aircraft still use this technology. Most air traffic control centres rely on the range and altitude information returned by commercial aircraft rather than raw radar information. Since the Gulf War during which unacceptably large numbers of personnel were killed by their own side, transponder technology called Battlefield Identification System (BIS) has been developed for ground vehicles. It relies on <b>interrogator</b> – <b>transponder</b> technology operating at 38 GHz. Another important application of the transponder has been in the measurement of distance. Here, the interrogator sends a signal to the transponder which immediately responds on another frequency. By using the time of flight, the range can be determined with great accuracy. This technique is more accurate than using the skin echo as the ultimate signal to noise ratio remains very high. A system called the Tellurometer (see Chapter 5) used this technique with improvements to measure ranges of hundreds of kilometres to an accuracy of a few cm...|$|R
40|$|RFID {{technology}} is the well developed technology. Which is having so many applications in real life. But along with large number of applications it is also having some disadvantages. Like this technology fails with cartons containing metal, water or any liquid content. This is due to absorption of radio waves by liquid content. Along with this {{there is one more}} problem which is low detection rate. RFID Detection is nothing but successful identification of rfid tag. Using high signal strength reader we can increase the detection rate but it is up to small level. For better improvement we are going for intelligent method. [1] Detecting of RFID transponder with help of RFID reader is most significant in the radio frequency identification systems [2]. For development of RFID technology successful tag detection is compulsory. The major considerations effecting the successful tag detection by RFID <b>interrogator</b> contain <b>transponder</b> position and relative position of the interrogator and reader field area [1][27]. In this project we examine the features of tag identification on the two dimensional plane by an experiment approach depending on the received signal strength from the tag. We perform a process for calculating identification linked directly to the strength of transponder with help of artificial neural networks and Support vector machine. The main advantage of this method is to prevent time consumption and decrease the price by immediate detection of transponder [3] [4] [5] [1]. No human intervention is required [2]. Many experiments revealed that the method can forecast the transponder recognition with an accuracy of 94 % for different reader antenna positions. This method is mainly helpful in finding out the best transponder identification changing feature conditions...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{identification}} is an increasingly pervasive technology that permits rapid data recovery from low-power transponders whenever they are placed within {{the vicinity of}} an interrogator device. Fundamental benefits include proximity detection not requiring line-of-sight, multiple transponder access and data security. In this document, electronic identification methods for asset management are devised for the new target application of electrical appliance testing. In this application mains-powered apparatus are periodically subjected a prescribed series of electrical tests performed by a Portable Appliance Tester (PAT). The intention is to enhance the process of appliance identification and management, and to automate the test process as far as possible. Three principal methods of electronic identification were designed and analysed for this application: proximity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), cable RFID and power- line signalling. Each method relies on an inductively coupled mechanism that utilities a signalling technique called direct-load modulation. This is particularly suited to low- cost passive transponder designs. Physical limitations to proximity RFID are identified including coil size, orientation and susceptibility to nearby conducting surfaces. A novel inductive signalling method called cable RFID is then described that permits automatic appliance identification. This method uses the appliance power cable and inlet filter to establish a communication channel between <b>interrogator</b> and <b>transponder.</b> Prior to commencing the test phase, an appliance is plugged into the PAT and identified automatically via cable RFID. An attempt is made to extend the scope of cable RFID by developing a novel mains power-line signalling method that uses direct-load modulation and passive transponders. Finally, two different implementations of RFID interrogator are described. The first {{takes the form of}} an embeddable module intended for incorporation into electronic identification products such as RFID enabled PAT units. Software Defined Radio (SDR) principles are applied to the second interrogator design in an effort to render the device reconfigurable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GPS-Squitter is a technology for aircraft surveillance in which aircraft broadcast their GPSdetermined positions to all listeners via the Mode S data link. It can be used to provide aircraft traffic displays, on the ground for controllers and in the cockpit for pilots. It is compatible with existing ground-based beacon <b>interrogator</b> <b>radars</b> and is an evolutionary way to move from ground-radar surveillance to Automatic Dependent Surveillance. During a July 1994 meeting, the FAA requested that MIT Lincoln Laboratory conduct a demonstration of GPS-Squitter in the Gulf of Mexico. Shortly thereafter, in November-December 1994, a field evaluation of GPS-Squitter for air surveillance was held in the Gulf. Objectives of this evaluation were to determine the suitability of GPS-Squitter for air surveillance in general, and more specifically for air surveillance of helicopters servicing oil platforms in the Gulf ofMexico...|$|R

40|$|Position {{information}} {{is very important}} as people need it almost everywhere all the time. However, it is a challenging task to provide precise positions indoor/outdoor seamlessly. Outdoor positioning has been widely studied and accurate positions can usually be achieved by well developed GPS techniques but these techniques are difficult to be used indoors since GPS signal reception is limited. The alternative techniques {{that can be used}} for indoor positioning include, to name a few, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), bluetooth and Ultra Wideband (UWB) etc [...] However, all of these have limitations. The main objectives of this paper are to investigate and develop algorithms for a low-cost and portable indoor personal positioning system using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and its integration with other positioning systems. An RFID system consists of three components, namely a control unit, an <b>interrogator</b> and a <b>transponder</b> that transmits data and communicates with the reader. An RFID tag can be incorporated into a product, animal or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. In general, for RFID positioning in urban and indoor environments three different methods can be used, including cellular positioning, trilateration and location fingerprinting. In addition, the integration of RFID with other technologies is also discussed in this paper. A typical combination is to integrate RFID with relative positioning technologies such as MEMS INS to bridge the gaps between RFID tags for continuous positioning applications. Experiments are shown to demonstrate the improvements of integrating multiple sensors with RFID which can be employed successfully for personal positioning...|$|R
