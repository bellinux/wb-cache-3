500|$|The {{painted turtle}} {{has a very}} similar {{appearance}} to the red-eared slider (the most common pet turtle) and the two are often confused. [...] The painted turtle can be distinguished because it is flatter than the slider. [...] Also, the slider has a prominent <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> {{on the side of}} its head (the [...] "ear") and a spotted bottom shell, both features missing in the painted turtle.|$|E
500|$|These signals work by {{preventing}} trains from entering a [...] "block" [...] occupied by another train. Typically, the blocks are [...] long. If no train {{is in the}} block, the signal will light up as green. When a train enters the block, the signal turns <b>red,</b> <b>marking</b> the block as occupied. The train's maximum speed {{will depend on how}} many blocks are open in front of it. However, the signals do not register a train's speed, nor where in the block the train is located.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body length}} (excluding legs) of the mature female is , [...] for males. Legs are long in {{proportion}} to body. Females are shiny and black in color, with a <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> {{in the shape of}} an hourglass on the ventral (under) side of her very rounded abdomen. There is much variation in female size, particularly in egg-carrying (gravid) females. The abdomen of a gravid female can be more than [...] in diameter. Many female widows also have an orange or red patch just above the spinnerets {{on the top of the}} abdomen. Juveniles have a distinctly different appearance from the adults; the abdomen is grayish to black with white stripes running across it and is spotted with yellow and orange. Males are either purple, or closer to the appearance of the juveniles in color.|$|E

2500|$|These signals work by {{preventing}} trains from entering a [...] "block" [...] occupied by another train. Typically, the blocks are [...] long, although some highly used lines, {{such as the}} IRT Lexington Avenue Line, use shorter blocks. Insulators divide the track segments into blocks. The two traveling rails conduct an electric current, as they are connected to an electric current. If the circuit is closed and electricity can travel across the rails without interruption, the signal will light up as green, as it is unoccupied by a train. When a train enters the block, the metal wheels interrupt the current on the rails, and the signal turns <b>red,</b> <b>marking</b> the block as occupied. The train's maximum speed {{will depend on how}} many blocks are open in front of it. However, the signals do not register the trains' speed, nor do they register where in the block the train is located. If a train passes a red signal, the train stop automatically engages and prevents the train from moving forward.|$|E

50|$|Achaeopsis spinulosa is {{commonly}} known as the hotlips spider crab because of the vivid <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> around its mouth. It is a small spider crab with relatively long but quite sturdy legs. It may grow to 70 mm across. Its carapace is rounded, tapering to a blunt tip. Its pincers are raggedly striped in white and red.|$|E

5000|$|Dianthus cyprius is a shrubby hairless {{perennial}} with overarching {{branches to}} 90 cm long, the flowering branches growing {{from the sides}} of stems that end in leaf-tufts. Calyx-tube to 2.5 cm cylindrical, with 4-9 pairs of bracts at the base. Flowers clustered, 2 cm in diameter; petals pink with some <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> toward the centre. Flowers from June to November. The plant's common name is [...] "Dianthos o Kyprios".|$|E
50|$|In modern {{education}} circles, rubrics {{have recently}} come {{to refer to}} an assessment tool. The first usage of the term in this new sense is from the mid-1990s, but scholarly articles from that time do not explain why the term was co-opted. Perhaps rubrics are seen to act, in both cases, as metadata added to text to indicate what constitutes a successful use of that text. It may also be that {{the color of the}} traditional <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> pen is the common link.|$|E
5000|$|Later-model cameras {{featured}} a double exposure button, {{which could be}} pulled {{out to make a}} double exposure but could otherwise be left alone, as well as a depth-of-field scale on the focusing knob. Many also had <b>red</b> <b>marks</b> on f/6.3, 1/50 and on 20 feet. This was called the [...] "The Three R's in Outdoor Stereo Photography" [...] and is based on the then-standard ASA 10 color slide film. Earlier cameras lacked these features but they could be added. The double exposure button would have to be installed by the factory, but the depth-of-field scale and <b>red</b> <b>marks</b> could be added by a dealer or even the camera's owner. Thus, older model Realists are sometimes found with <b>red</b> <b>marks</b> or depth-of-field scales, but without double exposure buttons.|$|R

50|$|The {{prognosis}} is favorable in most patients with an isolated cutaneous abnormality. In {{the majority of}} cases, both the vivid <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> and the difference in circumference of the extremities regress spontaneously {{during the first year}} of life. It is theorized that this may be due to the normal maturation process, with thickening of the epidermis and dermis. Improvements for some patients can continue for up to 10 years, while in other cases, the marbled skin may persist for the patient's lifetime.|$|E

50|$|Its live {{color is}} light {{goldenrod}} to olive in dorsal areas and very {{light on the}} flanks and belly. Snout and head are densely covered with speckles that extend posteriorly to nuchal area and onto gill cleft. Scales over flanks fringed by diamond-shaped darker outlines (scale-pockets), thicker over posterio-ventral half, giving the flanks a reticulate appearance. All specimens with <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> at axil, behind pectoral fin. Dorsal and caudal fins are same color as the body with four lines of red dots extending onto soft areas and conspicuous on inter-radial membranes. Tip of caudal fin reddish.|$|E
50|$|Both of the {{well-known}} 1961 road test cars: the E-type Coupe Reg. No. 9600 HP and E-type Convertible Reg. No. 77 RW, were fitted with Dunlop Racing Tyres on test, {{which had a}} larger rolling diameter and lower drag co-efficient. This goes some way to explaining the 150 mi/h km/h maximum speeds that were obtained under ideal test conditions. The maximum safe rev limit for standard 6-cylinder 3.8-litre E-type engines is 5,500 rpm. The later 4.2-Litre units had a <b>red</b> <b>marking</b> on the rev counter from just 5,000 rpm. Both test cars must have reached or exceeded 6,000 rpm in top gear when on road test in 1961.|$|E
