5|$|Following the storm, Grenada {{requested}} {{assistance from}} the United States Agency of International Development. Local crews worked quickly to cover broken roofs and repair other structural damage. The National Emergency <b>Relief</b> <b>organization</b> were sought for assistance.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, local Red Cross volunteers {{provided}} {{meals and}} clothing {{to thousands of}} storm victims. The government allocated $5.1million (Trinidad and Tobago dollars) for relief work, to be coordinated by the National Emergency <b>Relief</b> <b>Organization</b> of Trinidad and Tobago, which was established following the damaging Hurricane Flora in 1963. This helped rebuild damage houses, clear roads, and assist affected farmers. The United States Agency for International Development sent about $5,000 (USD) in assistance, after the country's ambassador sent a formal request to Washington, D.C. The Amoco oil company also sent a $500 (USD) donation to the country's Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Army {{engaged in}} cleanup and {{repairing}} in the country. On December6, the 834th Airlift Division sent six C-130s to Kwajalein with supplies. On the same day, President George H. W. Bush declared a major disaster, allowing federal funding {{to be sent}} to Arno, Aur, Kwajalein, Lae, Lib, Namu and Ujae islands. Despite already getting funding from the United States, Marshall Islands requested for aid via United Nations Disaster <b>Relief</b> <b>Organization</b> (UNDRO) on December18.|$|E
40|$|International <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> provide {{disaster}} <b>relief</b> {{and rescue}} to those areas that required urgent help and also those {{lack of public}} aids. Some international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> were founded {{more than a century}} ago and still providing assistance to poor and wounded to increase welfare of human beings. International <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> have branches established in Taiwan for decades. The marketing activities of these international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> are mainly fund-raising. Propagandas and news related to their event marketing are often seen in media. This study intended to examine consumer perceptions of international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> and to reveal consumer donation intentions. Four famous international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations,</b> Red Cross, United Way, World Vision, and ORBIS, with branch offices in Taiwan and were active in marketing were selected in this study. A consumer survey was administered in the metropolitan area in Taipei. Three hundred and thirty respondents were personally surveyed using stratified sampling method following the distribution of population in the latest census. Motivation to donate, awareness of and attitudes toward international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> of respondents were discussed in the study. Respondents would have strong donation intentions due to certain rationales like altruism, religious beliefs, and involvement. Motivations of donation positively influenced attitudes toward international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations,</b> and further affected donation intentions. Respondents were further grouped into different segments to reveal how respondents with different level of awareness and dollar amount of donation responded to marketing of international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations.</b> Results indicated that respondents high in awareness level of international <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> and in donations could be approached using information disseminated in media. Interactive and motivation-driven marketing activities seemed to be well-accepted for respondents high in awareness levels but low in donations. Based on the results of the study, strategic marketing was suggested for marketing managers to enhance communication effectiveness of the marketing information.

40|$|Humanitarian <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> are {{increasingly}} becoming reliant upon {{the use of}} Information Technology 2 ̆ 6 Telecommunications (IT 2 ̆ 6 T) for the distribution of aid to refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) throughout the world. Traditionally, basic telecommunications infrastructure like the public switch telephone network (PSTN) {{has been used to}} transmit important information but today humanitarian <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> are attempting to utilize emerging technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS) telephones and geographic information systems (GIS). For the greater part IT 2 ̆ 6 T utilization by <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> has happened in an ad-hoc manner in response to specific events. This paper proposes the use of a complete end-to-end digital aid framework that will help humanitarian <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> respond better to crises.

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several Caribbean islands, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas, preparations there, if any, were unclear. Residents across Puerto Rico boarded up windows and secured roofs {{in anticipation of}} damaging winds. Governor Robert Hayes Gore placed the Hurricane <b>Relief</b> <b>Organization</b> and Red Cross on standby. As the storm neared Florida, the United States Weather Bureau—later the National Weather Service—posted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville. These were later extended to include {{the west coast of}} the state from Punta Rassa to Tarpon Springs. At the time, forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status; this unawareness extended to the storm's passage over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters only issued storm warnings for part of the Texas coast, including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Calleia excelled as {{the villain}} in Hollywood films, but he fought against typecasting {{and created a}} {{succession}} of darkly mysterious characters edged with humor in films including Algiers (1938), Five Came Back (1939), Golden Boy (1939), The Glass Key (1942) and Gilda (1946). During World War II Calleia led the Malta War <b>Relief</b> <b>organization</b> in the US. After the war he continued to work steadily in motion pictures and television, and he starred in the 1948 London stage premiere of Arthur Miller's Tony Award-winning play, All My Sons. Calleia's performance in Orson Welles's 1958 film Touch of Evil is {{regarded as one of}} the best in his career.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War <b>Relief</b> <b>organization</b> in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster <b>Relief</b> <b>Organization.</b> People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E
5|$|On November7, despite no {{official}} appeal for international aid, {{the governments of}} France and the United States provided $34,783 and $25,000 in funds. The request for assistance came the following day, with the Philippines requesting food, water, medicine, emergency supplies, and heavy machinery. A team from the United Nations Disaster <b>Relief</b> <b>Organization,</b> specializing with relief coordination and flood management, was also sent. The Red Cross appealed for $418,000 to support 15,000families for one month. A cash grant of $17,300 from the United Kingdom was received on November8. Two United States Air Force AC-130s from Subic bay naval base flew to Cebu carrying ready-to-eat meals. International funding reached $2.5million on November12, with grants of $1.05million, $1million, $188,000 from the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia respectively. Additionally, the United States provided 55,000 packages of food rations. This total nearly doubled two days later with grants from the United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, World Vision International, Médecins Sans Frontières, Caritas, various branches of the Red Cross, and the governments of Canada and New Zealand. Ultimately, approximately $5.8million was provided in international assistance from 13nations, the United Nations, the Red Cross, and various non-governmental organizations.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster <b>Relief</b> <b>Organization.</b> Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E

40|$|In 2012 and 2013, Arkansas ranked {{first in}} the nation in food {{insecurity}} in both categories of “low food secure” (21. 2 %) and “very low food secure” (8. 4 %) (Lilley, 2013; Coleman- Jensen, 2014). In order to help address food insecurity in NWA, The Cobblestone Project developed a hunger relief donation partner, The Farm. (Cobblestone Project, 2013). In spring 2014, The Farm partnered with University of Arkansas to: • Better understand the demographics and need of hunger <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> • Calculate the impact of donations to hunger <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> • Assess satisfaction of donations from The Farm to hunger <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> • Explore ways that The Farm can positively impact the ability of hunger <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> to meet their goals of reducing hunger in NWA To meet these objectives, a series of three surveys (introduction survey; survey after donations; and final assessment survey) was developed and targeted to 13 hunger <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> that The Farm serves. Data analyses produced the following findings: Demographics and needs of hunger relief organizations: Statistical tests showed that {{there were no significant differences}} in demographics served (age and gender) between organizations that put different values on hunger relief in their mission statements. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the number of people served and the functional type (pantry, soup kitchen, in-house) of the organization. The impact of donations: 100 % of organizations believed donors would find impact statistics from academic studies (such as this) as well as those developed by the hunger <b>relief</b> <b>organizations</b> themselves relevant. Satisfaction regarding the quality, quantity and diversity of the commodities donated: There is a difference in usefulness of produce that is easily prepared with known recipes and for large amounts of people.
