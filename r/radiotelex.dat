50|$|Tianjin Coastal Radio also {{provides}} public maritime correspondence (CP) services in voice telephony, <b>radiotelex</b> and radiotelegraphy to ships within its range.|$|E
50|$|A GMDSS {{system may}} include {{high-frequency}} (HF) radiotelephone and <b>radiotelex</b> (narrow-band direct printing) equipment, with calls initiated by {{digital selective calling}} (DSC). Worldwide broadcasts of maritime safety information can also be made on HF narrow-band direct printing channels.|$|E
50|$|Competition from {{satellite}} communications, {{which began}} in the 1980s, initially had little effect on the station's business, which continued to expand. In 1983, a new control centre was opened, adding new radiotelephone and radiotelegraphy consoles, and an automatic <b>radiotelex</b> facility.|$|E
5000|$|Emergency Medical Assistance: The Tianjin Port Hospital (天津港口医院) is {{the primary}} {{provider}} of emergency medical care in the port. It is a 314-bed comprehensive hospital, owned by TPG, that is specially licensed to deal with infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine and maritime accident trauma: its orthopedic trauma department is especially well ranked nationally. The hospital also has special provisions to cater to foreign visitors and crew members. Maritime Telemedical Assistance Service can be requested by messaging [...] "HD MEDICO XSV" [...] on Ch 16 radiotelephony (preceded with PAN PAN for urgent cases), or <b>radiotelexing</b> “MED+" [...] (prefixing “XXX” for urgent cases) to 2012 XSV CN on 2082 kHz.|$|R
50|$|Telex {{is still}} in operation, but has been mostly {{superseded}} by fax, email, and SWIFT, although <b>radiotelex,</b> telex via HF radio, is still used in the maritime industry and is a required element of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.|$|E
5000|$|The IMO also {{introduced}} {{digital selective calling}} (DSC) on MF, HF and VHF maritime radios {{as part of the}} GMDSS system. DSC is primarily intended to initiate ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship radiotelephone and MF/HF <b>radiotelex</b> calls. DSC calls can also be made to individual stations, groups of stations, or [...] "all stations" [...] in one's radio range. Each DSC-equipped ship, shore station and group is assigned a unique 9-digit Maritime Mobile Service Identity.|$|E
50|$|When {{sending a}} {{distress}} signal, the DSC device will at minimum include the ship's MMSI number. It will {{also include the}} coordinates if available and, if necessary, the channel for the following radiotelephony or <b>radiotelex</b> messages. The distress can be sent either as a single-frequency or multi-frequency attempt. In the former, a distress signal is sent on one band and the system will wait up to four minutes for a DSC acknowledgment from a coast station. If none is received, it will repeat the distress alert up to five times. In a multi-frequency attempt, the distress signal is sent on the MF and all the HF distress frequencies in turn. As this requires retuning the antenna for each sending, {{without waiting for an}} acknowledgment, a multi-frequency attempt should only be done if {{there are only a few}} minutes until the ship's batteries are under water. As the distress message can only be sent on one of the bands, many ships and coast stations may be listening to a band without the message, and will after five minutes relay the distress signal to a coast station.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of doctors or {{adequately}} trained paramedic personnel on board of the majority of ships, the most reliable possibility of treating diseases or accidents of sailing seafarers is to provide medical advice via telecommunication systems. For more than 50 years, several radio medical services has been operational, starting by using radio signals and Morse code, evolving through telephones to full blown telemedicine solutions. This study has analyzed the evolution in medical assistance provided by Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (CIRM), the Italian Telemedical Maritime Assistance Service (TMAS) in the last 10 years. CIRM was established since 1935 and offers free medical assistance to ships without a doctor on board of any nationality and navigating in all the seas of the world. In this study analysis was accomplished by reviewing data of medical assistance of the Centre from January 1 st 1999 to December 31 st 2008. Analysis of total patients assisted revealed a significant increase of their number in the years, from 1159 in 1999 to 1963 in 2008 (41 % increase). The number of teleconsultations was also increased. Medical assistance was delivered primarily to merchant ships {{and to a lesser extent}} to passenger and fishing vessels in the order. The main changes were noticeable in the telecommunication systems used for medical assistance. Voice communications remained in percentage at the same levels throughout the years, whereas requests received via <b>radiotelex</b> and telefax remarkably decreased. The use of e-mail for contacts increased by about 6 times from 2001, the year in which this communication system was introduced at CIRM, to 2008. Pathologies assisted were classified according to the ICD- 9 until 2007 and according to the ICD- 10 starting from 2008. Accidents were pathologies most assisted (more than 20 % of total cases), followed by diseases of the digestive system (18 %), urinary system (10 %) and cardiovascular system (7 %). Cardiovascular pathologies represented the first cause of deaths on board ships, accounting for approximately the 45 % of total fatalities (1. 55 % of cases assisted by the Centre). The observation that e-mail is becoming the system most used for medical assistance of patients on board ships represents an advantage in terms of possible evolution of medical care to seafarers. In fact, this system the most suitable for transmitting by store-and-forward images of affected areas and several biomedical data. Hence, from a technological point of view, a system supporting telemedical applications is at the present the most used for obtaining medical advice from CIRM. Unfortunately basic telemedical devices on board ships and a culture/training of their utility and use are still lacking. The wide use of telemedicine for medical assistance to ships has obvious technological limitations, but also significant medical challenges. Telemedicine solutions for ships must be able to use satellite communication, with the limits to message size and real time applications that this introduces. Flexible solutions are developed that are able to use several communication carriers depending on what is available at any time. On maritime telemedicine we are getting significant experience in its advantages as well as in its limitations, but it is the only means by which expert medical advice at sea can be obtained...|$|E
