40|$|In routine {{design of}} steel storage rack frames, {{it is far}} more common to perform two {{dimensional}} (2 D) rather than three dimensional (3 D) linear buckling analyses. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the global buckling behavior of high-rise steel storage rack frames may not be revealed by 2 D buckling analyses as 3 D interaction modes are involved. It is shown that the monosymmetric upright columns of a high-rise <b>rack</b> <b>frame</b> fail in a flexural–torsional mode due to the shear-center eccentricity of the sections, and that the 3 D frame buckling analysis is more reliable in determining the critical members of a <b>rack</b> <b>frame.</b> Current steel storage rack design standards combine independent 2 D flexural buckling analyses and simplified flexural–torsional buckling analysis of individual columns to account for 3 D behavior. Comparisons between the buckling stresses of the rack columns determined from 3 D buckling analyses and the buckling stresses determined in accordance with the steel storage racking standards are presented. It is concluded that the use of 2 D analysis based procedures can lead to poorly proportioned pallet rack structures in terms of safety or economy. By comparing the buckling analysis results using 3 D beam elements of varying degrees of refinement to each other, it is also demonstrated that the beam elements available in most commercial frame analysis programs are not sufficiently refined for accurate 3 D buckling analyses of high-rise rack frames composed of monosymmetric thin-walled open sections...|$|E

30|$|Finally, we {{compared}} {{the differences between the}} Matlab and the NS 2 results. One possible explanation for the differences is that even though we did account for overhead in Matlab, we were unable to model some types of overhead, such as the random amount of time a node backs off after a successful transmission, because linear programs require fixed amounts of flow on each link. Instead, we assumed that the channels only sit idle for the minimum amount of interframe space time between transmissions when we calculated the effective data rate on each of the links. This is not the case in NS- 2. After the AP finishes transmitting a packet, 802.11 's binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism requires that the transceiver sit idle in order to give other nodes a chance to access the channel. Upon receiving either an RTSBC or an <b>RACK</b> <b>frame,</b> the AP counts this as a successful transmission, and must give other nodes a chance to transmit before it sends its next packet. Since we underestimated the overhead, the improvement in throughput seen in reality will be lower than that calculated by Matlab, which does match with our results.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review of existing research on rack structures shows that connection models {{that are often}} adopted {{for the study of}} frame behaviour are usually based on the pre - yield stiffness. Record of experiments carried out and connection models developed from such experiments show that there is no reported study on the post - yielding behaviour of these connections under seismic loads. Seismic excitations often cause connections to rotate well beyond yielding and therefore requiring consideration of the post - yielding stiffnesses which developed in the connections to allow all the excessive stresses developed from the seismic effects to be re - distributed {{to other parts of the}} structure in prevention of premature collapse. The current study is an investigation into the semi - rigid and post - yielding behaviour of a beam end connector used in the UK storage rack industry. The pre and post - yielding behaviours of the connection under seismic condition undergo "pinching" which is the degradation of stiffness in the connection as a result of persistent loading and unloading of the beam, causing; significant wear and tear in the connection. The deterioration in the connection is manifested through material yielding, permanent geometric change and fatigue failure. The pinching behaviour in the connection was determined through experiments, which were conducted as part of this research. The experiments showed a steady rise in moment resistance within the elastic range of the connector. In this range every stiffness curve generated from the connection showed a slight deviation from the preceding curve but similar in shape. As the applied loads increased the connection behaved plastically with non recoverable looseness developing around the neutral or zero position as a result of the permanent deformation. There was then a sudden drop in strength followed again by a gradual increase in moment capacity which led to a shape similar to a butterfly wing, a "butterfly -shaped" moment rotation curve. The pinching was associated with significant looseness in the connection and this was shown in the moment rotation curve to get bigger with increases in the number of load cycles and magnitude of the applied load. A connection model to describe the "butterfly shaped" stiffness curve was then developed through regression analysis and this was used for the study of <b>rack</b> <b>frame</b> behaviour under seismic loading. A procedure for non linear dynamic analysis, based on Newton - Raphson and Newmark's methods was developed using stability functions to derive the structural stiffness and the pinching properties of the connections were then incorporated for the study. The research finally gives a revised design methodology, incorporating the pinching behaviour of the connections in comparison with existing design codes.

40|$|Click on the URL {{to access}} the article (may not be free). This paper focuses on the seismic {{performance}} of pallet-type steel storage rack structures in their down aisle direction. As evidenced by experimental research, the seismic response of storage racks in the down-aisle direction is strongly affected by the nonlinear moment-rotation response of the beam-to-column connections. In their down-aisle direction, rack structures are designed to resist lateral seismic loads with typical moment frames utilizing proprietary beam-to-column momentresisting connections. These connections are mostly boltless hooked type connections and they exhibit significantly large rotations resulting in large lateral frame displacements when subjected to strong ground motions. In this paper, typical hooked boltless beam-to-column connections are studied experimentally to obtain their non-linear reversed cyclic moment-rotation response. Additionally, a compound type connection involving the standard hooks and additional bolts were also tested under similar conditions. The simple introduction of the additional bolts within the hooked connection {{is considered to be}} a practical way of structural upgrade in the connection. The experimentally evaluated characteristics of the connections are compared in terms of some important performance indicators such as maximum moment and rotation capacity, change in stiffness and accumulated energy levels within the cyclic loading protocol. Finally, the obtained characteristics were used to carry out seismic performance assessment of <b>rack</b> <b>frames</b> incorporating the tested beam-to-column connections. The assessment involves a displacement based approach that utilizes a simple analytical model that captures the seismic behavior of racks in their downaisle direction. The results of the study indicate that the proposed method of upgrading appears to be a very practical and effective way of increasing the seismic performance of hooked connections and hence the <b>rack</b> <b>frames</b> in their down-aisle direction...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks in the cross-aisle direction is typically ensured by cold-formed steel bolted upright frames. Sensitive to second-order effects, accurately determining the shear stiffness of these frames {{is essential for}} seismic design and for ensuring the {{stability of}} the rack, especially for high-bay racks and racks supporting the building enclosure, where the outer <b>rack</b> <b>frames</b> must withstand cross-aisle horizontal actions due to wind loading. The main international racking specifications adopt different approaches to determining the shear stiffness of cold-formed steel storage <b>rack</b> upright <b>frames.</b> The <b>Rack</b> Manufacturers Institute (RMI) specification conservatively uses Timoshenko and Gere's theory. The European Specification EN 15512 recommends testing, however {{it is not clear whether}} the shear stiffness obtained using the recommended test procedure is correct. The newly revised Australian Standard AS 4084 adopted the European approach but also introduced an alternative test method for determining the combined bending and shear stiffness of upright frames in the transverse direction. This paper reviews and analyses the factors influencing the shear deformation of cold-formed steel bolted upright frames and introduces the alternative test set-up adopted in the revised Australian Standard. 36 upright frames have been tested using the two test methods, and experimental results are presented, discussed and compared with finite element analysis results. Recommendations on how to use the test outcomes in design are also provided. Based on these recommendations, the paper shows that the two test methods are not equivalent and yield different results for the transverse shear stiffness of upright frames.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} comprehensive studies into locally unstable {{light-gauge steel}} structures. The {{aim of this}} project was to create guidelines {{for the design of}} thin-walled steel structures by analyses which consider the effect of cross-sectional instability. Research was conducted to address the knowledge gap associated with the amplification of second-order effects due to local instabilities, the treatment of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect of interactive buckling on light gauge steel members. The objectives of this research were achieved through a combination of numerical and experimental investigations using two different types of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The first series of experiments investigated the effects of interactive buckling through a number of compression tests on varying lengths of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The second experimental investigation was used to study the effects of local instabilities on the second-order effects and behaviour of light gauge steel frames. Fourteen full scale storage rack tests were completed using different combinations of beam depths and nominal horizontal loads. Measured imperfection data and calibrated FE models were then used to determine a rational procedure for implementing geometric imperfections into advanced analysis. Special attention was given to the effect that local instabilities had on the second-order displacements of the frame. Based on both the experimental and numerical studies, recommendations were then provided regarding the effect of interactive buckling, inclusion of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect that local instabilities have on the second-order displacements and ultimate loads of steel storage <b>rack</b> <b>frames...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cold-formed {{thin-walled}} {{members are}} used worldwide to realize semi-continuous steel frames to store goods and products (rack systems). Usually, monosymmetric cross-section members are employed for rack columns but their design {{is carried out}} by assuming very simplified approaches, which consider the centroid coincident with the shear center of the cross-section. In routine design, non-uniform (warping) torsion influence is sometimes neglected in structural analysis: internal forces and bending moments are hence incorrect and the coupling between flexure and torsion is never considered also in buckling analysis. As a consequence, an unsafe design could be developed, owing {{to the use of}} non-appropriate tools for analysis and verification checks. A numerical study is currently in progress in Italy to define suitable design rules accounting for the monosymmetry of the cross-section members forming rack systems. This paper summarizes the main results related to the warping effects on the resistance checks. A numerical study on typical medium-rise <b>rack</b> <b>frames</b> is presented. In particular, two racks have been selected, differing for interstorey height and total height. Both configurations of unbraced and braced frames have been considered. Four different load conditions have been identified as relevant for rack design and, for each of them, a parametric analysis has been carried out by varying the degree of beam-to-column joint stiffness. Furthermore, warping influence on the distribution on the longitudinal stresses on the cross-section has been investigated, with the scope to quantify the errors when the sole uniform torsion is taken into account in structural analysis, i. e. when the bi-moment is neglected. Design results are then critically analyzed, singling out the importance of the warping on the cross-section resistance checks. Finally, suitable safety factors are proposed to be used when design is developed neglecting warping but an adequate safety level has therefore to be guaranteed...|$|R
