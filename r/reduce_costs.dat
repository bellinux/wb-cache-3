5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general {{standard}} of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898.

3000|$|<b>Reduced</b> <b>costs</b> Defined as {{the rate}} of change of the {{objective}} function for a unit increase in the bounds of a variable. A positive <b>reduced</b> <b>cost</b> of a non-basic variable increases the objective function with a unit increase in the binding domain. The objective function will decrease if a non-basic variable has a negative <b>reduced</b> <b>cost.</b> The <b>reduced</b> <b>cost</b> of a basic variable is zero since its bounds are non-binding and, therefore, do not constrain the optimal solution [42].|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. Note {{that any}} {{solution}} with negative <b>reduced</b> <b>costs</b> {{is sufficient for}} creating a new variable, which might improve the current solution. Since the <b>reduced</b> <b>costs</b> measure the relative improvement from one basis solution to another, but not the quality gain towards the optimal solution, no predictions concerning the long-run performance of the new variables can be made on basis of the <b>reduced</b> <b>costs.</b> Hence, a heuristic solution of [FAPHPR] to find a negative <b>reduced</b> <b>cost</b> variable is usually sufficient. Only to guarantee LP optimality in the end, [FAPHPR] has to be solved to optimality.|$|R

Some vehicles produced by Tatra had its 12-cylinder, air-cooled Type 103 diesel engine fitted. Large spades were added at the rear of the chassis during the war to improve the vehicle's ability to recover tanks and other heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF and Army jointly {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} the Chinooks from service in May 1989. This {{decision was made to}} <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability. Due to the Chinooks' high operating costs, only six of the helicopters were in service at the time. No. 12 Squadron ceased flying on 30 June 1989, and was disbanded on 25 August that year.|$|E

Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution.

The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges {{by the city of}} Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting.

Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black Arrow, including the Chief Missile Scientist, Roy Dommett, the Chief Design Engineer, Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer, John Underwood.|$|E

As the low budget also precluded the use of an orchestra, composer Ivor Slaney devised a synthesised score featuring occasional contributions from traditional instruments (such as a piano) that he recorded himself. Slaney also composed for Warren's next film, Terror (1978). The soundtracks for Prey and Terror were released jointly on CD in 2009.|$|E

In an attempt to <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> Uchikoshi asked Chunsoft if he could develop Virtue's Last Reward and its eventual sequel simultaneously, as both games would use the same engine and digital assets; Chunsoft agreed to his proposal, and green-lit production.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor.

Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues and <b>reduce</b> <b>costs,</b> Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his grip on power.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to <b>reduce</b> <b>costs</b> and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
