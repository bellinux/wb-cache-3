40|$|At finite N {{the number}} of <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials is {{greater than or equal}} to {{the number of}} {{generalized}} <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials. In this note we study this discrepancy and explain its origin. We conclude that, for quiver gauge theories, in general, the generalized <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials correctly account for the complete set of finite N constraints and they provide a basis, while the <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials only account for a subset of the finite N constraints and are thus overcomplete. We identify several situations in which the <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials do in fact account for the complete set of finite N constraints. In these situations the <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials and the generalized <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials both provide good bases for the quiver gauge theory. Finally, we demonstrate situations in which the generalized <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials reduce to the <b>restricted</b> Schur polynomials. Comment: 1 + 21 pages, no figure...|$|R
