40|$|We propose an {{alternative}} definition of sparse <b>resultants</b> as <b>resultants</b> of multiprojective cycles in a suitable toric variety. This definition {{differs from the}} classical one {{in the sense that}} in our case, sparse <b>resultants</b> are polynomials defining cycles and not (irreducible) hypersurfaces. This approach allows us to deduce straightforwardly several basic properties of sparse <b>resultants</b> via multiprojective elimination theory plus some intersection theory of toric varieties. In particular, we prove the validity in full generality of the Poisson formula for sparse <b>resultants</b> due to Pedersen and Sturmfels, and also Khovanskii’s formula for the product of zeros of a system of polynomial equations...|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the <b>resultant</b> (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent <b>resultant</b> vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the <b>resultant</b> varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E

Problems from many applications involve computation of <b>resultants</b> [...] polynomials obtained after eliminating variables from polynomials.

A new method for computing <b>resultants</b> is proposed. This method exploits the sparsity in the problem, despite being {{based on a}} classical formulation by Dixon. It also extends the Dixon formulation for bi-degree polynomials to compute <b>resultants</b> of most multivariate polynomial systems, while implicitly exploiting the sparse structure of the input polynomial system. Our work, for the first time, links the classical Dixon formulation to the modern line of sparsity analysis based on Newton polytopes.

40|$|<b>Resultants,</b> Jacobians and {{residues}} {{are basic}} invariants of multivariate polynomial systems. We examine their interrelations {{in the context}} of toric geometry. The global residue in the torus, studied by Khovanskii, is the sum over local Grothendieck residues at the zeros of $n$ Laurent polynomials in $n$ variables. Cox introduced the related notion of the toric residue relative to $n+ 1 $ divisors on an $n$-dimensional toric variety. We establish denominator formulas in terms of sparse <b>resultants</b> for both the toric residue and the global residue in the torus.
