5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E

25|$|Body {{image is}} often {{measured}} {{by asking the}} subject to <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions.

Also having this body dissatisfaction can affect a girl’s comfort with her sexuality when she’s older and may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.|$|E

25|$|Positive self-perception {{of health}} has been {{correlated}} with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly. Various reasons {{have been proposed}} for this association; people who are objectively healthy may naturally <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> health better than that of their ill counterparts, though this link has been observed even in studies which have controlled for socioeconomic status, psychological functioning and health status. This finding is generally stronger for men than women, though the pattern between genders is not universal across all studies and some results suggest sex-based differences only appear in certain age groups, for certain causes of mortality and within a specific sub-set of self-ratings of health.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} design {{was based on}} the knowledge calibration work by Cunningham, Perry, Stanovich, and Stanovich (2004). One hundred and forty-one full time teachers participated in a four day professional development workshop on research-based reading instruction. Participants were administered a three-part survey comprised of 1) demographic information 2) knowledge calibration items measuring perceived understanding of phonics, phonological awareness, and syllabication and 3) phonics pretest published in Self-Paced Phonics: A Text for Educators (2005). There were statistically significant differences between participants who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as high and those who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as low on the phonological and phonics items. However, teachers in this study overestimated their knowledge of phonological awareness and phonics. There {{were no significant differences between}} those who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as high as compared to those who <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> knowledge as low on the subtest knowledge of syllabication. In addition, no significant differences were found between new teachers and experienced teachers in their knowledge in the three domains. The results and discussion address the importance of knowledge calibration to develop professional educational experiences for new and experienced teachers...|$|R

25|$|Some polls, {{such as the}} Gallup World Poll in 2007 {{revealed}} that significant numbers of Israelis, 20 percent, would ideally, {{if they had the}} opportunity, move permanently to another country. This was in the mid-range of desire to migrate and less than, for example, the residents of Denmark, Belgium, Mexico, Argentina, Italy, Poland, Hungary, South Korea and Chile. The 'push factor' bringing about migration is often reflected in quality of life perceptions. In terms of self ranked quality of life Israelis <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> own lives on a scale numbered from zero at the bottom to ten at the top, Israelis' average rating in 2007 was 6.84, which is far higher than the 4 average for the world and compares with Denmark's 8, among the world's top.|$|E
25|$|In the California Healthcare Quality Report Card 2013 Edition, Kaiser Permanente's Northern California and Southern California regions, Kaiser {{received}} {{four out}} of four possible stars in Meeting National Standards of Care. Kaiser North and South also received {{three out of four}} stars in Members <b>Rate</b> <b>Their</b> HMO. KP's performance has been attributed to three practices: First, KP places a strong emphasis on preventive care, reducing costs later on. Second, its doctors are salaried rather than paid per service, which removes the main incentive for doctors to perform unnecessary procedures. Thirdly, KP attempts to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay and by shifting care to outpatient clinics. This practice results in lower costs per member, cost savings for KP and greater doctor attention to patients. A comparison to the UK's National Health Service found that patients spend 2–5 times as much time in NHS hospitals as compared to KP hospitals.|$|E
