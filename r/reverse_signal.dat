Apoptosis is mediated by two distinct mechanisms: direct cell contact and a yet-unidentified soluble protein, death factor X. In addition, mTNF acts as a receptor that transduces a "reverse signal" into MO/MPhi when bound to the TNF receptor on EC. <b>Reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> by mTNF confers resistance to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

In this study, we reassess the biology of membrane-bound IL- 15 (mb-IL- 15) isoforms by comparing primary cultures of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) to peritumoral (ptumTEC), tumoral (RCC), and cancer stem cells (CSC/CD 105 +). RPTEC express a 14 to 16 kDa mb-IL- 15, whose existence has been assumed but never formally demonstrated and likely represents the isoform anchored at the cell membrane through the IL- 15 receptor α (IL- 15 Rα) chain, because it is sensitive to acidic treatment and is not competent to deliver a <b>reverse</b> <b>signal.</b> By contrast, ptumTEC, RCC, and CSC express a novel N-hyperglycosylated, short-lived transmembrane mb-IL- 15 (tmb-IL- 15) isoform around 27 kDa, resistant to acidic shock, delivering a <b>reverse</b> <b>signal</b> in response to its soluble receptor (sIL- 15 Rα). This <b>reverse</b> <b>signal</b> triggers the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin in ptumTEC and RCC but not in CSC/CD 105 +, where it promotes survival. Indeed, through the AKT pathway, tmb-IL- 15 protects CSC/CD 105 + from non-programmed cell death induced by serum starvation. Finally, both mb-IL- 15 and tmb-IL- 15 are sensitive to metalloproteases, and the cleaved tmb-IL- 15 (25 kDa) displays a powerful anti-apoptotic effect on human hematopoietic cells. Overall, our data indicate that both mb-IL- 15 and tmb-IL- 15 isoforms play a complex role in renal pathophysiology downregulating E-cadherin and favoring cell survival.

Sympathetic fibres reach these tissues in these mice but fail to grow and branch extensively in these tissues. In contrast, tissues that receive their sympathetic innervation predominantly from prevertebral ganglia are either unaffected, in mice lacking TNF and TNFR 1, or hyperinnervated.

Interaction of ephrinB molecules with Eph receptors leads to changes in long-term potentiation (LTP), which {{has been reported to}} be mediated by <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> into the post-synaptic membrane. Here, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of ephrinB 3 and hence <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> is not required for ephrinB dependent learning and memory tasks or for LTP of these synapses. Consistent with previous reports, we find that ephrinB 3 KO null mutant mice exhibit a striking reduction in CA 3 –CA 1 LTP that is associated with defective learning and memory tasks. We find the null mutants also show changes in both pre- and post-synaptic proteins including increased levels of synapsin and synaptobrevin and reduced levels of NMDA receptor subunits.

Neural crest cells generate much of the craniofacial skeleton and morphogenesis of skeletal elements occurs in transient, reiterated structures termed pharyngeal arches. The shape of individual elements depends upon intrinsic patterning within the neural crest as well as extrinsic signals to the neural crest from adjacent tissues within the arches. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is known to play roles in craniofacial development, yet its involvement in intrinsic and extrinsic patterning of the craniofacial skeleton is still not well understood. Here, we show that morphogenetic movements of the pharyngeal arches and patterning of the neural crest require Hh signaling. Loss of Hh signaling, in smoothened (smo) mutants, disrupts the expression of some Dlx genes {{as well as other}} markers of dorsal/ventral patterning of the neural crest. Transplantation of wild-type neural crest cells into smo mutants rescues this defect, demonstrating that the neural crest requires reception of Hh signals for proper patterning. Despite the rescue, morphogenesis of the facial skeleton is not fully recovered. Through transplant analyses, we find two additional requirements for Hh signaling. The endoderm requires the reception of Hh signals for proper morphogenetic movements of the pharyngeal arches and the neural crest require the reception of Hh signaling for the activity of a <b>reverse</b> <b>signal</b> that maintains sonic hedgehog expression in the endoderm.

Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that the FLVR motif within the Src homology 2 domain of Xenopus Grb 4 is vital for this phosphorylation-dependent interaction with ephrinB 1. More importantly, using deletion and substitution analysis we identify the tyrosine residue at position 298 of ephrinB 1 as being required for the physical interaction with Grb 4, whereas Tyr- 305 and Tyr- 310 are dispensable. Moreover, we show that the region between amino acids 301 and 304 of ephrinB 1 is also required for this critical tyrosine-phosphorylation-dependent event...|$|E
40|$|Although Fas ligand (FasL) is well {{characterized}} for {{its capacity to}} deliver a death signal through its receptor Fas, recent work demonstrates that FasL also can receive signals facilitating antigen (Ag) -specific proliferation of CD 8 + T cells. The fact that the gld mutation differentially influences the proliferative capacity of CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells presented the intriguing possibility that a single molecule may play opposing roles in these two subpopulations. The present study focuses on how these positive and negative regulatory roles are balanced. We show that naive CD 4 + T cells are responsive to FasL-mediated costimulation on encounter with Ag when Fas-mediated death is prevented. Thus, the machinery responsible for transducing the FasL positive <b>reverse</b> <b>signal</b> operates in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Instead, differential control of FasL expression distinguishes the role of FasL in these two T cell subpopulations. FasL costimulation occurs immediately on T cell receptor ligation and correlates with the up-regulation of FasL expression on CD 8 + and naive CD 4 + T cells, {{both of which are}} sensitive to the FasL costimulatory signal. Conversely, FasL-initiated death occurs late in an immune response when high levels of FasL expression are maintained on CD 4 + T cells that are sensitive to Fas-mediated death, but not on CD 8 + T cells that are relatively insensitive to this signal. This careful orchestration of FasL expression during times of susceptibility to costimulation and conversely, to death, endows FasL with the capacity to both positively and negatively regulate the peripheral T cell compartment...|$|E
40|$|SummaryReverse {{signaling}} by ephrin-As upon binding EphAs controls axon {{guidance and}} mapping. Ephrin-As are GPI-anchored to the membrane, requiring that they complex with transmembrane proteins that transduce their signals. We {{show that the}} p 75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) serves this role in retinal axons. p 75 NTR and ephrin-A colocalize within caveolae along retinal axons and form a complex required for Fyn phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal changes. In vitro, retinal axon repulsion to EphAs by ephrin-A <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> requires p 75 NTR, but repulsion to ephrin-As by EphA forward signaling does not. Constitutive and retina-specific p 75 NTR knockout mice have aberrant anterior shifts in retinal axon terminations in superior colliculus, consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded ephrin-A <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> induced by graded collicular EphAs. We conclude that p 75 NTR is a signaling partner for ephrin-As and the ephrin-A- p 75 NTR complex <b>reverse</b> <b>signals</b> to mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping...|$|R
40|$|During {{embryonic}} development the preoptic area (POA) {{gives rise}} to two populations of neurons which are generated at the same time, cortical interneurons and striatal cells. POA-derived cortical interneurons take a superficial path and avoid the developing striatum when they migrate to their target region. We found that EphB 1, which is expressed in the striatal anlage, prevents cortical interneurons from entering the striatum via ephrin-B 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling.</b> In contrast, for striatal neurons which also express ephrin-B 3, EphB 1 acts as a stop signal. This dual role of EphB 1 is {{due to differences in}} ephrin-B 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> cascades. For striatal neurons, binding of EphB 1 to ephrin-B 3 reduces endogenously high levels of pSrc and pFAK, which then causes the cells to stop migration. In contrast, in cortical interneurons EphB 1 -ephrin-B 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> leads to phosphorylation of Src and FAK which then mediates repulsion. Consistent with these in vitro findings, in an ephrin-B 3 knockout mouse line, we discovered misrouted cortical interneurons in the striatum and an over-migration of striatal neurons in their target region. Thus, EphB 1 /ephrin-B 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> has a different impact on two sets of neurons which are generated {{at the same time and}} place: it can act as a repulsive cue for migrating neurons or it can terminate neuronal migration, a novel role of the Eph/ephrin system...|$|R
5000|$|Ephrins {{are divided}} into 2 classes: Ephrin-As are bound to the {{membrane}} through GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) linkage and Ephrin-Bs have a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain; they interact with their respective receptors Eph-A and Eph-B which {{are members of the}} tyrosine kinase family. One unusual feature about Ephrins is their ability to bidirectionally signal (...) they can participate in both forward (ligand to receptor) and <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> (receptor to ligand). Eph/Ephrin binding induces conformational changes in the Ephrin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, activating the signaling pathway. Eph/Ephrin forward signaling regulates actin dynamics via small GTPases of the Rho family; <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> occurs when the Ephrin-B cytoplasmic tail gets phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. Ephrin-B also contains a PDZ binding motif important in axon guidance regulation via G-protein <b>signaling.</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> can also occur when Ephrin-A is activated by Eph-A3 binding; this is regulated by metalloprotease-dependent cleavage of Ephrin-A. [...] Eph/Ephrin bidirectional signaling is important for axon guidance and target selection; mapping of retinal axons along anterior-posterior axis in the visual system is regulated by Ephrin-A/Eph-A mediated repulsion. In the tectum, the transcription factor Engrailed creates an Ephrin-A concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior axis; this results in different signaling cues to the growth cones which also express graded levels of the receptor. Interestingly, the topographic location of retinal axons along dorsal-ventral axis requires both forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>signaling</b> by Ephrin-B/Eph-B gradient mediated attraction.|$|R
