25|$|September 1976 - Chevette L estate {{introduced}} with {{specification of}} saloon model. Bedford Chevanne van version of Chevette introduced. Similar to Chevette estate, but without <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> and rear seats.|$|E
25|$|Two further {{models were}} added to the range in 1962, the Bond 250 G Estate and the Bond 250 G Ranger. The estate {{featured}} a large hatchback, hinged at the roof. Inside, the rear seats could also be folded flat or removed entirely. On the Ranger version the rear seats and <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> were omitted.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows were}} {{intended}} to offset the significant blind spots created by the very wide C-pillars that were characteristic of American cars produced at this time. Even narrow opera windows helped rear visibility. In an age of decreasing dimensions and increasingly common use of non-opening <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> on 2-door models, the small opera windows helped rear passengers to be somewhat less claustrophobic.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{operated}} {{rear window}} roller sunblind, with manual operated <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> roller sunblinds ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1949 - A BC-12D-85 {{fitted with}} an extra <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> and a Continental C85-12F engine.|$|R
5000|$|Electrically {{operated}} rear-window {{shade and}} <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> sun shades are optionally available (standard on some models) ...|$|R
25|$|During its {{production}} from 1967 to 1970, the Rebel was {{available as a}} six-passenger four-door sedan, and two-door hardtop, and a four-door station wagon with an optional third row seat for two more passengers. In addition, a two-door sedan (coupé) with a thin B-pillar and flip out <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> was available in 1967 only, and a convertible was offered in 1967 and 1968.|$|E
25|$|Again, the 1973 GTO {{option was}} offered on two models {{including}} the base Le Mans coupe or the LeMans Sport Coupe. The base LeMans coupe featured a cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat while the more lavish Le Mans Sport Coupe had all-vinyl interiors with Strato bucket seats or a notchback bench seat with folding armrest. The Le Mans Sport Coupe also had louvered <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> from the Grand Am {{in place of}} the standard triangular windows of the base Le Mans.|$|E
25|$|The {{panel van}} {{variant of the}} Logan was {{launched}} on 23 January 2007, in Bucharest. It is a small business oriented vehicle, with 2,500 litre loading space and 800kg payload. The Logan VAN {{is more or less}} an MCV without the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> and therefore has the same safety features and uses the same engines as the other models (except the 1.6 16v engine). Production of this model was stopped in August 2012. Since its launch, over 53,000 units were manufactured. The panel van version is still produced at AvtoVAZ.|$|E
5000|$|A 210J with rear {{changed to}} full seat to provide six seats, an IO-520-L engine with [...] limited to five minutes, landing gear changed, {{enlarged}} cabin {{with a single}} <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window,</b> weight increased to 3800 lb, produced 1970-71, 303 built.|$|R
50|$|The Cherokee was a {{redesigned}} reintroduction of a two-door body style, with {{a single}} fixed <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line from 1963 to 1967), although this had the same pillar and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the rear window on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted rear windows, were introduced. The split <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> on the 145 became one piece which was no longer possible to open.|$|R
25|$|A new major variant, Mi-1M in 1957 {{introduced}} an enlarged cabin {{and the more}} powerful AI-26VF engine, which allowed the accommodation of three passengers on a bench behind the pilot. Cabin height increased from 1.22 to 1.26 m and width from 1.01 to 1.2 m. A noticeable difference was horizontal bottom windows line instead of slanted, with bigger <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> and a less pointed fuselage nose. It could also be fitted with two external side capsules for the injured or mail. There were trials of an armed anti-tank variant Mi-1MU carried in 1961, being the first Soviet attack helicopter, {{but it did not}} enter production due to having a small payload and the cessation of production of the basic variant.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "A" [...] {{also had}} 15% larger <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> and new {{adjustable}} seats. 344 were constructed.|$|E
2500|$|... 337F; split airstair entry door, smaller <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> {{improved}} flaps, larger front propeller, {{powered by}} Continental IO-360-G engines, 352 built.|$|E
5000|$|The {{greenhouse}} (or glasshouse) {{of a car}} {{comprises the}} windshield, <b>rear</b> and <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> the pillars separating them (designated A-pillar, B-pillar and so on, starting from the car's front), and the car's roof.|$|R
5000|$|O4/4, Rebuilt with O2 boiler, {{extended}} <b>rear</b> {{frames and}} <b>side</b> <b>window</b> cab, since rebuilt again.|$|R
50|$|Midway {{through the}} year the AM/FM antenna was moved from on the glass in the <b>rear</b> driver's <b>side</b> <b>window</b> to a three-inch (76 mm) rubber antenna {{in the center of}} the roof just above the tailgate.|$|R
2500|$|Van: In North America [...] "van" [...] {{refers to}} a truck-based {{commercial}} vehicle of the wagon style, whether used for passenger or commercial use. Usually a van has no windows at the side rear (panel van), although for passenger use, side windows are included. In {{other parts of the}} world, 'van' denotes a passenger-based wagon with no <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 1977 American GFS {{incorporated}} the same appearance and equipment novelties as the American ECD {{of the same}} year. Like the two-door 1976 American ECD, the model kept the individual front seat and floor-mounted automatic transmission configuration, with the notable difference of incorporating reclining mechanisms as standard equipment. From this model the [...] engine was also retained, but incorporating the new head and intake manifold designs {{as well as the}} 3.07:1 rear gear ratio from the American Rally model of the year. The most unique aspect of the 1977 American GFS was its design of <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> and roof. VAM designers created a half Landau-type vinyl top carrying the roof Targa band AMC used for the 1977 Hornet AMX models and shortened flip-open <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> creating a thicker B-pillar. AMC really liked this styling touch and adopted it for its 1978–1979 Concord DL/Limited two-door models (except {{for the use of the}} Targa band).|$|E
2500|$|It {{appeared}} in two versions. At the New York International Auto Show in April 1968 it was red {{with a white}} stripe on the sides that ran across the roof. It also had plain, flush wheel covers, generic all-black tires, a side-mounted exhaust, a ram-air intake hood, integrated roof spoiler and fixed <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> (quarter glass) with no support (or [...] "B") pillar.|$|E
50|$|The Cherokee was a {{redesigned}} reintroduction of a two-door {{body style}} Jeep Wagoneer, {{with a single}} fixed <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line from 1963 to 1967), although this had the same pillar and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer. This replaced the Jeepster Commando, whose sales had not met expectations despite an extensive 1972 revamp. The Cherokee appealed to a younger market than the Wagoneer, which was regarded more as a family SUV.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape and}} {{position}} of the automobile greenhouse on both two- and four-door sedans may be identical, with only the center B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer doors on the two-door versions. For example, 1962 Rambler Classic sedans feature identical windshield, A-pillar, roof, C-pillar, and rear window. The two-door sedans have longer doors and include roll down <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> and even a quarter window that is shaped to follow the reverse slant of the C-pillar, just like on the rear doors of the four-door sedans.|$|R
5000|$|In Malta; The Malta Transport Authority Permits VLT of 70% on Front <b>Side</b> <b>windows.</b> Tint on the {{windscreen}} - a band {{across the}} top is permitted with a depth {{of no more than}} 100mm of the depth of the windscreen. 30% on the <b>rear</b> and <b>side</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1951 the 2CV {{received}} an ignition lock and a lockable driver's door. Production reached 100 cars a week. By {{the end of}} 1951 production totalled 16,288. Citroën introduced the 2CV Fourgonnette van. The [...] "Weekend" [...] version of the van had collapsible, removable rear seating and <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> enabling a tradesman {{to use it as}} a family vehicle on the weekend as well as for business in the week.|$|E
2500|$|The Concept Grand Touring was {{a larger}} luxury {{hatchback}} designed for four-passengers. The interior was appointed in leather and corduroy upholstery and luxury appointments with deep-pile carpeting. The front end featured a [...] "venturi" [...] grille with rally-type lights. The <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> were [...] "opera" [...] recessed {{and surrounded by}} a vinyl cover that ran over the roof's rear quarter. The Concept GT car had genuine wire wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, the Riviera {{featured}} a luxurious four-place cabin with front bucket seats and bucket-style {{seats in the}} rear. [...] A center console with floor shifter and storage compartment built into the instrument panel divided the front. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl, cloth and vinyl, or optional leather. A deluxe interior option included real walnut inserts on the doors and below the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows.</b> Popular extra-cost options included a tilt steering wheel, power windows, power driver's seat, air conditioning, a remote-controlled side view mirror, and white sidewall tires.|$|E
5000|$|Ford in {{the late}} 1970s {{installed}} both the [...] "landau and canopy" [...] styles on one vehicle. On vinyl-equipped 1977-79 Thunderbirds, two separate vinyl areas existed, one starting {{at the base of}} the windshield pillars and extending back to the trailing edge of the front <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> and another starting {{at the base of the}} rear window and coming forward as far as the leading edge of the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> These were separated by a targa band of sheet metal in the middle of the roof, which swept down at the sides to form a thick sedan-like pillar on the sides. It was an updated appearance from the 1955 Ford Crown Victoria [...] "basket handle".|$|R
2500|$|Styling/engineering {{highlights}} {{through the}} years included disc brakes with audible wear indicators for 1972, a federally mandated [...] front bumper along with new vertical taillights in 1973, a stand-up hood ornament, 5mph rear bumper and optional fixed <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> opera <b>windows</b> in 1974 and rectangular headlights in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|It shared Mazda's GE {{platform}} with cars like the ɛ̃fini MS-6 and Mazda MX-6 coupe. The word [...] "clef" [...] is a musical notation, and Mazda chose it to signify that the Clef {{was meant to}} serve as a reference point by which other Autozam products would become to be known or regarded as. The Clef was mechanically related to the Mazda Cronos, but featured different bodywork, and <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> designs. [...] The Clef had the same width dimensions as the Mazda Cronos which shared the 2.5 L V6 engine. The width, length, and engine displacement dimensions have particular significance in Japan, due to dimension regulations, where Japanese consumers pay an additional annual tax for larger vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|Officially {{discontinued}} {{after the}} 1978 model year, the Gremlin was restyled that {{including a new}} model that featured a sloping liftback for 1979 and the model line renamed the AMC Spirit. This restyled continuation of the familiar chopped-tail two-door and the new hatch coupe caused sales to increase to 52,478 units for 1979. The original [...] "Kammback" [...] body style continued in production until 1982 as the Spirit Sedan with larger <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows.</b> The basic design was also used for the small AMC Eagle Kammback from 1981 to 1982.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1988, the new CN11S Fronte debuted. The {{previous}} generation {{was not as}} roomy as the competition due to its comparably short wheelbase, but the new version addressed this issue by having it stretched out by [...] to [...] A sleeker looking body, with <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> that wrapped {{around the edge of}} the roof, also helped sales. Apart from the very cheapest variants, the Fronte got front disc brakes and 12inch radial tyres. The Fronte also received the 547cc 12-valve SOHC F5B engine from the Suzuki Cervo, developing [...] at a lively 7500rpm. There was no three-door version this time, but a 4WD variant (CP11) was available.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1967 model year, all of AMC's {{intermediates}} {{took the}} Rambler Rebel name. They {{were of a}} completely new design from the predecessor models. The new Rebels were bigger and rode on a longer [...] wheelbase allowing for more passenger space and cargo capacity. The new styling featured sweeping rooflines with more glass area, {{as well as a}} smooth, rounded [...] "coke-bottle" [...] body design. The Rebel was now available not only in 4-door sedan, 4-door station wagon, and 2-door hardtop versions, but also for 1967 as 2-door sedan (coupé) with a thin B-pillar and flip out <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> as well as a convertible.|$|E
50|$|The car has a roof made of magnesium, front lid, {{front and}} rear wings and boot lid made of carbon, {{front and rear}} apron made of {{lightweight}} polyurethane, <b>rear</b> and <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> made of polycarbonate, rear silencers made of titanium. Porsche claims that the car will have a wet weight of 1,470 kg.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Evolution" [...] model (also called [...] "EVO2") {{produced}} up to [...] Other Evolution {{model changes}} included larger wheels (16 X 7.5 inches), thinner <b>rear</b> and <b>side</b> <b>window</b> glass, a lighter bootlid, a deeper front splitter and additional rear spoiler. It was only available in coupe and convertible bodies; no saloon option was available.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after 10pm on {{the night}} of 15 May 1987, Mannakee was killed when the Suzuki {{motorbike}} he was riding as a passenger, driven by a fellow police officer Steven Peat, crashed into a Ford Fiesta driven by 17-year-old Nicola Chopp, who had only passed her driving test six weeks earlier, in Woodford, north-east London on the A11 road. Mannakee was on the way to his home in Loughton. After waiting for a car to turn left, Chopp pulled out, turning right across the motorbike's path. Peat swerved to avoid the car, but a collision occurred and Mannekee was catapulted into the <b>rear</b> <b>side</b> <b>window</b> of Chopp's car and died almost instantly after breaking his spine in two places. Peat and Chopp both survived. An inquest into Mannakee's death concluded it was an accident.|$|R
