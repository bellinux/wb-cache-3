40|$|Releases of the GDP {{are subject}} to {{revisions}} over time. This paper examines the predictability <b>of</b> German GDP <b>revisions</b> using forecast rationality tests. Previous studies of German GDP covering data until 1997 finds that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are predictable. This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonal adjusted GDP, of nominal unadjusted GDP, of the seasonal pattern, and of the GDP deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly predictable and less well predictable compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R

In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of felony and put to death on 22 January 1552.

However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> canon law, the <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, a <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the North American Liliaceae by Sereno Watson {{described}} sixteen tribes, {{of which}} the Lilieae correspond most closely to current concepts of the family, Bentham and Hooker described twenty tribes in 1883, and Engler and Prantl in their extensive description of the Liliaceae in 1899 identified 31 tribes distributed over 11 subfamilies, with Tulipeae and Alieae representing the modern family. In 1936, Franz Buxbaum undertook a major <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the Liliaceae and among others described the subfamily Lilioideae with three tribes: Lloydieae (Gagea, Lloydia and Szechenya and Giradiella — both now included in Lloydia), Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa and Eduardoregalia — now part of Tulipa) and Lilieae (Korolkowia, Fritillaria, Notholirion, Cardiocrinum, Nomocharis and Lilium). Hutchinson included most of these genera within the Tulipeae tribe. The complex rearrangements of the various genera, tribes and subfamilies over a 30-year period from 1985, discussed by Peruzzi and colleagues (2009), are partly summarised in Table 2 below.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was {{purchased}} by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the D rules to date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E
