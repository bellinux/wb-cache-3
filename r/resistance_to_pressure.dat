5000|$|Its {{unit weight}} {{is lower than}} those of {{comparable}} building materials. Its shrinkage and expansion rates are low, and are comparable to those of concrete. As such, it can be poured continuously without necessitating a contraction joint. It is characterized by resistance to water and moisture. The ratio of lime in the mixture can be modified in order to completely eliminate water-related erosion. Experiments on capillary water absorption have shown that increased amounts of lime in the mixture results in an increase in quantity and in reduced width of capillary canals, proving the material’s erosion resistance. Compressive and shear strength and modules of elasticity and rigidity present advantages in terms of earthquake resistance. Once the mixture is poured into a mould, the production process is completed, and a significant degree of rigidity is reached. It does not require curing and drying, providing economy of time, labor, and energy. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> is 3,5 - 4 MPa. The lime in the mixture reduces <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> to a minimal degree, while increasing elasticity and resistance to impact. During pressure tests cube-shaped blocks fracture in pyramidal forms, comparable to concrete blocks, and do not disintegrate in the way unstabilized earthen blocks do.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{efforts at}} racial and {{cultural}} integration in the United States, the main thrust was assimilation. The stress was on {{the ideology of the}} [...] "model minority" [...] which states that the only standard for [...] "appropriate," [...] "effective," [...] and [...] "competent" [...] thinking (cognition), feeling (affect), and behavior (functional fit) was a presumed majority mainstream culture. The immigrant newcomer was compelled to internalize mainstream ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving or be marginalized. Beginning even before World War II and certainly after, efforts at racial and ethnic integration grew dramatically and the model minority ideology became untenable (Kramer, 2003 [...] ). But even into the twenty-first century we see remnants of it. An example is Young Yun Kim's cross-cultural adaptation theory. Borrowing extensively from Gordon and Park's work, especially Milton Gordon's 1954 book Assimilation in American Life where he outlines seven stages in the assimilative process, Kim presents a reiteration of the 1950s era notion in her theory of cross-cultural adaptation as a multi-staged process. The theory focuses on the unitary nature of psychological and social processes and the reciprocal functional personal environment interdependence. [...] This view takes into account micro-psychological and macro-social factors into a theoretical fusion [...] "vertical integration" [...] of theory. While cross-cultural adaptation theory itself is a fusion of previous ideas, it is not about racial or ethnic integration but instead assimilation. And as such it is unlike the works of Bateson, Ruesch and Bateson, Watzlawick Beavin, and Jackson, and Buss and Kenrick Kim's approach is unilinear. The sojourner must conform to the majority group culture in order to be [...] "communicatively competent." [...] Gudykunst and Kim (2003) equate integration, adaptation and assimilation writing, [...] "cross-cultural adaptation process involves a continuous interplay of deculturation and acculturation that brings about change in strangers in the direction of assimilation, the highest degree of adaptation theoretically conceivable" [...] (p. 360). In biological science adaptation means the random mutation of new forms of life, not convergence on a single form or monoculture (Kramer, 2003). The term adaptation is used by Gudykunst and Kim to mean simple conformity to the coercive power (pp. 360,371) of what they call a single form of [...] "mainstream culture" [...] with its [...] "objective" [...] "external" [...] reality (p. 378) -- [...] "what is real, what is true, what is right, what is beautiful, and what is good" [...] (p. 376). As they define reality, the newcomer's perspective is false, a delusion or [...] "self-deception" [...] (p. 380) and any attempt to maintain one's original false values, beliefs, ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitute the mental illness of [...] "maladaptation" [...] (p. 372). According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the way of [...] "upward-forward" [...] (p. 382) evolution toward functional fitness and psychological health is for the newcomer to willfully [...] "unlearn" [...] and [...] "deculturize" [...] (p. 380) herself. They propose psychotherapy as well as the abandonment of all ethnic relations and associations with ethnic ties as well as avoidance of [...] "ethnic media" [...] use (pp. 365-368) to help immigrants (p. 382) achieve [...] "integrative" [...] conformity. This is not ecological integration but simple disintegration of the newcomer until their identity is erased. According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the more the newcomer is disintegrated the better, even if it leads to extreme distress for the immigrant. As Gudykunst and Kim (2003) put it, [...] "Even extreme mental illness by [...] "conformity pressure" [...] p. 371 {{can be viewed as a}} process of a potentially positive disintegration that will be reintegrated with new material at a higher level" [...] (p. 381). No matter how unjust or cruel, Gudykunst and Kim (2003) argue that the host way of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitutes the [...] "higher level" [...] of psychic evolution and any <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> to conform, to disintegration on the part of a minority person indicates that the immigrant is communicatively incompetent, immature (p. 381), mentally ill (pp. 365, 372-373, 376), weak (p. 369), irrationally aggressive or hostile (pp. 371, 376), lacking in self-control (p. 369), cynical (p. 380), pessimistic (p. 369), closed-minded (p. 369), simple minded (pp. 382-383) and [...] "ethnocentric" [...] (pp. 376, 382). Evolutionary progress for the individual requires the individual to [...] "abandon identification with the cultural patterns that have constituted who one is and what one is" [...] (p. 377). These patterns are not just behavioral but [...] "appropriate" [...] ways of thinking as defined by the majority mainstream reality. In contradistinction from Gudykunst and Kim's version of adaptive evolution, Eric M. Kramer, in his theory of Cultural Fusion (2011, 2010, 2000a, 1997a, 2000a, 2011, 2012) maintains clear conceptual separation between assimilation, adaptation, and integration. Only assimilation involves conformity to a pre-existing form. Kramer's (2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2003, 2009, 2011) theory of Cultural Fusion, which is based on systems theory and hermeneutics, argues that first it is impossible for a person to unlearn themselves and second that [...] "growth" [...] is, by definition, not a zero sum process that requires the disillusion of one form for another to come into being but rather a process of learning new languages and cultural repertoires (ways of thinking, cooking, playing, working worshipping, and so forth). One need not unlearn a language in order to learn a new one. Nor does one have to unlearn who one is in order to learn new ways of dancing, cooking, talking and so forth. Cognitive complexity involves the ability to code switch between repertoires, not a zero growth, zero-sum process as Gudykunst and Kim claim (2003, p 383). Learning is growth, not unlearning.|$|E
30|$|During the depositional {{period of}} KT-II, the open {{platform}} water energy changed intermittently, {{leading to the}} alternate deposition of high-energy shoals, low-energy shoals, and inter shoals (the low-lying land between shoals). Nonreservoirs deposited between shoals are tight and strong in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure,</b> while reservoirs between shoals are loose and weak in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure.</b> Under tectonic stress, the reservoirs of high-energy shoals and low-energy shoals would release pressure first since their particles were breaking up, resulting {{in the formation of}} microfractures; then, the tight nonreservoirs between shoals would form macrofractures. Thus, structural macrofractures of open platform facies carbonate deposition are mostly present in tight nonreservoirs, accounting for 84.4  %, and seldom in low-energy shoals. High-energy shoals are dominated by granular fracturing microfractures.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between membrane damage {{and loss of}} viability following pressure treatment was examined in Escherichia coli strains C 9490, H 1071, and NCTC 8003. These strains showed high, medium, and low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure,</b> respectively, in stationary phase but similar <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> in exponential phase. Loss of membrane integrity was measured as loss of osmotic responsiveness or as increased uptake of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide. In exponential-phase cells, loss of viability was correlated with a permanent loss of membrane integrity in all strains, whereas in stationary-phase cells, a more complicated picture emerged in which cell membranes became leaky during pressure treatment but resealed {{to a greater or}} lesser extent following decompression. Strain H 1071 displayed a very unusual pressure response in stationary phase in which survival decreased to a minimum at 300 MPa but then increased at 400 to 500 MPa before decreasing again. Membranes were unable to reseal after treatment at 300 MPa but could do so after treatment at higher pressures. Membrane damage in this strain was thus typical of exponential-phase cells under low-pressure conditions but of stationary-phase cells under higher-pressure conditions. Heat shock treatment of strain H 1071 cells increased pressure resistance under low-pressure conditions and also allowed membrane damage to reseal. Growth in the presence of IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) increased resistance under high-pressure conditions. The mechanisms of inactivation may thus differ at high and low pressures. These studies support the view that membrane damage is an important event in the inactivation of bacteria by high pressure, but the nature of membrane damage and its relation to cell death may differ between species and phases of growth...|$|E

30|$|The {{buckling}} of thin cylinders under {{axial compression}} or external pressure {{has been studied}} for many years [1 – 20] and is now well-understood. Geometric imperfections {{play a major role}} in a shell’s <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> axial compression and, generally, a lesser role in its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> external <b>pressure</b> [21 – 37]. Fewer works can be found in the literature regarding the effect of plasticity on buckling [38 – 45]: plasticity plays an important role in the case of thicker cylinders and, coupled with initial imperfections, is often responsible for the significant decrease in the critical loads observed experimentally. This type of structure is also sensitive to the care with which the boundary conditions are applied [19, 46]. The effect of the model used for the boundary condition on the critical load is also well-known, but it is more difficult to determine, in each practical case, the exact boundary condition which should be chosen. The literature on the buckling strength under combined axial compression and external pressure is less extensive [47]. The objective of this work is to propose a metallic shell which can be manufactured easily and which, on the one hand, avoids the high sensitivity to imperfections of ordinary shells under axial compression while, on the other hand, having a much better <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> external <b>pressure.</b> This leads <b>to</b> an alternative to the shell defined in [48, 49] by optimizing a NURBS surface. NURBS shells have better <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> axial compression, but their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> external <b>pressure</b> has not been assessed. There is no theoretical study or experiment available for such shells when the material has the characteristic elastic-plastic behavior of metals.|$|R
