50|$|Belay devices {{generally}} have two modes of operation: {{in the first}} mode, the rope is relatively free to be paid in/out by the belayer. The second mode, which allows the belayer to arrest the descent of a climber {{in the case of}} a fall, functions by forcing the rope(s) into tight bends where the <b>rope</b> <b>rubs</b> against the belay device and/or against itself. This <b>rubbing</b> slows the <b>rope,</b> but also generates heat. Some types of belay devices can transition between these modes without the belayer taking any action, others require the belayer to hold or pull the rope in a particular direction to arrest a fall.|$|R

50|$|Forest Adventure Parks {{are very}} popular. They take {{advantage}} of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent <b>rubbing</b> from the <b>ropes.</b>|$|R

But the owners of the [...] "Butterfly" [...] were economists. They did not think life-preserving worth the expenditure of a few shillings, so there was no lifebuoy to be found. There was a round cork fender, however, which the boy seized and flung into the sea, just as Job's grasp loosened. He uttered a wild shriek, and tossed up his arms imploringly, as he was carried away. The buoy fell close beside him, and he caught it. But it was scarce sufficient to sustain his weight, and merely prolonged the agonising struggle. Tommy soon lost sight of him in the darkness. Soon after there arose a wild fierce cry, so loud and strong that it seemed to have been uttered at the boy's elbow. Tommy shuddered, for it suggested the idea of a despairing soul.|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of wire rope, comprising multiple wire strands, spooling the wire has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers {{have a tendency to}} crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The <b>rubbing</b> of <b>rope</b> against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1937, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums. Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.Introducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, pitches {{are often}} more complex, and multi-pitch rigging is used extensively. Long drops are broken into smaller pitches. Re-belays and {{deviations}} are used to direct the rope away from areas of sharp rock and from water. Where <b>rope</b> <b>rub</b> cannot be avoided, rope protectors are installed. Traverses are often installed to allow the rigger to reach an area where {{it is possible to}} hang the <b>rope</b> with no <b>rub.</b> Since allowing the <b>rope</b> to <b>rub</b> against the walls is prevented, lighter ropes are used, usually 8-9mm thick. This has the advantage of being lighter and therefore more economical to carry on long or deep trips. Bobbin descenders are quicker to change over at re-belays and are also lighter to carry. Deviations are short length of tape or rope pulling the main rope to one side with a carabiner which can be conveniently unclipped and replaced to allow passing. Rope-walking techniques are less effective in cases of awkward passageways and for changeovers at rebelays.Many caves have been equipped with bolt holes consisting of internally threaded metal inserts fixed into holes drilled in the rock. Subsequent visitors carry their own belay eyelets to bolt into these points. Selecting the best position for bolts needs particular care, the aim often being to achieve a 'Y' shaped rope hang between two bolts on opposite walls. This technique can help to prevent the rope from coming in contact with the rock, shares the load between the two belays, and reduces the shock load should one fail (in comparison {{with the use of a}} slack backup rope).|$|R
40|$|Preventing and {{treating}} mange Cue: One advantage that goats have over some {{other species of}} livestock is their hardiness. Goats are tough animals which do not commonly suffer from health problems. However, once a goat does become sick, its condition can worsen quickly and it may soon die. It is therefore vital that goat farmers have good systems in place to keep their animals healthy. Simple preventative measures like good feeding, clean water, clean housing and occasional treatments for internal parasites and skin diseases are all recommended. Sometimes goats can be affected by a skin disease called mange (pron. Mainj) which if left untreated {{can lead to the}} death of the animal. The disease is caused by a tiny mite. If goats have patches of bare skin, for example, where their skin has been <b>rubbed</b> by a <b>rope,</b> these are particularly vulnerable to the mites. Sometimes an outbreak of the disease can spread through an entire flock, so mange is a problem that farmers should take seriously. Chris Kakunta asked Dr Muzumbwe Kanemanema, District Veterinary Officer in Lusaka, Zambia, to explain more about the problem, and how farmers can prevent and treat it. IN:		?Goats are usually affected with ?? OUT:		??animals during the rainy season. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 41 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Kanemanema of the Zambian veterinary service. To treat mange in goats, farmers are advised to vigorously scrub an appropriate acaricide into the affected area. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kanemanema	Goats are usually affected with a skin disease called mange and this disease is caused by mange mites which burrow in the skin, under the skin and they eat up the hair follicles. So the hair drops down and the goat will have dry skin and no hair. Kakunta	How devastating is this disease? Kanemanema	This disease is so devastating it brings down production and it also causes mortalities in goats. The skin dries up and hardens up, then you find that the goat cannot walk properly and eventually the animal dies off. Kakunta	Has it got some treatment? Kanemanema	Yes it is treatable. Skin conditions take a bit of time to heal and you can treat it with Ivermectin which we inject on a weekly basis, maybe it might require up to three injections. Kakunta	Now do you think the use of acaricides is a worthwhile exercise for a small scale farmer? Kanemanema	Yes acaricides can be used and Milbitraz does very well for mange treatment not any other acaricides. So if you are using Milbitraz then a goat has to be dipped every three to four days until the skin condition is cleared. Kakunta	In Zambia here most farmers only dip their cattle, it is rare that they would be dipping their goats. I do not know how effective dipping can be? Kanemanema	Usually dipping for goats is recommended when you have noticed that there are ticks on the goats or they have this skin condition. Under normal circumstances if the housing is perfect, where the house is well done and the goats live away from the dung and the urine then these conditions can be avoided. Kakunta	So are we talking about management practices being very important in terms of preventing this disease? Kanemanema	Very correct, management is very very vital. If your housing structure for the goats is where the goats would just be lying on the dung and the urine, the chances of them developing this condition is very very high. So the housing should be constructed where the dung and the urine will go down and it is not in contact with the animals. Kakunta	Is it a very common disease here in Zambia? Kanemanema	It is very common, we do get it especially in the rainy season. It comes up here and there and we are able to control it using the two drugs I mentioned earlier on Ivermectin which is injectable and Milbitraz, which is a dip. Kakunta	What about the use of local herbs and so on, can it work as well? Kanemanema	Well I have been to places where I have found people using some local herb which they pound and then they wash the goats and the skin condition goes away, but I think that requires further research, so that we know what is the active ingredient in here which is helping us kill this mange mite. Kakunta	Is there anything else that I have left out in terms of management of mange which you think is very important especially to small scale farmers? Kanemanema	To avoid this skin condition called mange basically the house should be well constructed and it should have a roof so that water does not get to the animals during the rainy season.
