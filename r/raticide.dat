The place was crowded. The famous dog Billy, of rat-killing notoriety, 26 lb. weight, was wagered, for twenty sovereigns, to kill one hundred rats in twelve minutes. The rats were turned out loose at once in a 12-feet square, and the floor whitened, so that the rats might be visible to all. The set-to began, and Billy exerted himself to the utmost. At four minutes and three quarters, as the hero's head was covered with gore, he {{was removed from the}} pit, and his chaps being washed, he lapped some water to cool his throat. Again he entered the arena, and in vain did the unfortunate victims labour to obtain {{security}} by climbing against the sides of the pit, or by crouching beneath the hero. By twos and threes they were caught, and soon their mangled corpses proved the valour of the victor. Some of the flying enemy, more valiant than the rest, endeavoured by seizing this Quinhus Flestrum of heroic dogs by the ears, to procure a respite, or to sell their life as dearly as possible; but his grand paw soon swept off the buzzers, and consigned them to their fate. At seven minutes and a quarter, or according to another watch, for there were two umpires and two watches, at seven minutes and seventeen seconds, the victor relinquished the glorious pursuit, for all his foes lay slaughtered on the ensanguined plain. Billy was then caressed and fondled by many; the dog is estimated by amateurs as a most dextrous animal; he is, unfortunately, what the French Monsieurs call borg-ne, that is, blind of an eye.-This precious organ was lost to him some time since by the intrepidity of an inimical rat, which as he had not seized it in a proper place, turned round on its murderer, and reprived him by one bite of the privilege of seeing with two eyes in future. [...] The dog BILLY, of rat-killing notoriety, on the evening of the 13th instant, again exhibited his surprising dexterity; he was wagered to kill one hundred rats within twelve minutes; but six minutes and twenty five seconds only elapsed, when every rat lay stretched on the gory plain, without the least symptom of life appearing.' Billy was decorated with a silver collar, and a number of ribband bows, and was led off amidst the applauses of the persons assembled." ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} explore the suicidal process, suicidal {{communication}} and psychosocial situation of young suicide attempters in a rural community in Hanoi, Vietnam. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, in a community setting, with 19 suicide attempters aged 15 - 24 who had been consecutively hospitalized in an intensive care unit. In 12 of 19 cases, the first pressing, distinct and constant suicidal thoughts appeared less than one day before the suicide attempt in question. However, distress and mild, fleeting suicidal thoughts had been present {{up to six months}} before the suicide attempt in 16 cases. Five respondents had a suicide plan one to three days before attempting suicide. Altogether, 13 engaged in some form of suicidal communication before their attempt. This communication was, however, difficult for outsiders to interpret. Twelve of the respondents were victims of regular physical abuse and 16 had suffered psychological violence for at least one year before attempting suicide. Eighteen of the respondents used pesticides or <b>raticides</b> in their suicide attempts. None sought advice or consultation in the community despite long-standing psychosocial problems. The strategy of reducing the availability of suicide means (e. g., pesticides or <b>raticides)</b> in Asian countries should be complemented with a long-term suicide-preventive strategy that targets school dropouts and domestic violence, and promotes coping abilities and communication about psychological and social problems as well as recognition of signs of distress and suicidal communication...|$|R
40|$|Squill [Urginea maritima (L.) Baker, Liliaceae] is {{a native}} {{medicinal}} and ornamental plant from the Mediterranean area. The bulbs were an ancient source of rodenticide products replaced later on by warfarin and modern anticoagulant <b>raticides.</b> Since rats have developed resistance to such products there is now re-newed interest in the species. In the 1950 s, attempts {{were made in the}} United States to introduce this new crop for arid lands. A collection of bulbs are still maintained at Gentry Experimental Farm, Murrieta, California. Some limitations concerning variability in toxicity were previously discussed (Verbiscar et al. 1986 a; Gentry et al. 1987). Scilliroside, a high toxicity bufadienolide glycoside, is the main active principle. Other glycosides and agly-cones have also been isolated from the bulb (Verbiscar et al. 1986 b). We tested this plant in our research program to screen botanicals for insecticidal activity at “Centro d...|$|R

40|$|Chumbinho is {{the popular}} name given to {{carbamate}} aldicarb (Temik), an insecticide {{commonly used in}} agriculture and highly toxic (LD 50 [*]=[*] 0. 9 mg/kg oral in rats) that has been sold clandestinely in several regions of Brazil. Chumbinho is sold illegally as <b>raticide</b> and is available in a formulation of small black granules which are easily mixed with food for criminal purposes, its use often being attributed to accidents and suicides, hence the importance of its inclusion in the toxicology studies of suspicious deaths. With the corpse putrefaction, many pathological and toxicological anatomical parameters are damaged or lost. This study {{emphasizes the importance of}} the gastric content observation, which in this case has, despite the advanced putrefaction, recognized the presence of chumbinho and guide its toxicological confirmation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Geminiviruses are a {{group of}} plant viruses that contain {{circular}} single stranded (ss) DNA genomes encapsidated in small twinned icosahedral capsids. The virus DNA A plus strand encodes the coat protein (CP/AV 1) essential for viral transmission by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) [4]. Jatropha {{has been found to}} have strong molluscicidal activity and the latex to be strongly inhibitory to watermelon mosaic virus. It is also listed as a homicide, piscicide and <b>raticide.</b> Jatropha is considered as a poor quality fuelwood since the soft wood burns too rapidly. In Africa, Jatropha is widely planted as a “living fence ” and hedgerows to protect food crops from damage by livestock and as a windbreak to prevent soil erosion moisture depletion. In Madagascar, Jatropha is used as a support plant for Vanilla. Jatropha is grown both as a vegetable and a spice crop[1]. Out of the 22 viruses infecting jatropha, mosaic and lea...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{poisoning}} is {{a frequent}} accident in childhood, particularly in children under 4 years of age. This was a descriptive study with data collected from standardized forms of the Poison Control Center and patient record charts. All the cases of acute poisoning in children aged 0 to 14 years during the period 2008 to 2012 were selected. The variables studied comprised characteristics of the events and toxic agents, clinical development, and outcome. A total of 657 cases of acute poisoning, with higher frequency in the age-group from 1 to 4 years (48. 7 %) and male sex (53. 4 %), were recorded. The occurrences were accidental in 92 % of the cases, and 5. 8 % were due to suicide attempts. Among the toxic agents, medications (28. 5 %), venomous animals (19. 3 %), nonvenomous animals (10 %), household cleaning products (9. 0 %), and <b>raticide</b> agents (8. 7 %) predominated. The majority of cases were characterized as light (73. 5 %) and around 18 % required hospitalization, and there was low lethality (0. 5 %) ...|$|E
