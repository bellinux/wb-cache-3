40|$|Background Molecular {{testing for}} viral {{pathogens}} {{has resulted in}} increasing detection of multiple viruses in respiratory secretions of ill children. The clinical impact of multiple virus infections on clinical presentation and outcome is unclear. Objectives To compare clinical characteristics and viral load between children with multiple virus versus single virus illnesses. Patients ⁄methods Eight hundred and ninety-three <b>residual</b> <b>nasal</b> wash samples from children treated for respiratory illness at Children’s Hospital, Seattle, from September 2003 to September 2004 were evaluated by quantitative PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza (Flu), parainfluenza, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses (CoV). Illness severity and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical charts. Results Coinfections were identified in 103 (18 %) of 566 virus...|$|R
40|$|Nasal midline {{masses of}} {{ectodermal}} origin include nasal dermoids (ND) and nasal dermal sinus cysts (NDSC). NDSC {{are characterized by}} an intracranial-extradural extension, while ND are limited to the nasal dorsum, medial canthus, or glabella without intracranial extension. We report our experience in 11 NDSC patients. The goal {{of this study is}} to present the management including surgical technique for NDSC and compare it with the literature. Because a transfacial approach for NDSC with vertical incision caused visible scarring in two out of three patients, we applied a new surgical approach in four patients. This approach consisted of a simple excision and mobilisation of the pit while the proximal part is resected using a coronal transfrontal approach. The relation of the <b>nasal</b> <b>fistula</b> to the <b>nasal</b> bone is essential considering osteotomy. Disruption of the bony cartilaginous junction of the nasal dorsum must be prevented to avoid later growth impairment of the nose. There was no recurrence of NDSC in all 7 operated patients after a mean follow-up of 3. 9 years (range 0. 5 - 7. 2 years) ...|$|R
40|$|A 10 -year-old, intact male, pinscher was {{presented}} with unilateral bloodstained nasal discharge, sneezing, dyspnea, zygomatic arch deformity, submandibular lymph node increase, blindness in right eye, and exophthalmia. After clinical examination, {{it was found that}} the animal presented with upper respiratory tract dyspnea origin, possibly caused by an obstructive process. Complete blood count (CBC), ocular ultrasonography, thoracic radiographs, mandibular lymph node, and nasal sinus fine needle aspiration were performed. The right mandibular lymph node excisional biopsy was conducted and a tumor sample was obtained through the <b>nasal</b> <b>fistula</b> at hard palate. The material was processed, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin (AE 1 /AE 3), vimentin, and COX- 2 was performed. After histopathological evaluation nasal carcinoma diagnosis was obtained. Chemotherapy was established with carboplatin 300 [*]mg/m 2 intravenously—four cycles with intervals of 21 days—and firocoxib 5 [*]mg/kg orally every 24 hours for 7 months. After 7 months the treatment started, the animal presented with ataxia, vocalization, hyperesthesia, and anorexia. Due the clinical condition presented, the animal owner opted for performing euthanasia.

40|$|The modern {{technique}} of presurgical orthopedics and nasoalveolar molding produces a better skeletal foundation and nasal shape for the repair of the bilateral cleft lip-nasal deformity. The general principles are as follows: (1) preserve the presurgical columellar length; (2) keep {{the width of}} the central lip segment narrow without compromising the blood supply; (3) advance the columella prolabium complex superiorly to allow reconstruction of the orbicularis oris muscle behind the prolabium; (4) release the alar cartilage attachment from the pyriform rim and provide additional coverage of this soft tissue deficiency with the use of inferior turbinate flaps; (5) release and reposition the lower lateral cartilage; (6) adequately dissect above the maxillary periosteum; (7) reconstruct the nasal floor by local mucosal flaps; (8) reconstruct the prolabial buccal sulcus with tissue from the prolabium; (9) reconstruct the orbicularis muscle sphincter and attach it to the anterior nasal spine; (10) reconstruct a new Cupid's bow, central vermilion, and lip tubercle with tissue from the lateral lips; (11) balance the height of both lateral lips without any incision around the ala; and (12) maintain the presurgical nasolabial angle. The <b>residual</b> <b>nasal</b> deformity remains a problem that needs further improvement. The long-term result in Chang Gung Craniofacial Center suggests overcorrection of columella height before, during, and after lip repair...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral {{cleft lip}} and palate (UCLP) is a craniofacial {{malformation}} with functional and aesthetical {{impact on the}} face and the upper airways. The aims of the current thesis were to evaluate Quality of life (QoL) in adults treated for UCLP  (I), to objectively evaluate nasal form and function and to search for possible differences in <b>residual</b> <b>nasal</b> deformity and impairment of function between patients operated according to one-stage and two-stage palate closure (II) {{as well as to}} evaluate the relationship between professional and lay rating and patient satisfaction with nasolabial appearance (III) and to identify factors associated with lower levels of QoL and less satisfaction with nasal appearance among adults treated for UCLP (IV). Analyses of data from a homogenous population of UCLP patients treated at Uppsala University Hospital form the basis of this thesis. The mean follow-up time after primary surgery was 35 years (20 - 47 years) and participation rate was 79 % (n= 86). An age and gender matched control group of 68 people without clefts were evaluated according to the same protocol. The evaluation protocol included the Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF- 36), rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, odor test, peak nasal inspiratory flow test and photographies of faces. For the SF- 36 data, age- and gender-matched norm data of 1385 people from the Swedish population were used. Unilateral cleft lip and palate affected QoL differently depending on gender and age of the patient. Younger patients were affected more negatively than older patients in several subscales. However, except for lower values in the Mental Health subscale, QoL was similar among UCLP patients and norm data. Objectively measured nasal function was extensively affected among adults treated for UCLP. No difference in impairment of nasal function was found between one-stage and two-stage palate closure protocols on the cleft side. Judgment of nasolabial appearance differed between professionals, lay people and patients. Large infant cleft width was associated with less satisfaction with nasal appearance and male gender was associated with lower levels of mental QoL. Correlation between high nasal breathing resistance and low levels of physical QoL was found. In conclusion, this thesis provides a platform for future research for optimal evaluation of cleft treatment outcome...|$|R
40|$|Background Nasal packing is {{routinely}} used after septoplasty {{because it is}} believed to decrease risk of postoperative bleeding, hematomas, and adhesions. Multiple studies have shown, however, that there are numerous complications associated with nasal packing. The purpose of this work was to perform a meta-analysis on the existing literature to evaluate the role of nasal packing after septoplasty. Methods Two independent reviewers conducted a literature search using EMBASE, OVID, Medline, PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane Library, and reference list review from 1966 to August 2010 to identify studies assessing nasal packing after septoplasty. All papers were reviewed for study design, results, and were assigned an Oxford level of evidence grade, Detsky score, and Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) score. Results Sixteen papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Eleven papers were randomized control trials, 3 were prospective, and 2 were retrospective studies. Nasal packing did not show benefit in reducing postoperative bleeding, hematomas, septal perforations, adhesions, or <b>residual</b> deviated <b>nasal</b> septum. There was, however, an increase in postoperative infections. Two studies using fibrin products as nasal packing showed a decreased bleeding rate. Conclusion Nasal packing after septoplasty does not show any postoperative benefits. Fibrin products show a possibility of decreasing postoperative bleeding. Routine use of nasal packing after septoplasty is not warranted. This is the first meta-analysis conducted on this topic. Sarfaraz M. Banglawala, Mandeep Gill, Doron D.

40|$|Case summary A 13 -year-old, {{castrated}} male, British Shorthair cat {{presented for}} investigation of chronic, intermittent, bilateral epistaxis and stertor. CT revealed severe asymmetric bilateral intranasal involvement with extensive turbinate lysis, increased soft tissue attenuation and lysis of the sphenopalatine bone and cribriform plate. On retroflexed pharyngoscopy, a plaque-like mass occluded the choanae. Rostral rhinoscopic examination revealed extensive loss of nasal turbinates, necrotic tissue and mucosal fungal plaques {{in the left}} nasal cavity. The right nasal cavity was less severely affected. The nasal cavities were debrided extensively of plaques and necrotic tissue. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated on fungal culture, and species identity was confirmed using comparative sequence analysis of the partial β-tubulin gene. On histopathology of nasal biopsies, there was ulcerative lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic rhinitis, and fungal hyphae were identified on nasal mucosa, consistent with a non-invasive mycosis. The cat was treated with oral itraconazole after endoscopic debridement, but signs relapsed 4. 5 months from diagnosis. <b>Residual</b> left <b>nasal</b> fungal plaques were again debrided endoscopically and oral posaconazole was administered for 6 months. Fourteen months from diagnosis, the cat remains clinically well with mild intermittent left nasal discharge secondary to atrophic rhinitis. Relevance and novel information This is the first case of rhinoscopically confirmed sinonasal aspergillosis to be diagnosed in a cat in the UK. Endoscopic confirmation of resolution of infection is useful in cases where mild nasal discharge persists after treatment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the imaging {{findings}} of nasal septal abscess in 2 patients with immunosuppression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two patients with immunosuppression were identified as having a nasal septal abscess, and correlative CT imaging in both patients was evaluated. RESULTS: The characteristic radiographic appearance of a nasal septal abscess included a fluid collection with thin rim enhancement, located within the cartilaginous nasal septum. After CT exam-ination, incision and drainage was performed in both patients, and appropriate antibiotic coverage was initiated. Clinical and imaging follow-up demonstrated no signs of <b>residual</b> infection. CONCLUSION: <b>Nasal</b> septal abscess has a characteristic appearance on CT examination. Prompt diagnosis and treatment, including incision and drainage and appropriate antibiotic coverage, are necessary to avoid serious complications. Nasal septal abscess is defined as a collection of purulentmaterial between the cartilaginous or bony septum and the mucoperichondrium or mucoperiosteum. 1 Nasal septal ab-scessesoccurmorecommonlyafterminornasal trauma 1 butmay also result from iatrogenic causes 2 and sinonasal 3 or dental infec...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanisms by which histamine causes nasal blockage. Histamine, 40 – 800 [*]μg, intranasally into each nostril, induced significant blockage of the nasal airway in normal human subjects, as measured by acoustic rhinometry. Oral pretreatment with cetirizine, 5 – 30 [*]mg, the H 1 antagonist, failed to reverse completely the nasal blockage induced by histamine, 400 [*]μg. Dimaprit, 50 – 200 [*]μg, the H 2 agonist, intranasally, caused nasal blockage, which was reversed by oral pretreatment with ranitidine, 75 [*]mg, the H 2 antagonist. A combination of cetirizine, 20 [*]mg, and ranitidine, 75 [*]mg, caused greater inhibition of the nasal blockage caused by histamine, 400 [*]μg, than cetirizine alone. In the presence of both antagonists, there was <b>residual</b> histamine-induced <b>nasal</b> blockage. R-α-methylhistamine (R-α-MeH), 100 – 600 [*]μg, the H 3 agonist, intranasally, caused nasal blockage, which was not inhibited by either cetirizine or ranitidine. Thioperamide, 700 [*]μg, the H 3 antagonist, intranasally, reversed the R-α-MeH-induced nasal blockage. Thioperamide alone had no significant action on the nasal blockage induced by histamine, 400 and 1000 [*]μg, but, in the presence of cetirizine, 20 [*]mg, thioperamide further reduced the histamine-induced nasal blockage. Corynanthine, 2 [*]mg, the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, administered intranasally, caused nasal blockage. Corynanthine produced a greater increase in nasal blockage when in combination with bradykinin compared to its combination with R-α-MeH. There appears to be a contribution of H 1, H 2 and H 3 receptors to histamine-induced nasal blockage in normal human subjects. The sympathetic nervous system actively maintains nasal patency and we suggest that activation of nasal H 3 receptors may downregulate sympathetic activity...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcomes of secondary functional cheilorhinoplasty of <b>residual</b> lip and <b>nasal</b> deformities caused by muscular deficiency in cleft patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 4 -year period, 31 patients underwent cheilorhinoplasty, including complete reopening of the cleft borders and differentiated mimic muscle reorientation. In 21 patients, remarkable residual clefts of the anterior palate were also closed. Simultaneous alveolar bone grafting was performed in 15 patients. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. Cosmetic features evaluated were spontaneous facial appearance and changes in position of the nasal floor and the philtrum. The width of the alar base was measured. For functional outcomes, deficiency during mimic movements was evaluated, using standardized photographs taken preoperatively and postoperatively. The final results, judged according to defined criteria with several clinical factors, were compared. RESULTS: Cosmetic and functional improvement was achieved in all patients. In young patients (aged 4 to 9 years), the improvements were noteworthy. There were no differences in outcomes between the groups with and without simultaneous grafting, except for unilateral cases with minor muscular deficiency, in whom bone grafting before cheilorhinoplasty led to better results. CONCLUSION: In cases of major muscular deficiency, early cheilorhinoplasty should be performed at age 7 years, without waiting for the usual timing of bone grafting. In minor and moderate cases, the operation can ideally be done in combination with bone grafting...|$|R
