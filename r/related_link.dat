50|$|The 2014 AP Chemistry exam was {{the first}} {{administration}} of a redesigned test {{as a result of}} a redesigning of the AP Chemistry course. The exam format is now different from the past years, with 60 multiple choice questions (now with only four answer choices per question), 3 long free response questions, and 4 short free response questions. The new exam has a focus on longer, more in depth, lab-based questions. The penalty for incorrect answers on the multiple choice section was also removed.

As well, we show that the data do exhibit a <b>related</b> <b>link</b> suggested by standard models - that the exchange rate helps predict these fundamentals.

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} an action of a polynomial {{ring on the}} colored sl 2 link homology of Cooper-Krushkal, over which this homology is finitely generated. We define a new, <b>related</b> <b>link</b> homology which is finite dimensional, extends to tangles, and categorifies a scalar-multiple of the sl 2 Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. We expect this homology to be functorial under 4 -dimensional cobordisms. The polynomial action is related to a conjecture of Gorsky-Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende on the stable Khovanov homology of torus knots, and as an application we obtain a weak version of this conjecture. A key new ingredient is {{the construction of a}} bounded chain complex which categorifies a scalar multiple of the Jones-Wenzl projector, in which the denominators have been cleared. 1...|$|E

Extracting these types of knowledge required many of KDD steps such as preprocessing, pattern discovery, and pattern analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the impact of propagation effects at 20 / 30 GHz on the performances of the radio interface of a VSAT videoconferencing system and to demonstrate the interest to implement Fade Mitigation Techniques in order to improve the link availability. Specifications and system requirements of the VSAT network are briefly described. System performances of the physical layer are simulated using time-series data measured with the ESA's OLYMPUS satellite. The simulations enable to implement and optimize Up-Link Power Control and Data Rate Reduction, and to assess the <b>related</b> <b>link</b> performance improvement. Moreover, the introduction of propagation data sets allows to have a better idea of some system parameters which directly impact on the quality of service such as the switching rate or the link availability that such a system should have when deployed in operational conditions.

30|$|To obtain <b>related</b> <b>link</b> {{throughput}} {{and construct}} transmission paths, the typical existing scheme uses {{the method of}} actual measurements of link throughput, which are then reported to the related components of infrastructure. After that, the throughput values of all potential transmission paths are estimated and they are regarded as the input parameters of the relay selection algorithm. However, since the calculation of co-channel interference of outband D 2 D links involves the number of co-channels, the distribution, and other information of interference sources, the above scheme needs several times of iteration to obtain a convergence value of transmission path throughput. Hence, the computational and communication complexity increase accordingly. The algorithm in this paper firstly adopts the strategy of relay preselection and then verifies whether the selected relay improves throughput or not. Finally, the relatively stable values of link throughput and communication paths are determined at a time instead of several times of iteration. Meanwhile, the communication complexity is reduced because of the one-round decision.|$|E
