40|$|Characteristics of the {{electroretinogram}} (ERG) {{produced by}} the essentially all <b>rod</b> <b>eye</b> of the rat are presented as functions {{of the number of}} quanta absorbed by each rod per stimulus flash. The ERG's were obtained with 1. 5 msec. stimulus flashes and uniform illumination of the entire retina. Under these conditions, distortions in the ERG due to stray light are minimized, and the ERG more accurately reflects the activity of its retinal sources. The effects of background light and two forms of dark adaptation were studied and compared. The results, especially for the b-wave, permit an interpretation in terms of two distinct processes. One process appears to determine the b-wave latency. This process is almost independent of the state of adaptation of the retina. The other process does not affect the latency, but determines the b-wave threshold and amplitude. This process strongly depends upon the state of adaptation. Moreover, the effects of dark adaptation on this amplitude-determining process are almost identical with the effects of background light...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{graduation}} theses is geometrical and {{thermodynamic calculation}} of determined five-cylinder diesel engine and calculation of operation parameters of cylindrical unit and then to compare them with real motor and strike the balance. Other step {{is to work out}} thermodynamic cycle and draw the result in p-V diagram. Then to calculate power, effecting on piston which includes proposal of basic proportion of piston and wrist pin, and it follows weigh of piston group and maximal quickening and inertial force of piston group, calculation of specific pressure and pressure in wrist pin. Other purpose is to determine basic proportion for piston rod and to focus on material qualities of con <b>rod</b> <b>eye</b> and bronze case, determination of maximal pressure due to inertial forces comming from gas pressure and security against possible slip and tiredness.

5000|$|Roman aqueducts {{required}} a comprehensive system of regular maintenance. The [...] "clear corridors" [...] created {{to protect the}} fabric of underground and overground conduits were regularly patrolled for unlawful ploughing, planting, roadways and buildings. Frontinus describes the penetration of conduits by tree-roots as particularly damaging. Quite apart from this, the aqueducts themselves would have been regularly inspected and maintained by working patrols, to reduce algal fouling, repair accidental breaches, to clear the conduits of gravel and other loose debris, and to remove channel-narrowing accretions of calcium carbonate in systems fed by hard water sources. Inspection and access points were provided at regular intervals on the standard, buried conduits. Accretions within syphons could drastically reduce flow rates, due to the already narrow diameter of their pipes. Some had sealed openings {{that might have been}} used as <b>rodding</b> <b>eyes,</b> possibly using a pull-through device. In Rome, where a hard-water supply was the norm, mains pipework was shallowly buried beneath road kerbs, for ease of access; the accumulation of calcium carbonate in these pipes would have necessitated their frequent replacement.|$|R
5000|$|All geckos, {{excluding}} the Eublepharidae family, lack eyelids and instead have a transparent membrane, which they lick to clean. [...] Nocturnal species {{have an excellent}} night vision; their color vision is 350 times more sensitive than human color vision. The nocturnal geckos evolved from diurnal species which had lost the <b>eye</b> <b>rods.</b> The gecko <b>eye</b> therefore modified its cones that increased in size into different types both single and double. Three different photopigments have been retained and are sensitive to UV, blue, and green. They also use a multifocal optical system {{that allows them to}} generate a sharp image for at least two different depths.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{insensitivity}} {{of night}} vision to red and a slow adaption {{of the red}} sensitive <b>eye</b> <b>rods</b> to {{the light of the}} stars, astronomers making magnitude estimates of red variable stars, especially carbon stars, {{have to know how to}} deal with the Purkinje effect in order not to underestimate the magnitude of the observed star.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{research}} {{is still not}} definitive, the literature has suggested that argyria can cause a decrement in kidney function. Additionally, a lack of night vision may be present. [...] The lack of night vision would most likely be due to damaged <b>rods</b> in the <b>eye,</b> from the exposure to silver or silver dust particles in the ocular region.|$|R

30|$|A full-field {{electroretinogram}} (ERG) {{was performed}} 2  months following surgery, as the patient's vision remained 20 / 50 despite successful anatomic reattachment and a normal foveal contour. Photoreceptor responses were severely abnormal {{for the right}} <b>eye.</b> <b>Rods</b> and dark-adapted cone responses were severely subnormal. The scotopic bright flash a-wave responses were moderately subnormal, whereas the b-wave amplitudes were markedly subnormal, creating an electronegative configuration consistent with siderosis.|$|R

50|$|Dichromatic {{vision is}} the result of the animal having two types of cones in their eyes: a short-{{wavelength}}-sensitive cone (S) that is optimal at 428 nm (blue), and a middle-to-long wavelength sensitive cone (M/L) which sees optimally at 539 nm, more of a yellowish color. This structure may have arisen because horses are most active at dawn and dusk, a time when the <b>rods</b> of the <b>eye</b> are especially useful.|$|R
5000|$|The theory {{behind the}} {{effectiveness}} behind LRGB techniques has {{been related to}} the way humans see color. The <b>rods</b> in human <b>eyes</b> are sensitive to luminance and spatial data, while the cones are sensitive to color. There are three types of cones: those sensitive to red, those sensitive to green, and those sensitive to blue. Thus, each element of LRGB targets one type of photoreceptor cell in the human eye.|$|R
50|$|Lt Saurabh Kalia and his {{men were}} in captivity from 15 May 1999 - 7 June 1999 (over twenty-two days), and {{subjected}} to torture as evident from injuries to their bodies when they were handed over by the Pakistani Army on 9 June 1999. Post-mortem examinations revealed that the Pakistanis had tortured their prisoners by: burning their bodies with cigarettes, piercing the ear-drums with hot <b>rods,</b> puncturing <b>eyes</b> before removing them, breaking most of their teeth and bones, fracturing their skulls, cutting the lips, chipping of nose, chopping off limbs and private organs of the soldiers, and finally shooting them dead, as evidenced by bullet wounds to the temple. The post-mortem also confirmed the injuries were inflicted ante-mortem (before death).|$|R
60|$|Everybody, of course, {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in this experiment. The vessel was at least {{two miles from the}} iceberg, but in the clear atmosphere the glittering eminence could be plainly seen, and, with a glass, the great iron rod standing high up on its peak was perfectly visible. All were on deck when Mr. Gibbs stood ready to discharge the bomb on top of the <b>rod,</b> and all <b>eyes</b> were fixed upon the iceberg.|$|R
50|$|A dark {{area has}} limited light sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to {{alternating}} light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness. When a vertebrate, like a human, enters a dark area, its pupils dilate, allowing more light {{to enter the}} eye and improving night vision. Also, the light detecting cells in the human <b>eye</b> (<b>rods</b> and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness.|$|R
50|$|Ketra Oberlander {{gradually}} {{lost much}} of her vision, including much of her colour perception (cone of the eye) and black-and-white perception (<b>rod</b> of the <b>eye).</b> She is now legally blind, although she retains a restricted degree of vision. In mid-life, she changed careers, becoming a professional artist. Oberlander is able to use computers to create digital graphics, and also paints in acrylics. She founded an art licensing company that helps mobility-impaired artists distribute their work.|$|R

This fictional colour is strongly indicative of magic and can only be seen by wizards (who sometimes describe it as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple) and cats. Given that the normal human visual system works by the presence of cones and <b>rods</b> in the <b>eye,</b> the ability of Discworld wizards to see octarine is explained by the additional presence of octagon cells.|$|R

50|$|The {{superstructure}} {{is eight}} panels {{and includes a}} floor system made up of 3 by 12 in treated timbers on 5 in steel I-section stringers which are themselves supported by 12 in steel I-section floor beams. These beams are fastened to the hip verticals with riveted plates and are riveted directly to the intermediate posts, except for one exception: the first post to the east {{on the south side}} is welded to the floor beam with a steel plate set eight inches off center; it is uncertain whether this was a repair or a correction of the design as it was being built. Both top and bottom lateral bracing consists of <b>eye</b> <b>rods</b> stabilized at intersecting points with bolted plates. The top chords, end posts, and intermediate posts are channels with riveted cover plates and lacing bars. The hip verticals are double forged <b>eye</b> <b>rods,</b> while the diagonals are double punched eye bars. The counters are turnbuckles. The lateral and portal struts are double angles to which portal bracing (double angles) is connected with ledger plates. The portal struts and bracing make up a riveted unit which is bolted to the end posts. 2 in by 6 in wooden guard rails are boted to the bridge with angle sections. A builder's plate is fastened to the top portal struts {{at each end of the}} bridge.|$|R

2500|$|Although some {{scientific}} research is applied research into specific problems, {{a great deal}} of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question [...] "what is the use of basic research?" [...] he responded: [...] "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?". For example, research into the effects of red light on the human <b>eye's</b> <b>rod</b> cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.|$|R

When Rollo attempts to work out how the theft can be traced,he and Willa finally kiss, just as Vince arrives to return the money. A confrontation takes place first at the zoo office, and then outside as Willa, Rollo, Bugsy and several others attempt to stop Vince from running off with the money. Bugsy refuses to shut up, so Vince loses his temper and grabs a pistol from the management office. Rod arrives just as Vince is being subdued and announces the police {{are on their way}} to arrest Vince for stealing.

5000|$|While {{monochromatic}} photos {{make this}} effect appear white, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute scientist Steve Haddock (an {{author of a}} milky seas effect study) has commented, [...] "the light produced by the bacteria is actually blue, not white. It is white in the graphic because of the monochromatic sensor we used, and it can appear white to the <b>eye</b> because the <b>rods</b> in our <b>eye</b> (used for night vision) don't discriminate color." [...] In Shetland (where generally caused by Noctiluca scintillans), mareel has sometimes been described as being green, rather than the traditional blue or white milky seas effect seen {{by the rest of}} the world. It is not known whether this difference depends on the area, or simply a perception of a cyanic colour as being green.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the effort}} to reduce light pollution, {{researchers}} have developed a [...] "Unified System of Photometry," [...] which {{is a way to}} measure how much or what kind of street lighting is needed. The Unified System of Photometry allows light fixtures to be designed to reduce energy use while maintaining or improving perceptions of visibility, safety, and security. There was a need to create a new system of light measurement at night because the biological way in which the <b>eye’s</b> <b>rods</b> and cones process light is different in nighttime conditions versus daytime conditions. Using this new system of photometry, results from recent studies have indicated that replacing traditional, yellowish, high-pressure sodium (HPS) lights with [...] "cool" [...] white light sources, such as induction, fluorescent, ceramic metal halide, or LEDs can actually reduce the amount of electric power used for lighting while maintaining or improving visibility in nighttime conditions.|$|R
25|$|There are two {{sorts of}} light receptors in a bird’s <b>eye,</b> <b>rods</b> and cones. Rods, which contain the visual pigment {{rhodopsin}} are better for night vision {{because they are}} sensitive to small quantities of light. Cones detect specific colours (or wavelengths) of light, so they are more important to colour-orientated animals such as birds. Most birds are tetrachromatic, possessing four types of cone cells each with a distinctive maximal absorption peak. In some birds, the maximal absorption peak of the cone cell responsible for the shortest wavelength extends to the ultraviolet (UV) range, making them UV-sensitive. In addition to that, the cones at bird's retina are arranged in a characteristic form of spatial distribution, known as hyperuniform distribution, which maximizes its light and color absorption. This form of spatial distributions are only observed {{as a result of}} some optimization process, which in this case can be described in terms of bird's evolutionary history.|$|R
40|$|EN] Being fish larvae visual feeders, vision {{plays an}} {{important}} role in larval orientation at first feeding (Blaxter, 1986). Larval trophic behaviour is closely related with the development of the visual capacity, which directly depends on retina organogenesis. In sparids, such as Pagrus major (Kawamura, 1984) and Pagrus auratus (Pankhurst, 1996), the most important changes in the eye structure occur along the lecitotrophic stage as a preparation for prey capture. Neuringer et al.,(1988) has established a critical role for n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in neural and retinal tissue functions in mammals. Similarly, in larval fish there is a high demand of DHA to form nervous membranes. Bell and Dick (1993) found photoreceptors in the <b>eye,</b> <b>rods</b> and cones accumulate and selectively retain DHA in external segments. Bell et al. (1995) found that feeding juvenile herring a DHA poor Artemia diet during the period of rod development resulted in impaired vision at low light intensities, when rod vision is essential...|$|R
