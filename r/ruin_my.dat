500|$|As Morrison began live {{performances}} of the 40-year-old album Astral Weeks in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as [...] "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive". Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: [...] "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth – softer on the diction – but none the less impressively powerful." [...] Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: [...] "The approach now is to sing from lower down [...] so I do not <b>ruin</b> <b>my</b> voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to <b>ruin</b> <b>my</b> life and you think that it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on." [...] While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] numerous times in two songs from the album, Madonna explained: ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did <b>ruin</b> <b>my</b> career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E

In a fortnight the rebels gained control {{over most of the}} island, and within six weeks it was all under rebel control, except for Messina which was well fortified, and whose leading family, the Riso, remained faithful to Charles. But on 28 April it too broke into open revolt and, most significantly, the islanders' first act was to set fire to Charles's fleet in the harbor.
