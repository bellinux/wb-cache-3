In the first part of the study we have analyzed the rules of jurisdiction by establishing the jurisdiction of the court hearing with an application for parental responsibility, whether there are pending divorce proceeding or not. In the second part of the study, we have limited the analysis to the rules applicable to the law causes that have as object parental authority...|$|E
40|$|As stated, {{maintaining}} and developing {{an area of}} freedom, security and justice by the European Union, within which it is ensured the free movement of persons, requires the adoption of, among others, the measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters which have cross-border implications. These measures are designed to promote the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction. Based on the mobility of persons within the European Union, from the desire to protect both debtors of the maintenance, most often children, and the interest to favor a proper administration of justice within the European Union, there were adopted a number of community instruments relating to maintenance, which has provisions on conflicts of jurisdiction, conflict of laws, <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforceability,</b> enforcement of judgments, judicial assistance and cooperation between central authorities. In {{the first part of}} the study we analyzed the rules of jurisdiction according to which it is established the jurisdiction of the court hearing a claim for maintenance, when maintenance obligations arise from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity. In the second part of the study, we limited the analysis to the choice of law applicable on in the case of the obligation between parents and their children...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{evolution of}} the “real and substantial connection” test for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments remains a topic of immediate interest. Since the landmark decision in Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, and more recently in Beals v. Saldanha, Canadian jurisprudence for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments {{has been dominated by}} judicial and legislative unilateralism: the establishment of a domestically imposed standard (the lex fori) striving towards national uniformity informed by private international law (or conflict of laws) principles. While the “real and substantial connection” test for jurisdiction simpliciter provides a flexible analytical framework for a Canadian domestic court in assuming or declining jurisdiction over a foreign defendant, it does not completely restrict jurisdictional challenges by a non-resident (foreign) defendant. The residual discretion afforded by the forum non conveniens doctrine, coupled with other forms of jurisdictional challenges, remains a robust procedural tool in a litigator’s arsenal, while the boundaries of the recognized defences of fraud, natural justice and public policy continue to be tested. Part One reviews the Canadian unilateralist approach to recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, canvassing the application of “real and substantial connection” test through a review of recent court decisions, including the Court of Appeal decision in Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc. on the <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforceability</b> of a non-monetary judgment. Part Two discusses bilateralism highlighted by a recent Ontario decision applying the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments (UK) Act. It will also identify current provincial reciprocal enforcement of judgments legislation involving reciprocating U. S. states and foreign nations. The Uniform Law Commission of Canada’s uniform legislation recently implemented by the Saskatchewan Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act will be highlighted. In Part Three, unilateralism through an overview of the Hague Choice of Court Convention will conclude with a recommendation for ratification and implementation by Canada...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Regulation (EU) No 650 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on jurisdiction, {{applicable}} law, <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and {{on the creation of}} a European Certificate of Succession (regulation on succession). This regulation will be applicable in the matters of successions with cross-border implications of people who will decease on 17 August 2015 or later. Regulation on succession unifies legislation in matters of succession with cross-border implications, both in terms of substantive law and procedural law. This regulation has been expected {{for a long time in}} the European Union because the succession matters were expressly excluded from the scope of other regulations. Also thanks to the free movement of persons, the unification of this area of law is becoming more necessary from day to day. The preparation of this regulation and the connected discussions lasted several years. Not only for the numerous differences between the national rules of the Member States but also for the intention to create a complete unification of the substantive law, the succession proceedings itself <b>and</b> of the <b>recognition,</b> <b>enforceability</b> <b>and</b> enforcement of decisions.

40|$|This is a {{first of}} four {{in a series of}} blog posts on Kluwer Mediation Blog. They were {{published}} in conjunction with the the 65 th session of the UNCITRAL Working Group II on arbitration and conciliation. The Working Group has turned its attention to the settlement of commercial disputes and in particular on the preparation of an instrument on the enforcement of international commercial settlement agreements resulting from conciliation. (Note that in UNCITRAL speak, the term ‘conciliation’ is used interchangeably with ‘mediation’.) In terms of the type of instrument, the Working Group is considering the possibility of a convention, model provisions or guidance text. Draft provisions have been prepared without prejudice to the form of the final instrument but {{on the assumption that the}} instrument would be a stand-alone legislative text. More than a decade ago, the Working Group in drafting the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation (2002) was not able to agree on a uniform way forward for the enforcement of iMSAs. This has been one of the main criticisms of the Model Law. So it is perhaps not surprising that the issue remains controversial. These four posts are written jointly with Nadja Alexander and Anna Howard to highlight the core concerns about the move towards a multilateral convention and the responses or counterarguments to those concerns. We focus on the legal form of a convention rather than a model law or guidance text as this focus allows us to be more specific in our comments. We have placed what seem to be the main concerns about the drive towards a convention into four categories, namely concerns relating to: 1. the legitimacy of such a convention; 2. the impact of such a convention on the objectives of, and values underpinning, the mediation process; 3. the justifications for such a convention; 4. the application of an arbitration enforcement framework to iMSAs particularly in light of recent trends in arbitration. This first post focuses on the legitimacy of a proposed multilateral convention on the <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforceability</b> of international mediated settlement agreements...|$|E

40|$|Non-point source {{pollution}} from {{agricultural land use}} is a complex issue {{for the management of}} freshwater worldwide. This paper presents a case study from New Zealand to examine how predictive modelling and land use rules are being used to regulate diffuse pollution to manage water quality. Drawing on a science studies conceptual framework, the research evaluates the deployment of a numeric regime to enforce compliance with resource limits. It shows that in contrast to claims that a quantitative modelled 'outputs-based' approach would provide certainty and clarity and remove ambiguity in the implementation of resource limits at the farm scale, the opposite is unfolding. It is argued from the case study that in the development of land use policy greater <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> understanding is needed of the social and political dimensions of numbers and predictive models. This research highlights epistemological, institutional and practical challenges for the workability <b>and</b> <b>enforceability</b> of policy regimes seeking to regulate diffuse pollution that tightly link numbers derived from predictive models to compliance and enforcement mechanisms...|$|R

The Author identifies the standards the Connecticut Superior Court applied in Bedrick when determining if postnuptial agreements are enforceable. These standards are stricter than those required for prenuptial agreements and must contemplate potential future events. Additionally, the Author asserts that after execution, the agreement should be revised periodically and be reaffirmed, thus minimizing challenges to the terms of the agreement at the time of dissolution. The Author identifies three shortcomings in Bedrick relating to standards not defined: whether the promise to forego divorce and remain married serves as adequate consideration for the agreement; what the unconscionability test actually requires; and whether the proponent of, or the challenger to, the agreement carries the burden of proof...|$|R
