40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviews the}} {{institutional}} reforms {{taken place in}} minor irrigation systems in Sri Lanka by contrasting those observed during pre-colonial and colonial periods with those after the independence. Formal or informal institutions have governed the operation and performance of the minor irrigation systems with continuous change of authority. While the earlier reforms focused on the irrigation sector with quicker benefits and lower political risks, recent reforms have covered macro institutions, where the benefits are gradual with high political risks. In ancient irrigation system management, decision making and implementation were taken by communities themselves under the feudal system of “Rajakariya” ensuring sustainability and maintaining village ecosystem. With the abolishing of “Rajakariya” system after the arrival of British rulers, the authority was shifted from the community to the government along with the trend of irrigation system management towards centralization and bureaucracy. After independence, though the minor irrigation system management was the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> farmers, {{the authority of the}} systems was continuously changed between different government agencies. Now, minor irrigation systems are governed by the Department of Agrarian Development and/ or Provincial councils towards sustainability goals while emphasizing the different stakeholder involvement through enforcement of formal and informal rules and procedures. The government continues the commitment to reform because it provides evidence for the political and economic stability, tactical benefits, timely consideration of stakeholders’ perception and information towards the required change...|$|R

Lung cancer-attributable costs were estimated by subtracting each patient's own prediagnosis costs. Costs were estimated as the sum of Medicare reimbursements (payments from Medicare to the service provider), co-insurance reimbursements, and patient-liability costs (deductibles and “co-payments” that are the patient's responsibility). Costs and patient-liability costs were fit with regression models to compare trends by calendar year, adjusting for age at diagnosis. ResultsThe monthly treatment costs for a 72 -year-old patient, diagnosed with lung cancer in 2000, in the first 6 months ranged from $ 2687 (no active treatment) to $ 9360 (chemo-radiotherapy); costs varied by stage at diagnosis and histologic type. Patient liability represented up to 21. 6 % of care costs and increased over the period 1992 – 2003 for most stage and treatment categories, even when care costs decreased or remained unchanged. The greatest monthly patient liability was incurred by chemo-radiotherapy patients, which ranged from $ 1617 to $ 2004 per month across cancer stages. ConclusionsCosts for lung cancer care are substantial, and Medicare is paying a smaller proportion of the total cost over time...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} participation and project sustainability. By using the Participatory Integrated Development in the Rain-fed Areas (PIDRA), an integrated rural development project, in three districts of East Java, Indonesia, as a case study, it addresses the question {{about what kind of}} participation will lead the intended beneficiaries to continue to use and benefit from the services that remain beyond the project period. The research found that the project mostly targeted the poor, marginalised, and vulnerable people, and widows as household heads. However, some high school graduates and wealthy villagers were also included as target beneficiaries. Most participants were actively involved and participated in the project implementation activities, but rarely participated in project planning and design as well as monitoring and evaluation. The results also show that factors influencing participation <b>of</b> the intended <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> the PIDRA Project in the target areas were: the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiaries</b> to the groups as members and as leaders part of the management team; the level of education, knowledge, and skills of participants; incentives provided to access credits; the availability and use of sanctions; the geographical situation; poverty; age; support from the government; and the role of facilitators. Analysis of the case study shows that the PIDRA Project in East Java will likely have some sustainable activities and benefits in the short term. Furthermore, participation is likely lead to the project sustainability of some project elements when participation is not only used as a means but also as an end. However, the results also suggest the increasing cooperation and collaboration of government and the NGOs, and defining participant groups based on similar educational background and socio-economic situation will enhance participation and project sustainability. This study would also raise the attention of development practitioners of the dangers of the participatory approach in their practice because it could be manipulative, harm people who are supposed to be advantaged, and hence create “new tyranny” in development interventions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Long-Term Care Insurance Program (LTCIP) in Israel is {{a social}} {{security}} program administered by the National Insurance Institute (NII) since 1988. LTCIP focuses on home-based personal care services. Differently from most other programs under the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the NII, LTCIP benefits are in-kind benefits and are delivered via multiple for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. In recent years LTCIP has {{been the target of}} various legal amendments and numerous administrative changes. While many of these changes may have had significant effects on individuals, they have not altered the fundamental principles of the program. Thus, many of the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> have remained quite stable over the years; other characteristics of the population <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> have changed over the years reflecting the aging of Israeli society. A central issue related to LTCIP is whether benefits are adequate {{to meet the needs of}} the growing elderly population of Israel. While the generosity of LTCIP benefits is questionable, economic and political struggles have limited the scope of changes introduced thus far. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) is a {{community-based}} {{health service}} package delivered {{on a fixed}} day approach. Services like early registration of pregnancy, regular antenatal care and postnatal care, growth monitoring and referral of sick children, discussion of health topics to generate awareness, and convergence between health and ICDS, are delivered every month at VHND at the Anganwadi Center. This study explores the awareness, perception and practice of service providers, and beneficiaries, regarding VHND. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study conducted in Odisha during December 2009 -November 2010. Personal interviews were conducted at the VHND sessions with 111 beneficiaries and 45 service providers using a semi-structured schedule to know their awareness, perception and practice regarding VHND sessions. Data analysis was done and reported as simple percentages. Results: Most of the health worker females and anganwadi workers considered health awareness as {{a key component of}} VHND. 52 % of HWFs and 41 % of AWWs had misconception about additional roles and <b>responsibilities.</b> 34 % <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> had knowledge regarding fixed day approach of VHND, while 24 % did not have knowledge regarding any of its purpose. Only 8 % of referral cases had complete knowledge on the reason of referral. There was significant difference in between awareness and practice among the blocks. Conclusion: Service providers′ orientation should be improved. Behavior change communication activities should also be increased by the state. Referral cases should be properly counseled. The community believed that such a program should continue with better package and quality of services...|$|R

40|$|Lack of {{appropriate}} level <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement during the project lifecycle {{may lead to}} mismatch between the project output and needs <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Therefore, involving beneficiaries in the project helps {{to assure that the}} Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) provide the right solution to needs <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> as well as sustaining project results. Although beneficiary involvement is useful, the challenge is to determine how and when to involve beneficiaries in the project.    The {{purpose of this study is}} to improve the process <b>of</b> managing <b>beneficiary</b> involvement in NGOs. To achieve this, a review of the existing literature was done to have an initial understanding <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement. During our literature review, we identified six progressive levels of involvement which include: information sharing, listening and learning, joint assessment, shared decision-making, collaboration and empowerment.  Based on this literature review, we suggested a framework for managing beneficiary involvement.   In addition, we conducted a multiple case study and collected data from five different cases through interviews. Our respondents were professionals with several years of experience in developing and implementing development projects which are aimed at improving the livelihood of vulnerable communities. Through the analysis of the empirical findings, we got new insights on how the process <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement is managed. We identified four additional levels <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement within the project cycle. These include incentive system, peer facilitators, group forming, and cost sharing. The study also reveals the factors that affect beneficiary involvement, such as cultural context and, donors’ influence and requirements. We also highlighted that the appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> involvement should be chosen depending on the project context. Regardless of these factors, the research findings show that beneficiary involvement creates a sense of ownership, enhances project outcome and is useful in sustaining a project’s results in the long term. Therefore, NGOs should endeavour to involve beneficiaries as much as possible to ensure that the projects being implemented are addressing community needs...|$|R

Technical and educational reference publications are supplied {{in accordance with}} the needs expressed by the users. The programme is intended to improve the performance of the documentation centres in particular and, more generally, the institution itself. In practice, each benefiting centre chooses for itself the books which it judges will be of greatest value to its users. Between 1991 and 1994, 71 national centres of agricultural documentation and information were {{able to take advantage of}} the service and increase their stock of publications. (See also Spore 40, p 9) Following an evaluation of the DORA programme and a meeting of representatives from the benefiting centres, DORA has, since 1995, focused on agricultural educational institutions and now targets students, teachers, scientists and senior technicians in the agricultural sector. In the francophone ACP countries, 22 institutions have benefited from the service during 1995 - 96 (see box) and 44 centres in anglophone ACP countries will benefit from the programme between 1996 and 1998. Each site receives on average 300 reference books. Single copies will be provided of 70 % of the titles requested and up to a maximum of four copies each can be provided for the remaining 30 %. Postage, customs duty or transit costs are the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiary.</b> The books can be of any type provided that they relate to agriculture, the only exclusions being encyclopaedias and subscriptions to, or photocopied extracts of, periodicals. Documentation officers in charge of the DORA sites receive a short training course and/or self-teaching materials and they have the opportunity to participate in meetings at which they can share their experiences with others in the programme. They also receive a number of supporting documents, in particular a handbook, details of how to make requests, a questionnaire for evaluating the service and promotional material (posters and brochures) for bringing the DORA service to the attention of users.
