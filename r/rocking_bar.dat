Before the First World War it was fitted with oscillating (reciprocating) sights, using the older No 5 sighting telescope (x12 magnification) on either Sight Oscillating BL 60 pr Mk I or II, {{which included a}} sight clinometer and range scale {{as well as a}} deflection drum for the telescope. This was replaced by the No 3 carrier for the No 7 dial sight.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{fitted with}} <b>rocking</b> <b>bar</b> open sights {{including}} a deflection scale and a strip elevation, by 1914 the number seven dial sight in carrier number seven dial sight number {{one had been}} introduced. [...] This carrier was reciprocating (i.e. it could be cross-levelled), it had an integral elevation scale drum and a mounting for the sight clinometer (used for the angle of sight). [...] The number seven dial sight was {{a modified version of}} the German Goertz panoramic sight. The only changes to the ordnance, creating the Mark II in 1917, had a reduced twist in the rifling (from 1:15 to 1:20) and changes to correct design defects in the breech to reduce the effect of firing stresses.|$|E
50|$|However, in 1906, {{indirect}} fire goniometric sights were adopted; these consisted of an alidade {{mounted on a}} circular scale graduated in degrees that was mounted on the shield. In 1910, the Number 3 Dial Sight, a refined version with a telescope and compass, replaced the goniometer. The <b>rocking</b> <b>bar</b> and telescope were retained for direct fire, as was the range scale on the right {{in spite of a}} clinometer being part of the Dial Sight mount.|$|E

5000|$|The Equipment Committee's {{conditions}} required tangent sights (i.e. direct fire) with {{the option of}} a telescope. However, the 18-pounder entered service with <b>rocking</b> <b>bar</b> (also called [...] "bar and drum") sights - open sights with the option of a telescope {{on the left and}} a range scale (in yards) on the right of the cradle. These arrangements also incorporated independent line of sight, meaning that the sights could remain laid on the target while the barrel was elevated or depressed. A clinometer was provided for indirect fire when the sight was aimed using a gun-arc (a refined version of the expedient devices used in South Africa) and aiming posts in line horizontally with the target.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A linkage with dynamic-state {{balance and}} small {{fluctuation}} load features on its crankshaft would both enhance a motor’s efficiency and load rate and reduce its input power {{by ensuring that}} the motor is driving as uniform load as possible. It could then be widely applicable to the saving of energy in oil pumping equipment. This paper presents {{a new model of}} oscillating block six-bar linkages in which the net crankshaft torque is reduced to a small fluctuation in load by adding the counterweights to the crank and <b>rocking</b> <b>bar.</b> The kinematics and kinetics models of this linkage under the counterbalance were therefore established. Factors influencing the net crankshaft torque fluctuations were analyzed. All parameters of design scheme were optimized using the MATLAB optimization toolbox. Analyses contrasting the effects of energy saving were performed under the actual load conditions...|$|E
