The numerical calculations data of the turbulent combustion in reversing and flow furnaces for gas fuel are presented in the paper. Gas mixture temperature minimum values in volume and nitrogen oxides concentration correspond to the <b>reversing</b> <b>furnace...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Various other symbols to {{identify}} specific coins {{were also used}} such as the Thousand Character Classic, [...] "furnace" [...] and [...] "series" [...] numbers, as the Five Elements, astronomical symbols, the Eight Trigrams, the Ten Celestial Stems, the Twelve Terrestrial Branches, {{as well as a}} variety of characters with an unknown purpose. Mint marks were placed above the square hole on the <b>reverse</b> site, while <b>furnace</b> markings and other Chinese characters were placed below, special symbols such as dots, circles, crescents, horizontal lines, and vertical lines generally appeared either left or right of the square hole.|$|R
50|$|Steel is an alloy {{composed}} of between 0.2% and 2.0% carbon, {{and the balance}} of iron. From prehistory {{through the creation of}} the blast furnace, iron was produced from iron ore as wrought iron, 100% Fe, and the process of making steel involved adding carbon to the iron, usually via serendipity in the forge or via the cementation process. The introduction of the blast <b>furnace</b> <b>reversed</b> the problem. A blast furnace produces pig iron, which is an alloy of approximately 90% iron and 10% carbon. If the process of steelmaking begins with pig iron instead of wrought iron, the challenge is to remove a sufficient amount of carbon to get it to the 0.2 to 2 percent for steel.|$|R
