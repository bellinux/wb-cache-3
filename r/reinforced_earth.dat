40|$|Physicochemical {{characteristics}} of Hibiscus cannabinus (kenaf) fibers from Burkina Faso were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy, {{thermal gravimetric analysis}} (TGA), chemical analysis and video microscopy. Kenaf fibers (3 cm long) were used to <b>reinforce</b> <b>earth</b> blocks, and the mechanical properties of reinforced blocks, with fiber contents ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 8 wt%, were investigated. The fibers were mainly composed of cellulose type I (70. 4 wt%), hemicelluloses (18. 9 wt%) and lignin (3 wt%) and were characterized by high tensile strength (1 ± 0. 25 GPa) and Young’s modulus (136 ± 25 GPa), linked to their high cellulose content. The incorporation of short fibers of kenaf reduced the propagation of cracks in the blocks, through the good adherence of fibers to the clay matrix, and therefore improved their mechanical properties. Fiber incorporation was particularly beneficial for the bending strength of earth blocks because it reinforces these blocks after the failure of soil matrix observed for unreinforced blocks. Blocks reinforced with such fibers had a ductile tensile behavior that made them better building materials for masonry structures than unreinforced blocks...|$|R

40|$|The chapter explores {{how in the}} Cold War period large {{terrestrial}} and extraterrestrial regions {{came into}} focus as sites of strategic importance, areas of expansion or valuable resources: the deep sea, the polar regions and outer space. While the modern world since the 19 th century had been subjected to extensive processes of imperial expansion and territorialization, these regions had escaped sovereign rule; they entered international debate when technology made national claims viable. The chapter studies political ambitions to set up new political and legal regimes of access. It discusses the contested concept of global commons and its legal equivalent, the Common Heritage of Mankind principle, and argues that seemingly opposing concepts of territorialization and communalization were closely related. The commons-regimes of the 1970 s, so the suggestion, need to be reinterpreted as a double-edged sword, which failed to introduce a feasible common-based regime and did not overcome but <b>reinforced</b> the <b>earth's</b> spatial organization in terms of territory and sovereignty.

Typical structures subjected to lateral loads include bridge abutments, transmission tower, sand offshore platforms. Traffic, wind, wave, and seismic forces are common types of lateral loads subjected to pile foundations. The present work is focused on understanding the lateral load capacity of vertical piles located near crest of the slope and subjected to the lateral and inclined loads. The experimental investigation was carried out to study the effect of <b>reinforcing</b> an <b>earth</b> slope on the inclined loading behavior of a single vertical pile located near the slope. Layers of geogrid were used to reinforce a sandy slope of 1 V: 2 H. The parametric studies were performed by varying the length of pile(L), angle of inclination of load (θ), number of geogrid reinforcement (Nr) and crest distance. It was observed that the lateral load capacity of pile depends upon these parameters. The lateral load capacity of pile increases with increase in inclination of load, length of pile(L), number of geogrid reinforcement (Nr) and crest distance...|$|R
40|$|Object of {{this thesis}} has been {{centrifuge}} modelling of <b>earth</b> <b>reinforced</b> retaining walls with modular blocks facing {{in order to}} investigate {{on the influence of}} design parameters, such as length and vertical spacing of reinforcement, on the behaviour of the structure. In order to demonstrate, 11 models were tested, each one with different length of reinforcement or spacing. Each model was constructed and then placed in the centrifuge in order to artificially raise gravitational acceleration up to 35 g, reproducing the soil behaviour of a 5 metre high wall. Vertical and horizontal displacements were recorded by means of a special device which enabled tracking of deformations in the structure along its longitudinal cross section, essentially drawing its deformed shape. As expected, results confirmed reinforcement parameters to be the governing factor in the behaviour of <b>earth</b> <b>reinforced</b> structures since increase in length and spacing improved structural stability. However, the influence of the length was found out to be the leading parameter, reducing facial deformations up to five times, and the spacing playing an important role especially in unstable configurations. When failure occurred, failure surface was characterised by the same shape (circular) and depth, regardless of the reinforcement configuration. Furthermore, results confirmed the over-conservatism of codes, since models with reinforcement layers 0. 4 H long showed almost negligible deformations. Although the experiments performed were consistent and yielded replicable results, further numerical modelling may allow investigation on other issues, such as the influence of the reinforcement stiffness, facing stiffness and varying backfills. ...|$|R
50|$|Using straw, sticks, and {{branches}} to reinforce adobe bricks and mud dwellings {{has happened since}} the earliest part of human history, and in the 1970s French engineer Sir Henri Vidal invented the modern form of MSE, he termed Terre Armee (<b>reinforced</b> <b>earth).</b> In his submission for his patents he covered every possible reinforcement and facing type.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{concept of}} placing high {{strength}} linear reinforcements in a soil backfill {{to produce a}} vertical retaining structure is a recent idea that has been applied with success {{at a number of}} locations. Rational procedures have been developed for the design of these structures when the reinforcements consist of long metal straps. In certain situations advantages in construction and economy could be gained by replacing the metal straps with a continuous high strength fabric as reinforcement. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the behavior of a number of fabric <b>reinforced</b> <b>earth</b> models and to determine if the design methods that have been applied to metal strap <b>reinforced</b> <b>earth</b> walls can be applied to fabric reinforced walls. The economic feasibility of fabric <b>reinforced</b> <b>earth</b> walls was also investigated.

5000|$|The {{compressive}} strength of rammed earth is {{a maximum of}} [...] This is {{less than that of}} concrete but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices. Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate. Rammed <b>earth</b> <b>reinforced</b> with rebar, wood, or bamboo can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms, because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See 1960 Agadir earthquake for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices. The United States Department of Agriculture observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.|$|R
50|$|The Harbor Defenses of the Delaware were {{previously}} Forts Delaware, DuPont, and Mott, all near Delaware City. They were sited well {{north in the}} Delaware estuary due to the short range of their guns. The long-range guns of Fort Saulsbury allowed an enemy to be engaged much further south. Fort Saulsbury consisted of Batteries Hall and Haslet, each with two 12-inch guns and a large ammunition and fire control bunker constructed of <b>reinforced</b> concrete and <b>earth.</b> Battery Hall was named for David Hall, a Revolutionary War officer and former Governor of Delaware. Battery Haslet was named for John Haslet, also a Revolutionary War officer, killed at the Battle of Princeton. Like the initial construction of similar batteries, the guns were in the open {{and would have been}} vulnerable to air attack. Apparently the fort's position back from the coast was thought to be sufficient concealment against attack from the sea. Unusually, Fort Saulsbury had no smaller guns sited near it, probably since it had no minefield requiring rapid-fire guns to defend against minesweepers. Both batteries were completed in 1920 but apparently not accepted for service until 1924, as most references give that date for their entry into service.|$|R
