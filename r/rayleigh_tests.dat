Lett. 245 (2006) 605 – 615.) {{pointed out}} that, for 9 reversals {{over the last}} 3 Myr, reversal age has a non-random relationship to the phase of orbital obliquity. Our analysis, based on <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>tests,</b> indicates that reversals have no preferred phase distribution in the obliquity cycle at the 5 % significance level over the last 3 Myr. There is, however, a statistically significant relationship (at the 5 % level) between reversal age and the phase of orbital eccentricity for the last 3 Myr, although this relationship breaks down on adding just a few reversals beyond 3 Ma. Over the last 5 Myr, reversals preferentially occurred during decrease of the maximum obliquity envelope although, yet again, the relationship does not hold as additional reversals {{are added to the}} analysis, no matter which timescale is tested. The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>tests</b> are all based on the assumption of no uncertainty in reversal/excursion age, or in orbital solutions. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that reversal/excursion ages would have to be known within 5 – 10 kyr to resolve a preferred phase in obliquity similar to that advocated by Fuller (Fuller, M., Geomagnetic field intensity, excursions, reversals and the 41, 000 -yr obliquity signal, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 245 (2006) 605 – 615.) over the last 3 Myr. Reversal/excursion ages would have to be known within ~ 15 kyr to resolve a preferred phase in orbital eccentricity for reversals over the last 3 Myr, and within ~ 40 kyr for the last 25 Myr. Comparison of astrochronological reversal timescales indicates that reversal age uncertainties exceed these limits, making it unlikely that a relationship of reversal/excursion age to the phase of obliquity or eccentricity would be resolvable. In the case of the obliquity envelope, the critical levels of reversal age uncertainty (~ 50 kyr for 0 – 3 Ma, ~ 200 kyr for 0 – 5 Ma, and ~ 400 kyr for 0 – 25 Ma) are less stringent. The presence of a significant relationship between reversal age and phase of the obliquity envelope for the last 5 Myr, but not further back in time, implies either larger than expected reversal age uncertainties in pre-Pliocene polarity timescales and a link between reversal age and the obliquity envelope, or, more probably, the fortuitous occurrence of a low probability relationship over the last 5 Ma that has no mechanistic implication...|$|E

E. S. S., in 2004. Along with MSH 15 - 52, H. E. S. S. discovered very high energy (VHE) γ-ray emission from 14 extended pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in a Galactic plane survey. Furthermore, H. E. S. S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) found no pulsed VHE γ-ray emission from 13 young pulsars at their radio periods. The supernova remnant (SNR), MSH 15 - 52,consisting of a PWN which is powered by a ~ 150 millisecond relatively young and energetic pulsar, B 1509 - 58, was observed with H. E. S. S. during 23 nights. The likelihood of the pulsar periodicity being propagated into the PWN emission was investigated, by searching for periodicity of VHE γ-ray emission at and near the radio period from the entire composite supernova remnant. An exhaustive approach, using Fourier analysis techniques were employed for searching for a pulsed signal. This was done via the well-known universally most powerful (UMP) <b>test,</b> the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test,</b> and the H-test. No coherent sinusoidal pulsed emission, with > 1 % signal strength, could be seen using the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test,</b> between 151. 282 and 151. 301 ms, in observations with a 120 minute average duration. The Eadie combination method of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test</b> results, also showed no evidence of strong flares or non-coherent pulsed emission between 151. 277 and 151. 301 ms, during a night observation. No coherent pulsed signal with signal strength of > 0. 3 %, between 151. 288661 and 151. 288675 ms, was detected with the application of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test</b> on the 3. 9 month bulk data. Moreover, the H-test proved that there was no presence of any non-sinusoidal pulsed emission, again between 151. 282 and 151. 301 ms, during a night observation. Therefore, no pulsed VHE γ-ray emission was detected from the supernova remnant MSH 15 - 52 at and near the pulsar radio period. Master...|$|R
40|$|Overfishing {{has become}} an {{increasing}} threat to large pelagic fish in all oceans. Immediate actions to reverse this trend, such as decreased fishing effort and high-seas protected areas, are necessary to halt further declines. In order to implement effective conservation measures {{there must be a}} greater understanding of how pelagic fish relate to features in their environment. Certain features, such as upwellings, are known to attract these predators however; they are often difficult to predict and manage. Despite this difficulty, there are areas, such as the Eastern Pacific Ocean off Central America, that provide predictable seasonal upwellings that attract large pelagic fish. An upwelling in this region, known as the Costa Rica Dome, follows an annual progression characterized by well formed coastal currents during the summer followed by strong upwelling and mesoscale eddy formation in the winter. Many pelagic predators are known to associate with this upwelling, including the Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). In this study, nine sailfish were equipped with pop-up archival transmitters between June 2008 and June 2009. The fish were captured from sportfishing vessels off northwestern Costa Rica. The transmitters were programmed to transmit in real-time when the fish surfaced allowing for accurate location data as well as depth and temperature data downloads. Location data were overlaid on satellite composite imagery of geostrophic velocity and direction, sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentrations and bathymetry. V-variant <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>tests</b> were used to compare mean sailfish movement vectors and current vectors to determine correspondence. Corresponding vectors were then ranked according to the increasing value of environmental variables (current magnitude, SST, and chlorophyll) {{to examine the relationship between}} current correspondence and environmental changes. Dive data were used to examine depth and temperature preferences as well as habitat extremes. From this data, both high-use and maximum habitat usage were calculated based on the depth of the water column. Seven of the nine tags provided a total of 205 monitoring days with a mean displacement of 581 km from point of capture and a tendency toward northward movement. The amount of similarity between fish movement and current varied by individual however; five fish were shown to associate with local currents at varying temporal scales. Association to currents with respect to environmental variables showed three distinct relationships: near-logistic fit; variable fit; and no association. Variable fit was the most consistent relationship observed primarily during non-upwelling conditions while a near-logistic relationship was only observed during upwelling conditions. Dive data were consistent across all tags showing that sailfish utilize a small percentage of the water column (1...|$|E

We show that rotationally symmetric alternatives lead to two Local Asymptotic Normality (LAN) structures.

Methods 					Long-term IOP data from the Erlangen Glaucoma Registry, consisting of several annual extended diurnal IOP profiles for each patient, was retrospectively analyzed.

Aims: We search for VHE γ-ray emission from AE Aqr during different states of the source at several wavelengths to confirm or rule out previous claims of detection of γ-ray emission from this object. Methods: We report on observations of AE Aqr performed by MAGIC. The source was observed during 12 h {{as part of a}} multiwavelength campaign carried out between May and June 2012 covering the optical, X-ray, and γ-ray ranges. Besides MAGIC, the other facilities involved were the KVA, Skinakas, and Vidojevica telescopes in the optical and Swift in X-rays. We calculated integral upper limits coincident with different states of the source in the optical. We computed upper limits to the pulsed emission limiting the signal region to 30 % of the phaseogram and we also searched for pulsed emission at different frequencies applying the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test.</b> Results: AE Aqr was not detected at VHEs during the multiwavelength campaign. We establish integral upper limits at the 95 % confidence level for the steady emission assuming the differential flux proportional to a power-law function dφ/ dE ∝ E- Γ, with a Crab-like photon spectral index of Γ = 2. 6. The upper limit above 200 GeV is 6. 4 × 10 - 12 cm- 2 s- 1 and above 1 TeV is 7. 4 × 10 - 13 cm- 2 s- 1.

Preliminary surface Laplacian transformation of EEG data (31 channels) reduced head volume conductor effects. EEG phase values were computed by FFT analysis and the statistical evaluation of these values was performed by <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 05). About 50 % of the EEG single trials presented statistically the same FFT phase value of the evoked EEG oscillations (phase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant phase-locked compared to nonphase-locked component. The remaining single trials showed random FFT phase values (nonphase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant nonphase-locked compared to phase-locked component. Compared to nonpainful stimulation, painful stimulation increased phase-locked theta to gamma band responses in the contralateral hemisphere and decreased the phase-locked beta band response in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, nonphase-locked alpha band response decreased in the ipsilateral Pronto-central area. In conclusion, both decreased and increased EEG oscillatory responses to galvanic painful stimulation would occur in parallel in different cortical regions and in the phase- and nonphase-locked EEG data sets.

This research provides as basic data for on-line defect estimation using a laser ultrasonic or EMAT in non-contact ultrasonic detecting techniques in future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a {{non-invasive}} neurophysiological technique {{with high}} temporal resolution. Nevertheless, low {{signal to noise}} ratio may hamper its fullest capability. Many confidence tests already exist to detect strong responses for signals corrupted by noise, and we have explored their use with experimentally obtained MEG signals. We find that the tests demonstrating the most power are the F-test and <b>Rayleigh’s</b> phase coherence <b>test.</b> Due to the strongly non-Gaussian nature of the MEG noise, from both neural and external perspective, a signal which is purely noise often fails the marginal tests by exceeding the number of false positive allowed. A variation of the tests is suggested that ensures the average false positive for a large number of responses, excited at frequencies different than the frequency of interest, is below any desired threshold. This is implemented for the F-test, <b>Rayleigh’s</b> phase coherence <b>test,</b> and the union of the two. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{detection}} of pulsed X-ray emission from the young, energetic radio and gamma-ray pulsar PSR B 1706 - 44. In a 47 ks observation with the High Resolution Camera on-board the Chandra X-ray Observatory {{we find a}} pulsed signal at a frequency consistent with the radio ephemeris, f = 9. 7588081 +/- 0. 0000027 Hz (at epoch 51585. 34104 MJD). The broad, single-peaked pulse profile has a pulsed fraction of 23 % +/- 6 %; this is not in conflict with a Rosat PSPC upper limit of < 18 % because this instrument could not resolve the pulsar from a surrounding synchrotron nebula. The probability that this pulsed detection is a chance occurrence is 1. 8 X 10 E- 4 as judged by the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test.</b> We also fitted Chandra spectroscopic data on PSR B 1706 - 44, which require at least two components, e. g., a blackbody of T(infinity) = 1. 66 X 10 E 6 K and a power-law of Gamma = 2. 0 +/- 0. 5. The blackbody radius at the nominal 2. 5 kpc distance is only R(infinity) = 3. 6 +/- 0. 9 km, indicating either a hot region on a cooler surface, or {{the need for a}} realistic atmosphere model that would allow a lower temperature and larger area. Because the power-law and blackbody spectra each contribute more than 23 % of the observed flux, {{it is not possible to}} decide which component is responsible for the modulation in the spectrally unresolved light curve...|$|R
40|$|Males were {{consistently}} {{found to be}} more likely than females to report left-hand preference in single-hand tasks, but the literature reports negative results too. Using data from a large sample in Sardinia, we aimed at testing the links of left-handedness with sex, age, residence, and seasonality of birth. A total of 4239 participants (males = 1589; females = 2650) were recruited in public places such as high schools, university classes, or gyms in one of the major islands of Italy. Hand preference was established with the question: Which hand do you normally use to write legibly? The monthly distribution of births was studied with the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test.</b> In the sample, 270 female participants reported left-hand preference in writing (10. 2 %) versus 161 male participants (10. 1 %). Left-hand preference in writing was negatively related to age, with increasing left-hand preference in the younger generations. Left-hand preference in writing was not more common in urban than in suburban or rural settings. The month of birth was found to have a seasonal effect on the left-handed (p=. 031) but not on the right-handed (p=. 80) participants, and this seasonal effect was more evident in males (p=. 04) than in females (p =. 26). In our sample males were not more likely to report left-hand preference in writing than females. On the other hand, left-hand preference does vary by age and, in all likelihood, this is an effect of the reduced cultural pressure to write with the right hand in the younger generations...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} Time-Tagged Event (TTE) data from {{observations}} of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE). These data {{provide the best}} available time resolution for GRBs and SGRs. We have performed an extensive search for weak periodic signals in the frequency range 400 Hz to 2500 Hz using the burst records for 2203 GRBs and 152 SGR flares. The study employs the Rayleigh power as a test statistic to evaluate the evidence for periodic emissions. We find no evidence of periodic emissions from these events at these frequencies. In all but a very few cases the maximum power values obtained are consistent with what would be expected by chance from a non-periodic signal. In those few instances where there is marginal evidence for periodicity {{there are problems with}} the data that cast doubt on the reality of the signal. For classical GRBs, the largest Rayleigh power occurs in bursts whose TTE data appear to be corrupted. For SGRs, our largest Rayleigh power, with a significance of 1 %, occurs in one record for SGR 1900 + 14 (at 2497 Hz), and in no other outbursts associated with this source; we thus consider it unlikely to represent detection of a real periodicity. From simulations, we deduce that the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test</b> would have detected significant oscillations with relative amplitude ~ 10 % about half the time. Thus, we conclude that high frequency oscillations, if present, must have small relative amplitudes. Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the larvae of coral-reef fishes reveal that these tiny {{vertebrates}} possess remarkable swimming capabilities, {{as well as the}} ability to orient to olfactory, auditory, and visual cues. While navigation according to reef-generated chemicals and sounds can significantly affect dispersal, the effect is limited to the vicinity of the reef. Effective long-distance navigation requires at least one other capacity–the ability to maintain a bearing using, for example, a sun compass. Directional information in the sun’s position can take the form of polarized-light related cues (i. e., e-vector orientation and percent polarization) and/or non-polarized-light related cues (i. e., the direct image of the sun, and the brightness and spectral gradients). We examined the response to both types of cues using commercially-reared post-larvae of the spine-cheeked anemonefish Premnas biaculeatus. Initial optomotor trials indicated that the post-larval stages are sensitive to linearly polarized light. Swimming directionality was then tested using a Drifting In-Situ Chamber (DISC), which allowed us to examine the response of the post-larvae to natural variation in light conditions and to manipulated levels of light polarization. Under natural light conditions, 28 of 29 post-larvae showed significant directional swimming (<b>Rayleigh’s</b> <b>test</b> p, 0. 05, R = 0. 7460. 23), but to no particular direction. Swimming directionality was positively affected by sky clarity (absence of clouds and haze), which explained 38 % of the observed variation. Moreover, post-larvae swimming under fully polarized light exhibited a distinct behavior of tracking the polarization axis, as it rotated along with the DISC. This behavio...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{seasonality}} {{studies on}} phenology from India (Singh and Singh 1992; Murali and Sukumar 1993, 1994; Bhat 1992; Prasad and Hegde 1986) mention the seasons of leafing, flowering, and fruiting {{at the community}} level. From this study, by using <b>Rayleigh’s</b> Z <b>test,</b> various phenophases were expressed quantitatively and qualitatively in the dry forests of Bhadra wildlife sanctuary, which were shown to be significantly seasonal with a seasonal climatic factor. Despite the lack of seasonality in climate, attempts to quantify the seasonality of a phenological stage at the community level have shown significant seasonality (Morellato et al. 2000). With a strong seasonality in rainfall, the leaf phenophases also showed significant seasonality (Suresh and Sukumar 2011).|$|R
40|$|We present new {{results from}} the only 2 D multi-group, {{multi-angle}} calculations of core-collapse supernova evolution. The first set of {{results from the}}se calculations was published in Ott et al. (2008). We have followed a nonrotating and a rapidly rotating 20 solar mass model for ~ 400 ms after bounce. We show that the radiation fields vary much less with angle than the matter quantities {{in the region of}} net neutrino heating. This obtains because most neutrinos are emitted from inner radiative regions and because the specific intensity is an integral over sources from many angles at depth. The latter effect can only be captured by multi-angle transport. We then compute the phase relationship between dipolar oscillations in the shock radius and in matter and radiation quantities throughout the postshock region. We demonstrate a connection between variations in neutrino flux and the hydrodynamical shock oscillations, and use a variant of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>test</b> to estimate the detectability of these neutrino fluctuations in IceCube and Super-K. Neglecting flavor oscillations, fluctuations in our nonrotating model would be detectable to ~ 10 kpc in IceCube, and a detailed power spectrum could be measured out to ~ 5 kpc. These distances are considerably lower in our rapidly rotating model or with significant flavor oscillations. Finally, we measure the impact of rapid rotation on detectable neutrino signals. Our rapidly rotating model has strong, species-dependent asymmetries in both its peak neutrino flux and its light curves. The peak flux and decline rate show pole-equator ratios of up to ~ 3 and ~ 2, respectively. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, ApJ accepted. Replaced with accepted versio...|$|R
