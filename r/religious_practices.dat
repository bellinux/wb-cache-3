5|$|Ancient Chinese Daoism, {{ancestor}} worship, and foreign-originated Buddhism {{were the}} most prominent <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> in the Song period. Daoism developed largely from {{the teachings of the}} Daodejing, attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher Laozi ("Old Master"), considered one of the Three Pure Ones (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by Yuezhi, Persian, and Kushan missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct Chinese Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, {{particularly}} {{his relationship with}} Hierocles, increasingly provoked the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard. When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided {{that he and his}} mother, who had encouraged his <b>religious</b> <b>practices,</b> had to be replaced. As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.|$|E

50|$|Both the Constitution and Decree 92 {{assert that}} <b>religious</b> <b>practice</b> should serve {{national}} interests by promoting development {{and education and}} instructing believers to be good citizens. The Government presumed both a right and a duty to oversee <b>religious</b> <b>practice</b> at all levels to ensure <b>religious</b> <b>practice</b> fills these roles in society. In effect this has led the Government {{to intervene in the}} activities of minority religious groups, particularly Protestants, on the grounds that their practices did not promote national interests or demonstrated disloyalty to the Government.|$|R
5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized {{beliefs of}} Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han <b>religious</b> <b>practices,</b> {{though there is}} evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also be traced to the earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E
5|$|Numerous deities {{have been}} {{considered}} patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can originate in mythological stories about the deity, or from <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> and rituals. For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, {{has been linked to}} lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example two pieces of wood perceived as feminine, called the adhararani and utararani, are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.|$|E
5|$|Saivism (a sect of Hinduism) in Sri Lanka has had {{continuous}} {{history from}} the early period of settlers from India. Hindu worship was widely accepted even {{as part of the}} Buddhist <b>religious</b> <b>practices.</b> During the Chola period in Sri Lanka, around the 9th and 10th century, Hinduism gained status as an official religion in the island kingdom. Kalinga Magha, whose rule followed that of the Cholas is remembered as a Hindu revivalist by the native literature of that period.|$|E

5|$|The main {{religion}} practised on {{the island}} is Christianity (two-thirds Protestant, one-third Roman Catholic). The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The government has restricted the <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, {{most of whom are}} foreign workers employed by the government-owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru, with see at Tarawa on Kiribati.|$|E
5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} {{at a site}} adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave {{was part of a}} larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan <b>religious</b> <b>practices.</b> One burial was in a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned beneath a mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han <b>religious</b> <b>practices,</b> several sub-groups sought {{protection}} from the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from}} the oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E
5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The religious leader of Sogamoso was still the most important in these days.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its religious school. Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's <b>religious</b> <b>practices.</b> One was to have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E

5|$|Coronations {{are still}} {{observed}} in the United Kingdom, Tonga, and several Asian and African countries. In Europe, most monarchs {{are required to take}} a simple oath {{in the presence of the}} country's legislature. Besides a coronation, a monarch's accession may be marked in many ways: some nations may retain a religious dimension to their accession rituals while others have adopted simpler inauguration ceremonies, or even no ceremony at all. Some cultures use bathing or cleansing rites, the drinking of a sacred beverage, or other <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> to achieve a comparable effect. Such acts symbolise the granting of divine favour to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious paradigm of the country.|$|E
5|$|During Fineshriber's {{early years}} the {{congregation}} continued to modify its <b>religious</b> <b>practices.</b> At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E

That happened in 1850 under the leadership of Howard Stansbury (Stansbury discovered and named the Stansbury mountain range and Stansbury island). John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> based on Stansbury's interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City, which had been established three years earlier in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
5|$|Several signal {{events from}} the 4th to 6th centuries mark {{the period of}} {{transition}} during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324–337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379–395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and other <b>religious</b> <b>practices</b> were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
