30|$|In this section, we utilise the <b>Assessment</b> Design <b>Decisions</b> Framework (Bearman et al., 2014, 2016) {{to guide}} <b>assessment</b> <b>decision</b> making around {{the use of}} online tests. The {{framework}} can assist curriculum developers, learning designers and academics to systematically work through key questions in determining the type of assessment to be applied. The <b>Assessment</b> Design <b>Decisions</b> Framework breaks the decision-making process around assessment into six parts: purposes of assessment, context of assessment, learner outcomes, tasks, feedback processes, and interactions. The first three parts of the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Decisions</b> Design Framework emphasise the considerations {{that take place in}} determining the assessment type. These include clarifying the purpose of the assessment and the context in which it takes place, as well as determining how the assessment task aligns with unit and the course level outcomes. The third and fourth parts of the framework relate to aspects of the task design itself and feedback processes built into the task design. Finally, the sixth part relates to interactions between all stakeholders about the assessment that are integral to its review and continual improvement.|$|R

A principled charge <b>assessment</b> <b>decision</b> on every Report to Crown Counsel alleging a bail breach is essential {{in order to maintain the}} integrity of the criminal justice system, ensure the attendance of the accused in court and protect the public. In addition to the guidance provided by policy CHA 1, Crown Counsel should consider all relevant factors, including: • the nature of the substantive charge which gave rise to the bail order • the nature of the breach in relation to the risk posed by the accused • whether detention or more restrictive bail conditions should be sought Protecting the public is the paramount concern when breaches of bail may be a threat to public safety.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the existence of strategies for the verification and validation of <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions</b> currently being used by assessors in RTOs. Some of the research questions that are being addressed are: What factors {{contribute to the development of}} confidence in assessment decision-making? What strategies are assessors using to ensure that their judgments of competence are valid, reliable, fair and based on the collection of sufficient evidence? What strategies are registered training organisations using to support the verification and validation of <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions</b> and how cost effective are they? What quality assurance mechanisms do assessors, managers and ITABs consider essential, particularly with the implementation of training packages? The aims are to provide resources to support confident decision-making by assessors in VET. These will include guidelines and scenarios for the establishment of cost effective verification strategies for use by assessors, and strategies for RTOs to assure the quality of <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions</b> made by their assessors. The project has, therefore, a strong development element contained within it...|$|R
40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of potentially adverse effects of organic chemicals such as pesticides on the environment the atmosphere may play an important role. After its release to the atmosphere the chemical will be transported/dispersed in the atmosphere andfinally it will be removed either by atmospheric-chemical destruction or by deposition to the underlying soil or surface water. In a risk <b>assessment</b> <b>decision</b> support system both ambient concentrations and deposition fluxes must be known to evaluate the risk of direct exposure (inhalation) or the risk of soil and water contamination caused by deposition.

Cox regression modeling identified characteristics associated with reentry during this period. Findings suggest that current neglect assessment, problems with parenting skills, motivation to improve parenting, safety <b>assessment</b> <b>decision,</b> length of stay, substantiated allegations, and unsubstantiated allegations were associated with likelihood of reentry. The results suggest that child welfare systems could more effectively use assessment tools to match families with needed services...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} critical factors that impact on the confidence of assessors in making assessment judgements. The project grew from concern being voiced by assessors and registered training organisations about consistency in <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions.</b> For mutual recognition of qualifications to work successfully between registered training organisations, there needs to be widespread confidence in the consistency of <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions.</b> <b>Assessment</b> against competency standards involves collecting evidence and then forming a judgement about whether or not competency has been achieved. Several factors impact on these judgements, including the skill and experience of assessors and the clarity of the particular competency standards themselves, and these can influence the <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions</b> made. This research project identified a range of strategies for validating assessment currently being used by assessors in training providers, and identified critical areas where strategies are essential to increase assessor confidence. In addition to this report on the research process and findings, a resource kit for assessors and managers in registered training rganisations was also developed as part of the project. The resource kit includes a set of recommended strategies for registered training organisations to assist them with the quality assurance aspects of assessment. This was developed from material collected as part of the research project and based on recommendations made by practitioners consulted during the research...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in structured schemes {{for the assessment of}} risk for aggression within inpatient psychiatric settings. The most commonly utilized schemes are those previously developed to assess risk for prisoners being considered for release on parole and for forensic psychiatric patients being considered for discharge from the hospital to the community. Few structured schemes have been developed with the explicit aim of assessing risk for aggression in the inpatient setting. Recent research utilising a variety of risk assessment schemes has revealed reasonable predictive validity. This narrative review summarizes and appraises this expanding literature within the context of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>decision</b> making tasks typically undertaken by psychiatric unit staff. It is concluded that a number of structured risk assessments schemes do have acceptable predictive validity. Unfortunately, many of the schemes tested are compromised by a lack of practical utility, and only a few are capable of contributing to the entire range of risk <b>assessment</b> <b>decision</b> making tasks required. Options for the application of structured risk assessment schemes are raised...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how clinicians make sense of Muslim {{religious}} beliefs when the client may have psychotic symptoms. Limited literature suggests that psychiatrists draw on a Western empiricist epistemology and implicit cultural norms in utilising the DSM’s diagnostic criteria. Concerns have been raised that practitioners can overlook religious beliefs and pathologise religious beliefs from non-Western cultures. No research has specifically explored psychiatrists’ understanding of religious beliefs. This research aimed to explore how psychiatrists understand Islamic religious beliefs when assessing clients referred with possible psychotic symptoms. It also hoped to explore how they understand {{the impact of their}} views on subsequent <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions.</b> Interviews were conducted with five psychiatrists and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. In contrast to expectations, the participants did not view their understanding of religious beliefs as central to their <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions.</b> Service pressures and psychiatrists’ sense of accountability for clients appeared to inform the emphasis of psychiatric assessments; risk assessments and case management decisions were prioritised above all else. This appeared to limit the participants’ opportunity to engage with clients’ religious beliefs, to fully understand their presentations or to make fluid <b>assessment</b> <b>decisions</b> they felt were often appropriate. Participants also demonstrated a more intricate, nuanced understanding of religious beliefs than previous literature has suggested. In keeping with best practice guidelines participants viewed religious beliefs as a normal manifestation of a person’s culture and existing on a continuum. The participants showed an awareness of the impact of their cultural position on their understanding of religious beliefs. However, their understanding remains embedded within a psychiatric framework informed by the secular, empirical, bio-medical paradigm of the DSM. This provides an important insight into some of the barriers between mental health services and Muslim clients who present with religious beliefs...|$|R
