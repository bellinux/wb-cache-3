40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the speed with}} which abnormal economic profits vanish in the U. S. banking industry. A model is developed to infer expected speeds of profit adjustment from stock market and financial accounting data, deriving the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> that is most consistent with observed cross-sectional relationships between bank stock prices and profitability. The model allows for the possibility that reported accounting income may be a biased and noisy signal of economic profit. Estimation is performed using generalized nonlinear least squares on a pooled series of cross sections. The results indicate that the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> tends to be significantly greater than zero, although smaller than adjustment speeds found in studies of nonbank firms. The estimated speed of adjustment for negative profits is greater than for positive profits; for banks with high profit rates, the adjustment speed is near zero, implying that supernormal profits are very long-lived.

40|$|The {{symptoms}} of jet-lag commonly afflict travelers who cross time zones. Insomnia during the new night, daytime fatigue, malaise, sleepiness, and gastrointestinal disturbances can occur {{for as long}} as 3 weeks after jet travel across even a few time zones. These symptoms are largely due to the slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the internal circadian timing system to the new time zone. Since business (or pleasure) can be seriously interrupted by such symptoms, it is important to determine ways to speed up the adjustment process to ameliorate the symptoms. Airline pilots have reported that they frequently nap to counter jet lag symptoms, and that they view this as a useful technique. Napping as a countermeasure would be attractive since it is practical and would take advantage of a naturally occurring phase of sleepiness after lunch. Napping also makes sense since insomnia is a common jet lag symptom. Thus, a laboratory simulation of jet lag was designed to test the ability of napping to increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> following a time zone shift in a population of middle-aged men...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{relationships}} between retrospective reports of exposure to interparental violence in childhood and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>adjustment</b> problems in young adulthood in a birth cohort of New Zealand subjects. METHOD: Data were gathered {{during the course of}} an 18 year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children. At age 18 retrospective reports of exposure to interparental violence were obtained. At this time the cohort was also assessed on measures <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>adjustment</b> including mental health problems, substance abuse behaviors and criminal offending. RESULTS: Young people reporting high levels of exposure to interparental violence had elevated <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> problems at age 18. These problems included mental health problems, substance abuse behaviors and criminal offending. Analyses using multiple logistic regression showed that much of this elevated risk was explained by social and contextual factors associated with exposure to interparental violence.

However, little attention has been given to the adjustment behaviour of capital structure in the construction industry over the business cycles, in particular within the context of emerging markets. The partial adjustment model with the GMM (i. e. generalized method of moments) estimation is used to examine the adjustment behaviour of capital structure in the construction industry within the context of Taiwan during the period 1982 to 2007. The results suggest that, first, the average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is 26. 3 % of the adjustment gap between the target debt ratios and the previous debt ratios for firms in the construction industry of Taiwan. However, the average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> towards the target debt ratios has slowed down after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Secondly, firms with the financial constraint of over-leverage relative to the target debt ratios have lower debt ratios than those firms with the financial constraint of under-leverage. In addition, the difference in debt ratios between firms with the financial constraint of over-leverage and under-leverage has become narrower after the Asian financial crisis. Lastly, the findings suggest that macroeconomic conditions do not have a significant, negative effect on debt ratios.

A dynamic approach incorporating this linkage in food demand is developed, where consumers maximize utility over time by choosing fat intake to control their cumulative fat level.

The constructs tested are: relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, experimentation, image, income statement, visibility, volunteering and the use of technological innovation (established, in this study, by the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)).

Dynamic dual models are found to be non-robust in important ways to choice of functional form. With excessive stockpiles of dairy products heating up policy debates, considerable recent analytical attention has focused on dynamic adjustment in the U. S. dairy industry (Chavas and Klemme; La-France and deGorter). One method for estimating <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> herd size and other quasi-fixed inputs, such as labor, is the dynamic dual model (Epstein). Given a flexible functional form, the dynamic dual allows testing and/or maintaining theoretical properties while examining the structure of the industry. However, the robustness of the dynamic dual model to choice of functional form has not been investigated. This study examines the robustness of dynamic dual model results to the functional form employed for estimation. Epstein suggests four functional forms that meet the required conditions for an intertem-poral cost or profit function. Three have been used for estimation in different economic studies: qua-dratic in prices and quasi-fixed inputs (Epstein and Denny; Vasavada and Chambers, 1986); a modified generalized Leontief (Vasavada and Chambers, 1982); and log quadratic in prices and quadratic in quasi-fixed inputs (Taylor and Monson). However, none of these studies reports results for more than one functional form with the same data.
