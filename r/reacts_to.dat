5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree <b>reacts</b> <b>to</b> the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation).

5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel is {{centered}} on the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each character <b>reacts</b> <b>to</b> it.

The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen {{chronic myeloid leukaemia}} (CML) {{patients}} in remission were tested with solubilized membrane antigens from CML leukaemic cells, CML blasts, AML blasts and ALL blasts for cellular immunity in vitro by lymphocyte transformation (LT) and leucocyte migration inhibition (LMI) assays. Twelve CML {{patients in}} remission were tested with allogeneic PHA-transformed normal lymphoblasts. As controls, peripheral-blood leucocytes from 9 healthy persons were tested with the same antigen preparations. It was seen that 8 / 16 (50 %) CML patients responded to CML antigens by both LT and LMI assays, while 5 / 16 (31 %) patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> CML blasts and 44 % (7 / 16) patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> AML blast antigens.

40|$|This is to our {{knowledge}} the first report of a leptospirosis outbreak in a community. It is also {{the first time a}} public health laboratory with its manpower and technical facilities constraint utilized the commercially available leptospira antigens for the rapid macro-slide agglutination test as to pools and as specific serotype antigens. This has helped the clinicians and epidemiologists identify the etiology of the outbreak. At the time of the outbreak in 1976, of 101 sera from patients and residents with complaints within the month, 34 % were positive to one or more leptospira antigen pools; 74 % and 25 % to Pool 3 and to Pool 2 alone or in combination with other pools respectively. Of 517 sera from prisoners without complaints, 1 % <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> one or more pools, 80 % of these <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> Pool 3 alone. Three {{and a half years later}} 9 % of 551 sera from prisoners were positive to one or more antigen pools, 82 % and 42 % to Pool 3 and Pool 2 respectively alone or in combination with other pools.

Starbreeze considered {{the difficulty of the}} first game {{to be part of the}} franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI <b>reacts</b> <b>to</b> players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Limonene and linalool {{are common}} {{fragrance}} terpenes. Both oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool {{have recently been}} patch tested in an international setting, showing contact allergy in 5. 2 % and 6. 9 % of dermatitis patients, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To investigate concomitant reactions between oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool in consecutive dermatitis patients. METHODS: Oxidized R-limonene 3. 0 % (containing limonene hydroperoxides 0. 33 %) and oxidized linalool 6 % (linalool hydroperoxides 1 %) in petrolatum were tested in 2900 consecutive dermatitis patients in Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> either oxidized R-limonene or oxidized linalool. Of these, 25 % had concomitant reactions to both compounds, whereas 29 % <b>reacted</b> only <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene and 46 % only to oxidized linalool. Of the 152 patients <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene, 46 % <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> oxidized linalool, whereas 35 % of the 200 patients <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> oxidized linalool also <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> oxidized R-limonene. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients (75 %) <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> {{only one of the}} oxidation mixtures, thus supporting the specificity of the reactions. The concomitant reactions to the two fragrance allergens suggest multiple sensitizations, which most likely reflect the exposure to the different fragrance materials in various types of consumer products.

Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E
