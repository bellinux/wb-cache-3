5|$|In {{an initial}} attempt {{to settle the}} area, the {{government}} declared the land open for pastoral settlement by ordinary settlers, but little progress was made. By 1840, the population was just fifty-three, {{and most of those}} were in or near Bunbury (then known as Port Leschenault). The settlement of Australind by the Western Australian Land Company in 1840–41 prompted the first <b>real</b> <b>need</b> for a good quality road to Perth. Throughout much of 1842, there was much debate and discussion over providing a new route to Bunbury. A coastal route from Fremantle had been proposed, while an alternative proposal published on 11 May was a new route from Pinjarra to Bunbury, via an upstream crossing of the Harvey River, where a bridge could easily be built. The coastal route would have required a ferry to cross the Murray River's estuary, and would not go through Pinjarra, a significant settlement in the area; however, it would be shorter, had more water along the route, and would go through the village of Mandurah, which had a population of twenty-nine people from six families.|$|E

500|$|The {{settlement}} of Australind by the Western Australian Land Company in 1840–41 prompted the first <b>real</b> <b>need</b> {{for a good}} quality road to Perth. A coastal Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November 1842. Though the road was rebuilt by convicts in the 1850s, its importance was already declining. With a new road via Pinjarra at {{the foothills of the}} Darling Scarp completed in 1876, and the opening of the Perth−Bunbury railway in 1893, few people travelled up the old coastal road. In the late 1930s there was a proposal to re-establish the road as a tourist route, which could also reduce traffic on the main road along the foothills, but it was put on hold due to World War II. Improvements to Old Coast Road started in the early 1950s, but with little progress made until 1954 when the Main Roads Department approved £1000 worth of works. The name [...] "Old Coast Road" [...] was formally adopted on 27 January 1959, and a sealed road was completed in September 1969.|$|E

Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo, while commenting on the quality of the design of the characters, claimed that Zero was [...] "the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled off without a hitch." [...] Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character, calling her actions, attitudes and language [...] "a nicely self-contained example of how [...] plays with juxtaposition." [...] Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed, stating [...] "the character designs were fantastic. I loved Zero's look in particular; her white flowy dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons." [...] RPGFans Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as [...] "foul-mouthed butcher", although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling the latter [...] "strange and often hilarious". Andrew Barker, in an analysis of the game for RPGFan, referred to her as [...] "violence personified", noting how the game gradually justified her actions. She was also noted, alongside One, as being the only Intoner who had no <b>real</b> <b>need</b> for a disciple. In a final note, he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game's fourth branch, where her motives were revealed.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{shortage}} {{of doctors and}} maldistribution among specialties are of great concern in the Japanese health care system. This study investigated specialty preference in medical students of one university, and examined gender differences and compared their preference with <b>real</b> <b>needs.</b> Methods We conducted a self-administered questionnaire including specialty preference in all students of one medical university. Preference was assessed by the five-level probability of their future choice: 1 = very low, 2 = low, 3 = moderate, 4 = high, and 5 = very high. The proportion of 4 or 5 was calculated as the preference rate. The <b>real</b> <b>needs</b> (magnitude of doctor shortage) in the prefecture were drawn from two different surveys. The relationship between the sex-specific preference rate by specialty and <b>real</b> <b>needs</b> was assessed by Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results Internal medicine showed the highest preference rate, followed by general surgery, pediatrics, and emergency medicine. There was no significant correlation between the preference rates {{of men and women}} (r = 0. 27, p = 0. 34). The preference rates for general surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and emergency medicine were significantly higher in men than in women, while those of obstetrics & gynecology, pediatrics, and dermatology were significantly higher in women. The magnitude of doctor shortage by specialty from two surveys were significantly correlated with the total preference rate and men's preference rate (r = 0. 54 to 0. 74), but not with women's preference rate (r = 0. 06 and 0. 32). Conclusions This study elucidated not only gender differences in specialty preference but also the relationship to <b>real</b> <b>needs.</b> Critical gender differences and mismatch with <b>real</b> <b>needs</b> were found in women. In addition to traditional gender roles and insufficient support for women's participation in Japan, gender differences and mismatch influence the current and future maldistribution of specialties. Systematic changes in the working environment in medical society are required to solve these problems. </p...|$|R

As a result of this shift, there was no <b>real</b> <b>need</b> to limit the user to the speed of the long-distance lines, giving the Bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the user's site. Their attention turned to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), which ran over the existing wiring and did not block a telephone connection in the process.

30|$|Women {{entrepreneurs}} are {{key players in}} the economic development of societies in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, research has reported that business and technology incubators offer insufficient support to their enterprises. Consequently, this paper sets out to explore and highlight the present status of the contribution of business and technology incubators to women entrepreneurs’ businesses. The study collected data through exploratory focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and structured questionnaires. The data were analysed and interpreted using the convergent parallel method. The findings indicate that business incubators provide women’s business with training and to some extend enhance their access to market information and business networks. However, the study also finds a lack of contextualisation in the business and technology incubators’ services to the <b>real</b> <b>needs</b> of the incubatees, which eventually makes their support less impactful. In this light, the study recommends the provision of incubators’ services tailored to the <b>real</b> <b>needs</b> of women businesses. Our work puts forward recommendations to support women entrepreneurs’ business development through the contextualisation of the incubators’ services tailored to the incubatees’ <b>real</b> <b>needs</b> including appropriate training beyond business management. Further investments for establishing new incubation centres are also recommended.|$|R

Student assessment of teaching may be useful input for teachers to modify their teaching style, but it cannot be taken as a measure of teaching effectiveness. Effectiveness is a question of whether intended objectives are achieved or not, just as a physician is considered effective if the disease is cured.

2500|$|Cases construing the {{prudential}} {{component of}} the standing doctrine have relied on the avoidance doctrine. Prudence gives rise to, among other doctrines, the prohibition against third-party standing. One policy underlying the prohibition is the desire to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication. The Court, in explicating the bar against third-party standing, has described Brandeis' Ashwander rules as [...] "offering the standing requirement as one means by which courts avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudications." [...] A second prudential restriction is the bar against finding standing for a generalized grievance— a harm shared in substantially equal measure by all or {{a large group of}} citizens. The Court has also linked this standing bar to the avoidance doctrine: the requirement of an individualized injury serves to ensure that [...] "there is a <b>real</b> <b>need</b> to exercise the power of judicial review {{in order to protect the}} interests of the complaining party." [...] Indeed, the avoidance doctrine may be an early formulation of the justiciability doctrines.|$|E
