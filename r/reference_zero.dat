40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} generating a center of gravity trajectory of a biped humanoid robot under variable reference ZMP trajectory. A simple inverted pendulum model (SIPM) {{is used to calculate}} a center of gravity (CoG) trajectory from a <b>reference</b> <b>zero</b> moment point (ZMP) trajectory with an analytic form, which is based on the Fourier series. Fundamentally, we used a time segmentation based approach. For each segment, we defined its duration and boundary conditions, which are the key parameters of ZMP trajectory design. After designing the ZMP trajectory in each segment, we can automatically calculate the CoG trajectory by matching the boundary conditions and by calculating the coefficients between the time segments. The reference ZMP trajectory can be changed by updating the boundary conditions during walking. We successfully verified the proposed method through full-body dynamic simulations with variable step length...|$|E

[...] - Methods: Experiments in vivo were performed on cats and a new artificial model of the CSF system with dimensions similar to the CSF system in cats, consisting of non-distensible cranial and distensible spinal part. Measurements of the CSF pressure in the cranial and spinal spaces were performed in chloralose-anesthetized cats (n = 10) in the horizontal position {{on the base of}} a stereotaxic apparatus (<b>reference</b> <b>zero</b> point) and in the position in which the head was elevated to 5 cm and 10 cm above that horizontal position. Changes in the CSF pressure in the cranial and spinal part of the model were measured in the cranial part positioned {{in the same way as}} the head in cats (n = 5). [...] - Results: When the cat was in the horizontal position, the values of the CSF pressure in the cranial (11. 9 ± 1. 1 cm H 2 O) and spinal (11. 8 ± 0. 6 cm H 2 O) space were not significantly different. When the head was elevated 5 cm or 10 cm above the <b>reference</b> <b>zero</b> point, the CSF pressure in the cranium significantly decreased to 7. 7 ± 0. 6 cm H 2 O and 4. 7 ± 0. 7 cm H 2 O, respectively, while the CSF pressure in the spinal space significantly increased to 13. 8 ± 0. 7 cm H 2 O and 18. 5 ± 1. 6 cm H 2 O, respectively (P< 0. 001 for both). When the artificial CSF model was positioned in the horizontal level and its cranial part elevated by 5 cm and 10 cm, the changes in the pressure were the same as those in the cats when in the same hydrostatic position. [...] Conclusions: The new model of the CSF system used in our study faithfully mimicked the changes in the CSF pressure in cats during head elevation in relation to the body. Changes in the pressure in the model were not accompanied by the changes in fluid volume in the non-distensible cranial part of the model. Thus, it seems that the changes in the CSF pressure occur due to the biophysical characteristics of the CSF system rather than the displacement of the blood and CSF volumes from the cranium to the lower part of body...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although the World Society for Abdominal Compartment Syndrome in its {{guidelines}} recommends midaxillary line (MAL) as <b>zero</b> <b>reference</b> {{level in}} intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurements in aiming at standardizing the technique, evidence supporting this suggestion is scarce. The {{aim of this}} study is to study if the <b>zero</b> <b>reference</b> position influences bladder pressure measurements as estimate for IAP. Methods: The IAP of 100 surgical patients was measured during the first 24 h of admission to the surgical intensive care unit of General Calixto Garcia Hospital in Havana (Cuba) following laparotomy. The period was January 2009 to January 2010. The IAP was measured twice with a six-hour interval using the transurethral technique with a priming volume of 25 ml. IAP was first measured with the <b>zero</b> <b>reference</b> level placed at MAL (IAPMAL), followed by a second measurement at the level of the symphysis pubis (SP) after 3 minutes (IAPSP). Correlations were made between IAP and body mass index (BMI), type of surgery, gender, and age. Results: Mean IAPMAL was 8. 5 ± 2. 8 mmHg vs. IAPSP 6. 5 ± 2. 8 mmHg (p < 0. 0001). The bias between measurements was 2. 0 ± 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval of 1. 4 to 3. 0, upper limit of 4. 9, lower limit of- 0. 9, and a percentage error of 35. 1 %. IAPMAL was consistently higher than IAPSP regardless of the type of surgery. The BMI correlated with IAP values regardless of the <b>zero</b> <b>reference</b> level (R 2 = 0. 4 and 0. 3 with IAPMAL and IAPSP respectively, p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The <b>zero</b> <b>reference</b> level has an important impact on IAP measurement in surgical patients after laparotomy and can potentially lead to over or underestimation.
