5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of <b>rewinding</b> time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E

The album was published by DigiCube on April 21, 1999 with the catalog number SSCX-10009, and re-released by Square Enix on February 1, 2006 with the catalog numbers SQEX-10058~60.|$|E
5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by <b>rewinding</b> the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E

He also founded Diffusion Records, an independent record label {{through which he}} released The Alpha Conspiracy debut album. Gradually, Diffusion Records became a full-featured label, releasing albums by Iris, CTRL, Low Technicians, and Kilowatts and Vanek.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require <b>rewinding</b> and rereading the program source on tape or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.|$|E
25|$|Poorly {{compressed}} VCD video {{can sometimes}} be of lower quality than VHS video, for example exhibiting VCD block artifacts (rather than the analog noise seen in VHS sources), but does not deteriorate further with each use. Producing video CDs involves stripping out high- and low-frequency sounds from the video, resulting in lower audio quality than VHS. While both formats need fast-forwarding to find certain scenes, <b>rewinding</b> to the beginning upon reaching the end is not required in VCD. The resolution is just half below that of common VHS resolution.|$|E

25|$|The book {{attracted}} {{hardly any}} attention. Only three copies were sold, of {{which one was}} purchased by Fredrick Enoch, a resident of Cornmarket, Warwick, who in admiration, wrote to the publisher to request an autograph – the only extant single document carrying the three author's signatures in their pseudonyms, and they continued creating their prose, each one producing a book a year later. The three girls always worked in secret, unceasingly discussing their writing for hours at the dinner table, after which their father would open the door at 9 p. m. with Don't stay up late, Girls!, then <b>rewinding</b> the clock and taking the stairs to his room upstairs.|$|E
25|$|While digital voice {{recorders}} are now common, Compact Cassette—or microcassette—recorders may be cheaper and of sufficient quality {{to serve as}} adjuncts or substitutes for note taking in business and educational settings. Audiobooks, church services, and other spoken word material are still frequently sold on cassette, as lower fidelity generally is not a drawback for such content, and some people prefer the convenience of the tape controls for <b>rewinding</b> to repeat a missed passage. While most publishers sell CD audiobooks, they usually also offered a cassette version at the same price well into the 2000s. In the audiobooks application, where recordings may span several hours, cassettes also {{have the advantage of}} holding up to 150 minutes of material, whereas the average CD holds less than 80.|$|E

500|$|... 3. Time and Mystery {{introduces}} objects {{surrounded by}} a green glow that are unaffected by time manipulation; for example, switches will remain flipped even if time is rewound to before the action occurred. <b>Rewinding</b> can thus be used to change the synchronization between objects that can and cannot be rewound, the basis of many puzzles in this section. This theme is also used in later worlds to denote objects unaffected by the player's time manipulation.|$|E

500|$|The Xbox One {{does not}} provide full DVR {{functionality}} for recording television programs: executive Yusuf Mehdi indicated that the console would [...] "work in tandem" [...] with existing television services, but that Microsoft would {{need to work with}} them directly to provide extended functionality, such as DVR integration. The digital TV tuner accessory allows limited DVR functionality for pausing and <b>rewinding</b> live TV for up to 30 minutes.

50|$|The {{earliest}} machines recorded only {{in black}} and white and had no <b>rewind</b> mechanism, like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier; an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape.

The industrial-influenced [...] "Numb" [...] features a noisy backdrop of sampled, rhythmic noises, including [...] "arcade sounds", a Walkman <b>rewinding,</b> and a Hitler Youth boy banging a bass drum in the 1935 propaganda film Triumph of the Will. [...] "Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car" [...] begins with a snippet of fanfare from Lenin's Favourite Songs and samples MC 900 Ft. Jesus' song [...] "The City Sleeps".|$|E
500|$|Originally, Blow {{had envisioned}} {{the game to}} be broken into several {{different}} worlds as in the final game, each exploring facets of space, time, and causality, but with each world having very different high-level mechanics. One mechanic {{that he could not}} develop further was a world with no [...] "arrow of time" [...] that would have required the player to traverse the level in a manner that could be repeated in reverse. For example, the player would have been forbidden to jump down from a tall height while moving in forward time, as they {{would not be able to}} jump that height in reverse time. While this idea was not used, Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects. Another game mechanic that Blow considered was to show the player the expected result of an action they would take; while this concept was informative, he did not find it to be an entertaining game mechanic. Blow had previously explored this in a prototype game called [...] "Oracle Billiards", the game predicting each billiards shot before it was made. He had found the billiards setting too chaotic for this idea and this led him to try out similar ideas in a simpler [...] "Mario-style" [...] setting. After selecting the game mechanics he wanted, he began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on his views on game design in general. After brainstorming more puzzles and concepts, Blow dropped the least interesting puzzles and worlds from the game. Blow wanted to include significant consequences of <b>rewinding</b> time, not found in games such as , , and Timeshift in which <b>rewinding</b> time creates few or no changes to the game's world. While these games immerse the player with these time-shifting effects using a first- or third-person perspective, he decided to use a 2D presentation. Blow noted that some of the puzzles in Braid would have been more difficult or impossible to solve in any other perspective.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks is a single-disc {{album that}} {{comprises}} {{a selection of}} tracks from Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack. It was initially released through DigiCube on October 22, 1997 and later reissued by Square Enix on February 23, 2005.

All of the pieces are the same as on the Original Soundtrack except for [...] "Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII", [...] "One-Winged Angel", and [...] "Aerith's Theme", which were re-recorded with an orchestra and choir.
