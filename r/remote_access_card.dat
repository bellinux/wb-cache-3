40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the differences between SSL VPNs, IPSec VPNs, and other security technologies and explains why SSL VPNs are ultimately a better choice for secure <b>remote</b> <b>access.</b> At one time, a traditional Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN) was the only option for secure <b>remote</b> <b>access.</b> However, because IPSec solutions were designed for site-to-site connectivity and not with a highly mobile workforce in mind, these solutions provided limited <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> and often proved both difficult and costly to maintain. In response to increasing user demands for <b>remote</b> <b>access,</b> a new kind of VPN emerged—SSL VPNs. These new VPNs, based on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol that safeguards the world of e-commerce, quickly became the leading option for <b>remote</b> <b>access...</b>|$|R

Here, an <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder can edit data and perform many and more of the functions that a Project DIVA Arcade machine can do. However, an <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder must first accumulate 10 non-consecutive plays on any Project DIVA Arcade machine with an Internet connection before they can use many of Diva.Net's functions. Once 10 plays are accumulated, the <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> holder will gain 30-day access to all of Diva.Net's functions. Access to Diva.Net can only be performed this way, and one gains another 30 days of access every 10 plays. This [...] "access" [...] is known as a Diva.Net Right. Upon first play, a Card holder can automatically obtain a Diva.Net Right once. Losing one's Right does not affect the data, but the Card holder is unable to change it through Diva.Net until another Right is obtained.|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{problem of}} {{establishing}} and controlling <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> to corporate networks {{has become one}} of the most difficult issues facing network administrators and information security professionals (Tipton & Krause (b), 2001 : 99). As the connection devices become more powerful and less expensive, more and more personally owned devices make their way to the connected edge of the network. The rise of the Internet as an accepted vehicle for business use has dramatically increased the points of entry to the corporate network. As employees and third parties gain mobility through the use of laptops, smart phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), the threat to organisational security grows (Cartwright, 2001). There are three main reasons why <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> connections are often insecure: Lack of awareness regarding security risks associated with remote access; Protecting a <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> connection is a complex task which is unlikely to be done well unless a methodical approach is taken; and Remote locations are not under the direct control of the organisation and are inherently insecure (Information Security Forum (a), 1999). The purpose of this short dissertation is to: Provide an overview of <b>remote</b> <b>access,</b> including concepts and definitions; Identify the risks associated with <b>remote</b> <b>access</b> to corporate networks; Identify possible controls to mitigate these risks; and highlight possible future trends regarding <b>remote</b> <b>access...</b>|$|R
