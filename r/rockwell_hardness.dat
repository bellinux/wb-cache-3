25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the indenter, {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers {{that are consistent with}} our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E
500|$|Emerson {{ground the}} blades of these knives from ATS-34 steel with a <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> of 57–59 {{and made them}} thicker toward the tip, {{creating}} a stronger-tipped blade than he had made previously. He bead-blasted the blades as he did the liners and bolsters instead of rubbing or polishing them, giving them a matte finish {{as opposed to the}} mirror-polished finish common on his earlier knives and other knives at the time. [...] Emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose. The slender Viper 1 and smaller Viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer's backup weapon. [...] The Viper 5 was designed to be used by naval boat crews, as the handle was contoured with a rear brake so as to not slip from the user's hand when wet and the Viper 3 was designed as a pure fighting knife with its 4-inch blade.|$|E

50|$|The {{determination}} of the <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> of a material involves {{the application of a}} minor load followed by a major load. The minor load establishes the zero position. The major load is applied, then removed while still maintaining the minor load. The depth of penetration from the zero datum is measured from a dial, on which a harder material gives a higher number. That is, the penetration depth and hardness are inversely proportional. The chief advantage of <b>Rockwell</b> <b>hardness</b> is its ability to display hardness values directly, thus obviating tedious calculations involved in other hardness measurement techniques.|$|E
