40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the mathematical modeling and the application of a new position tracking control technique for hydraulic manipulators. The integrated model takes into account both the manipulator linkage as well as the actuator dynamics to represent a closer dynamic behaviour of the real system, thus providing a more suitable model for the purpose of advanced controller synthesis and analysis. Although hydraulic manipulators provide large torque and fast response, they possess highly nonlinear dynamics, parameter variations, uncertain load disturbances and strong couplings among various joints. Therefore, a robust control approach based on proportional integral sliding mode control (PISMC) technique is adopted to provide position tracking for the system.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is focusing on}} {{the improvement of the}} tracking method done for industrial robots by using On-Off method. The On-Off method is developed previously as a solution for the autonomous tracking method. The reason for improvement of the On-Off method is because the tracking error and deviation from targeted contour is exceptionally large. Improvements are done by using Artificial Intelligence methods which are Type- 1 and Type- 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems. The mean error and standard deviation for the tracking has been suppressed. This includes the improvement of the tracking time efficiency for the whole contour.

40|$|A lot of {{work has}} been done to {{automate}} this process in order to realize self learning capability. Non contact contour tracking has potential in robotic glasssealing, welding and painting applications. In this aspect, the robot learns the contour surface to be tracking autonomously. However, one of the problems in contour following technique is how to allocate sample according to curve complexities. For a simple curve, it will have less sample points, while more complex one will be represented by more number of points. In order to realize the above-mentioned objectives, neuro fuzzy contour tracking analysis has been studied in this work. Two inputs and one output ANFIS has been created and it will be used to improve the curve error and noise level. There are more points on complex curve and lesser points on simple or flat curve. If the slope is sharp and the difference between the previous and current slope gradient is large, then it represents a complex curve which requires more number of sampling points. Based on this consideration, twenty-five fuzzy rule have been established and using ABB <b>revolute</b> <b>robot.</b> The analysis shows that the contour tracking using neuro fuzzy can be improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we concern a swing-up control {{problem for}} an n-link <b>revolute</b> planar <b>robot</b> with {{any one of}} the joint being a passive joint. The goal {{of this study is to}} design and analyze a swing-up {{controller}} that can bring the robot into any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the upright equilibrium point with all links in the upright position. To achieve this challenging objective while preventing the robot from becoming stuck at an undesired closed-loop equilibrium point, first, we address how to iteratively devise two series of virtual composite links separated by the passive joint to be used for designing a coordinate transformation on the angles of all active joints. Second, we devise an energy based swing-up controller that uses a new Lyapunov function based on that transformation. Third, we analyze the global motion of the robot under the controller and establish conditions on control parameters that ensure attainment of the swing-up control objective. The results obtained here unify some previous results for the Pendubot, the Acrobot, and three-link robots with a passive first joint. Finally, we validate the theoretical results via a numerical simulation investigation to a 4 -link robot with a passive joint. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{the human}} body, {{there are many}} joints whose {{functions}} {{are very similar to}} revolute joints. To avoid the complexity of these joints, they are usually substituted by revolute joints in many humanoid <b>robots.</b> <b>Revolute</b> joints have purely rotational motion along their fixed axis while real joints in the human body have Instantaneous Rotational Axis (IRA) due to their configuration. Substitution of this kind of human joints with revolute (hinge) joints in robots changes the kinematics of the joints. Knowing the exact characteristics of the moving axis of rotation in human joints is a prerequisite for the kinematic study of the joint. Here, the main geometrical difference between this kind of joints in humans and their simplified (hinge-like) models in robots is described. Then, as a case study, the mechanism of the three joints of the index finger are compared with their hinge-like model using a multibody code, in order to understand when revolute joints can be substituted for anthropometric joints in hand exoskeletons and robotic hands. Furthermore, the position of Instantaneous Rotational Axis (IRA) and its distance from center of the condyle (MH) of the joint are presented. The concept and the results can be extended for other fingers and all similar joints, and can be used in humanoid robots, hand exoskeletons and robotic hands...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{investigation into}} the development of decentralized sliding mode control with application to trajectory tracking for hydraulically driven <b>revolute</b> <b>robot</b> manipulators. The control of hydraulically actuated robot manipulator is very challenging due to the highly nonlinearities in its dynamics, uncertainties parameters, and variations on payload. To overcome these problems, an integrated mathematical model of an N degree-of-freedom (dof) hydraulic robot manipulator is treated as a large-scale uncertain system models with bounded uncertainties where the bounds are known. This is then decomposed into interconnected uncertain subsystems in order to apply the decentralized tracking control strategy. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and Proportional-Integral Sliding Mode Control strategies will be utilized to overcome the inherent nonlinear dynamics under the decentralized frameworks. These approaches were adopted to ensure {{the stability of the}} system dynamics during the sliding mode and the insensitivity to the parameter variations and disturbances. The performance and robustness of the controllers were evaluated on a 3 dof hydraulically actuated manipulator through computer simulation.

40|$|The gravity induced {{force on}} <b>revolute</b> <b>robot</b> links is {{generally}} {{comparable to the}} dynamic induced forces at high operational speeds. At low speeds this force dominates over the dynamic forces. In the process of study of the static and dynamic behaviour of manipulators through the overall measures such as the force ellipsoid, the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid, and the generalized ellipsoid of inertia the effect of gravity is ignored due to the complexity that the inclusion of this force brings to the analysis. This study presents a method to include the effect of gravity in the static and dynamic analysis of robot arms. Using the concept of fields, the gravity induced forces acting on individual links are replaced by a single force, called here the generalized weight of the arm. The generalized weight is a force that acts at the end effector and its magnitude and direction are functions of {{the configuration of the}} manipulator. Since the system is conservative, the generalized weight is considered to be the gradient of a potential field that will be called here the generalized gravitational field (GGF). This field alone can illustrate the overall effect of gravity on the manipulator throughout its work volume. The generalized weight field is then integrated with the force ellipsoid to display the true force that a manipulator can apply to its environment. Based on the generalized weight field and the generalized inertia tensor the generalized gravitational acceleration field is introduced. The dynamic manipulability ellipsoid is then superimposed on this field to demonstrate the true acceleration capability of the end effector. The relation between the generalized weight and the generalized ellipsoid of inertia is investigated. Effect of change of physical parameters of the arm are also discussed. It is shown that for a particular design of manipulators the generalized gravitational field is absolutely flat, and in general the manipulators's physical parameters may be used to tailor the GGF for a particular application...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{decentralized}} and hierarchical control of a class of robot manipulators, where the robot manipulator is treated as a large scale uncertain system. The work {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part is concerned with the development of an integrated mathematical model of the robot manipulator. The model of the system considered comprises the mechanical part of the robot manipulator, the actuators, as well as the gear trains. The formulation results in nonlinear time varying state equations, which represent a more realistic model of the robotic system. A procedure to decompose and reduce the integrated model of the robot manipulator into a set of interconnected subsystems with bounded uncertainties description is then presented. In {{the second part of the}} research, two decentralized control approaches based on a deterministic approach are outlined. The first method uses only the local states as the feedback information. It is shown that the robot manipulator utilizing the proposed controller is practically stable and tracks a reference trajectory if a given sufficient condition is satisfied. In the second approach, the controller is designed based on the local states as well as the states of the neighbouring subsystems as the feedback information. It is shown that the controller will force the nonlinear uncertain robot manipulator to track a desired trajectory to within a small uniform ultimate boundedness set. In the final part of the study, two hierarchical control concepts for robot manipulator are proposed. The controllers are formulated based on a deterministic approach. It is shown that the hierarchical control strategies are capable of withstanding the expected variations and uncertainties and will render the robot manipulator to track a prescribed trajectory satisfactorily. In synthesizing the proposed controllers, it is assumed that the upper bounds on the nonlinearities, couplings and uncertainties present in the system are available. The proposed methods are simple and robust to parameter variations and uncertainties present in the system. The performance of the proposed control algorithms are evaluated by means of computer simulations. The proposed control laws are applied to a three degree of freedom <b>revolute</b> <b>robot</b> manipulator actuated by DC motors.
