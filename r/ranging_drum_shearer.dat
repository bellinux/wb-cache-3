40|$|A semi-automated coal {{extraction}} system with longwall <b>drum</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>shearer</b> is described {{to illustrate the}} way in which knowledge of mobile robots can be used to tackle previously unsolved technical problems. Height adjustment by means of sonsors of the drums along the limit between the coal and country rock is the first step towards the automation of {{coal extraction}} with <b>drum</b> <b>ranging</b> shearers. Because of the changing conditions during the extraction operations, unique sensor control of the drum height is not expedient. A multi-sensor system with superimposed seam model increases the control potential. This multi-sensor system makes it necessary to merge the individual statements using algorithms derived from AI research. The sensor and control structure used for this purpose is described. It permits hybrid theoretical value generation, either from the on-line sensor guidance or optionally via an extrapolation from the environment model...|$|R
40|$|Longwall mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{continuous}} and productive mining methods. Efficiency of this method is directly affected by the involved machineries and systems. The <b>drum</b> <b>shearer</b> plays an important role in the face productivity and the mine life. Therefore, monitoring of this machine can lead the whole extraction operation to a high level of production and safety. There are several reliability-related measures for evaluation of the mining equipment. Availability, utilization, production efficiency and overall production effectiveness are the most important measure which can help us in this way. In this paper, the production and failure data of a <b>drum</b> <b>shearer</b> machine in Parvade coal mine in Iran have been collected from whole of one longwall panel during a two-year period. The mentioned reliability-related measures have been calculated based on the total uptime and downtime of the machine. The results showed that, the studied <b>drum</b> <b>shearer</b> is in good availability level. However, it has average production efficiency, very low utilization and very low overall equipment effectiveness. Also, high waiting and idling time raises from other machineries during the extraction process, was recognized as the main reason for the current low productivity of shearer machine in mine.

40|$|The {{process by}} which a single drum {{longwall}} coal-cutting system is steered vertically through an undulating coal seam has been previously investigated. This work demonstrated initially that several discrepancies existed between theoretical models and actual performance. It was shown theoretically that the delay between the coal thickness measurement by nucleonic sensor and the actual coal cutting action contributes to system instability. Analysis of the process has demonstrated that by storing the previous pass data on a remote computer the system can be stabilised {{and this has been}} substantiated by the use of a 1 / 4 -scale physical model. Recently, the possibility of the automatic steering of a twin <b>drum</b> <b>shearer</b> cutting simultaneously the roof and floor of the coal seam has been considered. From theoretical considerations it seems possible that a local microcomputer can achieve the required optimum control of the twin <b>drum</b> <b>shearer</b> dispensing with the remote computer. For the purpose of analytical studies, a hybrid computer simulation of the process allowing for bi-directional cutting and the associated microcomputer control system have been constructed and is described in this report.

40|$|The {{poor coal}} loading {{performance}} of a <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> primarily restricts the widespread application of the shearer and affects the mining efficiency in thin seam mining. The coal loading performance of the <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> is influenced by several factors, such as geographical environment, drum structural parameters, and motion parameters. In addition to the above factors, in the actual production, the coal loading performance of the <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> is also affected significantly by the drum position parameters and the structural parameters of the connected equipment, e. g., {{the thickness of the}} ranging arm. The influence of the parameters on the coal loading performance of the <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> was studied using a three-dimensional (3 D) discrete element method (DEM) simulation in the current study, and the trends of the influential parameters were obtained.

40|$|Longwall shearers usually {{suffer from}} {{excessive}} pick and pickholder consumptions and severe wear of the backplate of the clearance ring section of <b>shearer</b> <b>drums.</b> In practice, {{most of the}} drums were seen to be withdrawn from the face due to the abovementioned problems, while vane picks and their holders were intact due to the improper lacing design of the clearance ring picks. However, few underground investigations and their results {{on the effect of}} lacing arrangement of clearance picks on the service life of <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> have been published. Nevertheless, the pick consumption characteristics of <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> were not investigated in detail, since these are fewer pick consumptions with shearers when compared to roadheaders. This paper is concerned with the comprehensive in situ trials on the effect of lacing of clearance ring picks on the lifespan of <b>shearer</b> <b>drums,</b> and the pick consumption characteristics of longwall shearers at Cayirhan Coal Mine in Turkey. The lifespan of <b>shearer</b> <b>drums</b> employed with shearers in this mine increased 70 per cent, while the consumption rate of clearance ring picks decreased three fold through using an alternative lacing for clearance picks, indicating the significance of utilizing proper design techniques for clearance ring picks for the service life of <b>shearer</b> <b>drums.</b> Statistical analyses carried out, using the raw pick consumption data, implied that the clearance ring picks experienced much higher loads than vane picks, revealing that special attention must be paid to designing clearance ring picks. An average maximum consumption value of 41 was determined for clearance ring picks, with corner-cutting picks having the most replacements, while it was 35 for vane picks, on three-day based pick replacements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} cutting {{efficiency}} and the lump coal {{percentage of the}} <b>shearer</b> <b>drum,</b> a new <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> with variable diameter vanes was developed according to the characteristic (good at compression resisting, not good at tension resisting) of coal and similarity theory.

And then, the cutting tests were carried out on the cutting testbed of coal and rock for the new <b>shearer</b> <b>drum</b> and an existed drum. To understand both {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the two drums, test parameters such as the cutting specific consumption, the load fluctuation, and the lump coal percentage of the drums were compared based on the same rotary speed and the initial haulage speed. And the two drums had the same vane starts, the same pick arrangement, and the number of total picks. The results indicate that the cutting lump coal percentage of the new drum is better than the existed drum and the lump percentage of the new drum increases by 3 % over the existed drum. At the same time, the cutting specific consumption of the drums is nearly the same, but the load fluctuation of the new drum is bigger...|$|R
