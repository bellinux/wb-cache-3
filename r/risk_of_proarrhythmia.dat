40|$|BACKGROUND Acute drug {{conversion}} of persistent atrial fibrillation usually fails. OBJECTIVES The {{purpose of this}} study was to test the proarrhythmic potential, safety, and efficacy of the novel antiarrhythmic agent AZD 7009 in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (mean duration 43 days) scheduled for direct current (DC) cardioversion. METHODS Patients were randomized to AZD 7009 (3 -hour intravenous infusion; n = 86) or placebo (n = 36). AZD 7009 was given in doses intended to produce target pseudo-steady-state plasma Levels of 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, or 2. 5 mu mol/L after 30 minutes of infusion. DC cardioversion was performed if conversion to sinus rhythm (SR) did not occur within 2 hours of infusion. RESULTS AZD 7009 in a concentration-dependent manner increased the rate of {{conversion of}} AF to SR and shortened the time to conversion. At the three highest target concentrations of AZD 7009, 45 %, 64 %, and 70 % of AF patients converted after a mean time of 62, 55, and 26 minutes, respectively, whereas no placebo-treated patients converted. SR was maintained for 24 hours in 21 of 22 patients with drug-associated conversion. AZD 7009 treatment was associated with QT-interval prolongation; the increase in QT corrected according to Fridericia typically ranged from 40 to 80 ms at targeted pseudo-steady-state plasma concentrations >= 0. 75 mu mol/L, but a number of outliers with QT corrected according to Fridericia > 550 ms were seen in the higher concentration groups, particularly after conversion to SR and prolonged infusion. None of the patients exhibited torsades de pointes according to predefined criteria; however, one patient exhibited a nonsustained, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of eight beats with torsades de pointes-like features after AZD 7009 infusion (asymptomatic and discovered only upon retrospective Hotter tape analysis). Clinical adverse events (primarily dizziness, bradycardia, hypotension, and nausea) were significantly more common in the highest target concentration AZD 7009 group vs placebo (P <. 001). CONCLUSION AZD 7009 exhibited dose-dependent effects in converting AF to SR in AF patients and appeared to be associated with a tow <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmia</b> despite continued administration during a period of heightened vulnerability...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common form of arrhythmia, carrying high social costs. It is usually first seen by general practitioners or in emergency departments. Despite the availability of consensus guidelines, considerable variations exist in treatment practice, especially outside specialised cardiological settings. Cardioversion to sinus rhythm aims to: (i) restore the atrial contribution to ventricular filling/output; (ii) regularise ventricular rate; and (iii) interrupt atrial remodelling. Cardioversion always requires careful assessment of potential proarrhythmic and thromboembolic risks, and this translates into the need to personalise treatment decisions. Among the many clinical variables that affect strategy selection, time from onset is crucial. In selected patients, pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF can be a safely used, feasible and effective approach, even in internal medicine and emergency departments. In most cases of recent-onset AF, pharmacological cardioversion provides an important [...] and probably more cost effective [...] alternative to electrical cardioversion, which can then be employed as a second-line therapy for nonresponders. Class IC agents (flecainide or propafenone), which can be safely used in hospitalised patients with recent-onset AF without left ventricular dysfunction, can provide rapid conversion to sinus rhythm after either intravenous administration or oral loading. Although intravenous amiodarone requires longer conversion times, it is still the standard treatment for patients with heart failure. Ibutilide also provides good conversion rates and could be used for AF patients with left ventricular dysfunction (were it not for high costs). For long-lasting AF most pharmacological treatments have only limited efficacy and electrical cardioversion remains the gold standard in this setting. However, a widely used strategy involves pretreatment with amiodarone in the weeks before planned electrical cardioversion: this provides optimal prophylaxis and can sometimes even restore sinus rhythm. Dofetilide may also be capable of restoring sinus rhythm in up to 25 - 30 % of patients and can be used in patients with heart failure. The potential <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmia</b> increases the need for careful therapeutic decision making and management of pharmacological cardioversion. The results of recent trials (AFFIRM [Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management] and RACE [Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation]) on rate versus rhythm control strategies in the long term have led to a generalised shift in interest towards rate control. Although carefully designed studies are required to better define the role of pharmacological rhythm control in specific AF settings, this alternative option remains a recommendable strategy for many patients, especially those in acute care...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} drugs prolong cardiac repolarization (manifested as QT {{prolongation}} on ECG), although the major example are the so-called class III antiarrhythmics. However, antiarrhythmic drugs which prolong cardiac repolarization are not harmless, {{as they may}} also be proarrhythmic, inducing a potentially fatal arrhythmia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). Recently, it has become apparent that a wide variety of non-antiarrhythmic agents may also, as an entirely undesired side-effect, provoke TdP. TdP is also characteristic of the congenital long QT syndrome, one form of which is caused by mutations in the HERG gene which encodes the major repolarizing potassium channel, IKr. Furthermore, HERG appears to be the main molecular target for drugs which cause QT prolongation. This thesis investigates the cellular mechanism for QT prolongation, proarrhythmia and sudden death associated with several commonly prescribed non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Specifically, we studied the effects of an antimalarial agent, halofantrine, and five psychoactive agents, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, clozapine, amitriptyline and mianserin on the HERG channel. A better understanding of the way these drugs interact with HERG could facilitate the development of safer drugs. We used the whole-cell voltage clamp technique to study currents produced by stable transfection of HERG into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K 1). Our HERG-transfected cells possessed a potassium channel with biophysical properties similar to HERG-transfected cells previously reported (e. g. Xenopus oocytes, human embryonic kidney cells 293) and also to human IKr. HERG currents were potently inhibited by E- 4031, a defining pharmacological signature of IKr. Therefore, these cells provide an appropriate model for the study of this important current in isolation. Halofantrine is a widely used antimalarial agent which has been associated with QT prolongation, TdP and sudden death. Halofantrine blocked HERG tail currents potently with an IC 50 of 196. 9 nM. Channel inhibition was time-, voltage- and use-dependent. Halofantrine did not alter channel activation or deactivation kinetics but inactivation was accelerated and there was a 20 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the mid-activation potential of steady state inactivation. Block increased with increasing depolarizing pulse duration and was enhanced by pulses that render channels inactivated. This is the first report of HERG channel blockade by halofantrine and is the likely cellular mechanism for its proarrhythmic potential. Our data indicate preferential binding of halofantrine to the open and inactivated channel states. Cardiovascular mortality in psychiatric patients is high. Reports of sudden unexplained death in those taking antipsychotic drugs have raised concerns that part of this excess may be due to drug-induced arrhythmias. We found that thioridazine and chlorpromazine blocked HERG channels (IC 50 1. 07 &# 131;ÝM and 1. 47 &# 131;ÝM respectively) at clinically relevant concentrations and this is likely the cellular mechanism for their ability to prolong QT interval and induce TdP. To date, HERG block by chlorpromazine has not been reported and the state dependence of channel blockade by these phenothiazines has not been studied. Our results indicate that both drugs preferentially bind to closed HERG channels on the basis that block was not time-, voltage- or use-dependent, did not alter channel activation or deactivation kinetics and was unaffected by the depolarizing pulse duration. Clozapine is the prototype of the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs and is more efficacious and better tolerated than the traditional agents. Serious cardiotoxicity have occurred in clozapine-treated patients including sudden death. We found that clozapine produced a tonic block on HERG channels indicating preferential binding to the closed channel state. The IC 50 for block was 2. 62 &# 131;ÝM. This is close to the therapeutic concentration of the drug (0. 6 to 2 &# 131;ÝM) and concentrations above 10 &# 131;ÝM have been reported during overdoses. Although there have been no specific reports of QT prolongation or TdP in clozapine-treated patients, our data raises the possibility of proarrhythmia as another potential explanation for sudden death during clozapine treatment. Amitriptyline, a commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressant, can induce a variety of cardiac rhythm disturbances. Most reports have attributed these effects to its Na+ channel blocking ability. We found that amitriptyline blocked HERG channels with an IC 50 of 10 &# 131;ÝM. Such high concentrations can be achieved during overdoses. Thus HERG channel blockade likely underlies amitriptyline¡¦s QT-prolonging effect. Channel inhibition by amitriptyline exhibited positive voltage- and use-dependence and increased progressively with further prolongation of depolarization during an envelope of tails protocol, indicating preferential binding to an activated (open/inactivated) state of the channel. In contrast to the tricyclics, the tetracyclic antidepressant, mianserin, is much safer and only very rarely associated with cardiac complications. HERG channel blockade by mianserin was the least potent among the 5 psychoactive drugs we studied, with an IC 50 of 14. 78 &# 131;ÝM, which is 30 - to 40 -fold higher than therapeutic plasma concentrations of the drug. This probably, in part, accounts for the lack of reports of QT prolongation or TdP with mianserin. Mianserin displayed preferential affinity for an activated state of HERG channels on the basis of voltage-dependent block, a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage of half-maximal activation and an increase in block at low external potassium concentration. Our results show that HERG block is a common feature of many non-cardiac drugs and that this underlies their potential for QT prolongation and TdP. Although the proarrhythmic risk varies according to potency of HERG block (e. g. mianserin is a weak blocker and does not induce TdP), other factors such as drug metabolism, protein binding and myocardial concentrations are also important since the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmia</b> during clinical use differ significantly even among the more potent HERG blockers. The preferential binding of these drugs to different channel states together with their diverse chemical structures suggest the presence of multiple distinct binding sites for drugs on HERG channels. There is increasing awareness that many non-antiarrhythmic drugs can prolong the QT interval and provoke TdP. Cardiac safety is now a major issue in new drug development. Our model of HERG K+ channels stably expressed in a mammalian cell line (CHO-K 1) provides a useful tool for screening, at the preclinical stage, the proarrhythmic potential of novel drugs intended for human use...|$|E

40|$|Progressive {{heart failure}} (HF) post {{myocardial}} infarction (MI) remains {{the leading cause}} of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Non-pharmacological interventions, including stem cell therapy and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), are emerging novel therapeutic approach to prevent or treat HF. Nevertheless, the potential impact of these interventions on the susceptibility for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT/VF), which are {{the most common cause of}} sudden death in HF patients remains unknown. For stem cell therapy, sympathetic hyperinnervation as reflected by nerve spouting, lack of gap junction and immature electrophysiological phenotypes of the transplanted cells are potentially trigger and/or substrate for VT/VF after transplantation. Previous studies suggested that stem cell transplantation post-MI may induce cardiac nerve sprouting but their effects on gap junction expression are unclear. Furthermore, the effects of stem cell transplantation on cardiac nerve spouting and gap junction expression in chronic myocardial ischemia have not been addressed. In Chapter 3, we investigated bone marrow (BM) derived mononuclear cells (MNCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) via direct intramyocardial transplantation in a porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia. Our results showed that BM-MNCs or BM-EPCs transplantation was not associated with increased cardiac nerve sprouting, which might account for their low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmias</b> observed in clinical and experimental studies. In Chapter 4, we investigated the susceptibility to develop VT/VF after embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) transplantation in a murine model of MI. Moreover, the potential application of bioengineered ESC-CMs with over-expression of Kir 2. 1 to reduce their susceptibility to induce VT/VF was also studied. Our results showed that transplantation of ESC or ESC-CMs reduced cardiac nerve sprouting and increased gap junction expression in the infarcted regions when compared with MI alone. The inducibility of VT/VF after ESC-CM transplantation was significantly higher than ESC transplantation or MI alone. On the other hand, over-expression of Kir 2. 1 improved the electrical maturation of ESC-CMs which significantly attenuated their vulnerability for VT/VF. These results suggested that the immature electrical phenotypes of ESC-CMs, rather than cardiac nerve spouting and changes in gap junction expression, plays an important role for proarrhythmias after stem cells transplantation, which can be eliminated by bioengineering of ESC-CMs. Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system with increased sympathetic tone and decreased parasympathetic tone has been well documented in HF progression, and is proposed to play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. In Chapter 5, we performed acute thoracic SCS at T 1 -T 2 level in an animal model of ischemic HF (MI+HF) induced by MI and rapid ventricular pacing. Our results showed that acute SCS significantly increased left ventricular (LV) contractile function as determined by echocardiographic measurement of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and invasive hemodynamic assessment of +dP/dt. Furthermore, myocardial oxygen consumption also significantly decreased during SCS without any change in serum norepinephrine level. Nevertheless, acute SCS failed to prevent spontaneous VT/VF provoked by prolonged (> 2 minutes) acute myocardial ischemia. Taken together, our results provide important insights into the potential mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmias</b> after stem cell transplantation as well as the acute beneficial effects SCS in ischemic HF. published_or_final_versionMedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Methods and Results Sixty-one patients who had had chronic atrial fibrillation for 8 +/- 14 months received a 6 h infusion of the I-kr-bIocker almokalant, the first 90 min of which are used for this analysis. The following day, after conversion to sinus rhythm, by almokalant (n = 19) or direct current cardioversion (n = 42), an identical 90 min infusion was administered. Prior to infusion, there was no difference in precordial QT dispersion between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm (29 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 17 ms, P = ns). During infusion, at prolonged repolarization, the {{increase in}} QT dispersion was greater during sinus rhythm than during atrial fibrillation (58 +/- 49 vs 30 +/- 15 ms, P = 0. 0011, after 30 min infusion). No correlation was found between QT dispersion and the QT or RR interval. Conclusion QT dispersion during atrial fibrillation does not differ from QT dispersion during sinus rhythm during normal repolarization, while measurement of QT dispersion during prolonged repolarization, induced by an I-kr-blocker, yielded larger values during sinus rhythm than during atrial fibrillation.

MethodsThe {{first part of this}} study prospectively compared rapid and slow infusion rates in terms of results and ventricular arrhythmias. Thirty-two patients (mean age 41 ± 12 years; 26 men) received the two ajmaline challenges on different days. According to randomization, ajmaline (1 mg/kg) was infused at 1 mg/sec or over 10 minutes. The second part of the study retrospectively assessed the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia during 386 challenges performed at a rapid infusion rate. ResultsNo differences were observed between rapid and slow tests. All patients diagnosed as positive or negative with one test obtained the same result with the other test. Ventricular premature beats were observed in five of 32 patients during the slow challenge and in four of 32 patients during the rapid challenge. No sustained ventricular arrhythmias were observed. Analysis of the 386 tests revealed four episodes of ventricular arrhythmia (two complex ventricular premature beats, one non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and one ventricular fibrillation). ConclusionSlow and rapid infusions of ajmaline have identical diagnostic performances on suspected Brugada electrocardiograms.

40|$|International audienceFlecainide is a class Ic {{antiarrhythmic}} agent {{that has an}} important role as part of rhythm control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Early clinical data {{on the use of}} flecainide showed an increase in arrhythmias and mortality compared with placebo in patients with a previous myocardial infarction and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. These findings only apply to a specific group of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and ischaemic heart disease, but had a negative impact on the use of class Ic antiarrhythmics across all indications and patient groups. The aim of this review was to evaluate the available safety data for flecainide in the literature and to assess its current use in patients with AF. Current European guidelines now recommend the use of flecainide in carefully selected groups of patients with AF who do not have structural heart disease. This includes for the cardioversion of recent-onset AF, pretreatment prior to direct current cardioversion, out-of-hospital acute oral therapy ('pill-in-the-pocket' approach) and for the ongoing maintenance of sinus rhythm. Potential cardiac adverse effects <b>of</b> flecainide include <b>proarrhythmia,</b> conduction abnormalities and negative inotropic effects. Dizziness is the most frequent non-cardiac side effect, followed by blurred vision and difficulty focusing; these are almost all mild, transient and tolerable. Data from recent clinical trials in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias suggest that flecainide has a good tolerability profile in groups of appropriately selected patients. Caution is required when using flecainide in patients with renal dysfunction, {{and there are a number}} of drug interactions, but these are well documented and manageable. Overall, flecainide is a good choice for the pharmacologicalmanagement ofAF.

40|$|BACKGROUND Vanoxerine is an oral, 1, 4 -dialkylpiperazine {{derivative}} antiarrhythmic drug {{being evaluated}} for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vanoxerine for the restoration of sinus rhythm in subjects with recent onset AF or atrial flutter (AFL). METHODS RESTORE SR (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine for the conversion of subjects with recent onset atrial fibrillation or flutter to normal sinus rhythm) was a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized subjects to a single oral dose of vanoxerine 400 mg or placebo (2 : 1 allocation). RESULTS A total of 41 subjects were randomized in the study (placebo [n = 15] and vanoxerine [n = 26]). The study was terminated prematurely because of safety concerns. Overall, 61 % (23 of 38) of the treated cohort had a history of AF/AFL and 66 % (27 of 41) had structural heart disease (SHD). The primary efficacy end point-conversion to sinus rhythm through 24 hours-occurred in 20 % (3 of 15) in the placebo arm vs 69 % (18 of 26) in the vanoxerine arm (P =. 0024). The mean length of stay was 4. 2 +/- 2. 9 days in the placebo arm vs 4. 7 +/- 3. 2 days in the vanoxerine arm (P =. 6561). The primary safety end point (all-cause death, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia requiring intervention, or torsades de pointes) occurred in no patient in the placebo arm vs 11. 5 % (3 of 26) in the vanoxerine arm. All 3 patients had torsades de pointes and underlying SHD. CONCLUSION Vanoxerine is an oral, mixed ion channel blocker with I-Kr, I-Na, and L-type calcium channel activity.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, causing disabling symptoms, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> thromboembolic events and increased mortality. Some patients with AF are asymptomatic, but to what extent these patients differ from patients with symptoms is unclear. Electric cardioversion mostly restores sinus rhythm, but recurrence of AF is frequent, even with the use of antiarrhythmics. Considering the drugrelated side effects and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmias</b> with antiarrhythmic treatment, more knowledge about clinical factors predicting successful electric cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion, as well as new alternative treatments, is necessary. Magnesium (Mg) is the second most common intracellular cation. Mg has a decisive role in the maintenance of the Na, K and Ca gradient across the cell membrane and thereby for the resting potential of the cell. Electrophysiological effects have been shown after intravenous administration of Mg, and Mg has shown efficacy in the treatment of ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias. The main purpose of the present studies was to investigate: the prevalence of symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction, predictive factors for successful electric cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion, and, the effect of Mg on heart rate, rate variability and its effect as a prophylactic agent in order to reduce recurrence of AF after cardioversion, in patients with AF. The prevalence of symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction was investigated in 280 patients with persistent AF, duration > 2 months. A careful history of symptoms, clinical investigation, echocardiographic assay and 24 hours ECG was performed in all patients. 189 patients (68 %) had symptoms that could be related to the arrhythmia, 91 patients (32 %) were asymptomatic. Symptoms of irregular pulse, rapid palpitations or congestive heart failure were reported in 30 %, 35 % and 91 % of the symptomatic patients, respectively. In logistic regression analysis, including data from clinical, echocardiograpic and 24 hours ECG examination, the only independent predictor of symptoms was the presence of valvular heart disease. Left ventricular dysfunction (EF < 40 %) was observed, in 56 patients (23 %). Presence of male gender, ischemic heart disease, higher mean heart rate and an increased LVED were independently associated with impaired left ventricular function. Clinical factors predicting successful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm were evaluated in 166 patients with persistent AF elected to their first cardioversion. Independent predictors of successful elective electric cardioversion were; short duration of AF and low weight. Short duration of AF, treatment with [beta]-blockers or calcium antagonists and right atrial area/dimension (adjusted for BSA) were independent predictors for maintenance of sinus rhythm. Patients with unknown duration were comparable to patients with known duration regarding successful elective electric cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. THe effect of intravenous Mg, two different doses (10 mmol and 16 mmol), on heart rate and rate variability was studied in 30 patients with chronic AF, in a double blind placebo controlled fashion. Intravenous Mg showed no effect on heart rate or rate variability, and therefore seems to have no clinically relevant effects on the atrioventricular conduction in patients with chronic AF. Intraindividual variation of rate variability over time was low. The effect of orally given Mg, as a prophylactic treatment {{in order to reduce the}} recurrence of AF after elective electrical cardioversion, was evaluated in two studies. Oral Mg (20, 6 mmol daily) or placebo was given to A) 170 patients with persistent AF elected to their first cardioversion without concomitant antiarrhythmics. B) 131 patients with recurrence of persistent AF after elective electrical cardioversion, as an adjuvant to sotalol. No influence on the recurrence rate of AF was seen with either of the treatments. In conclusion, the presence of valvular heart disease is an independent factor predicting symptoms in patients with persistent AF, with a prevalence of asymptomatic patients of approximately 30 %. Approximately 20 % of patients with persistent AF have left ventricular dysfunction, and, male gender, a higher heart rate and presence of ischemic heart disease is more likely to occur among these patients. In patients with persistent AF elected to their first cardioversion, only short duration of AF and low weight are independent predictors of successful elective electric cardioversion. Short duration of AF, treatment with [beta]-blockers or calcium. antagonists and right atrial area/dimension (adjusted for BSA) are independent predictors for maintenance of sinus rhythm. In patients with chronic AF, intraindividual variation of rate variability over time is low. Intravenous Mg has no effect on heart rate or rate variability. Oral treatment with Mg alone, or as an adjuvant to sotalol, does not influence the recurrence rate of AF after elective cardioversion of patients with persistent AF...|$|R

Proarrhythmia is an evolving concept in cardiology. Its definition, incidence and clinical significance in various patient settings require refinement. Methods. The Impact <b>of</b> early <b>proarrhythmia</b> was analyzed in 3, 840 patients in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST). Results. Drug therapy {{did not affect the}} incidence of new, sustained but nonfatal ventricular tachycardia (placebo 0. 5 %, active drug 0. 4 %). Nevertheless, there was a threefold increase in arrhythmic death (placebo 0. 5 % vs. active drug 1. 6 %). The incidence of increased ventricular premature depolarizations was equivalent (3 % to 5 %) for the three study drugs and indistinguishable from that seen with placebo. Patients with increased ventricular premature depolarizations on the first drag tested had fewer at baseline (65 ± 94 vs. 137 ± 260 per hour; mean ± SD) (p < 0. 01). When increased ventricular premature depolarizations occurred with the first drug, they were much more likely also to be present with the second drag (for example, 42 % vs. 5 %, p < 0. 001). Increased ventricular premature depolarizations during initiation of therapy independently predicted increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> subsequent arrhythmic death (independent relative risk 2. 34, p = 0. 0053) in the absence of continued antiarrhythmic drag therapy. Conclusions. The overall incidence of early worsening of arrhythmia {{in the present study was}} low.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of oral sotalol for various arrhythmias in pediatric patients and to evaluate the incidence <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmia</b> and systemic side effects. Background. Sotalol is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent with additional class III antiarrhythmic properties. Experience in pediatric patients is limited. Data concerning the incidence <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmia</b> in children are lacking. Methods. Seventy-one pediatric patients (mean age 7. 3 years) with various supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias were treated with oral sotalol. All the patients were {{admitted to the hospital}} for initiation of sotalol therapy. Antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects of sotalol were assessed by daily surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the in-hospital phase and by serial Holter monitoring. Results. Sotalol was either completely (27 [66 %] of 41 patients) or partially effective (11 [27 %] of 41) in 38 (93 %) of 41 patients with supraventricular reentrant tachycardias. In patients with atrial flutter predominantly after operation for congenital heart disease, sotalol was effective in 84 % of patients (completely in 9 of 19 and partially in 7 of 19). Ventricular tachycardia was completely (3 of 11) or partially (4 of 11) controlled in 64 % <b>of</b> children. <b>Proarrhythmia</b> occurred in seven patients (10 %) and consisted of symptomatic bradycardia from sinoatrial block and high grade atrioventricular (AV) block, respectively, in two children; asymptomatic high grade AV block in one; torsade de pointes in one; and relevant increased ventricular ectopic activity in three.

Shortening of APD, when accompanied by instability and triangulation, was also markedly proarrhythmic (primarily monomorphic ventricular tachycardia). In experiments in which instability and triangulation were present, proarrhythmia declined with prolongation of APD, but this effect was not large enough to become antiarrhythmic.

40|$|Ventricular arrhythmias are a {{major cause}} of death after {{myocardial}} infarction, especially in patients with poor left-ventricular function. Previous attempts to identify and suppress arrhythmias with various antiarrhythmic drugs failed to reduce or actually increase mortality. Amiodarone is a powerful antiarrhythmic drug with several potentially beneficial actions, and has shown benefit in several small-scale studies. We postulated that this drug might reduce mortality in patients at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death after myocardial infarction because of impaired ventricular function, irrespective of whether they had ventricular arrhythmias. The European Myocardial Infarct Amiodarone Trial (EMIAT) was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess whether amiodarone reduced all-cause mortality (primary endpoint) and cardiac mortality and arrhythmic death (secondary endpoints) in survivors of myocardial infarction with a left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40 % or less. Intention-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were done. EMIAT enrolled 1486 patients (743 in the amiodarone group, 743 in the placebo group). Median follow-up was 21 months. All-cause mortality (103 deaths in the amiodarone group, 102 in the placebo group) and cardiac mortality did not differ between the two groups. However, in the amiodarone group, there was a 35 % risk reduction (95 % CI 0 - 58, p = 0. 05) in arrhythmic deaths. Our findings do not support the systematic prophylactic use of amiodarone in all patients with depressed left-ventricular function after myocardial infarction.

The device was programmed into a rhythm monitoring mode for the first 3 -month postimplant period. All defibrillation therapy was performed under physician supervision to monitor safety and efficacy. After this initial monitoring period, patients were allowed to activate their device away from the hospital or clinic. A total of 357 spontaneous AF episodes occurred in 83 (72 %) patients during observed operation and the mean shock efficacy was 93. 5 ± 20. 3 % (lower 95 % confidence interval [CI] 89. 8 %). As of the last follow-up, 58 (55 %) patients had transition to receive nonphysician observed therapy. Forty-two (72 %) patients had experienced 332 episodes of AF for which they had received device therapy away from the hospital/ clinic (mean shock efficacy 90. 5 ± 39. 7 %). The presence of hypertension, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease did not affect the shock efficacy of the IAD during physician observed and nonobserved therapy (P > 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{dog with}} chronic {{complete}} atrioventricular block (AVB), torsade de pointes arrhythmias (TdP) can be induced reproducibly by class III antiarrhythmic agents. In vivo studies reveal important electrophysiological alterations of the heart at 5 weeks of AVB, resulting in increased proarrhythmia. Autopsy studies indicate the presence of biventricular hypertrophy. In this study, the cellular basis <b>of</b> <b>proarrhythmia</b> and hypertrophy in chronic AVB was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: From chronic-AVB dogs with increased heart weights and TdP, left midmyocardial and right ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dispersion. These myocytes were significantly larger than sinus rhythm (SR) controls. In chronic AVB, the action potential spike-and-dome configuration was preserved. However, the action potential duration (APD) at 95 % and 50 % of repolarization of the left midmyocardium was significantly larger in chronic AVB than in SR, with little change in the right ventricle, causing enhanced interventricular dispersion of repolarization at slow pacing rates. Treatment with the class III agent almokalant increased the APD to a much larger extent in chronic-AVB than in SR myocytes and resulted in {{a higher incidence of}} early afterdepolarizations (EADs). EADs had their takeoff potential between - 35 and 0 mV. There was no evidence that spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release underlies these EADs. CONCLUSIONS: In the dog, chronic AVB leads to hypertrophy of both right and left ventricular myocytes. The repolarization abnormalities predisposing for class III-dependent TdP in vivo are the results of cellular electrophysiological remodeling. status: publishe...|$|R
