25|$|Among {{the species}} of {{salmonids}} migrating routinely through the ladder at the Chittenden Locks are Chinook (king) salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho (silver) salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Sockeye (<b>red)</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus nerka), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|E
25|$|Zonal pelargoniums {{are mostly}} bush-type plants with {{succulent}} stems grown for {{the beauty of}} their flowers, traditionally <b>red,</b> <b>salmon,</b> violet, white or pink. The scarlet colouring is attributed to the contribution of P.inquinans. Flowers may be double or single. They are the pelargoniums most often confused with genus Geranium, particularly in summer bedding arrangements. This incorrect nomenclature is widely used in horticulture, particularly in North America.|$|E

25|$|Bristol Bay {{is home to}} the world's largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's {{freshwater}} tributaries. Commercial fisheries {{include the}} world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. The Kvijack River has the single largest <b>red</b> <b>salmon</b> run in the world. The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs.|$|E
25|$|The Yup'ik, {{like other}} Eskimo groups, were {{semi-nomadic}} hunter-fisher-gatherers who moved seasonally {{throughout the year}} within a reasonably well-defined territory to harvest fish, bird, sea and land mammal, berry and other renewable resources. Subsistence is the practice of hunting, fishing, or gathering food to live on (not to resell), and is practiced by almost all the Yup'ik. In the inland, fishing for <b>red</b> <b>salmon</b> and gathering berries in the summer as well as hunting caribou or moose {{in the fall and}} winter constitute the primary seasonal subsistence activities of the inland Yup'ik villages.|$|E
25|$|Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) {{are also}} {{known in the}} US as <b>red</b> <b>salmon.</b> This lake-rearing species is found south {{as far as the}} Klamath River in California in the eastern Pacific and {{northern}} Hokkaidō island in Japan in the western Pacific and as far north as Bathurst Inlet in the Canadian Arctic in the east and the Anadyr River in Siberia in the west. Although most adult Pacific salmon feed on small fish, shrimp, and squid, sockeye feed on plankton they filter through gill rakers. Kokanee salmon are the land-locked form of sockeye salmon.|$|E

2500|$|Pier 62 (built in 1901) and Pier 63 (built in 1905) {{have long}} since lost their sheds, which were {{similar to the one}} on Pier 59. Pier 62 was {{originally}} numbered Pier 9, known as the Gaffney Dock, after its absentee owner Mary Gaffney. Pier 63 (originally Pier 10) was known by 1908 as the Holden Dock, but was more commonly known as the Virginia Dock or Virginia Street Dock from its location. It was designed by architect Max Umbrecht and one of its main tenants in the 1910s was Northwest Fisheries, who canned and distributed Alaskan <b>red</b> <b>salmon.</b> An overpass connected the dock to a warehouse {{on the other side of}} Railroad Avenue.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{the color of}} salmon products {{is one of the}} most important quality parameters. Therefore, color plays a decisive role when evaluating the quality of the product at point-of-sale. The colors resulting from the deposition of carotenoids are considered to be of significant behavioral importance to animals. However, in addition to their coloration properties, the carotenoids have major biological functions. The species-specific pink flesh color provided only by astaxanthin has always been associated with salmonids and has differentiated the salmonids from other fish species. Studies have shown that when it comes to making purchasing decisions about salmon, consumers have stated that color is very important. Consumers perceive that <b>redder</b> <b>salmon</b> is equated to these characteristics: fresher, better flavor, higher quality and higher price...|$|R

50|$|Aloe polyphylla is a {{stemless}} aloe {{and grows}} its leaves {{in a very}} distinctive spiral shape which may be clockwise or anti-clockwise. The plants {{do not seem to}} sucker or produce offshoots, but from the germination of their seeds they can form small, dense clumps. The fat, wide, serrated, gray-green leaves have sharp, dark leaf-tips and grow in the five spiral rows. This aloe flowers at the beginning of summer, producing flowers that range in colour from <b>red</b> to <b>salmon</b> pink and occasionally yellow, at the head of robust, branched inflorescences.|$|R
50|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Tyromyces pulcherrimus are bracket-shaped caps that measure 3 - 8 cm in diameter. They are sessile, lacking a stipe, and are instead {{attached}} {{directly to the}} substrate. The cap colour when fresh is cherry <b>red</b> or <b>salmon,</b> but it dries to become brownish. The cap surface can be hairy, particularly near the point of attachment. Pores on the cap underside are red, and number about 1-3 per millimetre. The flesh is soft and thick, red, and watery. It {{does not have any}} distinct odour. Tyromyces pulcherrimus is inedible.|$|R
