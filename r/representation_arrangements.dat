40|$|Are {{non-union}} {{systems of}} representation an acceptable alternative to union-based systems? Or do they in fact complement more {{traditional forms of}} union representation? This book {{is the first of}} its kind to consider these and other challenging questions. Employee Representation in Non-Union Firms offers a comprehensive overview of this practice in the UK and locates this within an international context. Readers are invited to consider the potential implications and limitations of these arrangements, and to examine how unions respond, through bargaining, consultation and representation processes. Throughout issues are addressed on both a macro and micro level, while this book reviews the literature and examines current practice using survey data and original case analysis. 1.

Importantly, the paper also examines {{the pros and cons}} of both NER and union voice arrangements. The fi ndings show that the effectiveness of non-union structures as bodies representing the interests of employees in fi lling the lack of representation is questionable.

This perception of the lack of effective voice is particularly important given the recent {{introduction of}} the European Directive on information and consultation and its forthcoming implementation into UK law. The main implication of this research is that the existence of a mechanism - union or non-union - for communication between management and employees at the workplace may not be a suffi cient condition for representation of employee interests.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the current research}} debates over non-union employee representation (NER) arrangements in advanced English speaking countries. It reviews the current literature and debates around four core research questions: First, what are NER arrangements {{from the perspective of}} advanced English speaking countries? Second, what is the rationale for establishing NER arrangements? Third, are NER arrangements a complement to union representation or do they act as a substitute for union-based voice arrangements? Fourth, how effective are NER arrangements in representing the interests of employees and employers? Overall, the findings presented in this review of the NER literature and evidence-based research would seem to suggest that the legitimacy of NER arrangements as alternative to unions is inadequate and concerns remain over some key issues. These include: lack of independence of NER compared to union representation; resource dependency of NER forms on the employer; the capacity of NER arrangements compared to unions to challenge management decision-making; the lack of non-union representatives’ knowledge and experience compared with union representatives; and the more limited level and scope of NER influence and input compared to unions. In addition, the incentives that motivate NER highlight that the intentions and actual outcomes may be contradictory due to a number of external and internal circumstances. The research also suggests that the old dichotomy of union versus non-union channels of voice is likely to prove inadequate in shaping future <b>representation</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Instead focus could be more fruitfully directed towards the quality of employee representation and resultant climate of employment relations, manifested in a mosaic of substance and process. Embracing this alternative orientation has important consequences for management strategies towards NER voice arrangements. 34 page(s...|$|E

Then some of his presbyterian friends asked him why he should even do so much as this, when he would take no such steps for the moderator of the free church.

He has been dispossessed, not for any fault of his own, but because clerical dominion was deemed intolerable. In the maintenance of the pope and his court, followers and agents, six millions of our fellow-subjects or thereabouts are deeply interested; and they are making demands upon us which we are forced to decline. But I should for one be ashamed to deny that there are the strongest equitable claims upon the Italian government growing out of the past state of things; that in these equitable claims the six millions I speak of have a real interest and share; and as the matter is international, and they have no locus standi with the Italian government, it is our part so far to plead their cause if need be.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the European Directive on Information and Consultation and the recent implementation of the Information and Consultation of Employees (ICE) Regulations into United Kingdom (UK) law have increased the focus on workplace <b>representation</b> <b>arrangements.</b> This paper examines the interplay between nonunion and union representative arrangements at Eurotunnel (UK) and assesses their effectiveness in representing the needs of employees over a 5 -year period. Importantly, the paper also examines the opportunities and challenges of both nonunion representation (NER) and union voice arrangements. The findings show that the effectiveness of nonunion structures as bodies representing the interests of employees in filling the lack of representation is questionable. However, union recognition through an employer–union partnership agreement has also raised important issues regarding the effectiveness, impact, and legitimacy of unions at Eurotunnel. The main implication {{of this research is}} that the existence of a mechanism—union or nonunion—for communication between management and employees at the workplace may not be a sufficient condition for effective representation of employee interests. In addition, while trade unions may provide greater voice than nonunion arrangements (thus the reluctance of management to accept such voice arrangements), the strength of voice is dependent on the legitimacy and effectiveness of trade unions in representing employees’ interests at the workplace. And that in turn depends on the union being perceived by the workforce as both representative and able to act independently. If the union cannot, it will not meet the needs of either employees or management—and could run the risk of being supplanted under the provisions of the new EU Directive on Information and Consultation with tougher requirements for compliance in terms of procedures for consultation and information disclosure. 44 page(s...|$|E

The research explores these issues by using a multi-variant analysis including employee surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation and internal company documentation. The research attempts to address a number of research questions. First, what are the management strategies towards and objectives of NER arrangements.

Third, how effective are NER and union arrangements perceived to be at representing the interests of and providing voice for employees. Fourth, what are the perceived workplace outcomes of both NER and union-based voice arrangements. Fifth, what are the union responses and approaches towards NER arrangements. Sixth, what are the potential implications for employers, unions and NER-based voice arrangements in the future.

40|$|This {{research}} explores local self-governance {{policy and}} implementation practice, and examines {{the reasons for}} its weak impact on poverty reduction in rural areas of Nepal. In order to do this, it analyses local governance to judge its impact on poverty reduction. The strength of its performance is evaluated through three criteria: participation, accountable governance and service delivery. It also investigates four factors which enable the measurement of the above three criteria. These enabling factors are: human resources and capacity, local financing, local autonomy and co-ordination. Field data were collected in two anonymous Village Development Committees using document analysis, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and observation. The analysis shows policy is consistent with theory, but inconsistent with implementation practice. Participation of disadvantaged groups and the poor was a positive aspect of policy, but their participation in decision-making remained weak {{due to lack of}} information on policy arrangements, high levels of rural poverty, elite domination, inequitable <b>representation</b> <b>arrangements</b> and discontinuation of local elections. Accountable governance is weak with stakeholders not accountable to disempowered groups, through lack of internal and external checks and balances, perpetuation of democratic local authorities and fair participation arrangements. Devolution of services and improvements of local infrastructure development are positive aspects in local service delivery. However, pro-poor service delivery and planning, balanced service production and delivery, and fair resource distribution are lacking due to overlapping and unclear division of roles and responsibilities among tiers of governance and other stakeholders, lack of accountable governance and financial resources, ineffective human resource and capacity development efforts, inappropriate delimitation of local government jurisdictions, and a lack of information-based and coordinated planning. Human resources and capacity development efforts remain ineffective due to the domination of deputed staff, lack of appropriate arrangements for fair selection and recruitment, and lack of effective institutional arrangement and linkage for capacity development. Intergovernmental resource transfer is inappropriate, nominal, power-based and inconsistent with local responsibilities and resource capacity. Overlapping revenue rights and a cap on sources hinder local revenue capacity and foster dependence on conditional and nominal central government funding. Local co-ordination is weak and results in duplication and corruption {{because of a lack of}} necessary policy arrangements, lack of commitment and discontinuation of elected bodies in local government institutions. The study concludes that participation, accountable governance and service delivery in local governance are highly correlated with poverty reduction in rural areas. Local self-governance policy implementation practice has had very little impact in poverty reduction in Nepal due to policy weaknesses and weaknesses in implementation practice.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{computational}} geometry algorithms involve {{the construction and}} maintenance of planar arrangements of conic arcs. Implementing a general, robust arrangement package for conic arcs handles most practical cases of planar arrangements covered in literature. A possible approach for implementing robust geometric algorithms is to use exact algebraic number types — yet this {{may lead to a}} very slow, inefficient program. In this paper we suggest a simple technique for filtering the computations involved in the arrangement construction: when constructing an arrangement vertex, we keep track of the steps that lead to its construction and the equations we need to solve to obtain its coordinates. This construction history can be used for answering predicates very efficiently, compared to a naïve implementation with an exact number type. Furthermore, using this <b>representation</b> most <b>arrangement</b> vertices may be computed approximately at first and can be refined later on in cases of ambiguity. Since such cases are relatively rare, the resulting implementation is both efficient and robust. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the case of}} Cochlear, a medical manufacturer in Sydney, Australia, and its non-union voice arrangements. It draws on interviews conducted in 2009 and 2012 with management and employees to argue the following points. First, representative non-union employee <b>representation</b> (NER) <b>arrangements</b> {{can be used in}} periods of organisational change in a problem-solving capacity (Butler 2009) and as means to address short-term communication needs. However, when the change at hand is embedded in the organisation and the circumstances that gave rise to representative NER dissipate, the centrality and role of a collective non-union representation body wanes. In other words, we concur with much literature that finds that NER arrangements diminish in importance in the long term. Second, direct-voice arrangements can substitute for collective NER and in fact be more effective in capturing employee concerns over production and/or other matters. Third, embedding employee voice mechanisms within a broader human resources (HR) framework is crucial and preferred to a 2 ̆ 2 narrow, one-dimensional employee participation initiatives 2 ̆ 2 (Wilkinson et al. 2010 : 9). In other words, the existence of voice mechanisms per se is not enough; what is needed is a high-involvement strategy that emphasises competitive advantage through people (Kaufman and Taras 2010) ...|$|R

Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) typically {{form the basis of}} such a discretization.

Thus, a pre-processing is needed to improve the mesh in order to avoid negative effects on the performance of the hydrological model. This paper proposes computer-assisted mesh generation tools to obtain a more regular and physically meaningful mesh of HRUs suitable for hydrologic modelling.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} the decision within Lacanian psychoanaly-sis to formalize {{the theory of}} psychoanalytic praxis. The intrinsic problem-atics of analysis, the place of authority, unconscious knowledge, the roles of embodiment and representation, and singularity are addressed as challenges that psychoanalytic theory must address. It is argued that psychoanalysis cannot locate its autonomy from or complicity with hegemonic cultural dis-courses without {{a clear sense of}} the specificity of its practice. This is addressed in detail. Part of Lacan’s formulation of the four discourses was in fact to situate just such an interface founded in the structure of speaking and its remains and located between a separation from and enmeshment in social and cultural <b>representations</b> and <b>arrangements.</b> In light of this effort, I question the rather chilly reception of Lacan’s formalization by North American and anglophone analysts in terms of the role of affect, the place of norms and knowledge, and issues about theory. KEY WORDS: Lacan, Lacan’s four discourses, psychoanalysis, psychother-apy, structuralism Psychoanalysis was once the golden boy of mental health in North America, a kinship in which medicine and psychoanalysis were closely aligned (see Miller, 2005 b). Currently, the American-bred professional alliance between psychoanalysis and the other mental health fields such as psychology and psychiatry is being harvested through an excruciatingly elderly population of training analysts, the average age being 71 years (Fischer, 2004); apparently the horses of psychiatry and psychology have found new pastures better suited to their appetites, leaving psychoanalysts in the dust as the latter lament their loss of influence as a crisis in recruitment and patient base (Widlöcher, 2003). Today the American Psychoanalytic Association is reaching out t...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on development provides {{evidence of a}} continuous effort by economists to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the theoretical relationship between institutions and the process of economic development. It is widely agreed by social scientists and economists that continual institutional change is important for development. Designers of institutional change put much effort in coming up with effective programs that guarantee positive institutional change. However this is only achievable if the underlying process of institutional change is understood. This paper makes a contribution towards this effort by bringing to understanding the structural, quantitative and operational <b>representation</b> of institutional <b>arrangement</b> and change which provides researchers and practitioners an opportunity to be able make interventions and enhance institutional change that brings about development. The paper presents a conceptual model for institutional arrangement and change. The paper further presents a system dynamic institutional arrangement and change model that exposes influence points where interventions can be made. The paper presents ICTs as interventions to enhance the institutional arrangement and change in a real world scenario...|$|R
40|$|We asked 149 high-school {{students}} who were pretested for their working memory capacity (WMC) to read spatial descriptions relating to five objects and to evaluate conclusions asserting an unmentioned relationship {{between two of the}} objects. Unambiguous descriptions were compatible with a single spatial arrangement, whereas ambiguous descriptions permitted two arrangements; a subset of the ambiguous descriptions still determined the relation asserted in the conclusion, whereas another subset did not. Two groups of participants received different instructions: The deduction group should accept conclusions only if they followed with logical necessity from the description, whereas the comprehension group should accept a conclusion if it agreed with their <b>representation</b> of the <b>arrangement.</b> Self-paced reading times increased on sentences that introduced an ambiguity, replicating previous findings in deductive reasoning experiments. This effect was also found in the comprehension group, casting doubt on the interpretation that people consider multiple possible arrangements online. Responses to conclusions could be modelled by a multinomial processing model with four parameters: the probability of constructing a correct mental model, the probability of detecting an ambiguity, and two guessing parameters. Participants with high and with low WMC differed mainly in the probability of successfully constructing a mental model...|$|R
