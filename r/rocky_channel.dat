Captain Gore on Triton, which was in full flow at seven knots, was unaware of the obstacle and at 05:00 crashed into them, coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship's hull. Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit, assisted by Digby on Alcmene who was able to block Pillon's route into Porte de Vidre. Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigida at 07:00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter in the rocks at Commarurto close to the safe harbour at Muros, Pillon's movement hampered by the coastal rias that blocked the wind. After an hour of resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces.

Species composition consisted mainly of estuarine and euryhaline marine species. Spatially, a saline gradient was observed with marine conditions in the mouth, and increasing to over 100 in the inner zone of the system. Species richness, diversity and biomass declined from the mouth to the inner zone, while density showed an inverse tendency, with the highest values in the inner zone. Thus the salinity was the variable that best explained the spatial fish assemblages" structure. The ichthyofauna composition did not change over time, but the dominant species varied with the years.

Geomorphology 57 (3 - 4), 235 - 262 RAE 2008 Anabranching is {{characteristic}} of a number of rivers in diverse environmental settings worldwide, but has only infrequently been described from bedrock-influenced rivers. A prime example of a mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching river is provided by a 150 -km long reach of the Orange River above Augrabies Falls, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Here, the perennial Orange flows through arid terrain consisting mainly of Precambrian granites and gneisses, and the river has preferentially eroded bedrock joints, fractures and foliations to form multiple channels which divide around numerous, large (up to 15 km long and 2 km wide), stable islands formed of alluvium and/or bedrock. Significant local variations in channel-bed gradient occur along the river, which strongly control anabranching style through an influence on local sediment budgets. In relatively long (> 10 km), lower gradient reaches (0. 0013) within the anabranching reach, local transport capacity exceeds sediment supply, bedrock crops out extensively, and channels flow over an irregular bedrock pavement or divide around <b>rocky</b> islands. <b>Channel</b> incision into bedrock probably occurs mainly by abrasion, with the general absence of boulder bedforms suggesting that hydraulic plucking is relatively unimportant in this setting. Mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching also occurs {{in a number of other}} rivers worldwide, and appears to be a stable and often long-lived river pattern adjusted to a number of factors commonly acting in combination: (1) jointed/fractured granitoid rock outcrop; (2) erosion-resistant banks and islands; (3) locally variable channel-bed gradients; (4) variable flow regimes.

Studies were carried out in November (2004) and February (2005). We counted the number of calling males and duration of calling bouts {{in the morning and}} evening periods. The advertisement call was recorded with a digital recorder. Tadpole description was based on specimens collected in pools. Males called from well-illuminated sites such as <b>rocky</b> fields, rain <b>channels,</b> and borders of riverine forests. In November, males vocalized daily during two distinct periods, between 04 : 30 h and 10 : 00 h and between 16 : 30 h and 20 : 00 h. Morning temperature varied between 20 - 23 ºC and humidity from 79 - 89 %; during evening varied between 24 - 27 ºC and 54 - 82 %. In the middle of the day, temperature reached 36 ºC and humidity 40 %. During the morning, call activity was almost uninterrupted, in the evening calling bouts lasted around 9 min. In February, even with the occurrence of rainfall and temperatures similar to that of November no frog vocalized. The advertisement call is composed by a single note with 7 - 8 pulses with frequency ascending slightly from 3. 20 to 4. 05 kHz. Note duration was 144 ms, and between note intervals is 292 ms. Notes are given at a rate of 139 per minute. Upon observing the female, the male began to emit courtship call. The female approached the male and touched him laterally with her snout. The male moved forward and raised his hindquarters by stretching his hind legs. While leading the female, the male continued to give courtship and advertisement calls. The male clasped the female in axillary amplexus, and the pair entered a hole in a bank. The female deposited eggs {{on the surface of the}} soil, spreading them in groups. The egg clutches had eggs in at least two developmental stages, recently deposited and with embryos. Tadpoles were found in small, shallow rocky pools along a permanent stream, in well-illuminated sites at the forest border. The tadpole had the dorsal fin arched, not extending onto body. E. flavopictus appears to be unique among dendrobatids by using open areas subject to high temperatures and low humidity. Reproductive activity of the species ends before the end of the rainy season, possibly to avoid loss of tadpoles during months with unpredictable rainfall.

40|$|Mulkey, Inc. is {{participating}} in a stream restoration study with the Ecosystem Enhancement Program in Yadkin County, North Carolina. The {{purpose of this study}} is to restore approximately 4, 300 linear feet of Rocky Branch, a second order stream locatedin the western Piedmont of North Carolina. Stream restoration in North Carolina is generally conducted to provide compensatory mitigation for stream impacts from both highway construction and private development. Since the late 1990 s, North Carolina has served at the forefront for stream restoration activities due to the state’s tremendous population growth and stringent water quality standards. In an effort to provide mitigation for the state’s needs in an efficient manner, the Ecosystem Enhancement Program was created in 2003 under an agreement with the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. There are approximately 400 streams and wetland restoration projects that are currently under development across 54 watersheds in North Carolina. Those resources having the greatest repair needs are prioritized and the Ecosystem Enhancement Program works with public and private organizations in an effort to restore, to enhance and to preserve wetlands, streams, and buffers, statewide. The Ecosystem Enhancement Program serves as the nucleus for consolidating and streamlining mitigation activities within the state. The project presented here is one of the many projects this program administers in an effort to meet the ever growing mitigation needs in the state. The Rocky Branch site comprises approximately 24 acres of pasture and woodlands immediately adjacent to the Interstate 77 corridor in Yadkin County, North Carolina. The project site has a drainage area of approximately 3. 1 square miles and is part of the South Yadkin River Watershed. The site was once heavily forested, but over the last 100 years has been cleared primarily for pasture and row crops. Cattle have been a significant part of the land-use since the early part of the 20 th century and their impact is highly visible through compaction, erosion, and denuded vegetation along the stream. The objectives of the Rocky Branch stream restoration project were and continue to be: 1) to provide mitigation for future needs in the area, 2) to improve water quality by excluding cattle from the stream, 3) to provide a stable and functional stream channel, 4) to improve the overall quality of the stream and riparian areas and 5) to provide long-term protection of the project through a conservation easement. The restoration of <b>Rocky</b> Branch’s main <b>channel</b> and its associated tributary were completed using methods based on the work of David L. Rosgen, PhD, which emphasize the use of natural stability concepts. The stream restoration project created a new stream channel with the appropriate dimension, pattern, and profile for its specific location within the watershed. The new channel contains in-stream boulder structures which provide grade control, bank stabilization, and aquatic habitat. Boulder structures used in conjunction with this project include cross vanes, rock vanes, and j-hooks. The stream banks were stabilized using erosion control matting, native seed mixes, bare root seedlings, rootwads, and live vegetation stakes. A permanent riparian buffer was established using native vegetation specific to the region. Vernal pools were established throughout the riparian buffer to provide habitat, water storage capacity and micro-topography. To protect the project from disturbance, permanent fencing was established around the entire site. As is true for projects of this type, an as-built report documenting stream restoration and enhancement is developed to provide a baseline for future monitoring or success criteria. A monitoring program will be implemented to document system development and progress toward achieving the success criteria as stipulated in the mitigation requirements for the project permit. Monitoring will take place over a 5 -year period or until final success criteria are achieved...|$|R
50|$|Farmers {{cultivated}} {{the rich}} soil on the intervales. The Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad diagonally crossed the town. With abundant water {{power from the}} Baker River, Wentworth developed into a lumber producing town with nine sawmills. But disaster struck on August 6, 1856, when dams on the Upper and Lower Baker ponds in Orford breached during a flood, releasing a wall of water down Pond Brook to the Baker River. It raced three miles (4.8 km) down the steep, <b>rocky</b> <b>channel,</b> then undermined and washed away Wentworth's riversidemills, houses, barns, sheds and roads. It widened the river by nearly 90 feet (27 meters).|$|E
50|$|The {{headwaters}} of Leggetts Creek are {{outside of the}} Lackawanna Valley. At Providence, the creek flowed directly southeast prior to the glacial period, reaching the Lackawanna River approximately 0.5 mi downstream of its current location. However, the course now flows to the east instead. The old course of the creek has been build over. There is a ledge on the north bank of Leggetts Creek in its lower reaches. The creek makes a sharp eastward bend around Providence. From this point downstream to its mouth, it flows through a <b>rocky</b> <b>channel</b> that contains a thick covering of till on its upper walls.|$|E
