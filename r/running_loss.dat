40|$|It is {{intended}} to present technical analysis of issues using data which are currently available. The purpose in the release of such reports is to facilitate the exchange of technical information and {{to inform the public}} of technical developments which This report documents the method used in MOBILE 6 for estimating the <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> emissions from vehicles. In earlier versions of EPA's MOBILE model, <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> emissions (defined as evaporative hydrocarbons that are emitted when the vehicle is in operation) were calculated as functions of ambient temperature, fuel volatility, driving cycle, and vehicle parameters (i. e., fuel delivery system, model year ranges, and functionality of the evaporative control system). This report is not a complete re-analysis of the older data used in those previous versions of MOBILE. Rather, this report incorporates the effects of "gross liquid leakers " (see report M 6. EVP. 009) with the MOBILE 5 <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> estimates, and then verifies that this approach is consistent with the results of recent <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> testing (while the MOBILE 5 estimates alone are not).

40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports the}} {{quantification}} of the evaporative emissions from gasoline-poweredmotor vehicles in South Africa {{under various conditions}} including high temperatures. Three vehicles with and without evaporative emission control systems have been tested to quantify gasoline evaporative emissions, including both diurnal and <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> emissions. Measurements were made in a Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determination over a range of ambient temperatures. The standard diurnal test shows that evaporative emissions increase progressively with increasing fuel temperature. South African gasoline poweredmotor vehicles exhibitedevaporative emissions 10 times higher than that allowed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The extended-time diurnal test shows that the fuel emittedfrom gasoline-poweredmotor vehicles in South Africa is about 97 million litres of gasoline every year...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the duration of trips in a metropolitan area is an important input to estimating area-wide <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> emissions, operating mode fractions and vehicle miles of travel (VMT) accumulated on local roads in the region. In the current paper, we formulate and implement a methodology for modeling trip durations. The approach develops a log-linear regression model of the duration of trips {{as a function of}} trip purpose, time-of-day of the trip start, and other land-use and socio-demographic characteristics of the zone of trip start, using vehicle trip data from household travel surveys and supplementary zonal demographic/land-use data. A distinguishing characteristic of the methodology is the straightforward manner in which model parameters estimated from vehicle trip data can be applied to obtain zonal-level trip duration distributions. The modeling framework is applied to develop trip duration distributions for the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{emission}} inventory of vehicular {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) {{is one of those}} with the largest errors and uncertainties due to suboptimal estimation methods and the lack of first-hand basic data. In this study, an updated speciated emission inventory of VOCs and an estimation of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) from vehicles in China at the provincial level for the year of 2015 are developed based on a set of state-of-the-art methods and an abundance of local measurement data. Activity data for light-duty vehicles are derived from trajectories of more than 70   000 cars for 1  year. The annual mileage of trucks are calculated from reported data by more than 2  million trucks in China. The emission profiles are updated using measurement data. Vehicular tailpipe emissions (VTEs) and four types of vehicular evaporation emissions (VEEs), including refueling, hot soak, diurnal and <b>running</b> <b>loss,</b> are taken into account. Results show that the total vehicular VOC emissions in China are 4. 21  Tg (with a 95...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{resource}} allocation algorithm for OFDMA-based systems which handles both real-time and non-real-time traffic. For real-time traffic, the QoS requirements are specified with delay bound and loss proba-bility. The resource allocation problem is formulated as one which maximizes system throughput subject to the constraint that the bandwidth allocated to a flow is no less than its minimum requested bandwidth, a value computed based on loss probability requirement and <b>running</b> <b>loss</b> probability. A user-level proportional-loss scheduler is adopted to determine the resource share for flows attached to the same subscriber station (SS). In case the available resource {{is not sufficient to}} provide every flow its minimum requested bandwidth, we maximize the amount of real-time traffic transmitted subject to the constraint that the bandwidth allocated to an SS is no greater than the sum of minimum requested bandwidths of all flows attached to it. Moreover, a pre-processor is added to maximize the number of real-time flows attached to each SS that meet their QoS requirements. We show that, in any frame, the proposed proportional-loss scheduler guarantees QoS if there is any scheduler which guarantees QoS. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm performs better than previous works. Index Terms—OFDMA, QoS, delay bound, loss probability, proportional-loss. I...|$|E

After recognizing the pattern, its advantage is taken by moving towards a lower cost point, using an acceleration factor for faster convergence. The step length is adjusted as we proceed to expedite improvement.

From our study of a panel of more than 8, 000 non-financial affiliates in Germany, we find only small effects of the tax rate of the foreign parent. However, our empirical results show that subsidiaries that on average are profitable react more strongly {{to changes in the}} German corporate tax rate than this is the case for less profitable firms. This gives support to the frequent concern that high German taxes are partly responsible for the high levels of intra-company loans. Taxation, however, does not fully explain the high levels of intra-company borrowing.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the flexibility of}} multinational firms to use income-shifting strategies within a tax year to react to operating losses. First, we develop an analytical model that considers how affiliate losses can be adjusted by using the transfer prices of tangible and intangible assets, as well as internal debt shifting, either by ex-post (i. e., {{by the end of}} the tax year) or ex-ante income shifting (i. e, before the current tax year). Our model predicts that, due to income shifting, multinational firms report lower profits when running profits, and lower <b>losses</b> when <b>running</b> <b>losses,</b> compared to domestic firms. It also suggests that under ex-post income shifting, loss affiliates have lower transfer prices and internal leverage than profitable affiliates, whereas under ex-ante income shifting, affiliates feature the same transfer prices and internal capital structure, regardless of making losses. Second, using data on direct transfer payments and internal debt of Norwegian affiliates, we find empirical evidence that, under losses, transfer pricing gives substantial flexibility to adjust income shifting ex post. In contrast, we do not find evidence for flexibility in the use of internal debt to shift income ex post. We contribute to the literature that neglecting the precautionary income-shifting behavior of potential loss affiliates underestimates the sensitivity of tax rates to transfer payments and to internal debt, whenever some ex-ante income shifting is present...|$|R
