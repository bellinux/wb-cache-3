25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a mid-mounted engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge magnesium alloy panels glued and riveted {{together and to}} three steel bulkheads. The monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat and the engine {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to the rearmost bulkhead. The gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and the rear bulkhead. The front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> – and the steering column were attached to the two bulkheads in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|E

Radius rods are also sometimes used in aircraft with fixed (non retractable) undercarriages.|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} {{locomotion}} control strategies for a novel multi-legged spherical robot. The conceptual robot, named Robotic All-Terrain Surveyor (RATS), has a spherical body {{roughly the size}} of a soccer ball, with 12 legs equally distributed over its surface. The legs are pneumatic linear actuators, which are oriented such that their axes of motion are normal {{to the surface of the}} sphere. The objective of this robot is to be capable to circumvent complex obstacles and traps through rough terrain. The 12 legged spherical version of the robot is still on its design phase and no prototype has been built yet. Instead, a simpler planar prototype of the robot is available to study the control problem. The planar robot consists of a wheel with 5 legs pointing radially, that rotates freely over the main axis of a <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> that constraints its motion into a plane. The air-cylinders run on compressed air which is supplied over a tether that goes through the <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b> This work presents novel control strategies for the RATS planar roboti...|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> configuration, incorporating anti-squat characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung weight. Rear hub carriers were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for toe-in and camber adjustments.|$|R

50|$|The {{channel section}} chassis had {{suspension}} by leaf springs {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius rods provided axle location and anti-roll properties.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} used {{very tall}} uprights with the wheel spindles {{on one side}} and a short stub axle extending inwards on the other. Springing was by vertically mounted coil-over-damper units mounted inboard and operated through rocker-style upper arms. The lower arms were conventional wide-based wishbones made of a one-piece wishbone and long <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> running back towards the bulkhead. Steering was rack-and-pinion mounted high, at the same level as the upper wishbone.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was mounted}} between the wings on central struts {{above and below}} and was circular in cross-section, tapering towards the tail. The horizontal tail surfaces were rectangular, and the rudder and wide chord fin formed a shallow triangle. There were two cockpits, seating the pilot under the wing and the gunner further aft with a large radiator between them. The 260 hp (120 kW) water-cooled Canton-Unné X-9 radial engine gave the HF.30A a short nose. Its simple conventional undercarriage had a single mainwheel on each main leg and <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 701's rear {{suspension}} {{was a relatively}} conservative twin link and <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> system, with coilover spring and damper units mounted outboard of the car's bodywork, in the airflow. Double wishbone suspension was employed for the front wheels, which Herd described as [...] "slightly unconventional for a current formula 1 car", again with the spring and damper units mounted outboard. Herd attributed his choice of the double wishbone system to a desire to overcome the suspension geometry compromises necessary to accommodate the increasingly wide front tyres of contemporary Formula One, while outboard shock absorbers - despite aerodynamic disadvantages - provided advantages in simplicity, cooling and stress management.|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} this is the German V200 design and its many {{international}} derivatives. The need to arrange the bogie suspension around the drive shafts led to an unusual bogie design with <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> rather than hornblocks and so prominently visible wheels and rims.|$|E
50|$|The fixed-length {{driveshaft}} as {{the upper}} suspension link remained, but the lower wishbone became a fabricated steel box section {{with a much}} wider base.

5000|$|Independent {{front wheel}} {{springing}} was {{provided in the}} form of parallel links with coil springs, <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and torsion bar damping.

50|$|The {{lower link}} {{itself is not}} {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|E
40|$|The {{blue coral}} reef {{asteroid}} Linckia laevigata (Linnaeus) makes up conspicuous adult-only populations on shallow reef flat habitats {{in the tropical}} Indo-West-Pacific. Monthly year-round census showed a consistent unimodal size-frequency distribution, with mean <b>arm</b> <b>radius</b> for the population fluctuating from 93. 8 to 99. 4 mm, at Asan reef flat, Guam, Mariana Islands. This census failed to detect a significant influx of smaller individuals within the population. Searching efforts for this and other asteroids yielded only three pretransformation-stage juveniles and less than 10 transforming young (with <b>arm</b> <b>radius</b> of approximately 50 mm) during a 3 -year period (1972 through 1974), {{in spite of the}} omnipresence of adults.

Laboratory-grown juveniles attained a mean <b>arm</b> <b>radius</b> of 13. 9 mm, 14 months after metamorphosis (15 months after spawning).

50|$|To {{be really}} successful, the MacPherson strut {{required}} {{the introduction of}} unitary construction, because it needs a substantial vertical space and a strong top mount, which unibodies can provide, while benefiting them by distributing stresses. The strut will usually carry both the coil spring on which the body is suspended and the shock absorber, which is usually {{in the form of}} a cartridge mounted within the strut (see coilover). The strut can also have the steering arm built into the lower outer portion. The whole assembly is very simple and can be preassembled into a unit; also by eliminating the upper control arm, it allows for more width in the engine compartment, which is useful for smaller cars, particularly with transverse-mounted engines such as most front wheel drive vehicles have. It can be further simplified, if needed, by substituting an anti-roll bar (torsion bar) for the <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b> For those reasons, it has become almost ubiquitous with low cost manufacturers. Furthermore, it offers an easy method to set suspension geometry.|$|R
40|$|The opacity of {{foreground}} spiral disks can be probed {{from the}} number of distant galaxies seen through them. To calibrate this number for effects other than the dust extinction, Gonzalez et al (1998) developed the "Synthetic Field Method". A synthetic field is an extincted Hubble Deep Field added to the science field. The relation between the dimming and the number of retrieved synthetic galaxies calibrates the number found in the science field. Here I present results from counts in 32 HST/WFPC 2 fields. The relation between opacity and <b>radius,</b> <b>arm</b> and disk, surface brightness and HI are presented. The opacity is found to be caused by a clumpy distribution of clouds in the disk. The brighter parts of the disk -the center and arms- are also the more opaque ones. The dust distribution in spiral disks is found to be more extended than the stellar disk. A comparison between HI column densities and opacity shows little relation between the two.

50|$|The device {{consisted}} of three primary components, an index arm, a radial arm and a graduated chord. The three were arranged in a triangle as in {{the image on the}} right. A telescopic sight was mounted on the index arm. At the point of rotation of the radial arm, a single mirror was mounted. This point of rotation allowed the angle between the index arm and the radial arm to be changed. The graduated chord was connected to {{the opposite end of the}} radial arm and the chord was permitted to rotate about the end. The chord was held against the distant end of the index arm and slid against it. The graduations on the chord were uniform and, by using it to measure the distance between the ends of the index arm and the radial arm, the angle between those arms could be determined. A table of chords was used to convert a measurement of distance to a measurement of angle. The use of the mirror resulted in the measured angle being twice the angle included by the index and the <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
