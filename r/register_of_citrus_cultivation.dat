We identified a suite of odorants that activated the ORNs with high specificity and sensitivity, which may be useful in eliciting behavior such as attraction. In separate experiments, we also identified odorants that evoked prolonged ORN responses and antagonistic odorants able to suppress neuronal responses to activators, both of which can be useful in lowering attraction to hosts. In field trials, we tested the electrophysiologically identified activating odorants and identified a 3 -odor blend that enhances trap catches by ∼ 230 %.

Mechanical harvest would increase labor productivity and benefits of growers. Efficiency of these machines depends on the varieties and operating conditions. Use of abscission chemicals has been promoted to increase the detachment rate of fruit without affecting its quality. This work is aimed at studying whether the mechanical harvest and/or the application of an abscission agent affect {{the quality and quantity}} of harvested fruit and tree defoliation under the conditions <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Spain. Trials were made in a completely randomized experimental design. From 2008 to 2011, different orchards of mandarin and orange trees were sprayed with different doses of ethephon as abscission agent and harvested with a trunk shaker. Harvest related variables (detachment percentage, defoliation and fruit without calyx) were measured. The percentage of fruit detached by the trunk shaker ranged between 70 and 85 % and it did not depend on the orchard. The shaker produced minimal damage to the bark when gripped incorrectly. Increased doses of ethephon increased fruit detachment except in ‘Clemenules’ orchard, but also increased the fruit without calyx in 1 - 9 %. Moreover, ethephon promoted significant defoliation. Neither gummosis nor death of branches was observed. This work demonstrates that mechanical harvesting with trunk shakers may be a feasible solution for citrus cultivated in Spain for fresh market. Use of ethephon could only be recommended for citrus destined to industry and only for certain varieties...|$|R

Seventy-two laying hens, approximately twelve months old, were assigned into 6 experimental groups of twelve hens each. One of the groups served as control (C) and was given a commercial basal diet, without bioflavonoid supplementation, whereas the other five groups were given the same diet further supplemented with hesperidin at low (750 mg/kg of feed) (H 1) or high (1500 mg/kg) (H 2) concentration or naringin at low (750 mg/kg) (N 1) or high (1500 mg/kg) (N 2) concentration or α-tocopheryl acetate (200 mg/kg) (E). Measurements of yolk antioxidant capacity were performed on 8 eggs from each dietary group, at 0, 4, 7, 28 and 63 days after the beginning of the experiment. Yolk cholesterol level was determined on the final day (63 th) of the experimental period. Oxidative stability of egg yolk, expressed as ng MDA/g yolk, was significantly improved in the hesperidin and naringin groups even from the first four days of the supplementation period (P< 0. 001).

Fourty-four male Chios lambs were randomly assigned to 4 groups. One of the groups served as control (C) and was given a basal diet, whereas the other 3 groups were given the same diet further supplemented with hesperidin at 2500 mg (H), or naringin at 2500 mg (N), or α-tocopheryl acetate at 200 mg (E) per kg feed. At the end of the experiment (35 th day), lambs were fasted, weighed and slaughtered. After overnight chilling, samples of longissimus thoracis muscle were taken and were used for meat quality evaluation. No significant differences were observed in final body weight, body weight gain and edible organ weights among the four experimental groups. pH, colour parameters (L, a*, b*), water holding capacity and shear force value of longissimus thoracis muscle were also not significantly influenced by the dietary treatments. Measurement of lipid oxidation values showed that hesperidin or naringin supplementation positively influenced meat antioxidant properties during the refrigerated storage at 4 °C for up to 8 days, however to a lesser extent compared to α-tocopheryl acetate. Nowadays, there is a strong interest in isolating antioxidants from natural sources and using them in animal nutrition with the intention to minimize lipid oxidation in meat products. According to the findings of the present study, flavonoids appeared as a great alternative, since they resulted in an improvement of meat antioxidant capacity leading to a prolongation of its shelf-life and an increase of its acceptability in the market...|$|R

Being quite densely populated the island has 409 persons per square kilometer, that is about double the population density of the Japan. Its arable land amount to 3, 551. 24. hectares, 47. 4 of the total area, but the land being hilly, the degree of land utilization for cultivation is low, only 33. 7 ares per family in average. Therfore farming based on rice and wheat crops present no bright future for the population of the island. Furthermore the sericulture and tobacco culture have become less popular among the people after the Second World War and now they are being replasced by the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> fruits. (2) The climate as well as the soil of the island and other surrounding condition are more suitable to the <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation.</b> The history <b>of</b> the <b>citrus</b> industry is traced back to 100 years ago when the plant was introduced to Hikuma Village and it has now become a big centers of the industry in Yamaguti Prefecture. (3) The <b>citrus</b> industry <b>of</b> the island had well developed up until the Second World War,but during the War it greatly declined being deemed as an unnecessary and non urgent industry in addition to the lack of labor and operration materials. But after the War the industry recovered gradually its activity and redevelopment. At present the total area of the land for the industry has increased to 850 hectares, 21 % of the whole arable land and the number of families engaged in it amounts to 6, 000, 70 % of the total and the fruit has now become the most important marketable commodity for the farmers of the island. The species cultivated are mostly Uushu mandarin with small quantity of navel orange and Natsu-daidai. (4) Recently 100, 000 plants are being planted annually. In the selection of the plant land however, it is important to choose the places where are less affected by typhoons, and with thick surface soil, good drainage with ground inclination less than 30 degrees.

40|$|Introduction: Land use in {{the overall}} concept {{is said to be}} the type of using land in the current {{situation}} which contains all users in different sectors of agriculture, natural resources and the industry. Protecting land use is as follows: “Prevent the change of application of certain lands by their owners, if their change has negative natural, economic, political, cultural, or scientific effects”. Change of application of land is certainly the most important factor that will affect the protection of natural ecosystems. Thus, it is imperative to consider the importance of land use change from the perspective of environmental, economic, social and finally, its important aspects such as food security and the lack of planning for its realization and the changes that occur in these sectors. Factors affecting the development of land use change should be considered to finally be able to apply appropriate policies and strategic principles to reduce its negative effects. Materials and Methods:Thestudy’s data and information were obtained by simple random sampling and through interviews and 60 questionnaires that were completed by farmers and rice farmers of Tonekabon city that all or part of their land use had been changed and the datahadbeen collected in 2012. For investigating the factors affecting agricultural land use changes, the Tobit model of Heckman’s two-step was used. In this paper, the relationship between the factors that influence decision to change land use and actions to land use change were investigated. The variables including family size, literacy, experience, number <b>of</b> garden plots, <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation,</b> kiwi cultivation, the price per square meter of garden land, the price per kilograms <b>of</b> horticultural crops (<b>citrus),</b> the price per kilograms of horticultural products (kiwi), number of pieces of agricultural land, cultivated level, the price per kilograms of crop, the price per square meter of agricultural land, satisfaction of supporting institutions and garden and agricultural insurance were used in this study. Results and Discussion: The estimated Probit model’s marginal effects showed that the variables <b>of</b> literacy, experience, <b>citrus</b> and kiwi <b>cultivation,</b> number of garden plots, the price per kilograms of horticultural products (kiwi), cultivated level, and the price per square meter of agricultural land have been positive signs that indicate a positive impact of these variables on the decision to change the use of land. The estimated linear regression model showed that the variables of number <b>of</b> garden plots, <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation,</b> kiwi cultivation, the price per kilograms <b>of</b> horticultural crops (<b>citrus),</b> number <b>of</b> pieces of agricultural land, cultivated level and garden and agricultural insurance have been positive signs that indicate the positive impact of these variables on the action to change the use of land. Due to significant coefficients of the quantitative variables that influence the rate of change in land use, <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> fruits is dedicated to most positive effects. As well, satisfaction of supporting institutions also has the most negative role as a dummy variable. Conclusion: The issues of land use change, prevention of land destruction and preservation of land, are of the main challenges in recent years. In this paper, we investigated the factors affecting change in land use by using a survey of 60 farmers in Tonekabon and the two-step Tobit model (Heckman) in 2012. The result of the Probit model showed that literacy levels, experience, number ofhorticulturalland pieces, area of citrusandkiwi,the price ofhorticultural products(kiwi), crop area and price ofland hada positive effect andhouseholdsize, price ofhorticultural land, price ofhorticultural products(citrus), number ofagricultural land price, and averageprice ofcrop, the satisfaction level of support in situations, horticultural and agricultural insurance had negative effects on thedecisionofchanging agriculturallandtohorticultural.

40|$|Citrus is a {{valuable}} fruit crop in world trade. Citrus Black Spot (CBS), caused by Guignardia citricarpa Kiely, is a fungal disease <b>of</b> <b>citrus.</b> It occurs in many citrus producing countries including parts of Australia and South Africa, {{but it does not}} occur in the countries of the European Union (EU) or the United States of America (USA). To prevent the introduction of CBS, the EU and the USA have phytosanitary regulations that restrict the import <b>of</b> <b>citrus</b> fruit from areas where CBS is found. This study uses two bioclimatic modelling approaches — CLIMEX and response surface modelling — to predict which areas have climates suitable for CBS to establish. The work focuses on the <b>citrus</b> growing areas <b>of</b> South Africa and Europe, but {{other parts of the world}} are also considered. As CBS is dependent on <b>citrus,</b> geographical areas <b>of</b> global <b>citrus</b> production are also mapped, and models are used to predict which areas of South Africa have climates suitable for <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation</b> under current and future climates. The potential impacts of climate change on CBS distribution in South Africa are also estimated. Results indicate that under current and future climates many areas in South Africa where citrus is not currently grown have a climate suitable for <b>citrus</b> <b>cultivation,</b> but most <b>of</b> these areas are also climatically favourable for CBS. <b>Of</b> the current <b>citrus</b> producing areas in South Africa, only the Northern and Western Cape Provinces are predicted to be unsuitable for CBS. Under climate change scenarios, some <b>citrus</b> production areas <b>of</b> Western Cape are predicted to become suitable for CBS, but the greater part of the Northern Cape will remain climatically unsuitable for the establishment of CBS in future. The climates <b>of</b> several CBS-free <b>citrus</b> producing areas around the world, such as Mexico, and Florida and Texas (USA) are suitable for CBS. However, European climate is unfavourable for CBS establishment, and provided importing countries comply to minimum standards, phytosanitary restrictions on the import of fruit from CBS infected areas may be unnecessary. This study is the first of its kind in citriculture, and in South Africa it is one of the few studies that investigates the effects of climate change on the potential distribution of a plant pathogen. Bioclimatic modelling was found to be a very useful means to combine complex data in order to make predictions relevant to Pest Risk Assessments.
