Activities within MIND concentrate on the development, optimisation and harmonisation of the appropriate layers involved. The physical (PHY) layer was chosen to base on the High Performance <b>Radio</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> type 2 standard (HiperLAN 2).

40|$|A {{quality control}} method for {{combined}} online monitoring of weather radar antenna pointing biases and receiver calibration using solar signals detected by an operational radar is adapted for application to midrange radar data (80 - 150 km). As the original method was developed using long-range data, additional criteria based on robust statistical estimators are imposed {{in the sun}} signature detection and selection process, allowing to discard observations biased by ground clutter or precipitation and to remove very influential outliers. The validity ranges of the physical model describing the solar interferences detected by the scanning radar antenna are explicitly defined and an equation for estimation of the effective scanning width in reception is provided in a thorough theoretical derivation.

40|$|Abstract—A {{simple and}} {{computationally}} inexpensive analytical {{approach to the}} evaluation of the short-term fading depth dependence on system bandwidth and environment characteristics is proposed. The approach, accounting for the maximum difference in propagation path length and having the Rice factor as a parameter, is derived from fitting simulated data from a model in the literature. Application examples are presented for global system for mobile communications (GSM), universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS), high-performance <b>radio</b> <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (HIPERLAN), and mobile broadband systems (MBS), which give some insight into the fading depth observed under different conditions regarding system bandwidth and environment characteristics. Macro, micro, and picocell environments are considered. In the microcellular environment, the fading depth experienced by UMTS is below the one for GSM by 0. 1 to 5. 5 dB, while in the picocellular one, the difference between GSM and UMTS is not significant, being almost independent of environment characteristics. When considering HIPERLAN or systems with larger bandwidths, the fading depth, both in micro and picocellular environments, is smaller than the one verified by UMTS; however, there is an increased dependence on environment characteristics. In the macrocellular environment, the fading depth experienced by UMTS is about 6 to 11 dB below the one for GSM. Hence, different short-term fading margins should be considered for each system and working environment.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensor technologies have prompted {{a new vision}} {{of the world in which}} we live. As witnesses the effects of Moore's law, which are evident in many aspects of innovative technical opportunity, such as cost, size, capacity, bandwidth, etc. These advances allow us to build new types of human-computer-environment interaction in augmented physical spaces. Ideally, mobile computing devices can go with people so that they can access information on the move as being constantly connected to the digital space. Sensor technologies enable mobile computing devices to sense their users and environments. This increases the interaction bandwidth between a human and a mobile computing device. The development of context-sensitive mobile computing systems requires considerable engineering skills. None of the existing approaches provides an effective means of obtaining location and environmental information using "standard" hardware and software. This raises the entry level of discovering more about this type of interaction to the designers. In addition, it is important to stress that relatively little is known about the usability problems that might arise from interaction with these different context-sensitive mobile computing applications. The focus of this thesis is on the development of a prototyping environment for context-sensitive mobile computing. This thesis makes two contributions. The most significant contribution is the presentation of the Glasgow Context Server (GCS). It has been specifically designed to address the concerns mentioned above. It successfully integrates an off-the-shelf <b>radio</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (LAN) with the infrared sensors that have been a feature of many previous context-sensitive mobile computing applications. The GCS is intended to help interface designers validate the claimed benefits of location sensing, location disclosing and environment sensing applications. The second contribution is the working applications, in particular, a web-based annotation system for physical objects and a shopping assistant built upon the GCS environment. These demonstrations are used to evaluate the GCS approach and point out the challenging issues in computing technology as well as usability concern. The hope is that this research can provide interface designers with an in-depth reference to a prototyping environment for context-sensitive mobile computing applications...|$|E

This feature makes the collision detection techniques in radio networks different from cabled networks. The active signalling feature of the radio LAN standard HIPERLAN provides an efficient channel access mechanism.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of a multiple element antenna system in an indoor environment based on the measurements taken in the Lucent Bell Labs building in Crawford Hill, NJ, with a system of 12 transmitters and 15 receivers. In particular, we investigate the capacity behavior with respect to the polarization of the transmitting/receiving elements and the distance between the transmitting and the receiving arrays. The analysis of the power rolloff versus distance clearly demonstrates the different propagation characteristics of the horizontally versus the vertically polarized electric fields. Under strong line-ofsight (LOS) conditions (hallway environment), the power of the horizontally polarized waves falls off faster with distance than that of the vertically polarized fields. Also, the cross-polarization coupling is about 15 dB. Under nonline-of-sight (NLOS) conditions (labs), both polarizations display similar rolloff behavior with distance and the cross-polarization coupling is about 0 dB. There is a power loss of at least 15 dB under NLOS conditions relative to LOS conditions. The average received signal power affects the system capacity. In the hallway, horizontally polarized systems achieve lower capacities than their vertically polarized counterparts. Also the achievable capacity in the labs is much lower than that in the hallway, because of the lower average received power. The comparison of single polarization systems to hybrid polarization systems shows that combined polarization systems perform better in terms of achievable capacity. Therefore, there lies an advantage in using both electric field polarizations. However, under strong LOS conditions the channel itself inherently limits the capacity behavior of the system.

40|$|The {{field of}} digital signal {{processing}} {{grew out of the}} flexibility afforded by the use of digital computers in implementing signal processing algorithms and systems. It has since broadened into the use of a variety of both digital and analog technologies, spanning a broad range of applications, bandwidths, and realizations. The Digital Signal Processing group carries out research on algorithms for signal processing and their applications. Current application areas of interest include signal enhancement and active noise cancellation; speech, audio and underwater acoustic signal processing; advanced beamforming for radar and sonar systems; and signal processing and coding for wireless and broadband multiuser communication networks. In some of our recent work, we have developed new methods for signal enhancement and noise cancellation with single or multisensor measurements. We have also been developing new methods for representing and analyzing fractal signals. This class of signals arises {{in a wide variety of}} physical environments and also has potential in problems involving signal design. We are also exploring potential uses of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory of signal design and analysis. Another emphasis is on structuring algorithms for approximate processing and successive refinement. In other research, we are investigating applications of signal and array processing to ocean and structural acoustics and geophysics. These problems require the combination of {{digital signal processing}} tools with a knowledge of wave propagation to develop systems for short time spectral analysis, wavenumber spectrum estimation, source localization, and matched field processing. We emphasize the use of real-world data from laboratory and field experiments such as the Heard Island Experiment for Acoustic Monitoring of Global Warming and several Arctic acoustic experiments conducted on the polar ice cap. A major application focus of the group involves signal processing and coding for wireless multiuser systems and broadband communication networks. Specific interests include commercial and military mobile <b>radio</b> <b>networks,</b> wireless <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> and personal communication systems, digital audio and television broadcast systems, and multimedia networks. Along with a number of other directions, we are currently exploring new code-division multiple- access (CDMA) strategies, new techniques for exploiting antenna arrays in wireless systems, and new methods for modeling and management of traffic in high-speed packet-switched networks.
