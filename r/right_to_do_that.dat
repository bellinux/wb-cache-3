500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
