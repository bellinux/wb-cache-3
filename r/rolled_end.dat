50|$|In {{practice}} for the ARCA 200 race at Daytona International Speedway on 7 February 1985 while traveling at an estimated 195 miles per hour, Affleck got his car sideways between turns 1 & 2, went airborne, and barrel <b>rolled</b> <b>end</b> over end at least 7 or 8 times. The protective window netting on his car failed and Affleck was thrown partially {{out of his car}} and sustained head and neck injuries after being pinned under his Ford. He was survived by Kathleen, his wife of 15 years, and two sons. Affleck's crash also changed the way that the protective window nettings are constructed on both NASCAR and ARCA cars to this very day. Francis Affleck became the first ARCA driver to be fatally injured at the Daytona International Speedway in its then 26-year history, and the first driver to be killed at the track since Ricky Knotts in 1980.|$|E

5000|$|The Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express aircraft, {{owned by}} the USAAF and {{operated}} using a United Airlines crew, was transferring Japanese men, women and children of the Consular Corps, to exchange for Allied POWs. On 2 August 1943, it took off from Whenuapai Aerodrome runway 04 at 2:20 am, with rain and fog conditions at minimums for departure, and quickly passed through low stratus. Captain Herschel Laughlin’s gyro horizon had inadvertently been left caged [...] - [...] while the instrument displayed level flight, the aircraft entered a steepening bank to the left. The crew detected the problem in a few seconds, but as the aircraft was straightening up and levelling out, it hit the ground at about 322 km/h, bounced {{a few times and}} exploded. The third bounce threw its first officer, R. John Wisda, out through the canopy; he <b>rolled</b> <b>end</b> over end about 100 m through mud and reeds. A medic later found him trying to keep warm near a burning tyre. The major factors of the accident were the lack of a pre-flight checklist, and crew fatigue (126 flying hours in the last 26 days).|$|E

30|$|Roll {{flattening}} is {{an important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll flattening calculation. However, the roll flattening calculated by traditional flattening models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll flattening, a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll flattening are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an transition coefficient, and the distribution rules of roll flattening for different rolling force, flattening width, roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to <b>roll</b> <b>end</b> and the <b>roll</b> diameter as variable to fit the transition coefficient, the new model of roll flattening is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the transition coefficient is fitted to establish the model. Compared with the traditional models, the new model can effectively improve the calculation deviation in the <b>roll</b> <b>end,</b> which has important significance for accurate simulation of plate shape, especially for the distribution of rolling force between rolls.|$|R

50|$|The FACIT ECM 64, {{manufactured}} by Swedish company Facit AB, is {{a prototype of}} carousel memory. To avoid having a single, long magnetic tape, it instead has 64 small rolls of 9 meters each, with 1.6-cm wide tape on each roll, divided into 8 channels per roll. The tape speed is 5 m/s. To read a particular roll, the carousel rotates so the desired <b>roll</b> <b>ends</b> up at the bottom. A counterweight sits at the free end of the tape, and facilitates the roll in moving out and down into a mechanism with a read-and-write head. The tape is then rewound. The average seek time is 2 seconds and the storage space is 2560 kilobytes. The control system is operated by transistors. Both the carousel and individual spools are replicable.|$|R
50|$|Neckerchiefs worn by sailors {{are shaped}} like a square, and are folded in half diagonally before rolling, with rolling {{occurring}} {{from the tip of}} the resulting triangle to its hypotenuse.

The <b>rolled</b> <b>ends</b> then pass around the neck until they meet in front of it, where they are secured together, either with a knot, such as a reef knot or a slip knot, or with a rubber band or other fastener (called a woggle or neckerchief slide) and allowed to hang. A slip knot (vs. a simple reef or square knot) will give way if the neckerchief gets caught and is thus less likely to choke the wearer.|$|R
