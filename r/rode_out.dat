5|$|In Taiwan, {{the threat}} of Fanapi forced the closure of rail lines and {{cancellation}} of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport, and at least 156flights were canceled. The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close, thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants. Many boats <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the storm at port.

Onshore, officials closed {{a portion of}} Highway 1 {{as well as other}} roads in the area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes, as well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production. About 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the Guam National Weather Service {{issued a}} typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, {{as well as}} a high surf {{advisory}} for Guam.

Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system. During the storm, there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored. On Alamagan where the storm struck, six people <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the storm in a concrete bunker.|$|E

5|$|In León {{near where}} it moved ashore in Nicaragua, {{the passage of}} Alma left the city without power. Several {{buildings}} were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of León and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable, and another person died in a similar manner. Offshore, one person drowned when he <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the storm in his boat. In Tegucigalpa, TACA Flight 390 skidded off a runway sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty. One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in a raging stream.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, about 21,800fishing boats in the Chinese province of Hainan returned to port, and about 120,000people evacuated from fish farms and low-lying areas on the island. Officials halted ferry service between Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong province. Offshore, 56fishermen <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the storm in a shelter on the Paracel Islands; 38people were rescued shortly after the storm, and initially eighteen people were reported missing. The eighteen missing fishermen were found thirty hours after Neoguri struck. The ship they were on had sunk, and the crew clung to debris and made makeshift rafts {{to survive in the}} waters. However, another 18 Chinese fisherman and 22 Vietnamese fisherman remain missing. On Hainan island, the storm left the city of Wenchang without power.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1871 Alma <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> a typhoon in Yokohama. She was {{relieved}} by Belliqueuse on 1 August 1872 and reached Toulon on 16 January 1873. The ship {{was assigned to}} the Evolutionary Squadron on 8 October 1873. She was in reserve in Cherbourg from 1876 to 1881. Alma recommissioned on 1 March 1881 and {{was assigned to the}} Levant Squadron. From 6–16 July 1881 the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax as part of the French occupation of Tunisia. She was reduced to reserve in Cherbourg on 8 January 1883. The ship was condemned on 12 March 1886, but Alma was not sold until May 1893 for 129,000 francs.|$|E

5|$|Operation Crossroads {{began with}} the first blast (Test Able), an air burst on 1 July 1946; Nagato was not close to ground zero and was only lightly damaged. For Test Baker, an {{underwater}} explosion, the ship was positioned closer to ground zero. Nagato <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July. Opened to divers in 1996, The Times has named Nagato {{as one of the top}} 10 wreck diving sites in the world.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida {{subsequent to the}} discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all small craft to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range missiles from Cape Canaveral. Fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for safety on two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the hurricane. Small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} Emily {{prompted}} hurricane warnings {{for much of}} the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware. A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000people during the busy Labor Day weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10million (1993USD). About 1,600residents on these islands <b>rode</b> <b>out</b> the storm in their homes, and emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives, causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal. Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily's path, there were also evacuations from the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Fire Island in New York.|$|E
