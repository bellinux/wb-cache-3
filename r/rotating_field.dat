25|$|The {{design of}} AC {{induction}} and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC {{to produce a}} rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the <b>rotating</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a one sided flux magnet is a refrigerator magnet. These are usually composed of powdered ferrite in a binder such as plastic or rubber. The extruded magnet is exposed to a <b>rotating</b> <b>field</b> giving the ferrite particles in the magnetic compound a magnetization resulting in a one-sided flux distribution. This distribution increases the holding force of the magnet when placed on a permeable surface, compared to the holding force from, say, a uniform magnetization of the magnetic compound.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a <b>rotating</b> <b>field</b> without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E

The convective flows which arise {{as a function of}} these driving parameters are identified. For small magnetic field strengths, a region of stationary flow is observed. This region is bounded by critical values of the Rayleigh and Hartmann numbers. As the <b>rotating</b> magnetic <b>field</b> is increased, the critical Rayleigh number can increase by more than a factor of 10.
