5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would allow her {{to work on a}} larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various <b>races</b> <b>of</b> maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of <b>Races</b> <b>of</b> Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.|$|E

Gené along with team-mate Muller failed to get through to the second part of qualifying for the <b>Race</b> <b>of</b> UK, he then had all his times disallowed because the engine speed sensor of his car's data logging system was disconnected and he dropped {{to the back of the}} grid as a result. He was involved in an incident at the first chicane in <b>race</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>Race</b> <b>of</b> Germany and he retired on the second lap. Gené dropped out <b>of</b> contention in <b>race</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>Race</b> <b>of</b> Italy on the opening lap. He triggered an accident when he hit Huff's Chevrolet Cruze under braking, Huff lost control and made contact with Rickard Rydell who then hit Gené and Farfus. He had to sacrifice his position in <b>race</b> two <b>of</b> the <b>Race</b> <b>of</b> Japan in order to benefit championship contender Tarquini. He finished off the season at the <b>Race</b> <b>of</b> Macau with a podium in race one and was eighth in the drivers' championship.|$|R

5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical <b>races</b> <b>of</b> one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
