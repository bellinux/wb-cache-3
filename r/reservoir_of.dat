5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable.

5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, a chamber is constructed which {{is connected to}} a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass.

In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.|$|E

The game concludes as Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolve to find Riku and Mickey.|$|E
5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt {{was released from}} volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected {{enormous}} amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E
5|$|Rouffaer {{reported}} that the gringsing pattern was already known by the 12th century in Kediri, East Java. He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the canting, an etching tool that holds a small <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> hot wax, and proposed that the canting was invented in Java around that time. The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese Prajnaparamita statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins, similar to today's traditional Javanese jlamprang or ceplok batik motif. The motif is thought to represent the lotus, a sacred flower in Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the canting existed in 13th-century Java or even earlier.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini and Calvin Harris.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E
5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of the objects with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E
