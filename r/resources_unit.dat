Together with the channel access demand vector D and the CQI values for each <b>resource</b> <b>unit</b> of each user, the user serving vector is used to perform the adaptive and non-adaptive resource allocation according to the following strategy: First, the <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> of the adaptively served users are allocated, i.e., WPFS is applied over all Nru <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> taking into account only the UA adaptive users. By doing so, the diversity of all Nru <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> is exploited in the adaptive resource allocation process. However, the non-adaptively served users demand WNA <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> which have to be re-allocated from the adaptive users. As for non-adaptive users it is not important which <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> are allocated to them since the non-adaptive mode works independent from any CQI, WNA out of the Nru selected <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> with the lowest ratio between weighted instantaneous SNR and average SNR are re-allocated from the adaptive users to the non-adaptive users. By doing so, the best WA out of Nru <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> are selected for the adaptive users while the non-adaptive users still obtain their demanded number of <b>resource</b> <b>units.</b> Note {{that it is possible}} that an adaptive user u does not get access to exactly D [...]...|$|R

40|$|Multicast and {{broadcast}} service (MBS) {{is one of}} the important services for next-generation wireless systems. In WiMAX, the radio <b>resource</b> <b>unit</b> (i. e., time, frequency, code, etc.) for MBS is centralized allocated by an anchor access service network gateway (Anchor ASN-GW). In MBS, a BS can dynamically join or leave an MBS Zone due to the moving of MSs. The Anchor ASN-GW must allocate nonoverlapping radio <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> to BSs for delivering different MBS contents in overlapping MBS Zones. This paper presents radio resource allocation and reallocation algorithms to minimize the number of required <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> for overlapping MBS Zones. For a given number of MBS Zones, a resource estimation model is also presented to estimate the average number of radio <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> to be reserved by the ASN-GW. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithms can reduce the number of reallocations, and, thus, the signaling messages exchanged in the air interface and the core network are minimized. The results also showed that the proposed model {{can be used as a}} good reference for the network operator to estimate the average number of required radio <b>resource</b> <b>units</b> for a given number of MBS Zones. </p...|$|R
