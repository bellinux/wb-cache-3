5|$|Large and {{dangerous}} fires sometimes <b>resulted.</b> <b>On</b> 4 May 1897, {{one of the}} first major fires involving nitrate film began when a Lumière projector caught fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris; the resulting blaze caused 180 deaths. In the United States, a series of fires occurred at industry facilities. The Lubin Manufacturing Company's vault in Philadelphia exploded on 13 June 1914, followed on 9 December by a fire that destroyed Thomas Edison's laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey. The New York studio of the Famous Players Film Company burned in September 1915; in July 1920, the shipping facility of its corporate successor, Famous Players-Lasky, was destroyed by a fire in Kansas City, Missouri, despite construction intended to minimize that risk. The United Film Ad Service vault, also in Kansas City, burned on 4 August 1928, and a fire was reported at Pathé Exchange nine days later. In October 1929, the Consolidated Film Industries facility was badly damaged by a nitrate fire. Spontaneous combustion was not proven to have occurred in any of these fires; {{it is possible that the}} potential of nitrate film to self-ignite was not even recognized before 1933.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October, Baillet de Latour {{immediately}} lay {{the groundwork}} for a lengthy siege by ordering the construction of extensive earthworks around the bridgehead. The lines of contravallation (the trenches nearest to the French position) included a series of redoubts connected by trenches. Initially, the French considered these to be purely defensive and they were inclined to ignore the industrious Austrian diggers and focus instead on their own fortifications, which were sketchy and relied upon palisades unprotected by dirt; these could not withstand a vigorous attack until strengthened. After several days of strengthening their outer works by 30 October, several artillery pieces were brought up to augment the outer defense. In addition, released from the main army after the Battle of Schliengen, General Dessaix arrived to command the fortress and augment the garrison with his troops. Subsequently, French reconstruction of the fortress and its defensive lines increased. Several minor sorties against the Austrian lines <b>resulted.</b> <b>On</b> 14 November 1796, Dominique Vandamme, commanding a column of Dessaix's force, directed a small group of skirmishers and hussars to attack the most forward of the Austrian posts. This successful sortie took eighty Austrian prisoners. On 21 November, while the Austrians constructed their trenches on the right bank of the Kinzig, the French planned for a considerable sortie against the lines of contravallation between the Kinzig and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Soult was {{now free}} to {{continue}} his investment of Badajoz; although the town's garrison was now some 8,000 strong due to the influx of soldiers from Mendizabal's destroyed army, it eventually fell to the French on 11 March. Wellington then sent a large Anglo-Portuguese corps, commanded by Sir William Beresford, to retake the important fortress town, and by 20 April the second siege of Badajoz had begun. A French attempt to lift this siege <b>resulted,</b> <b>on</b> 16 May, in the bloody Battle of Albuera, in which Beresford's strong Allied corps maintained the siege but only barely managed to hold off an outnumbered French army, again commanded by Soult. However, when the French Army of Portugal, now {{under the command of}} Marshal Auguste Marmont, and the Army of the South converged, the combined French force of over 60,000 men forced Wellington, on 20 June, to call off the siege and pull his 44,000-man besieging army back to Elvas. Thus Badajoz would remain in French hands until the following year, when the Allies finally retook it following the Battle of Badajoz.|$|E

2500|$|According to Mexico's second census ever which {{considered}} race, made {{right after}} the Mexican revolution on 1921, 59% of Mexico's population was Mestizo, 29% was Indigenous and only 9% was European, with Mestizos being the most numerous ethno-racial group in almost all the states. For a long time this census' results have been taken as fact, with extraofficial international publications such as The World Factbook and Encyclopædia Britannica using them as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day. However, in recent time Mexican academics have subjected the census' results to scrutiny, claiming that such a drastic alteration on demographic trends {{in regards to the}} 1793 census is not possible and cite, among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.

2500|$|On 27-8 January 1806 {{captured}} [...] "sundry Smuggling Vessels". Hancock decoyed {{a number}} of smugglers off shore by disguising his ship as an American. He captured one cutter, which he used as a tender. He then sailed Cruizer and the cutter in the direction he thought most of the smugglers had sailed. Next morning he found four luggers and a cutter within easy reach and proceeded to capture them too. The tender captured two luggers, each with 1000 tubs of geneva, rum, and the like. In all, the haul included 26,000 gallons of spirits and a large quantity of tobacco, plus other contraband. The proceeds amounted to £2236 19s 7d, which the officers and crew shared. Despite this singular success against the smugglers, when Cruiser returned to port Hancock had to turn over command of Cruiser to Commander Pringle Stoddart. Unfortunately for Hancock, the battle of Trafalgar had taken place a few months earlier.

During these years the main field of work was the promotion of integrated coastal zone management in Europe, contributing to the EC Demonstration Programme on ICZM [...] (1996-1999). EUCC participated in the UNEP ICZM Conference of 1998 in St Petersburg [...] which recommended a demonstration programme to be launched on ICZM for Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. EUCC took the lead to organise in conjunction with UNEP’s PAP/RAC, the first intergovernmental ICZM meeting (ICMCEENIS), in Croatia in June 2000, bringing together representatives from 18 non EU coastal States and from the Regional Seas Programmes for the Eastern Mediterranean, Baltic, Caspian and Black Seas who expressed support common ICZM initiatives for their regions.

2500|$|Patras {{played a}} crucial role in the Greek War of Independence against the Ottomans (1821–29). The town was the first seat of the {{revolution}} along with the rest of Achaea and Mani. [...] Patras was at the time the biggest and most prosperous town of the Peloponnese. An overwhelming, 2/3 majority of the town's 18.000 inhabitants where Greeks, and a small number of them was engaged in commerce, constituting the precursors of a middle class. Moreover, due to the town's commercial importance, some wealthy merhants of Patras had been appointed consuls of the major European states. The consul of Russia Vlassopoulos was also a member of the Filiki Eteria. The atmosphere in Patras had been tense since the mid-February 1821, when the Greeks refused to pay heavy taxes for the equipment of the Ottoman Army which was fighting against Ali Pasha. In the same period, members of the Filiki Etairia were preparing the field for a revolt in Patras, accumulating munition, money and equipment for their struggle. Odysseas Androutsos was hiding in Patras and Makryiannis arrived there trying to bring in contact the protagonists of the incoming revolts and coordinate the revolutionary effort. The Turks, who grew suspicious of these movements, transferred their belongings to the fortress on February 28, and their families on March 18 and fortified themselves in it.

2500|$|The street {{violence}} in Germany had largely ceased {{in the period}} 13 April-15 June 1932 when the SA and SS had been banned, {{and it was only}} after Papen lifted the ban that street violence returned with a vengeance. [...] Riots <b>resulted</b> <b>on</b> the streets of Berlin, as a total of 461 battles between Communists and the SA took place, leading to 82 deaths on both sides. Papen took no responsibility for lifting the ban and blamed the Social Democratic Prussian minister-president Otto Braun for the violence, claiming with no real proof that Braun had ordered the Prussian police to support the Communists against the Nazis. Papen had been looking for a reason to take over Prussia right from the beginning of his Chancellorship, and only held back because he lacked a convincing excuse. On 11 July 1932, {{with the exception of the}} Labour Minister Schäffer, the entire cabinet voted to depose the Braun government provided that Papen could find a believable excuse, and on the next day, the Interior Minister Baron Wilhlem von Gayl found that excuse, reporting he heard a rumor that the Social Democrats and Communists were planning a merger. The fact that Social Democrats and Communists were engaging in street battles, which might suggest that this rumor was just that, was disregarded and Papen promptly visited Hindenburg at his estate at Neudeck to ask for and receive a decree allowing the Reich government to take over the Prussian government. In this meeting with Hindenburg, Papen did not talk much about the alleged plans for a SPD-KPD merger, instead saying that the decree was necessary because the Reich and Prussian governments should be headed by the same man as was the case in Imperial Germany. [...] On 20 July 1932, Papen launched a coup against the centre-left coalition government of Prussia, which was dominated by the Social Democrats (the so-called Preußenschlag). The use of the police apparatus in the Prussian [...] "coup" [...] on 20 July 1932 is described by historians Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle as [...] "the decisive breach on the path towards the Third Reich." [...] Berlin was put on military shutdown and Papen sent men to arrest the Prussian authorities, whom he accused with no evidence of being in league with the Communists. Hereafter, Papen declared himself commissioner of Prussia by way of an emergency decree which he elicited from Hindenburg, further weakening the democracy of the Weimar Republic. In Germany, the Reich government made laws, but the Länder governments were responsible for enforcing them as the Reich government had no police force of its own. When Prussia was ruled by Social Democrats, Paragraph 175, which made homosexuality illegal was not enforced as the SPD had long argued for the legalization of homosexuality. With the Preußenschlag, and with Papen serving as the Commissioner for Prussia, this changed as Papen ordered the Prussian police to start enforcing Paragraph 175 and to crack down on [...] "sexual immorality" [...] by banning nude bathing, pornography, and nude dancing together with a law ordering women not to wear [...] "suggestive" [...] clothing in public, though Papen did not ban soliciting by prostitutes as he had promised to. Despite his very acrimonious split with the Zentrum, Papen still had hopes of having the Zentrum support his government, and cracking on [...] "sexual immorality" [...] in Prussia offered a possible way of winning support from the Catholic church, which supported the Zentrum. But the same time, Papen wished to trade a full scale crackdown in exchange for the Zentrum supporting his government, which explained why Papen's crackdown was not as harsh as many Catholic conservatives would have liked. Papen had hopes in the summer of 1932 of attracting support in the Reichstag of a [...] "black-brown" [...] coalition of the Zentrum and the NSDAP.|$|E
