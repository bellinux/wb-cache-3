After each player has made their desired moves, the game shows any world events {{that affect the}} players (for instance, a labor strike will delay shipments of aircraft from that company, while the Olympic Games will boost traffic worldwide, particularly to the host city). The game then shows the results of direct competition between airlines flying the same routes, then the quarterly results of sales, expenses, profits, and passengers flown. After the January-March quarter of every year, it also shows annual results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: At {{the end of}} 1989 a new ticket issuing and {{collection}} system, including automatic gates at 63 busy central stations, was brought into full operation on the London Underground. One of the system's principal objectives, a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>fare</b> evasion, {{appears to have been}} achieved. The results of before-and-after surveys undertaken by the management of the Underground suggest that fare evasion has been cut by two-thirds and that the additional revenues generated should soon pay for the cost of installing the automatic gates. An analysis of ticket sales also indicates that the more recent installation in December 1991 of automatic gates at two suburban stations has been cost-effec-tive in terms of reduced fare evasion. It is concluded that further research should be directed to identifying other high-risk stations where installation of automatic gates might be cost-effective...|$|R

50|$|Labour's 1981 GLC {{manifesto}} {{commitment was}} to subsidise fares on all London Buses, London Underground and British Rail services in Greater London. This {{would cause a}} <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>fares</b> of approximately a third and cause a corresponding increase in the transport costs of the GLC. The funding for the change was planned {{to come from a}} 5% increase in local government rates. The subsidy to British Rail was blocked by central government, which restricted the policy to the buses and the London Underground. This also had the effect of restricting the GLC subsidy in many of London's 32 boroughs that were not served by the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the Bergen businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the Bergen mountains, electrification from Voss to Bergen, {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private financing would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a surcharge on tickets, equal to the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>fare</b> induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around Bergen were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt financing would have to compete with the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built. The cost was estimated at NOK 100 million.|$|R

40|$|In postwar Europe {{aviation}} {{markets were}} controlled by bilateral agreements which confined {{the market to}} one airline per country. The airlines charged the same fares and divided the markets. Economists from Adam Smith to William Baumol recommend that governments should not ban new entrants or otherwise prevent competition and {{the examination of the}} current state of European aviation in this paper confirms this policy prescription. European air fares are {{the highest in the world}} and Europe's share of world aviation is falling steadily. European airlines are characterised by high costs and low productivity. The economic rent from protectionism in the sector has been absorbed by a combination of high wage costs and productivity some 36 % lower than in North America. The paper then examines the impact of the deregulation of the Ireland/United Kingdom air services market in 1986. The results in terms of growth in a previously static market and <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>fares</b> have been dramatic beyond the expectations of proponents of deregulation.

If air transport improves their fuel efficiency {{in response to}} increase in jet fuel prices, then some of the increases {{in the cost of}} air travel can be reduced.

The business sustainability {{relies on a}} significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>fares</b> that would outperform other benefits, an earlier time of delivery above all.

This increasingly posed a greater risk to financial system than market failure, due to the increasing scale effects. Competition ceases to exist. The operations of markets first described by Adam Smith (1776) and confirmed by Alfred Marshall (1920). As a result of the increasing risk of governmental failure, legal barriers to "entry" removed (liberalization) and private ownership promoted (privatization). Here, we investigate the impact of the "liberalization processes of (private) " "Aegean Ferry System" since 2001, and look at the effect on passenger fares and private cars freight rates under "free entry".

40|$|The {{effects of}} “low-cost carriers” (LCCs) such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways on the {{competitive}} {{landscape of the}} U. S. airline industry have been thoroughly documented in the academic literature and the popular press. However, the more recent emergence of another distinct airline business model—the “ultra-low-cost carrier” (ULCC) —has received considerably less attention. By focusing on cost efficiencies and unbundled service offerings, the ULCCs {{have been able to}} undercut the fares of both traditional network and low-cost carriers in the markets they serve. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of ULCCs in the U. S. aviation industry and demonstrate how these carriers’ business models, costs, and effects on air transportation markets differ from those of the traditional LCCs. We first describe the factors that have enabled ULCCs to achieve a cost advantage over traditional LCCs and network legacy carriers. Then, using econometric models, we examine the effects of ULCC and LCC presence, entry, and exit on base airfares in 3, 004 U. S. air transportation markets from 2010 – 2015. We find that in 2015, ULCC presence in a market was associated with market base fares 21 % lower than average, as compared to an 8 % average reduction for LCC presence. We also find that while ULCC and LCC entry both result in a 14 % average <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>fares</b> one year after entry, ULCCs are three times as likely to abandon a market within two years of entry than are the LCCs. The results suggest that the ULCCs represent a distinct business model from traditional LCCs and that as the ULCCs grow, they will continue to play a unique and increasingly important role in the U. S. airline industry. members of the MIT Airline Industry Consortiu...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} ferry fares {{and quality}} of service to a remote island region and analyses how this affects {{the economy of the}} islands. Taking the Western Isles in Scotland as a case study, the paper identifies the links between fares, service, and economic development and attempts to quantify this impact. A new methodology is developed to estimate the impact of service frequency. The Western Isles, especially the more remote southern islands, face particular challenges due to their peripheral location relative to markets and supplies in Scotland, the rest of the UK and the European ‘core’. This manifests itself in terms of access to skilled labour, raw materials, connections to other businesses and customers. These economies are likely to experience higher transportation costs to domestic and international markets and may also be limited by the frequency and reliability of connections. The ferry services between islands and with mainland Scotland are vital to the continued economic and social well-being of the Western Isles. The extent of the contribution of ferry services towards the economic and social prosperity of the Isles is very much dependant upon the frequency, speed and reliability of service and on the fare structure. It is therefore vital to ensure that the correct <b>fare</b> mechanism is <b>in</b> place to ensure maximum benefit to the local economy of the Isles, in addition to satisfying value for money criteria for the taxpayer and commercial viability for the operators. Our findings show that a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ferry <b>fares</b> and, <b>in</b> particular in increase in service frequency, will have substantial income and employment benefits to the local economy, running into millions of pounds annually. It is also revealed that there is potential to increase the quality of service to the Isles, and reduce <b>fares</b> <b>in</b> some cases, with no increase in public subsidy towards operating costs. This is achieved by taking a more radical perspective to the routes and services operated, and by more closely matching service provision to the demands of communities within the islands. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry represents approximately 3 % of global greenhouse gas emissions, however with significant growth expected {{over the coming}} decades this proportion is expected to increase. Continued governmental and social pressure to reduce global emissions is posing a challenging question to the industry; how to improve environmental efficiency and reduce emissions with increasing industry growth. The environmental impact of aviation globally is discussed, examining the significant emissions and protocols that exist and their relative impacts both environmentally and economically. The viability of alternative biofuels is discussed, determining the life cycle environmental impact of future replacements to kerosene based jet fuel. This thesis therefore aims to provide {{an understanding of the}} fundamentals of aviation emissions but also most importantly provide possible solutions to assist the industry in reducing its emissions ‘footprint’. An important factor in determining efficiency improvements is to understand the impact of particular stages of an aircraft life and the impact they have individually. This was achieved using an established methodology called Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which is an efficient tool for the analytical consideration of the environmental impact of manufacturing, operation and decommissioning. The results of a comprehensive LCA study of an Airbus A 320 are documented considering all phases of the service life. The study draws useful conclusions, indicating the significance of special materials such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) on the total manufacturing emissions of the aircraft and indicating its operational phase as the one contributing most in its environmental performance breakdown. The thesis also examines short-term efficiencies for emissions <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> commercial aviation, focussing on improvements in aircraft routing. The initiation of the EU emissions trading system (ETS) within European aviation willincentivise airlines to reduce their annual CO 2 emissions. An alternative routing strategy is proposed for selected long haul routes, which introduces multiple stages into the route utilising two aircraft and is shown to reduce total CO 2 emissions by up to 13. 7 %. Combined with blended biofuel, this reduction was estimated to increase to 16. 6 % with a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ticket <b>fares</b> estimated to be as high as $ 19 per passenger per flight...|$|R

The data sets available relate solely to urban/suburban travel and to studies for which ITS had prime responsibility. The objectives of this re-analysis of previous bus users' SP data sets were to address the following issues: • How the sensitivity to cost varies with income, age and gender in addition to journey purpose. Analysis of the effect of income on the cost coefficient is essentially the same as analysis of how the value of time varies with income. • Whether there is a non-linear relationship between the sensitivity to fare and the level of fare. • Whether the sensitivity to fare varies according to whether the <b>fare</b> level <b>in</b> the SP exercise implied an increase or reduction on current levels. This would follow along the lines of similar analysis conducted on the sensitivity to time losses and gains in several recent value of time studies. • How the magnitude of the fare change impacts upon the sensitivity to cost.
