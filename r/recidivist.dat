His French colleague General Joubert was displeased with the radicals because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed Agenten were disturbed about the inefficiency of the Uitvoerend Bewind.

The two were found guilty of deliberately assigning Ursu to a cell where two <b>recidivist</b> and violent common criminals were serving time, and of having prevented their subordinates from intervening when the prisoner was being beaten. Three years earlier, Ursu's cell mate Marian Clită had declared his full responsibility for the murder, and had been sentenced to 20 years in prison (eventually commuted to eight years, of which he served two). Clită's move was seen by Olaru {{as an attempt to}} cover up for the officials later sentenced. Stănică and Creangă went into hiding for several months, and turned themselves in only after the Supreme Court reduced their sentences by one year. Their temporary flight and the Supreme Court's decision caused some consternation abroad: in September 2003, Finnish MEP Astrid Thors asked foreign embassies in Bucharest to closely monitor the case.|$|E

Transferred to a punishment camp at Gavi, he made three further escape attempts, the last of which was in September 1943 and involved the digging of a tunnel with 60 other prisoners. Detected before they could break out, the prisoners were moved to a camp in Germany. While en route, Clifton jumped from the train transporting them through Germany. His escape was short lived and while hiding in a bush near the train tracks, he was shot in the leg and stomach by a guard. Other prisoners, under guard, retrieved him and dressed his wounds. Taken to a hospital, he was treated for his wounds; the bullet, which had lodged in his stomach, was later given to him as a souvenir. In March 1944, after recuperating for four months, he was placed in a camp near Hadamar which was specially designated for <b>recidivist</b> escapees.|$|E

Kirkland and his animation team were relatively new to animation when they began working on the show, and to make the animation in this episode the best they had ever done, they incorporated all the techniques they had learned during their first year into it. Kirkland said animating Homer drunk was a challenge for him as he had to analyze how people behave when they are intoxicated by alcohol. He said of the animation: [...] "I shifted [...] eyes open and close, they're not working in sync. And of course Homer can't keep his balance so that's why he's shifting back and forth." [...] Kirkland was raised in New York City in an environment similar to the one where the marriage retreat was held. He therefore enjoyed drawing and overseeing the scenery for the episode, and the bait shop was based on the bait shops he visited when he grew up. Snake Jailbird, Springfield's resident <b>recidivist</b> felon, appeared {{for the first time on}} the show in this episode, though he was not named until season three's [...] "Black Widower". He appears at Bart and Lisa's wild house party. A woman named Gloria who seeks marriage counseling at the retreat was voiced by Julie Kavner. It is one of the few times in the history of the show that Kavner has voiced a character other than Marge and her relatives. Gloria's hair was based on Kirkland's assistant director Susie Dietter's hair.|$|E
40|$|The author applied Bayes’s theorem to agewise sexual {{recidivism}} {{rates and}} the accuracy of high actuarial scores for predicting sexual recidivism in civil commit-ment cases. Recidivism rates consistently declined with age, paralleling the age-invariance pattern found for other offenders. Furthermore, actuarials were efficient for only the youngest group, were inaccurate for identifying <b>recidivists,</b> and mis-classified many nonrecidivists as <b>recidivists.</b> Opinions about the accuracy of actu-arials are therefore often wrong, and actuarials need to be reformulated. Finally, actuarials are useless for identifying likely sexual <b>recidivists</b> from populations with recidivism base rates below. 25. Recommendations include seeking new trials in cases that overlooked age, focusing attention on young offenders, limiting commit-ment periods, and shifting resources from commitment centers to impact all offend-ers released to the community...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} conceptualized murderers {{as highly}} callous and self-gratifying individuals, offending {{as a result}} of psychopathic tendencies. The current exploration sought to verify whether murderers differ on psychopathy and criminal social identity from recidivistic and first time incarcerated offenders. Methods: The study compared an opportunistic sample of murderers (n = 94), <b>recidivists</b> (n = 266), and first time offenders (n = 118) on criminal social identity (3 factors: cognitive centrality, in-group affect, and in-group ties) and psychopathy (4 factors: callous affect, interpersonal manipulation, erratic lifestyle, antisocial behavior). Results: <b>Recidivists</b> scored significantly higher on cognitive centrality and in-group ties than murderers. <b>Recidivists</b> score significantly higher than first time incarcerated offenders or murderers on the erratic lifestyle and interpersonal manipulation factors of psychopathy. Additionally, <b>recidivists</b> scored significantly higher on antisocial behavior compared to first time offenders. All three groups of prisoners did not differ in terms of callous affect. Conclusion: Contrary to previous research and media portrayals of homicide perpetration being rooted in psychopathic tendencies such as callous affect, the present findings found no support for such a conceptualization of the crime. Moreover, unsurprisingly, it appears murderers have less developed criminal cognitions than other offending groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background As {{pyromania}} {{is a rare}} diagnosis with questionable validity, we {{aimed to}} describe a forensic psychiatric population of arson <b>recidivists.</b> Methods The medical records {{as well as the}} forensic psychiatric examination statements of 90 arson <b>recidivists</b> referred for pretrial psychiatric assessment in Helsinki University Hospital Department of Forensic Psychiatry between 1973 and 1993 were reviewed. Results The most important diagnostic categories of arson <b>recidivists</b> were personality disorders, psychosis and mental retardation, often with comorbid alcoholism. In all, 68 % of arsonists were under alcohol intoxication during the index crime. Psychotic as well as mentally retarded persons with repeated fire-setting behaviour were mostly "pure arsonists"- persons guilty only of arsons during their criminal careers. Arson <b>recidivists</b> with personality disorder, in contrast, often exhibited various types of criminal behaviour and arson appeared to be only one expression {{of a wide range of}} criminal activity. Comorbid alcoholism was apparently a more rarely observed phenomenon among pure arsonists than in "nonpure arsonists". We found only three subjects fulfilling the present diagnostic criteria for pyromania. Conclusion Using the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR, pyromania must be regarded as an extremely rare phenomenon. Especially the question of substance intoxication as an exclusion criterion for pyromania should be reconsidered. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Justice O'Connor {{wrote an}} opinion for herself, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Kennedy. [...] Under the Eighth Amendment, a narrow {{proportionality}} principle applies to non-capital sentences. [...] Before Ewing, the Court had {{from time to}} time examined lengthy sentences imposed for relatively minor crimes. [...] In Rummel v. Estelle, , the Court upheld a life sentence for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses imposed on a three-time offender under Texas's <b>recidivist</b> statute. [...] In Solem v. Helm, , the Court struck down a life without parole (LWOP) sentence imposed on a defendant who had committed a seventh non-violent felony. [...] Most recently, in Harmelin v. Michigan, , the Court upheld a life without parole sentence imposed on a first-time offender convicted of possession of more than 650grams of cocaine. [...] Against this backdrop of case law, O'Connor said that the gross disproportionality principle contained in the Eighth Amendment would require striking down only an extreme noncapital sentence, such as a life sentence for overtime parking.|$|E

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has been dedicated to understanding re-offending after release from prison - a phenomenon known as recidivism. A meta-analysis was conducted using fifty- seven published studies on actuarial predictors of both violent and nonviolent recidivism in men and women. The current analysis resulted in 127 effect sizes between violent <b>recidivists</b> and non-recidivists, and sixty-eight effect sizes between violent <b>recidivists</b> with nonviolent <b>recidivists.</b> Several variables (drug/alcohol use, age, and marriage) were predictive of recidivism. Gender differences were also observed. In men, increased violent criminal history was associated with increased violent recidivism. This effect was not true for women. In fact, longer sentences were predictive of violent re-offending in women and not men. Despite limited data on women, pursuing the predictors of recidivism in men and women independently demonstrated that gender differences exist, and supported {{the need for more}} data concerning the predictors of recidivism in women. ...|$|R

40|$|Exhibitionism has {{historically}} been viewed {{as more of a}} nuisance than a serious criminal justice matter. Research has demonstrated that the number of exhibitionists who are detected re-offending is a significant under-representation of the number who actually re-offend. The objective {{of this study was to}} extend a previous study conducted on exhibitionists, while attempting to solve the limitations described in that study. Two hundred eight exhibitionists were assessed at a university teaching hospital between 1983 and 1996. Archival data were derived from police and medical files. Results indicated that, over a mean follow-up period of 13. 24 years, 23. 6, 31. 3, and 38. 9 percent of exhibitionists were charged with or convicted of sexual, violent, or criminal offenses, respectively. Undoubtedly, this is an under-representation of the true rate, as we have no way of knowing how many exhibitionists re-offended and did not get caught.

40|$|Female sexual {{offender}} {{research is}} behind male sexual offender research by approximately 20 years (Cortoni, 2010). Research on development of assessment tools {{used to measure}} the risk of any criminal recidivism by female sexual offenders is even more limited than in other areas, with only two published studies to date on risk factors related to recidivism (Freeman 2 ̆ 6 Sandler, 2008; Sandler 2 ̆ 6 Freeman, 2009). The purpose of the current study was to explore characteristics of female sexual offender <b>recidivists</b> and nonrecidivists, assess the predictive accuracy for female sexual offenders of a risk-assessment tool developed for use with male sexual offenders (the Static- 99 R), and explore the relationship of static risk factors with recidivism for female sexual offenders. A total of 60 female sexual offenders from the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area were included. Results indicated differences in education, relationship of the victim, and sex of the victim among sexual <b>recidivists,</b> nonsexual violent <b>recidivists,</b> nonsexual and nonviolent <b>recidivists,</b> and nonrecidivists. The predictive accuracy of the Static- 99 R for general and violent recidivism showed no significant differences. Furthermore, none of the 10 factors of the Static- 99 R were related to general or nonsexual violent recidivism. Findings indicated that education level could be an important difference among the groups and that it should be explored as a risk factor. Additionally, the Static- 99 R is not recommended for prediction of general or violent recidivism for female sexual offenders. Replication of this study with a larger sample is recommended to validate the findings...|$|R
