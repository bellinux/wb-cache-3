Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the primary. He ran an independent campaign and won {{in the general election}} even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn. <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats split the state offices, with five going to <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> four going to Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a state official, Clayton {{remained}} {{the leader of the}} state <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> was controlling now not only appointments within the state, but also the flow of federal money and positions. He began purging Brindles from federal office, including Joseph Brooks, who was at this point an Internal Revenue Assessor.|$|E
5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> {{the rest of the}} Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} fellow <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck.

5|$|In 1862 Morton {{attended}} the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation.

5|$|In 1863, Knott {{returned}} to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in Lebanon. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1867.

He was re-elected to a second term, but did not stand for re-election in 1870.|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout {{his first year}} in office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 <b>Republicans,</b> <b>and</b> 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later. This {{resulted in the}} alienation of the second Viscount of Uruguai's ultraconservative faction and powerful political interests.

One Democrat, State Representative Jim Condon, said that he would vote for Milne, also citing his district's support for Milne over Shumlin. Political science professors Eric Davis and Garrison Nelson and House Minority Leader Don Turner expected the General Assembly vote to roughly follow party lines, with Milne receiving about one-third of the votes, including most of the <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> a few Democrats and Independents.|$|E

5|$|As of {{the general}} {{elections}} of 2014, {{a large majority of}} the members of Texas's U.S. House delegation are Republican, along with both U.S. Senators. In the 114th United States Congress, of the 36 Congressional districts in Texas, 25 are held by <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> 11 by Democrats. Texas's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Since 1994, Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office. The state's Democratic voters are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, Beaumont, and El Paso, as well as minority voters in East Texas and South Texas.|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 <b>Republicans,</b> <b>and</b> 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E
