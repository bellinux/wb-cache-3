5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> tree damage, {{which was}} rated as EF0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Willamette {{renamed the}} {{building}} {{in honor of the}} Reverend Alvan (Alvin) F. Waller who was instrumental in getting the hall built. Then on December 17, 1919, another fire swept through Waller Hall while school was on break for Christmas. This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact. The Mansard <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> square tower were destroyed in the fire. The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> the square tower topping the structure. Architect Fred A. Legge oversaw the rebuilding and re-design of the hall. A campaign launched in 1920 by the university was set to raise $100,000 to be used for the reconstruction of Waller, plus completing the new Lausanne Hall and adding a central heating plant.|$|E

5|$|The {{castle and}} {{surrounding}} lands were {{bought by the}} Seymour-Conway family in 1754. By the late-18th century only the north wall of the bailey survived and the <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> upper floors of the keep had badly decayed, and Francis Seymour-Conway, the 2nd Marquess of Hertford, proposed destroying the building in 1805. He was prevented from doing so by the government, {{on the grounds that}} the keep formed a valuable landmark for ships approaching from Holland, wishing to avoid the nearby sandbanks. Francis' son, also called Francis, undertook conservation efforts in 1831, installing a new, relatively flat, lead <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> a replacement upper floor. Francis furnished the top of the keep for use as an apartment by guests. By the 1840s, however, all of the surrounding bailey wall and mural towers had almost vanished, having been quarried for stone, and the foundations could only just be seen.|$|E
