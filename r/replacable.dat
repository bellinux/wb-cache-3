Most pesticide and fertilizer inputs appear to be <b>replacable</b> by non-chemical methods and organic manure, with economic results similar to conventional systems. The targeted reductions in pesticide use in the Netherlands' Multi-Year Crop Protection Plan for the year 2000 can already clearly be met. Further improvements of the prototype systems are considered. Recently started farming systems research for outdoor horticulture is briefly discussed...|$|E

The practical relevance of the theoretical results is shown by the actual problem of information safety in communication networks. After defining the demand for insurance the relationship to self-protection measures is analyzed. Finally, the practical consequences are illustrated by the restricted insurance policies for irreplacable commodities, like the personal privacy and collector's items...|$|E
40|$|To {{support our}} MicroTCA (AMC) module developments, and for {{diagnostic}} investigations in MicroTCA systems, {{we found a}} need to develop tools to exercise the IPMI functions of Management Controllers within the system. Based on the freely available ”ipmitool” program, we built a framework which allows to communicate with AMC Module Management Controllers through the Shelf Manager's network interface, without need to tap an IPMB. It contains functions to exercise various IPMI transactions and to check integrity and correctness of FRU (Field <b>Replacable</b> Unit) information and other data structures published by Management Controllers. The general structure of the library will be presented, as well as first results and future plans...|$|E
40|$|UrMus is a multi-layered {{environment}} {{intended to}} support interface design, interaction design, interactive music per-formance and live patching on multi-touch mobile devices. Its design {{is based on}} suggestions from the HCI community for design for multiple target audiences and design for cre-ativity. In addition UrMus {{is intended to be}} an environment for use directly on mobile devices and was not designed with legacy assumptions taken over from desktop computing. Ur-Mus offers multiple component which all are <b>replacable</b> and offer ways to control computational cost, easy of program-ming and design as well as separation of representation and function. Ultimately UrMus tries to stay as flexible and in-dependent from any particular design choice as possible and rather is an environment where mobile interaction design becomes possible. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLow {{temperature}} {{optical and}} photochemical properties of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (R- 26) reaction centers, in which bacteriopheophytin a {{has been replaced}} by plant pheophytin a, are reported. Modified reaction centers preserve the ability for photoinduced electron transfer from the primary electron donor P to the primary quinone acceptor QA at 80 K. The triplet state ESR signal of modified reaction centers with prereduced QA at 10 K shows an electron spin polarization pattern and ZFS parameters analogous to those for the triplet state 3 P in non-treated reaction centers. It was found that at low temperature both P+Q−A and 3 P states are formed via a precursor radical pair P+I− in which I is the introduced plant pheophytin molecule. This shows that acceptor systems of bacterial and plant (photosystem II) reaction centers are mutually <b>replacable</b> in structural and functional aspects...|$|E
40|$|Potential {{modes of}} {{operating}} in {{space in the}} space shuttle era are documented. The October 1973 NASA Mission Model provides a definition of various NASA and non-DOD automated payload configurations when employed in an expendable mode. The model also specifies a launch schedule for initial deployment of payloads {{as well as for}} subsequent replacements at periodic cycles. This model and its associated payload definitions serve as a foundation for the data presented in this report. The reference model has been revised to reflect automated space servicing of payloads as an operational concept instead of the existing expendable approach. The indication is that the bulk of a payload's subsystems and mission equipment require no support over the lifetime of the program. However, failure of a single unit could result in loss of the mission objectives. When space servicing is employed, the approach is to replace only that unit causing the anomaly. This concept affords an opportunity to standardize space <b>replacable</b> units, as well as to reduce the expense of logistics support, by allowing multiple servicing on any single upper stage/shuttle flight...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{potential}} of functional languages in designing and implementing complex distributed systems. We focus on the areas of parallel computation and coordination, and describe the prototype implementation of a generic runtime environment (RTE) for parallel execution. In particular, we discuss the implementation of scheduling algorithms in this context. Key features of our design are modularity, a separation between basic components, and employing a hierarchy with increasing levels of abstractions. The microkernel of this system is accessed via a narrow interface {{and most of the}} coordination of the system is realised in a functional language, (Concurrent) Haskell [5], at system level. Thus, we obtain a prototype {{in the form of an}} executable specification, amenable to formal reasoning, and easier to maintain and more flexible than conventional RTEs. In particular, components can be easily replaced, and we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by presenting different variants of the scheduling component for the parallel execution of Haskell programs, put on top of GHC [4]. In the full paper we add sophisticated work distribution policies. With our approach we target complex architectures such as Computational Grids [1]. To handle such heterogeneous, global architectures with potentially thousands of machines a modular design with easily <b>replacable</b> components is crucial. More generally, this work underlines the usability of a high-level language such as Concurrent Haskell as a systems programming language [2]...|$|E
40|$|Since 1989, {{the data}} {{concerning}} {{medically assisted procreation}} (MAP) in Belgium have been registered through the BELRAP association (Belgian Register for Assisted Procreation). In 1999, the national College of Physicians in Reproductive Medicine has been installed and given the mission {{to carry out the}} quality controls and the registration of MAP activities in our country. In 2001, a new on line system of registration of all treatment cycles was started, the basic structure of the corresponding data base having undergone a series of changes along the years. Although the number of MAP trials has considerably increased in our country, mainly because of the introduction of new techniques such as intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI), the success rate per trial has remained almost unchanged, becoming stabilized around 18. 8 % of ongoing pregnancies per initiated cycle. The main modification that occurred during the analyzed period has been the reduction of the number of embryos transferred at each trial, being first reduced from 3 to 2 to evolve more recently towards the replacement of only one embryo per trial. Multiple pregnancies are indeed the chief complication of MAP and in order to avoid it Belgian centers have been among the first to reduce drastically the number of transferred embryos. In 2003, legal rules were enacted, fixing the number of <b>replacable</b> embryos in accordance to the patient's age and to the rank of trial, while also solving the problem of the long-awaited reimbursement of MAP by our national social security system.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the physics}} of a burning plasma are coming closer to being {{demonstrated}} in ITER, the focus of fusion research will shift towards the technology needed to build a demonstration reactor. The EU supports the development of its reference breeding blankets mainly within its long-term breeding blanket and materials R&D programmes. The recent European Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) points out that a plant based on Helium-cooled in-vessel components, i. e. breeding blanket and divertor, while assuming limited technological extrapolation, {{has the potential for}} producing electricity in a competitive future market. While this outcome is based on careful analysis of key functions of the in-vessel components, the complexity of the task has prevented a comprehensive design of a blanket/divertor system fully integrated within the reactor vessel of a tokamak fusion machine. The paper presents the current status of a study of design concepts available for reactor integration, based on the recent development in Europe of blankets and divertors, and focussing on the EU modular Helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) blanket concept. As a geometry relevant for a demonstration reactor, a reactor model of 3300 MW fusion power is assumed. Conceptual design solutions are proposed for (i) blanket segmentation; (ii) curved blanket modules covering the tokamak surface; (iii) <b>replacable</b> shield modules; in-vessel piping including compensation for differential thermal expansion; and, (iv) attachment and remote handling schemes for blanket and shield. The requirements imposed by in-vessel integration have implications on blanket performance, since they affect blanket coverage, the amount of structural steel required, and radial space requirements. The work provides important feedback especially on current breeding blanket design, and input for the definition of a future European DEMO study...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{covering}} {{an area of}} solutions for medium to large (enterprise) products or systems, which are supposed to tie in many different services into one homogenous entity. These kinds of systems are problematic in sense of updating and replacing specific parts of them. This is where an implementation of SCA specifiacion comes to provide modularity and independence of a product on a large scale. The otherwise heterogen systems can be presented {{as a set of}} independent components. Each of the components, which build up the whole, is easily <b>replacable.</b> This means that {{there is no need to}} recompile the whole system with a compiler. Main part of the SCA implementation consists of Sca container. It's operation is explained in a simple manner, as are it's scenarios of use. In order for Sca comtainer to function properly, service factory and service registry are introduced. Their means of operation is also explained. This thesis also consists of explanations of methods, mechanisms and different means of configuring the system. Everyday programming problems such as multithreading, multiplicity and wiring of different implementations of different C++ classes into a functional system, named composite, are also explained. A composite is being run in an assigned context, which is defined by common services that are being used by all components. All elements of a composite, which are presented in XML form, are explained as well as the properties of it. In the last part of the thesis, there is a demonstration of a use case in a testing environment, explaining how the developed system behaves and performs in a real life scenario. Elements of configuration are explained step by step along with a presentation of how the system structure looks like on the filesystem. ...|$|E
