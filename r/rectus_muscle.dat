5000|$|Turner-Warwick's {{incision}} - This type of incision {{is placed}} 2 cm above the symphysis pubis {{and within the}} lateral borders of the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The sheath overlying the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> at the symphysis pubis is released, 4 cm transversely, and the incision angled up to the lateral borders of the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The lateral edges of the incisions remain medial to the internal oblique muscles. The sheath may be released off the aponeurosis {{with the help of}} traction applied using Kocker clamps. The pyramidalis muscles are typically left attached to the aponeurosis. The <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> are separated and the incision is made in the midline. This type of incision is good for exposure of the retropubic space but offers limited access to the upper pelvis and abdomen.|$|R

Rupture of more than two <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> usually requires the eye to be removed, because significant blood vessel and nerve damage also usually occurs.

25|$|Candicine (as {{either the}} iodide or chloride) was re-investigated by Japanese pharmacologists {{in the early}} 1960s. Initial {{experiments}} on frogs, using <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and nerve-sartorius preparations from Rana nigromaculata nigromaculata, showed that the alkaloid caused contractions in the rectus at concentrations of 0.01–0.2mg/mL, and blocked {{the response of the}} nerve-sartorius to direct or indirect electrical stimulation at similar concentrations. The contraction of the rectus was inhibited by pre-treatment with tubocurarine, as was the response of the nerve-sartorius (i.e., the normal muscle twitch was not reduced by the application of candicine subsequent to tubocurarine). The action of candicine in these assays was not affected by eserine. Taking additional observations into account, these researchers concluded that the effects on frog tissue of candicine most closely resembled those of the well-known depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drug decamethonium. An earlier comparison of 0.2mg of candicine chloride with 2mg of hordenine sulfate on the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> preparation showed that hordenine was much less potent at eliciting a contraction, even at 10× the concentration of candicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of the MS-TRAM flap {{is similar to}} the {{technique of}} the DIEAP flap, but the MS-TRAM flap is used if the perforators of the abdominal wall are located in different intramuscular layers and the muscle fibres between these vessels would need to be divided. This gives damage to the <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> necessitating a reinforcing mesh repair and causing higher chance of postoperative complications such as abdominal wall weakness, bulging or herniation. In this situation the MS-TRAM flap is performed, in which a small cuff of muscle fibres between and around the perforators is incorporated.|$|E
25|$|Sutures may {{be passed}} through the rectus muscles before their {{disinsertion}} from the globe. Some surgeons also suture one or both oblique muscles. Traction sutures or clamps may {{be applied to the}} horizontal <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> insertions to assist in rotating and elevating the globe during the ensuing dissection. Tenon’s capsule may be opened posteriorly to allow visualization of the optic nerve. The vortex veins and posterior ciliary vessels may be cauterized before dividing the nerve and removing the eye. Alternatively, the optic nerve may be localized with a clamp before transection. Hemostasis is achieved with either cautery or digital pressure.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} implicated exotropia as {{a risk factor}} for schizophrenia. We {{determined}} whether schizophrenia biomarkers have abnormal levels of expression in extraocular muscles from patients with strabismus and explored whether differences in gene expression between medial and lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> may explain the specific association of schizophrenia with exotropia but not esotropia. Samples from horizontal extraocular muscles were obtained during strabismus surgery and compared with age- and muscle type-matched normal muscles from organ donors. We used PCR arrays to identify differences in gene expression among 417 signaling molecules. We then focused on established schizophrenia-related growth factors, cytokines, and regulators of the extracellular matrix. Among 36 genes with significantly altered gene expression in dysfunctional horizontal <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> over one third were schizophrenia-related: CTGF, CXCR 4, IL 1 B, IL 10 RA, MIF, MMP 2, NPY 1 R, NRG 1, NTRK 2, SERPINA 3, TIMP 1, TIMP 2, and TNF (adjusted p value ≤  0. 016667). By PCR array, expression of three of these genes was significantly different in medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> while eleven were significantly altered in lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> Comparing baseline levels between muscle types, three schizophrenia-related genes (NPY 1 R, NTRK 2, TIMP 2) had lower levels of expression in medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> Despite the surprisingly large number of schizophrenia-related genes with altered gene expression levels in dysfunctional muscles, the lack of specificity for medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> undermines a model of shared, region-specific gene expression abnormalities between exotropia and schizophrenia, but rather suggests consideration of the alternative model: that exotropia-induced aberrant early visual experiences may enable and/or contribute as a causative factor to the development of schizophrenia...|$|R
50|$|Four of the extraocular muscles {{have their}} {{origin in the}} back of the orbit in a fibrous ring called the annulus of Zinn: the four <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The four <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> attach {{directly}} to the front half of the eye (anterior to the eye's equator), and are named after their straight paths. Note that medial and lateral are relative terms. Medial indicates near the midline, and lateral describes a position away from the midline. Thus, the medial <b>rectus</b> is the <b>muscle</b> closest to the nose. The superior and inferior recti do not pull straight back on the eye, because both muscles also pull slightly medially. This posterior medial angle causes the eye to roll with contraction of either the superior rectus or inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The extent of rolling in the recti is less than the oblique, and opposite from it.|$|R

2500|$|Duane {{syndrome}} is most probably a miswiring {{of the eye}} muscles, causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldn't and other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Alexandrakis and Saunders found that {{in most cases the}} abducens nucleus and nerve are absent or hypoplastic, and the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> is innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve. This view is supported by the earlier work of Hotchkiss et al. who reported on the autopsy findings of two patients with Duane's syndrome. In both cases the sixth cranial nerve nucleus and nerve was absent, and the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> was innervated by the inferior division of the third or oculomotor nerve. This misdirection of nerve fibres results in opposing muscles being innervated by the same nerve. Thus, on attempted abduction, stimulation of the lateral rectus via the oculomotor nerve will be accompanied by stimulation of the opposing medial rectus via the same nerve; a muscle which works to adduct the eye. Thus, co-contraction of the muscles takes place, limiting the amount of movement achievable and also resulting in retraction of the eye into the socket. They also noticed mechanical factors and considered them secondary to loss of innervation: During corrective surgery fibrous attachments have been found connecting the horizontal recti and the orbital walls and fibrosis of the lateral rectus has been confirmed by biopsy. This fibrosis can result in the lateral rectus being 'tight' and acting as a tether or leash. [...] Co-contraction of the medial and lateral recti allows the globe to slip up or down under the tight lateral rectus producing the up and down shoots characteristic of the condition.|$|E
50|$|Damage to the abducens nucleus {{does not}} produce an {{isolated}} sixth nerve palsy, but rather a horizontal gaze palsy that affects both eyes simultaneously. The abducens nucleus contains two types of cells: motor neurons that control the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> on the same side, and interneurons that cross the midline and connect to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (which controls the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of the opposite eye). In normal vision, lateral movement of one eye (lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle)</b> is precisely coupled to medial movement of the other eye (medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle),</b> so that both eyes remain fixed on the same object.|$|E
