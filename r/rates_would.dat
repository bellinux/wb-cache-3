50|$|The Congressional Budget Office {{provides}} an unemployment rate forecast in its long term budget outlook. During August 2012, it projected that the unemployment <b>rate</b> <b>would</b> be 8.8% in 2013 and 8.7% in 2014. CBO projected the <b>rate</b> <b>would</b> then begin falling steadily to 5.5% by 2018 and remain around that level through 2022. This forecast assumes annual real GDP growth will exceed 3% between 2014 and 2018. During December 2012, Wells Fargo Economics forecast that the unemployment <b>rate</b> <b>would</b> be 7.8% in 2013 and 7.6% in 2014. This forecast assumes real GDP growth would be 1.4% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014.|$|R
25|$|CBO also {{estimated}} that if policies {{in place as}} {{of the end of}} the Obama administration continued over the following decade, real GDP would grow at approximately 2% per year, the unemployment rate would remain around 5%, inflation would remain around 2%, and interest <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> rise moderately. President Trump's economic policies can also be measured against this baseline.|$|E
25|$|Deregulation {{would ensure}} that <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> no longer be based on {{long-term}} average costs, as determined by a central regulating entity, to pricing based on short-term marginal costs. A plant's marginal cost varies considerably based on age, technology, fuel conversion efficiency, and so on. Both regulated and deregulated systems operate to minimize the avoidable costs of meeting instantaneous demand.|$|E
25|$|With {{negotiations}} between the AKP and CHP failing on 13 August, the lira slumped to ₺2.86. A last-ditch attempt to form a coalition between the AKP and MHP also failed on 17 August, after which the lira fell to ₺2.869 to the dollar, setting a new record. With the Central Bank of Turkey announcing that interest <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> remain at 7.5%, the lira fell even lower to ₺2.88 to the dollar.|$|E

25|$|During Monday 31 March, {{there were}} {{spontaneous}} gatherings of sailors, {{during which they}} discovered the pay review, shipboard conditions, and the ineffectiveness of the lower-deck committees.

25|$|The Democratic party made {{a similar}} {{argument}} in the 1880s when high revenue from import tariffs raised during the Civil War (1861–1865) led to federal budget surpluses. The Republican party, which was then based in the protectionist industrial Northeast, argued that cutting <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> lower revenues. But the Democratic party, then rooted in the agricultural South, argued tariff reductions would increase revenues by {{increasing the number of}} taxable imports.|$|E
25|$|With bank {{accounts}} in seven countries including the Netherlands, the Universal League needed to stipulate {{the value of}} the Stelo in these countries. For want of scientific data on the effective purchasing power of the various national currencies it was, however, impossible to determine reliable conversion rates between the Stelo and each national currency. While the conversion rate with the guilder was solidly established, agreement on the other <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> not be easy.|$|E

25|$|For the 2015-16 budget year, Lakeland School Board {{applied for}} two {{exceptions}} to exceed their Act 1 Index limit: {{for special education}} cost and for its rapidly rising teacher pension costs. For the school budget 2015-16, 310 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> not be increased above its Act 1 Index limit. Another 187 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeding the Index limit.|$|E
25|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. Cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, prompting some farmers to use beak trimming as a preventative measure, although reducing stocking <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> eliminate these problems. Diseases can be common {{and the animals}} are vulnerable to predators. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In South-East Asia, a lack of disease control in free range farming has been associated with outbreaks of Avian influenza.|$|E

50|$|A {{proposal}} {{set forth}} by the utilities offered to charge both residential and commercial net metering customers their “otherwise applicable rate” for the kWh’s of electricity used from the grid. A fixed export compensation rate for exported energy over a 10-year period would also be imposed. The export <b>rate</b> <b>would</b> amount to $0.15/kWh for installations until the distributed power exceeded 7% of the utility’s customer demand. Subsequently, the <b>rate</b> <b>would</b> fall to $0.13/kWh.|$|R
30|$|Operation {{parameters}} (fracturing fluid viscosity and injection <b>rate)</b> <b>would</b> {{significantly affect}} the fracture propagation and penetration behavior. Appropriate viscosity {{as well as}} injection <b>rate</b> <b>would</b> ensure a large vertical propagation distance of the fracture and increase {{the possibility of a}} fracture network forming. Too low a viscosity or injection <b>rate</b> of fluids <b>would</b> cause leakage through weak planes and as a result forming multiple fractures with limited fracture height. Too high a viscosity or injection <b>rate</b> of fluids <b>would</b> lead to forming a single fracture with lower SRV. Additionally, comparing with operation parameters, the natural weak plane characteristics (such as development of weak planes and distribution) of coal were the main controlling factor.|$|R
25|$|In June 1957, at {{the fourth}} session of the First National People's Congress, Ma {{presented}} his New Population Theory. Having examined trends of the early 1950s, he concluded that further population growth at such high <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> be detrimental to China's development. Therefore, he advocated government control of fertility. During the following three years, Ma's theory suffered two rounds of attacks, and he was dismissed from public life. The charges of the government were that the theory followed Malthusianism, attempted to discredit the superiority of socialism, and showed contempt for the people.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} New Jersey Casino Expansion Amendment {{resulted from}} an agreement among Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic state legislators. State legislators were in deadlock over {{who would be}} allowed to own new casinos and tax revenue sharing. The measure does not say where the casinos would be allowed. Location and other matters such as tax <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> be determined by enabling legislation to be passed by the state legislature. A law passed by popular vote in 1976 gives Atlantic City a monopoly on casino gambling in New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|After a {{year with}} {{stagnant}} economic activity in 2010, Irish real GDP rose by 2.2% in 2011 and 0.2% in 2012, which was mainly driven by strong improvements in the export sector – while private consumption remained subdued. The economic challenges continued, however, as the prolonged European sovereign-debt crisis caused a new Irish recession starting in Q32012, which was still ongoing as of Q22013. In May 2013 the European Commission's economic forecast for Ireland predicted its growth <b>rates</b> <b>would</b> return to a positive 1.1% in 2013 and 2.2% in 2014.
