40|$|SUMMARY To relate {{angiographic}} injections {{to potential}} cardiac trauma, we verified a mathematic theory that allows quantitative {{definition of the}} kinetic energy content <b>of</b> contrast <b>jets</b> emanating from the exit holes of angiographic catheters. Cineangiographic recordings <b>of</b> a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>jets</b> <b>of</b> known energy content were obtained in 18 cardiac canine experiments and energy content and dissipation were quantified precisely from center line to jet edge. All contrast jets produced in clinical angiographic practice were turbulent, even those from hand injections into the coronary arteries. Energy content was related to an estimated cardiac wall damage threshold. At energy MODERN ANGIOGRAPHIC PUMP INJECTORS may cause catheter recoil and generate high velocity contrast jets that may result in iatrogenically induced cardiovascular trauma.

50|$|Zip fuel, {{also known}} as high energy fuel (HEF), is any member {{of a family of}} jet fuels {{containing}} additives in the form of hydro-boron compounds, or boranes. Zip fuels offered higher energy density than conventional fuels, helping extend the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> aircraft, a major problem for the military planners in the 1950s. A number of aircraft were designed to make use of zip, including the XB-70 Valkyrie, XF-108 Rapier, as well as the BOMARC, and even the nuclear-powered aircraft program. In testing, the fuels proved to have several serious problems and the entire effort was eventually canceled in 1959. It was later claimed that the Blackstar spaceplane uses zip fuel, but Blackstar is almost certainly mythical.|$|E

The DPS contributions are calculated in the LO collinear approach within the so-called factorized Ansatz. We show that the relative contribution of DPS is growing with respect to standard single-parton scattering (SPS) production of dijets and to the BFKL Mueller-Navelet (MN) jet mechanism at large rapidity distance between jets. This is consistent with recent studies of DPS effects {{in the case of}} double D and double J/ψ meson production. The calculated differential cross sections as a function of rapidity distance between the jets that are the most distant in rapidity are compared with recent results of LL and NLL BFKL calculations for the Mueller-Navelet jet production at √(s) = 7 TeV.
