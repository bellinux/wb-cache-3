5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order {{as a matter of}} right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E

50|$|A red card, {{just like}} in {{association}} football, is a permanent exclusion {{from the rest of}} the game, without substitution, and usually results in the player being banned for a certain period of time or number of matches (this is governed by local playing conditions, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of field hockey). The player must also leave the pitch and surrounding area.|$|R
25|$|After the Great Schism, {{there existed}} a Catholic Bishopric of Cumania (later, {{separate}} bishoprics in both Wallachia and Moldavia). However, {{this seems to}} be the exception, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> as in both Wallachia and Moldavia the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was Old Church Slavonic. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, {{the members}} of the National Language Commission came to settle upon the Beijing dialect, which became the major source of {{standard}} national pronunciation due to its prestigious status. In 1932, the commission published the Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use (国音常用字汇/國音常用字彙), with little fanfare or official announcement. This dictionary was similar to the previous published one except that it normalized the pronunciations for all characters into the pronunciation of the Beijing dialect. Elements from other dialects continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{passenger}} airline case, capacity {{is regarded as}} fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus {{can be said to}} have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.|$|E
25|$|All {{three of}} the {{northern}} New England states (Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) contain some areas that are unincorporated and unorganized, not part of any town, city or plantation. Maine has significantly more such area {{than the other two}} states. While these areas do exist, their importance should not be overstated. They are certainly the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in the New England system, and the number of New England residents who live in them is extremely small in comparison to those who live in towns and cities, even in Maine. Most such areas are located in very sparsely populated regions. Much of the barely inhabited interior of Maine is unorganized, for example.|$|E

50|$|A player {{character}} (also {{known as}} PC and playable character) is a fictional {{character in a}} role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of <b>the</b> game <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>the</b> game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it.|$|R

25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect. For example, when an organism is in need of phosphorus, multiple enzymes that break down different phosphorylated components from the environment may act additively {{to increase the amount of}} phosphorus available to the organism. However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative epistasis). Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive. It is now considered that strict additivity is the exception, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> since most genes interact with hundreds or thousands of other genes.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E
25|$|The royal council or witan {{played a}} central but limited role in the Anglo-Saxon period. The main feature of the system was its high degree of decentralisation. The {{interference}} by the king through his granting of charters and the activity of his witan in litigation are exceptions <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in Anglo-Saxon times. The most important court in the later Anglo-Saxon period was the Shire Court. It is of interest that many shires (such as Kent and Sussex) were {{in the early days}} of the Anglo-Saxon settlement the centre of small independent kingdoms. As the kings first of Mercia and then of Wessex slowly extended their authority over the whole of England they left the Shire Courts with overall responsibility for the administration of law. The Shire met in one or more traditional places, earlier in the open air and then later in a Moot or meeting hall. The meeting of the Shire Court was presided over by an officer, the shire reeve or sheriff, whose appointment came in later Anglo-Saxon times into the hands of the king but had in earlier times been elective. The sheriff was not the judge of the court, merely its president. The judges of the court were all those who had the right and duty of attending the court, the suitors. These were originally all free male inhabitants of the neighbourhood but, over time, suit of court became an obligation attached to particular holdings of land. The sessions of a Shire Court resembled more closely those of a modern local administrative body than a modern court. It could and did act judicially but this was not its prime function. In the Shire Court, charters and writs would be read out for all to hear.|$|E
40|$|A rules-based fiscal framework, {{such as the}} EU’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), can be an {{important}} bulwark against short-sighted policies. Although policies have improved following the SGP’s adoption, shortcomings remain. These, however, are rooted in <b>the</b> policies <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> where few changes seem necessary. Specifically, the Excessive Deficit Procedure needs a stronger focus on policies <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> outcomes, while staying operationally simple and transparent. Furthermore, reforms are needed to foster time-consistent national policies, budgetary transparency, and ownership of the Pact. Accordingly, parliaments should debate national Stability Programs and national fiscal councils should review these programs for parliaments. ...|$|R
5000|$|Lord Darcy is {{a detective}} in an {{alternate}} history, created by Randall Garrett.

500|$|For {{the chamber}} repertoire, Ketèlbey {{composed}} a string quartet (c.1896) and a quintet for piano and wind (1896) {{which won the}} Costa Prize and the College Gold Medal. His 1894 Romance for violin and piano was praised as [...] "a charming, musicianly work". His other early works include choral pieces, including the anthems [...] "Every good Gift"; [...] "Behold upon the mountains", and [...] "Be strong, all ye people" [...] (all 1896). After these works he moved professionally into conducting light opera, and serious music became the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in his compositions.|$|E
500|$|Ships {{designed}} for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or [...] and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, {{was the first}} large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, {{she would have had}} little endurance {{on the other side of}} the ocean. The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play {{it over and over}} again." [...] While the album Don't Blow Your Top was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{architecture}} is presented for combining rule-based and case-based reasoning.

The case focused on the terms of <b>the</b> wager <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>the</b> sport and the judge ordered the game to be played out.

5000|$|The idea of confessionalism can {{generate}} considerable controversy. Some Christian denominations, particularly newer ones, {{focus more on}} the [...] "experience" [...] of Christianity than on its formal doctrines, and are accused by confessionalists of adopting a vague and unfocused form of religion. Others argue that the confessionalist view of religion is too narrow, and that people should be able to seek religion in their own way. Anti-confessionalists generally argue that it is the spirit and values of religion that matter, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> Confessionalists generally counter that the [...] "spirit and values" [...] of any given faith cannot be attained without first knowing truth as given in formal dogmas.|$|R
500|$|The group's albums {{have tended}} to be both lyrically and musically darker in {{atmosphere}} than many of their progressive rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were the exception <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and its members have contributed to his solo albums, he is keen to stress that the band collectively arranges all its material. Hammill's lyrics frequently covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as [...] "a male Nico" [...] and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s. Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several musicians, including John Lydon and Julian Cope.|$|E
