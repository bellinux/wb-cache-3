25|$|Despite Gediminas' chief goal to save Lithuania from {{destruction}} at {{the hands}} of the Germans, he still died as a pagan reigning over semi-pagan lands. Also, he was equally bound to his pagan kinsmen in Samogitia, to his Orthodox subjects in Belarus, and to his Catholic allies in Masovia. Therefore, it is still unclear whether the letters sent to the Pope were an actual <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> or simply a diplomatic maneuver.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in the Hellenistic era (Second Temple Judaism), in {{the modern}} era Judaism does not proselytize non-Jews. Instead, non-Jews are {{encouraged}} to follow Noahide Law, which is said to assure a place in the world to come. However, some groups, such as Aish HaTorah or Chabad, encourage nonobservant Jews to be observant. Many branches of Judaism are open to the conversion of the non-Jewish spouses of already existing mixed marriages to convert to Judaism. Orthodox Judaism in theory, neither encourages nor discourages conversion, however their standards <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> can be very challenging but persistent and sincere <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> are conducted.|$|R

5000|$|Alstat was {{an early}} {{champion}} {{of the rights of}} women, including their education and their place in academia. In the 1930s, he worked with Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, teaching courses on Jewish History and Modern Jewish Problems at [...] "The School of the Jewish Woman," [...] the institution she created on New York's Upper West Side, under the auspices of Hadassah. Weiss-Rosmarin, and those who worked with her, felt that [...] "Jewish women had been short-changed...and saw education was the remedy." [...] "As an intellectual feminist," [...] Weiss-Rosmarin promoted the study of the liturgy, learning the meaning and history of the prayers, [...] "to stimulate attendance of women at synagogue." [...] Through classes in history, philosophy, customs, and ceremonies, Alstat, along with the other well-known rabbis who taught at this school, helped promote this vision of increased education, not only for the women of that time, but also so that they could help their children. As Weiss-Rosmarin put it, [...] "If you want your children to grow up as educated Jews, you yourself must become educated."

40|$|This NUREG {{contains}} the improved Standard Technical Specifications (STS) for Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) plants. Revision 1 incorporates the cumulative changes to Revision 0, {{which was published}} in September 1992. The changes reflected in Revision 1 resulted from the experience gained from license amendment applications to convert to these improved STS or to adopt partial improvements to existing technical specifications. This NUREG is the result of extensive public technical meetings and discussions between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff and various nuclear power plant licensees, Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) Owners Groups, specifically the B&W Owners Group (BWOG), NSSS vendors, and the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI). The improved STS were developed based on the criteria in the Final Commission Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, dated July 22, 1993 (58 FR 39132). Licensees are encouraged to upgrade their technical specifications consistent with those criteria and conforming, to the extent practical and consistent with the licensing basis for the facility, to Revision 1 to the improved STS. The Commission continues to place the highest priority on <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> complete <b>conversions</b> to the improved STS. Licensees adopting portions of the improved STS to existing technical specifications should adopt all related requirements, as applicable, to achieve a high degree of standardization and consistency...|$|R

The revision of bariatric procedures is required between 10 to 25 % of patients operated, either by insufficient weight loss or complications, including stenosis. After a LSG, the Roux- en- Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the most <b>requested</b> surgery <b>for</b> <b>conversion.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} describe a series of 5 patients who had revisional surgery for stenosis following LSG. Material and Method: Between January 2006 and March 2013, in 770 consecutive patients was performed LSG. Patients were included in a prospective protocol. Five patients had revisional surgery with <b>conversion</b> to RYGBP <b>for</b> stenosis following LSG. In three patients the initial LSG was performed in our hospital, the other 2 were from other hospitals. Results: In the 5 patients with revisional surgery mean age was 39. 8 ± 15. 7 years. Four patients were women (80 %). The average BMI before LSG was 37. 0 ± 2. 1 kg/m 2 and BMI before RYGBP was 29. 4 ± 5. 4 kg/m 2. The RYGBP was laparoscopic in 3 cases and opened in two. There were no complications, and no mortality. Conclusions: Conversion to RYGBP is an effective treatment for stenosis following a LSG...|$|R
2500|$|Deruvian (...) , {{also known}} by several other names {{including}} Damian, was a possibly legendary 2nd-century bishop and saint, {{said to have}} been sent by the pope to answer KingLucius's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> baptism and <b>conversion</b> to Christianity. Together with his companion StFagan, he was sometimes reckoned as the apostle of Britain. KingLucius's letter (in most accounts, to PopeEleutherius) may represent earlier traditions but does not appear in surviving sources before the 6th century; the names of the bishops sent to him does not appear in sources older than the early 12th century, when their story was used to support the independence of the bishops of StDavids in Wales and the antiquity of the Glastonbury Abbey in England. The story became widely known following its appearance in Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudohistorical History of the Kings of Britain. This was influential for centuries and its account of SSFagan and Deruvian was used during the English Reformation to support the claims of both the Catholics and Protestants. Geoffrey's account is now considered wholly implausible, but Christianity was well-established in Roman Britain by the third century. Some scholars therefore argue the stories preserve a more modest account of the conversion of a Romano-British chieftain, possibly by Roman emissaries by these names.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{specification}} of a RESTful based networking interface for the efficient exchange and manipulation of visual computing resources. It is designed to include web applications by using modern web-technology such as Typed Arrays and WebSockets. The specification maps internal structures and data containers to two types, Elements and Attributes, which can be queried for a description or their content. Two modes of communication are defined, one through HTTP requests, where we use HTTP operations to manipulate Elements and Attributes or request their data in a stateless fashion, the other through WebSockets to enable a push-based communication. A key idea to this interface is that we use MIME types to specify the way data is to be exchanged in. When requesting data, the user may supply a hint or type in which the data {{is expected to be}} delivered in, which enables us to write web-applications which can process already converted data {{that would not have been}} web-friendly before. To have such a mode of operation, we also present a table of extracted basic data types usable <b>for</b> <b>requesting</b> data <b>conversion,</b> which are derived from the Typed Array specification and shared across shader languages...|$|R
