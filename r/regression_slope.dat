We outline the complexities involved in synthesizing slopes, describe existing methods of analysis and present a multivariate generalized least squares approach to the synthesis of <b>regression</b> <b>slopes.</b> Key words and phrases: Generalized least squares, multivariate, metaanalysis, <b>regression</b> <b>slopes.</b> We begin with a discussion of the rationale for summarizing <b>regression</b> <b>slopes,</b> a practice that has become more prevalent in meta-analyses in recent years.

40|$|Are {{logistic}} <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> {{suitable to}} quantify metacognitive sensitivity, i. e. the effi- ciency with which subjective reports differentiate between correct and incorrect task responses? We analytically show that logistic <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> are independent from rat- ing criteria in one specific model of metacognition, which assumes (i) that rating decisions {{are based on}} sensory evidence generated independently of the sensory evidence used for primary task responses and (ii) that the distributions of evidence are logistic. Given a hier- archical model of metacognition, logistic <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> depend on rating criteria. According to all considered models, <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> depend on the primary task criterion. A reanalysis of previous data revealed that massive numbers of trials are required to dis- tinguish between hierarchical and independent models with tolerable accuracy. It is argued that researchers who wish to use logistic regression as measure of metacognitive sensitivity need to control the primary task criterion and rating criteria...|$|R

40|$|The appraisals of treatment-covariate {{interaction}} have {{theoretical and}} substantial implications in all scientific fields. Methodologically, {{the detection of}} interaction between categorical treatment levels and continuous covariate variables {{is analogous to the}} homogeneity of <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> test in the context of ANCOVA. A fundamental assumption of ANCOVA is that the <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> associating the response variable with the covariate variable are presumed constant across treatment groups. The validity of homogeneous <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> accordingly is the most essential concern in traditional ANCOVA and inevitably determines the practical usefulness of research findings. In view of the limited results in current literature, this article aims to present power and sample size procedures for tests of heterogeneity between two <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> with particular emphasis on the stochastic feature of covariate variables. Theoretical implications and numerical investigations are presented to explicate the utility and advantage for accommodating covariate properties. The exact approach has the distinct feature of accommodating the full distributional properties of normal covariates whereas the simplified approximate methods only utilize the partial information of covariate variances. According to the overall accuracy and robustness, the exact approach is recommended over the approximate methods as a reliable tool in practical applications. The suggested power and sample size calculations can be implemented with the supplemental SAS and R programs...|$|R
40|$|Two new models, the {{covariance}} and <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> models, {{are proposed}} for assessing validity generalization. The new models are less restrictive {{in that they}} require only one hypothetical distribution (distribution of range restriction for the covariance model and distribution of predictor reliability for the <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> model) for their implementation, {{in contrast to the}} correlation model which requires hypothetical distributions for criterion reliability, predictor reliability, and range restriction. The new models, however, are somewhat limited in their applicability since they both assume common metrics for predictors and criteria across validation studies. Several simulation (monte carlo) studies showed the new models to be quite accurate in estimating the mean and variance of population true covariances and regression slopes. The results also showed that the accuracy of the covariance, <b>regression</b> <b>slope,</b> and correlation models is affected by the degree to which hypothetical distributions of artifacts match their true distributions; the <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> model appears to be slightly more robust than the other two models...|$|E

40|$|Aptitude-treatment {{interaction}} (ATI) {{effects are}} present when individuals demonstrate differential outcomes across treatments based upon aptitude—that is, any measurable individual characteristic, attribute, or ability (e. g., anxiety, learning style, motivation, prior knowledge). ATI effects may exist in data from one design {{commonly used in}} psychological and educational research—the two-group pre-post design—in which pre-intervention scores may be considered to reflect individual aptitude. Researchers may mistakenly overlook these effects, however, due to inappropriate analytical approaches. When applying analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), {{it is important to}} check for ANCOVA assumptions, including an assumption known as homogeneity of <b>regression</b> <b>slopes.</b> When heterogeneity of <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> is found, ATI effects are revealed. Consequently, alternative approaches to ANCOVA must be sought. Using formulae based on the Johnson-Neyman procedure to define simultaneous regions of significance is one straightforward alternative. This tutorial outlines the process for analyzing data resulting from two-group pre-post studies when data violate the ANCOVA assumption of homogeneity of <b>regression</b> <b>slopes.</b> What was initially viewed as an obstacle may result in the discovery of an ATI effect, which may be described statistically through simple mathematical calculations...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{strengths}} of the Framingham Heart Study data, provided for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 13, is the long-term survey of phenotypic data. We used this unique data to create new phenotypes representing the pattern of longitudinal change of the provided phenotypes, especially systolic blood pressure and body weight. We performed a linear regression of body weight and systolic blood pressure on age and took the slopes as new phenotypes for quantitative trait linkage analysis using the SOLAR package. There was no evidence for heritability of systolic blood pressure change. Heritability was estimated as 0. 15 for adult life "body weight change", measured as the <b>regression</b> <b>slope,</b> and "body weight gain" (including only individuals with a positive <b>regression</b> <b>slope),</b> and as 0. 22 for body weight "change up to 50 " (<b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> of weight on age up to an age of 50). With multipoint analysis, two regions on the long arm of chromosome 8 showed the highest LOD scores of 1. 6 at 152 cM for "body weight change" and of > 1. 9 around location 102 cM for "body weight gain" and "change up to 50 ".

40|$|The Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect {{describes}} a stimulus-response association of left with small magnitude and right with large magnitude. Usually, {{it is estimated}} by means of <b>regression</b> <b>slopes,</b> where the independent variable only has {{a limited number of}} levels. Inspection of the literature reveals that {{it is not difficult to}} detect a SNARC effect within a group, but it has been quite unusual to find group differences. Is the SNARC effect as it is usually estimated using <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> largely insensitive to group differences, and are there design parameters necessary to increase sensitivity in group comparison analyses? Using numerical simulations, we provide evidence that both sample size and the number of stimulus repetitions, as well as intra-individual variability, contribute in a substantial way to the probability of detecting an existing SNARC effect. Our results show that the adequate choice of either sample size or number of repetitions per experimental cell does not fully compensate for a poor choice of the other parameter. Moreover, repeated failures to find significant group differences in the SNARC effect can be explained by insufficient power. Fortunately, increasing the number of repetitions to about 20 and testing at least 20 participants provides in most cases sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect the SNARC effect as well as group differences. Power plots are provided, which may help to improve both the economy and sensitivity of experimental design in future SNARC experiments, or, more generally when <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> are estimated intra-individually...|$|R

40|$|The {{pressure}} drop across a stenotic vessel {{is an important}} parameter in medicine, providing a commonly used and intuitive metric for evaluating {{the severity of the}} stenosis. However, non-invasive estimation of the {{pressure drop}} under pathological conditions has remained difficult. This study demonstrates a novel method to quantify the irreversible pressure drop across a stenosis using 4 D Flow MRI by calculating the total turbulence production of the flow. Simulation MRI acquisitions showed that the energy lost to turbulence production can be accurately quantified with 4 D Flow MRI within a range of practical spatial resolutions (1 - 3 mm; <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> = 0. 91, R- 2 = 0. 96). The quantification of the turbulence production was not substantially influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resulting in less than 2 % mean bias at SNR amp;gt; 10. Pressure drop estimation based on turbulence production robustly predicted the irreversible pressure drop, regardless of the stenosis severity and post-stenosis dilatation (<b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> = 0. 956, R- 2 = 0. 96). In vitro validation of the technique in a 75 % stenosis channel confirmed that pressure drop prediction based on the turbulence production agreed with the measured pressure drop (<b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> = 1. 15, R- 2 = 0. 999, Bland-Altman agreement = 0. 75 +/- 3. 93 mmHg).
