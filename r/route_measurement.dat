One of the key performance measures is the network's ability to <b>route</b> <b>measurement</b> data from the sensor nodes to the destination node(s).

30|$|Delay {{tomography}} is an {{inference technique}} for link delays in a network, where end-to-end <b>route</b> <b>measurement</b> is a promising method to reduce measurement overhead. Furthermore, by incorporating compressed sensing, delay tomography can efficiently detect sparse anomaly. In delay tomography, however, {{there is an}} inevitable issue that is clock synchronization for the route measurements. In this paper, based on route referencing, we study synchronization-free delay tomography with compressed sensing. From theoretical analysis, optimal route referencing and ordering methods for synchronization-free delay tomography are derived as “subtractive and differential schemes,” which cancel or minimize the error factors caused by clock asynchronism, clock skew, and normal link delays with single or multiple references, respectively. Simulation experiments confirm that the proposed methods can identify abnormal links more accurately with robustness against the error factors than a conventional scheme, where the newly proposed differential scheme always shows the best performance thanks to its better error factors cancelation.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} form of {{physical}} activity for people of all ages is walking, thus the use of active travel modes, such as walking or cycling for school trips, can increase daily physical activity levels. School travel is one way to encourage walking and cycling on a daily basis. Much of the recent literature reports inconsistent results pertaining to how the built environment may relate to active school travel. To date, there is no consistent approach toward conceptualizing the "environment" for its measurement, and this may be partially to blame for the inconsistent results. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold: to examine how characteristics of the built environment might relate to mode of school travel, while testing how measurement of the environment may influence the results in terms of the shortest path or respondent reported route mapping. The results indicate that model parameter estimates vary when using these two <b>route</b> <b>measurement</b> methods.

40|$|An initial {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of platinum addition on the activities of aluminum and nickel in beta-NiAl(Pt) over the temperature range 1354 to 1692 K. These measurements were made with a multiple effusion-cell configured mass spectrometer (multi-cell KEMS). The results of this study show that Pt additions act to decreased alpha(Al) and increased the alpha(Ni) in beta-NiAl(Pt) for constant X(sub Ni) /X(sub Al) approx. = 1. 13, while at constant X(sub Al) the affect of Pt on Al is greatly reduced. The measured partial enthalpies of mixing indicate Al-atoms have a strong self interaction while Ni- and Pt-atoms in have similar interactions with Al-atoms. Conversely the binding of Ni-atoms in beta-NiAl decreases with Pt addition independent of Al concentration. These initial results prove the technique {{can be applied to the}} Ni-Al-Pt system but more activity measurements are required to fully understand the thermodynamics of this system and how Pt additions improved the scaling behavior of nickel-based superalloys. In addition, with the choice of a suitable oxide material for the effusion-cell, the "closed" isothermal nature of the effusion-cell allows the direct investigation of an alloy-oxide equilibrium which resembles the "local-equilibrium" description of the metal-scale interface observed during high temperature oxidation. It is proposed that with an Al(l) + Al 2 O 3 (s) experimental reference state together with the <b>route</b> <b>measurement</b> of the relative partial-pressures of Al(g) and Al 2 O(g) allows the activities of O and Al 2 O 3 to be determined along with the activities of Ni and Al.

3000|$|Network {{tomography}} {{has been}} used to encompass a class of approaches to estimate internal link states from end-to-end <b>route</b> <b>measurements</b> in networks. Especially when packet route delays are measured, network tomography is referred to as “delay tomography,” and recently, it has been applied to the problem of anomaly identification in networks since it alleviates cooperation of internal nodes. In the problem, tomography schemes are often formulated as underdetermined linear systems [6 – 8], and compressed sensing [9, 10] is utilized to solve it, which is a promising technique for reconstructing a finite-dimensional sparse vector based on its linear measurements with dimension smaller than the size of the unknown sparse vector. The probability that multiple anomaly simultaneously occur is considered to be relatively low, so compressed sensing has successfully brought high efficiency into delay tomography for the aforementioned challenge of the active anomaly detection, by reducing the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>routes</b> as compared to the number of links in a given network, that is, by reducing the number of probing packets.

The source of the inconsistency between manikins could be methodological or calibration. Inconsistent measurements dilute the argument for using manikins in place of human subjects. Since manikins are not mass-produced and a variety of designs are in use, a calibration tool is needed to make manikin data credible and prove equivalence to human subject testing.

Objectives: To assess the effects of fasting on the innate immune response against pneumococcal pneumonia and {{to determine the effects of}} maintaining circulating leptin levels on host defense in fasted mice. Methods: C 57 BL/ 6 mice were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 48 h and given an intraperitoneal injection of saline or recombinant leptin (1 �g/g of body weight) twice daily for 48 h before bacterial challenge. Mice were challenged with 105 cfu of Streptococcus pneumoniae via the intranasal <b>route.</b> <b>Measurements</b> and Main Results: Lung homogenate S. pneumoniae burden was nearly 20 -fold greater in the fasted as compared with fed mice. The impairment in bacterial clearance observed in fasted animals was associated with reduced bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts and interleukin- 6 and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 levels. Alveolar macrophages from fasted animals also exhibited defective phagocytosis and killing of S. pneumoniae and reduced calcium-ionophore–stimulated leukotriene B 4 synthesis in vitro. In contrast, the provision of exogenous leptin to fasted animals restored bacterial clearance, bronchoalveolar lavage levels of neutrophils and cytokines, alveolar macrophage bacterial killing, and leukotriene B 4 synthesis.
