40|$|The Swedish {{environmental}} objective to have sustainable forests by 2020 {{will not be}} achieved with current measures taken by the forestry sector. One {{problem is that the}} mandatory environmental considerations are not taken to a satisfactory degree in <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> sites. The ones performing <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> and the taking or not taking of environmental considerations are the forest machine operators. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop understanding about forest machine operators’ practice, how it hinders and facilitates the taking of environmental considerations in <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> from the operators’ own descriptions of their work situation, in answering the questions: What characterizes forest machine operators practice and their task of taking environmental considerations? What type of knowledge and skills are needed in order to take considerations to the environment? How can the development of forest machine operators’ skills and possibilities of taking environmental considerations be understood? Through a theoretical reading of transcripts from seven semi-structured interviews with forest machine operators, answers to these questions are given on the assumption, based on a socio-cultural perspective on practice and practical knowledge, that knowledge, intentions, aims, norms, routines and the meaning given to objects and situations are situated and developed in social interactions. The conditions for the taking of environmental considerations during timber harvesting are also assumed to be limited to the workings and properties inherent to the capitalistic system. This study shows that the lack of considerations to environmental values in regeneration sites are not due to forest machine operators' lack of competence or that the forest machine operators have unfavorable attitudes towards environmental preservation. But during <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> operators need to balance the task of taking environmental considerations with other tasks. It is operators’ practical knowledge of recognizing environmental values and their skills of operating harvesting machines in varying forest landscapes that enables and guides the taking of environmental considerations. But considerations to environmental values are limited by the frames of harvesting practices and by the reality of timber production in a global capitalistic system. This study shows that the development of forest machine operators’ knowledge and skills on how to consider environmental values, are better facilitated when operators’ actions are acknowledged, questioned and analyzed in dialogue between operators, and managers of timber harvesting and environmental consideration with respect and sensibility for the others expertise and identity...|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} natural regeneration of deciduous forest at exposed sites in Czech military forests (division Lipník nad Bečvou), forest district Velký Újezd. The main goals {{of this study}} were to evaluate success of different-aged natural regeneration stands at different exposures (north, south, east, and west). In case of all analysed naturally regenerated stands, the Fagus sylvatica species is dominated, the Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia cordata, Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer platanoides are admixed species. Under parent stands, the highest natural regeneration density was detected at north exposure sites (222, 500 piece/ha with the highest proportion of individuals in the height class of 1 - 20 cm). In two years naturally regenerated growths (in the open sites), the highest density of regenerated young individuals was detected at west exposure sites (115, 000 piece/ha), with the highest proportion of regenerated individuals in 2 [...] 3 meter height class. The characteristics of all investigated stands of natural regeneration fulfil the criteria for reforestation according to norm no. 139 / 2004 Sb. § 2.

40|$|Determining how {{tropical}} tree populations {{subject to}} selective felling (logging) pressure may be conserved {{is a crucial}} issue for forest management and studying this issue requires a comprehensive understanding {{of the relationships between}} population demography and gene flow. We used a simulation model, SELVA, to study (1) the relative impact of demographic factors (juvenile mortality, felling regime) and genetic factors (selfing, number and location of fathers, mating success) on long-term genetic diversity; and (2) the impact of different felling regimes on population size versus genetic diversity. Impact was measured by means of model sensitivity analyses. Juvenile mortality had the highest impact on the number of alleles and genotypes, and on the genetic distance between the original and final populations. Selfing had the greatest impact on observed heterozygote frequency and fixation index. Other factors and interactions had only minor effects. Overall, felling had a greater impact on population size than on genetic diversity. Interestingly, populations under relatively low felling pressure even had a somewhat lower fixation index than undisturbed populations (no felling). We conclude that demographic processes such as juvenile mortality should be modelled thoroughly to obtain reliable long-term predictions of genetic diversity. Mortality in selfed and outcrossed progenies should be modelled explicitly by taking inbreeding depression into account. The modelling of selfing based on population rate appeared to be oversimplifying and should account for inter-tree variation. Forest management should pay particular attention to the <b>regeneration</b> capacities of <b>felled</b> species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The analyzed mature stands were degraded coppice and mainly predominated by the Turkey oak in the tree stratum. In juvenile stands, often initially well regenerated with Turkey oak, the dominant species in the tree stratum are lime, hornbeam, flowering ash, field maple and other secondary species, predominantly of coppice origin. Restitution of the degraded stands is possible by applying an adequate regeneration system.

40|$|New forest damages", often {{attributed}} to air-borne pollutants, are a complex, multi-cause {{process in which}} current silvicultural regimes have a decisive role. The treatment of stands has changed considerably in the time during which agrarian societies have developed into industrializing and post-industrialized welfare ones, and the commodity and timber production functions of the forest have changed to protective and social functions. On the side of forest management, economic success has become a secondary criterion next to protection and social values. As a consequence, tree stands have become denser and older. Under the glooming threat of pollution, the preservation principle, with an aim to preserve stands at full density and postpone the <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> as far as possible, {{is becoming more and}} more popular. In over-dense and -mature stands, increasing numbers of trees lose their vitality and die under the stress of insects, diseases, and pollutants.

40|$|Similar {{to other}} Apennine areas, a {{considerable}} increase of wild ungulate density {{has been observed}} in the past decades in the Bisenzio valley (province of Prato), leading to a strong impact on coppice <b>regeneration.</b> In some <b>felling</b> areas, the prolonged browsing on young suckers turned the stumps into low and dense bushes, thus threatening {{the survival of the}} forest stand and triggering a loss of environmental stability. The aim of this work was to study the impact of deer on sprout regeneration after cutting in mixed coppices felled in the period 2007 - 2010 and characterized by the dominance of chestnut, hornbeam, Turkey oak, and beech. Some 36 plots were established in four municipal districts of the Prato province (Cantagallo, Vernio, Montemurlo, Vaiano). Damage and browsing intensity on each stump were evaluated using an index that allowed the comparison among different areas and fores stand types. Regardless of the species, over 90 % of the sprouts revealed a very strong damage, whereas only 6 % did not exhibit any damage. A significant difference in the sprout height was detected between browsed and non-browsed areas. Despite a high incidence of damage in all the studied areas, chestnut showed a greater resilience against browsing. In summary, overgrazing by wild game may determine severe contraints to the evolutionary dynamics of forest stands, frustrating the effects of silvicultural practices. The possible benefits of the implementation of a large-scale integrated wildlife plan, including hunting and forest-evironmental management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study, the {{selected}} wood and fiber properties were investigated in terms of their occurrence and variation in wood, as well as their relevance from the perspective of thermomechanical pulping process and related end-products. It was concluded that the most important factors were the fiber dimensions, juvenile wood content, and in some cases, the content of heartwood being associated with extremely dry wood with low permeability in spruce. With respect to the above properties, the following three pulpwood assortments of which pulping potential was assumed to vary were formed: wood from regeneration cuttings, first-thinnings wood, and sawmill chips. In the experimental part of the study the average wood and fiber characteristics and their variation were determined for each raw material group prior to pulping. Subsequently, each assortment - equaling about 1500 m 3 roundwood - was pulped separately for a 24 h period, at constant process conditions. The properties of obtained newsgrade thermomechanical pulps were then determined. Thermomechanical pulping (TMP) from sawmill chips had the highest proportion of long fibers, smallest proportion of fines, and had generally the coarsest and longest fibers. TMP from first-thinnings wood was just the opposite, whereas that from <b>regeneration</b> cuttings <b>fell</b> in between the above two extremes. High proportion of dry heartwood in wood originating from regeneration cuttings produced a slightly elevated shives content. However, no differences were found in pulp specific energy consumption. The obtained pulp tear index was clearly best in TMP made from sawmill chips and poorest in pulp from first-thinnings wood, which had generally inferior strength properties. No dramatical differences in any of the strength properties were found between pulp from sawmill residual wood and regeneration cuttings. Pulp optical properties were superior in TMP from first-thinnings. Unexpectedly, no noticeable differences, which could be explained with fiber morphology, were found in sheet density, bulk, air permeance or roughness between the three pulps. The most important wood quality factors in this study were the fiber length, fiber cross-sectional dimensions and percentage juvenile wood. Differences found in the quality of TMP manufactured from the above spruce assortments suggest that they could be segregated and pulped separately to obtain specific product characteristics, i. e., for instance tailor-made end-products, and to minimize unnecessary variation in the raw material quality, and hence, pulp quality...|$|R

This operation used mechanised harvesting in tree sizes with a mean dbh of 42 cm amongst well developed natural <b>regeneration.</b> Motor manual <b>felling</b> was required for trees beyond the capacity of harvester felling, due to diameter and/or coarse branching. Shortwood harvesting was carried out {{with the aim of}} removing the overstorey and releasing the well developed (natural regeneration) understorey. A John Deere 1270 D harvester was used for felling and timber extraction was carried out with a John Deere 1110 D forwarder. The mature overstorey included many large trees, consequently mechanised harvester outputs were high at 30. 15 m 3 OB/shr 1 at a cost of £ 2. 30 per m 3 OB. Motor manual felling and partial processing to assist the harvester produced an output of 8. 50 m 3 OB/shr at a cost of £ 3. 07 per m 3 OB (an addition of £ 0. 35 per m 3 OB proportionally across the study area).

40|$|Forestry {{and forest}} {{products}} are vital {{components of the}} Swedish economy but the forest is also important for recreation, hunting, out-door life and conserving biodiversity. The Swedish Forest Act has two equally important objectives, production and environmental protection. Polytax is the Swedish Forest Agency´s inventory programme which monitors progress toward the two objectives in connection with regeneration fellings. It includes data on environmental protection measures taken in connection with regeneration fellings. 30 § of the Swedish Forestry Act and related regulations specify the demands for conserva-tion of nature. Modern forestry creates monocultures and to counteract that Swedish fore-stry has introduced a number of biodiversity-orientated management practices. One of them is Green-tree retention cutting (GTR) which is a modification of traditional clear-cutting and implies that some living trees are left on the cut area. The Swedish model of forestry builds on three different levels of conservation, general conservation consideration in all forest operations, voluntarily protected areas and site pro-tection. The purpose of the general conservation consideration is {{to pay attention to}} natural and historical environments and social values. It is based on § 30 of the Swedish Forestry Act. One category of the general conservation is nature trees, which is trees that have an obvious nature- or culture-value. The category involves living trees, dead trees, logs and natural or created snags. Nature trees are supposed to function as “lifeboats” for species and processes during the regeneration phase. The density of nature trees in mature forests reflects the management history during the last 80 - 100 years. For the formulation of guide-lines and requirements for tree retention {{it is important to be}} aware of changes in this den-sity, because it affects both the conservation possibilities and the conservation value of tree retention. The first purpose of this study is to evaluate how the density of nature trees varies over time (1999 - 2009). The second purpose is to see how much consideration has been given to these trees at <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> during the same time period. The results show that it is a significant difference between the first five year-period and the last five years.

40|$|Even though {{stumpwood}} {{may become}} {{a significant part of}} the future fuel mix for combined heat and power plants in Sweden, the harvesting of stumps after <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> is still only performed on a trial basis. Results from time studies on two, 23 tonne, excavators fitted for stump lifting, together with follow-up data on stump lifting and forwarding, are presented. Lifting, splitting, and piling the stumps accounted for 17, 32, and 32 %, respectively, of the total productive work time. A predictive model was developed to estimate operational times and productivities when lifting pine and spruce stumps. Stump diameter, species, and terrain conditions contributed significantly to the fit of the model. The model predicts that productivity of stump lifting in spruce sites with easy terrain conditions and average stump diameters of 20 and 40 cm will be 1. 23 and 4. 19 oven-dry tonnes (ODT) per productive work hour, respectively. This is 43 % higher than in pine sites with difficult terrain conditions and the same diameters.

Los resultados mostraron que las tendencias en las variables meteorológicas se ajustaron al comportamiento que éstas normalmente exhiben en bosques de similares características. BV presentó diferencias estadísticamente significativas con SD en todas las variables microclimáticas, excepto con Ta, y durante los períodos de receso vegetativo con Tmina, TS 15 y TS 30. En CR se produjeron cambios estadísticamente significativos respecto a BV en las variables RSG, HRa, TS 15, TS 30 (solamente durante período receso vegetativo) y V. Las mayores diferencias encontradas entre BV y CR fueron que RSG aumentó en promedio 4, 4 y 3, 5 veces en CR durante períodos de crecimiento y receso vegetativo, respectivamente; y que la V aumentó 1, 2 veces en CR. Las diferencias en las condiciones microclimáticas registradas sugieren que en CR se verifica un microclima distinto al del BV. Debido a que el microclima y el balance hídrico en el rodal influyen en la vegetación, las disparidades encontradas entre BV y CR son importantes y entregan una base útil para evaluar las implicancias de la práctica forestal más utilizada en estos bosques. The {{forest microclimate}} in a Nothofagus pumilio primary forest (BV) {{and the effect}} of a <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> (RG) and an open field (SD) were studied during seven years. Three weather stations measured the global solar radiation (RSG), the air temperature (Ta), the soil temperature at 15 (TS 15) and 30 (TS 30) cm depth, the relative humidity (HRa) and the wind speed (V). The results showed that the trends in meteorological variables were similar to those found in forests with similar characteristics. Almost all meteorological variables recorded in BV showed statistical differences, compared to SD, with the exception of Ta, and during the leafless period with Tmina (minimum air temperature) TS 15 and TS 30. When CR was compared to BV the variables RSG, HRa, TS 15, TS 30 (only during leafless period) and V showed significant differences. The higher differences between BV and CR were that in CR the RSG was 4. 4 and 3. 5 times higher than in BV, for the fully-leaved and the leafless period; and V was 1. 2 times higher in CR than in BV. These differences suggest that the microclimate in CR changed respect BV.

40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{in stone}} pine (Pinus pinea L.) managed {{forests in the}} Spanish Northern Plateau is not achieved successfully under current silviculture practices, constituting a main concern for forest managers. We modelled spatio-temporal features of primary dispersal to test whether (a) present low stand densities constrain natural regeneration success and (b) seed release is a climate-controlled process. The present study is based on data collected from a 6 years seed trap experiment considering different <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> intensities. From a spatial perspective, we attempted alternate established kernels under different data distribution assumptions to fit a spatial model able to predict P. pinea seed rain. Due to P. pinea umbrella-like crown, models were adapted to account for crown effect through correction of distances between potential seed arrival locations and seed sources. In addition, individual tree fecundity was assessed independently from existing models, improving parameter estimation stability. Seed rain simulation enabled to calculate seed dispersal indexes for diverse silvicultural regeneration treatments. The selected spatial model of best fit (Weibull, Poisson assumption) predicted a highly clumped dispersal pattern {{that resulted in a}} proportion of gaps where no seed arrival is expected (dispersal limitation) between 0. 25 and 0. 30 for intermediate intensity regeneration fellings and over 0. 50 for intense fellings. To describe the temporal pattern, the proportion of seeds released during monthly intervals was modelled as a function of climate variables – rainfall events – through a linear model that considered temporal autocorrelation, whereas cone opening took place over a temperature threshold. Our findings suggest the application of less intensive regeneration fellings, to be carried out after years of successful seedling establishment and, seasonally, subsequent to the main rainfall period (late fall). This schedule would avoid dispersal limitation and would allow for a complete seed release. These modifications in present silviculture practices would produce a more efficient seed shadow in managed stands...|$|E

The <b>regeneration</b> <b>felling</b> was marked and subsequently performed in the same year. This stand was affected by wind storm in November 2004. The stand condition was evaluated in 2005. The total area secured by natural regeneration was 0. 17 ha. The rest of the plot (0. 08 ha), in form of scattered spots, showed no signs of natural regeneration. The analysis in 2010 confirmed that whole stand area including PRP was secured by natural regeneration of climax tree species (fir, spruce) and pioneer tree species (birch, goat willow). The height growth dynamics analysis of selected plots showed the same rate of height growth of both climax tree species in the advance growth stage. The height growth of spruce individuals was significantly higher in thicket growth stage. The fir maintains the position of middle and lower layer in vertical profile of advance growth stage or thicket respectively. There was determined successive birch invasion followed by consecutive arrival (with 2 [...] 3 years delay) of goat willow on the plot secured by regeneration of pioneer tree species. The average height of birch individuals was 4. 01 m in time span from its origin in 2005 to presence. It represented the same height value as spruce had reached, that was in advance growth phase during the windstorm impact.

All of the stands had a low bearing sub – soils – flysch sandstone. This affected the rut depth after both machines passage. Rut depth indicated severe damage to the stand soil. We also observed severe differences in CO 2 content of the compacted soil. Measurements in all of the stands showed a significant increase in CO 2 content after its compression. Unimpaired soil reaches volume of 0. 3 % and rut soil reaches 1. 8 %. The compressed soils contained 6 x the CO 2 of uncompressed soils. The results of statistical analysis show, that moisture content affects the CO 2 content more than bulk density. Coeficients of correlation between CO 2 and moisture content were r = 0. 68 and 0. 52 and between CO 2 and balk density were r = 0. 26 and 0. 36. Increase in moisture content causes CO 2 accumulation. Combined effects of these two characteristics are significant and show very strong correlation.
