She tried to make Ruby seem [...] "as innocent as possible" [...] to make viewers question her true allegiance, and to [...] "bring more of a humanity" [...] to Ruby than Cassidy had.

The actress also acknowledged that Ruby was likely manipulating Sam when she claimed to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> felt to be human, but suggested that {{there was also an}} element of truth to her character's words.|$|E

And there is this street out by his house that is called Hooba Street or something like that and before Doug could pronounce the name, he called it Hoobastank and it was kinda a cute thing and his brother still teases him about it to this day. When we were looking for band names it's almost impossible to find a band name that hasn't been taken. Anything remotely normal has been taken already.
