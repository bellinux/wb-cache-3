Chicago mayor Harold Washington's administration had passed an edict that 30% of the work for public sector projects be set aside for minority and women-owned businesses.

5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} not contesting the election because {{the area was}} a Conservative stronghold, the Liberals decided {{to do so in}} order to generate a discussion on the issue of Home <b>Rule</b> <b>for</b> Ireland. Allsopp was in agreement with the Conservative policy, which was to maintain full governmental control over Ireland, and pass further Coercion Acts to reduce lawlessness in that country. Sanders, who had lost two previous elections for the Liberal Party, was in favour of devolution of powers to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian rule in Palestine {{resulted}} {{in the destruction of}} Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.|$|E

5|$|In 212, the constitutio Antoniniana (Antonine decree) of emperor Caracalla granted Roman {{citizenship}} {{to all the}} free inhabitants of the Empire– the peregrini– thus abolishing their second-class status. But {{there is no evidence}} that the citizens-only <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> legions was also abolished at this time. The legions simply gained a much wider recruitment base, as they were now able to recruit any male free resident of the empire. Auxiliary units were now recruited mainly from Roman citizens, but probably continued to recruit non-citizen barbari from outside the Empire's borders. However, the citizens-only <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> legions appears to have been dropped some time during the 3rd century, as by the 4th-century Romans and barbarians are found serving together in all units.|$|E

5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> the next 200 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Basil I to {{the throne}} in 867 {{marks the beginning of}} the Macedonian dynasty, which would <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> the next two and a half centuries.

5|$|The <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> the {{automaton}} {{within each}} of these subsets is equivalent (except for a shift by half a cell per time step) to another elementary cellular automaton, Rule 102, in which the new state of each cell is the exclusive or of its old state and its right neighbor.

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
