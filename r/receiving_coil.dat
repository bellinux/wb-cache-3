The second concept—referred to as free positioning—does not require the user to place the Mobile Device in direct alignment with the transmitting coil. There are several ways to achieve free positioning. In one example a bundle of transmitting coils is used to generate a magnetic field at the location of the <b>receiving</b> <b>coil</b> only.

Materials and methods: The new phase and amplitude (PA) decoupling method is implemented {{in a clinical}} 3 T-MRI system equipped with a parallel transmit array system. For RF excitation, two transmit coils are used in combination with a single <b>receive</b> <b>coil.</b> The transmit coil is geometrically decoupled from the <b>receive</b> <b>coil,</b> and the remaining B 1 -induced voltages in the <b>receive</b> <b>coil</b> during CEA are minimized by the second transmit coil using a careful adjustment of the phase and amplitude settings in this coil. Isolation of the decoupling scheme and transmit noise behavior are analyzed for different loading conditions, and a CEA MRI experiment is performed in a rubber phantom with sub-millisecond T 2 * and in an ex vivo animal. Results: Geometrical (20  dB) and PA decoupling (50  dB) provided a total isolation of 70  dB between the transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>coils.</b> Integration of a low-noise RF amplifier was necessary to minimize RF transmit noise.

50|$|Laterolog tools send an {{electric}} current from an electrode on the sonde {{directly into the}} formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode {{in order to maintain}} a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud. Induction logs use {{an electric}} coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a <b>receiving</b> <b>coil</b> located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the <b>receiving</b> <b>coil</b> is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of 40 in. Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of MRI has created a demand for high quality images for current and emerging applications. High quality images are currently acquired by using application specific <b>receive</b> <b>coils</b> that fit close to the patient’s body to produce high signal to noise ratio.

One way to achieve a very lightweight and thin coil is to fabricate it from solution using printed electronics.

The materials used to fabricate the coil components are identified as a main avenue for improvement. A fully printed proof-of-concept array is made to demonstrate feasibility and is used to image a volunteer on a 3 T clinical system. Coils are optimized with components made from high quality flexible substrates to make better performing printed coils and arrays.
