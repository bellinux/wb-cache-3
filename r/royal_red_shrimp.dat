Catch rates of the <b>royal</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> were standardized using Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Preliminary analysis on goodness-of-fit indicates that Gamma distribution was the most adequate to model catch rates as response variable on this specie. The dataset was obtained from logbooks of the commercial fishing trawl between 2002 and 2008. The proposed model explained 18 % of the total deviance, and temporal and spatial factors included (year, months, area and depth), were highly significant (p < 0. 01). Since 2005, the catch rate shows an increment on their values {{as a consequence of}} a decrease in fishing effort. Catch rates also show monthly variations, with higher values during spring-summer 53 kg per trawl hour (kg ha- 1) and lower in winter, with 40 kg ha- 1. At spatial scale, the standardized catch rates show higher values for those hauls carried out over 500 m of depth and between 33 º 53 ’S- 34 º 41 ’S. The current analysis produces a standardized catch rate time series for the <b>royal</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery. This time series can be used as an abundance index to calibrate stock assessment models.

Sound production by white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus) was studied acoustically and behaviorally. Another crustacean-like signal from the Gulf of Mexico was analyzed, and the use of passive sonar for the detection and stock assessment of shrimp fisheries species was discussed. Video and audio recordings were made of captive white shrimp. Audio recordings were made of wild populations in the bays and channels of Galveston, TX, and simultaneously taken trawl data were used to verify species. Results showed that captive white shrimp make detectable sound via three behaviors. The most important signal was produced when shrimp were eating (40 ms, 2 - 8 kHz, 112 dB re 1 [] at 1 m). Wild and captive spectra were similar (r= 0. 7 to 0. 8), suggesting that accurate passive sonar detection of wild shrimp is possible. Data from recordings made in the Gulf of Mexico of another crustacean-like signal were analyzed and compared to white shrimp signals. Waveforms and acoustic envelopes were similar (r= 0. 9). The unknown had a slightly narrower bandwidth than white shrimp at 3 dB down of the magnitude spectrum squared (2. 42 kHz vs 3. 5 kHz) and showed an upward shift in peak frequency (5. 6 kHz vs 4. 7 kHz). Acoustic data, water depth, and location suggested that the unknown signal might be produced by a deepwater shrimp, possibly <b>royal</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pleoticus robustus), but verification of the species was not possible. The data further support the use of passive sonar for the detection of fisheries shrimp. Assessment of shrimp population densities may be possible using either the number of signals /time/area, or amplitude changes/area. Research with either of two methods was suggested: (1) captive research tested with field studies, or (2) modeling of population densities using towed hydrophone array directionality and beam patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify the potential of new deep-sea fisheries in the Colombian Caribbean Sea determining their biomass and spatial distribution in order to advice management and conservation strategies, based on ecosystem approach to fisheries management. First, I examine morphological characteristics of the shallow water pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis to investigate stock differentiation, presenting biological data such as size at 50 % sexual maturity. The data onF. notialis were obtained from samples collected from June to December 2004, on board of commercial fishing vessels and from a time series of historic landings of catch and effort data. I did not find morphometric variability between the studied regions, which indicates the existence of a single population of F. notialis from a morphometric point of view. This study provides the first complete view, to date, of the stock structure and fishery dynamics of the pink shrimp F. notialis in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. This fishery is a typical case in which high exploitation, combined with non-existent fisheries management, have resulted in the significant depletion of stock. In response to this, I investigate possible new fishing areas, exploring the poorly understood deep sea habitats in the Colombian Caribbean Sea, to determine the potential for a viable deep-sea crustacean fishery. The sampling area extended from 100 m the isobaths to 600 m depth. I found high abundances ofthe giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea), the <b>royal</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pleoticus robustus), the pink speckled deep-sea shrimp (Penaeopsis serrata) and the deep-sea lobster (Metanephrops binghami) obtained in two experimental trawl surveys carried out in November and December 2009, all of which are important commercially. The highest biomassess of these deep-sea crustaceans species were found mainly in the northern zone of the Colombian Caribbean Sea, where the local oceanography is modulated by high productive seasonal upwelling. However, further scientific assessment is necessary to determine population life cycle parameters of these deep-sea crustaceans and associated biodiversity before initiating a new commercial fishery. Studies of deep-sea biodiversity are necessary {{in order to understand the}} degree of stability and vulnerability of deep-sea environments and enable comparison of conditions before and after exploitation of the fishery. This will enable a better understanding of the ecosystem, to advise ecosystem-based conservation and fisheries management strategies. The aim of thislaststudy was to identify deep-sea fish assemblages across a depth range of 200 - 550 m from the Colombian Caribbean Sea and their implications for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Classification (Cluster analysis) and ordination (non-parametric multidimensional scaling NMDS) were performed to identify deep-sea fish assemblages. A total of 102 species (13 Chondrichthyes and 89 Teleosteans) and 58 families (9 Chondrichthyes and 49 Teleosteans) of deep-sea fish were sampled. This study reveals the existence of three deep-sea fish assemblages and demostrates that depth plays an important role in ichthyofaunal differentiation. I conclude that, the management of the shallow shrimp fishery and the potential new deep-sea crustacean fishery should be based on an ecosystem approach that considers population dynamics and structure, the optimum allocation of catches and effort, protection of nursery and spawning areas, the development of monitoring strategies and the care of ecosystems...|$|E

Species Description These shrimp are very small, with males reaching only 8 - 10 mm and females reaching 11 - 16 mm. They have large, stalked eyes and eight pairs of legs. They are typically red to orange in color due to pigmented cells called chromatophores; however, coloration can be highly variable and change with varying light and temperature conditions. Some individuals lack color completely and are ivory or translucent. Without a microscope, the best way to distinguish the bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> from other shrimp is by counting legs — it has eight pairs of legs, while most other larger shrimps and decapods have five pairs.

All predictors individually have an impact on LPUE, though some of them lose their predictive power when considered jointly. That is the case of the NAO index. Our results show that six variables from the whole set can be incorporated into a global model with a total explained deviance (ED) of 43 %.

Aristeus antennatus), {{reported}} in the deep water bottom trawl fishery developed on the Sóller fishing ground off northern Mallorca (Western Mediterranean), and the mean ocean surface vorticity in the surrounding areas are compared between 2000 and 2010. A good correlation is found between the rises in the surrounding surface vorticity and the drops in the CPUE of the adult <b>red</b> <b>shrimp.</b> This correlation {{could be explained by}} assuming that most of the surface vorticity episodes could reach the bottom, increasing the seabed velocities and producing sediment resuspension, which could affect the near bottom water turbidity. A. antennatus would respond to this increased turbidity disappearing from the fishing grounds, probably moving downwards to the deeper waters. This massive displacement of <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> specimens away from the fishing grounds would consequently decrease their accessibility to fishing exploitation. Similar although more intense responses have been observed during the downslope shelf dense water current episodes that occurred in a submarine canyon, northeast of the Iberian peninsula. The proposed mechanism suggesting how the surface vorticity observed can affect the bottom sediments is investigated using a year-long moored near-bottom current meter and a sediment trap moored near the fishing grounds. The relationship between vorticity and catches is also explored for fish species (. Galeus melastomus, Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides) and other crustacean (. Geryon longipes and Nephrops norvegicus), considered as by-catch of the deep water fishery in the area.

Available annual catch per unit effort, recruitment and spawning stock biomass {{have been used as}} biological data. As environmental data, the meso- scale IDEA index and the large-scale North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) indices have been used. To analyze possible links between these indices with the population dynamics of demersal resources, two non-linear approaches have been applied: (i) stock–recruitment relationships from Ricker and Beverton–Holt models, by sequentially incorporating environment factors; (ii) generalized additive modelling, both classical general and threshold non-additive models were considered. The latter simulate an abrupt change in explicative variables across different phases (time periods or climatic index values). The results have shown that two oceanographic scenarios around the Balearic Islands, associated with macro and meso-scale climate regimes, can influence the population dynamics of hake and <b>red</b> <b>shrimp.</b> This is especially true for recruitment, which seems to be enhanced during low NAO and IDEA indices periods. During these periods, colder-than-normal winters generate high amounts of cold Western Mediterranean Intermediate Waters (WIW) in the Gulf of Lions, which flow southwards and reach the Balearic Islands channels in spring, increasing the productivity in the area. This oceanographic scenario could also be favourable to the distribution of hake on the fishing grounds where the trawl fleet targets this species, increasing its accessibility to the fishery. Both spawning stock and abundance of <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> seems to be also enhanced by high MO index periods, which could reflect the increased presence of the saline and warm Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) in the study area, extending over the fishing grounds of this species.

In NE Spain it is fished by bottom trawling at the depths between 200 m and 900 m, and the fishing grounds are allocated around the margins of a system of submarine canyons, where it constitutes the only target species. This fishery is characterized by marked seasonality, with higher levels of landings occurring in summer. Combining Vessel Monitoring System data (VMS) with daily landings has the potential to substitute logbook data for stock evaluations, avoiding human error or misreporting. Also, when landings per size class are available, this approach allows the identification of the critical areas and/or periods for the exploitation of the smallest size classes in the population, constituting the basis for specific management decisions such as the establishment of protected areas or temporary fishery closures. The main objective {{of this study was to}} map and investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of the landings per size class of <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the fishing grounds of two of the main fishing ports of NE Spain, Blanes and PalamósPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A tagging {{experiment}} of {{the blue}} and <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Aristeus antennatus {{was carried out in}} the Ionian Sea, off Roccella Jonica (RC). The experiment involved 45 shrimps, caught by trawling at night at about 100 - 150 m in depth. One month after tagging one specimen was recaptured at about 10 nautical miles from the releasing point. As the first case of tagged recaptured deep sea shrimp, this experiment brings important results about the feasibility of experimental studies on displacement and growth and gives the first direct proof of the migratory abilities A. antennatus...|$|R
50|$|However, {{compared}} to the ocean and other known naturally occurring mineral resources in the world, Soap Lake still has the highest diverse mineral content of any body {{of water on the}} planet. Soap Lake water also contains ichthyols, an oil-like substance sold over the counter in Europe to treat infections and abrasions. The icthyol in Soap Lake water most likely come from decomposition of tiny brine-like <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> that flourish in the water from late spring to mid-summer. Like the Dead Sea, the high mineral content of the lake makes the water very buoyant.|$|R
40|$|Larval {{stages of}} protozoeas II and III and zoea I of Aristeus antennatus {{were found in}} low numbers near the <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshing grounds off the Balearic Islands. The {{discovery}} of the larvae in the upper water layers {{has led to a}} proposed model of reproductive dynamics, in which newly hatched larvae perform an ontogenetic migration up through the water column to surface waters, where the larval stages develop. Data on the horizontal distribution of larvae presented, can contribute {{to an understanding of the}} dynamics processes of larval dispersal of the zoeal stagesPublicado...|$|R
