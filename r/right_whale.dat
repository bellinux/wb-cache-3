5|$|Cetotheriidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (Caperea marginata). The first descriptions {{date back to the}} 1840s of bones and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> and was named Balaena marginata. In 1864, it was moved into the genus Caperea after a skull of another specimen was discovered. Six years later, the pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was classified under the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is more genetically similar to rorquals and gray whales than to right whales. A study published in 2012, based on bone structure, moved the pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> from the family Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> than to the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the {{conservation}} {{status of the}} North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to conclude the three living <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.|$|E

5000|$|North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> {{are highly}} endangered. In the early 1900s, the {{population}} was reduced to {{only a few hundred}} whales as a result of commercial whaling. [...] Although whales were protected from commercial whaling since 1935, the population still has not fully recovered. In 2011 the population of western North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> estimated about 465 whales. [...] Despite recent small growth in population, the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> remain critically endangered. Unfortunately, the eastern North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are nearly extinct.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} marine mammal {{species have been}} shown to {{conserve}} energy by using negative buoyancy to power prolonged descent glides during dives. A new non-invasive tag attached to North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> recorded swim stroke from changes in pitch angle derived from a three-axis accelerometer. These results show that <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are positively buoyant near the surface, a finding that has significant implications for both energetics and management. Some of the most powerful fluke strokes observed in tagged <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> occur as they counteract this buoyancy as they start a dive. By contrast, <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> use positive buoyancy to power glides during ascent. <b>Right</b> <b>whales</b> appear to use their positive buoyancy for more efficient swimming and diving. However, this buoyancy may pose added risks of vessel collision. Such collisions are the primary source of anthropogenic mortality for North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> whose population is critically endangered and declining. Buoyancy may impede diving responses to oncoming vessels and <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> may have a reduced ability to manoeuvre during free ascents. These risk factors can inform efforts to avoid collisions...|$|R
5|$|In Brazil, Imbituba in Santa Catarina {{has been}} {{recognized}} as the National <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> Capital and holds annual <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> Week celebrations in September when mothers and calves are more often seen. The old whaling station there has been converted to a museum dedicated to the whales. In winter in Argentina, Península Valdés in Patagonia hosts the largest breeding population of the species, with more than 2,000 animals catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{leading cause}} of death among the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> which migrates through some of the world's busiest {{shipping}} lanes while journeying off the east coast of the United States and Canada, is being struck by ships. At least 16 ship-strike deaths were reported between 1970 and 1999, and probably more remain unreported. According to NOAA, 25 of the 71 <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is {{now officially}} in the Eubalaena genus, the type species for a genus remains {{as it was}} first {{described}} – {{in the case of}} Eubalaena the type species is Balaena australis Desmoulins, 1822.|$|E
25|$|No coastal {{or other}} {{wintering}} ground {{has been found}} for North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b> Which factors cause <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> not to favor inshore waters is unknown.|$|R

5|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 15 mysticete species. One species—the North Atlantic right whale—is Endangered {{with only}} around 400(±50) {{individuals}} left, and four more are also classified as Endangered (North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> the blue whale, the fin whale, and the Sei whale), and another 5 ranked as Data deficient (Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, Omura's whale, Southern minke whale, and pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale).</b> Species {{that live in}} polar habitats are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} ongoing climate change, particularly declines in sea ice, as well as ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|The Stellwagen Bank {{area has}} {{implemented}} an autobuoy program to acoustically detect right whales in the Boston Approaches and notify mariners via the <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> Listening Network website.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{is easily}} {{confused}} with minke whales {{because of their}} similar characteristics, such as their small size, dark gray tops, light gray bottoms, and light eye-patches.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, newly {{discovered}} documents {{revealed that the}} total illegal catch was even larger. The accounting based on that information showed that the Soviet whaling fleets caught 529 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> from 1962 to 1968 in the eastern North Pacific, plus 152 more <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1967 and 1968, {{for a total of}} 661 <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b> Catches were distributed in the Bering Sea (115), eastern Aleutian Islands (28), Gulf of Alaska (366), Sea of Okhotsk (132), and other areas (20). Detailed information on catches of 112 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> taken in May/June 1963 shows a broad distribution in offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska, consistent with 19th century historical whaling records. Other major areas in which <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> were caught include south of Kodiak Island, western Bristol Bay (southeastern Bering Sea), and the central Sea of Okhotsk off eastern Sakhalin Island. The catches primarily involved large mature animals, thus greatly inhibiting recovery of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in these regions.|$|R
50|$|Sightings {{in recent}} yearsAerial and {{shipboard}} surveys are conducted annually {{to locate and}} record seasonal distribution of North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> along the northeast and southeast United States coast. Researchers identify individual <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> document whale behavior, monitor new calves, and respond to entangled whales. The surveys {{have been used to}} produce seasonal maps showing the density of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> (number of animals per square kilometer) throughout the U.S. east coast and Nova Scotia.|$|R
25|$|The {{focus of}} the North Pacific whaling fleet on <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> ended soon after 1848, when a whaler ventured through the Bering Straits and {{discovered}} unexploited populations of bowhead whales. Being more abundant, easier to capture, and yielding far more baleen, the majority of whalers rapidly switched to hunting bowheads. Since bowheads range further north than <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> hunting pressure on <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> declined rapidly.|$|R
5|$|The {{southern}} <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{spends the}} summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> shares several {{characteristics}} {{with the}} right whales, although having dorsal fins separates them from right whales, {{and they have a}} very distinctive jaw configuration. Pygmy right whales' heads are no more than one-fourth the size of their bodies, whereas the right whales' heads are about one-third the size of their bodies.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{species of}} <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was {{proposed}} by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century - the so-called Swedenborg whale. The description {{of this species}} {{was based on a}} collection of fossil bones unearthed at Norra Vånga, Sweden, in 1705 and believed to be those of giants. The bones were examined by Swedenborg, who realized they belong to a species of whale. The existence of this species has been debated, and further evidence for this species was discovered during the construction of a motorway in Strömstad, Sweden in 2009. To date, however, scientific consensus still considers Hunterius swedenborgii to be a North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> According to a DNA analysis conducted by scientists, it was later confirmed that the fossil bones are actually from a bowhead whale.|$|E
25|$|Historic whaling is {{the reason}} North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are so {{endangered}} today. The two critical periods of whaling were 1839 to 1849 (pelagic whaling, 90% American ships) and 1963 to 1968 (illegal Soviet whaling). The illegal Soviet whaling in the 1960s killed 514 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska to plus 136 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the Sea Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands.|$|R

Since bowheads range further north than <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> hunting pressure on <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> declined rapidly.|$|R
5|$|As {{it became}} clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, {{although}} violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued {{off the coast of}} Brazil for many years and the Imbituba land station processed <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.|$|R
5|$|The North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{appears to}} occur in two {{population}}s. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very {{little is known about}} this population. Thus, the two northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern Bering Sea. Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (E. glacialis).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Right</b> <b>whales</b> {{in other}} oceans have been {{recorded}} making a percussive vocalization labeled a [...] "gunshot call" [...] or gunshot. The role and purpose of this call is uncertain. However, until 2017, {{it had never been}} proven than it was <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the North Pacific that were the whales making this type of call, so detection of gunshots was not considered a reliable indicator of the presence of <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Based on back {{calculations}} {{using the}} present population size and growth rate, the population may have numbered fewer than 100 individuals by 1935. [...] As {{it became clear}} that hunting <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> was unsustainable, international protection for <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> came into effect, as the practice was banned globally in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in 1967.|$|R
25|$|The Northeast Pacific {{population}}, which {{summers in}} the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 40 animals. A western population that summers near the Commander Islands, the coast of Kamchatka, along the Kuril Islands and in the Sea of Okhotsk between it, is thought to number in the low hundreds. Prior to commercial whaling in the North Pacific (i.e. pre-1835) there were probably over 20,000 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the region. The taking of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in commercial whaling has been prohibited {{by one or more}} international treaties since 1935. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, illegal Soviet whaling killed at least 529 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as at least 132 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the Sea Okhotsk. plus an additional 104 North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> from unspecified areas.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy <b>right</b> <b>whale),</b> and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The Southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one of the smallest species.|$|E
25|$|Right whales' habitat {{preferences}} {{vary depending}} on the time of year. In spring, summer and fall, the <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are seeking concentrations of food. In winter, in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, pregnant females and their calves generally seek out shallow, protected bays in which to give birth and raise their calves. In the North Pacific, the pattern of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> seeking out areas of high food is the same, but female <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and calves in the North Pacific do not show the clear pattern of concentrating in nearshore aggregations. The distribution of North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in winter remains a major mystery.|$|R
2500|$|In its 2013 Recovery Plan, NOAA {{reviewed}} {{the scientific evidence}} {{on the effects of}} ship noise on <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> at length. No studies have been done on North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> due to the difficulty of even finding them. Several studies have been done on North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> which are reviewed. [...] Ship noise in the oceans has increased dramatically due to both the amount of shipping and the exploration for oil and gas. The increased noise may make <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> more vulnerable to being struck by ships. [...] It may also impose a sublethal level of stress on them that might impact their health.
