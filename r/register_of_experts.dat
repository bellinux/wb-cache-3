40|$|Australian higher {{education}} ‘industry’ {{is a highly}} regulated environment and represents the fourth largest export income contributing 14. 385 billion dollars in 2012 / 2013 and why the Australian Government has placed itself in {{a significant role in}} regulating and protecting the industry. The current regulatory model is a top down approach where Australian Government legislation controls the criteria for quality assurance, standards and accreditation. Specifically via TEQSA (Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011), which sets the {{higher education}} standards framework, risk assessment framework, <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> engagement with professional bodies, TEQSA quality assurance, TEQSA public reporting and compliance with other standards such as the AQF (Australian Qualifications Framework). The AQF “is the national policy for regulated qualifications in Australian education and training. It incorporates the qualifications from each education and training sector into a single comprehensive national qualifications framework,” and sets the criteria for each level of qualification from Level 1 - Certificate 1 to Level 10 - doctoral degree. In this context Australian universities and qualifications are, especially in exercise and sport science undergraduate degrees, converging to become homogeneous entities. In one context promoting comparability and transferability of graduates between states and in another context the construct of promoting diversity while compelling conformity or education convergence in the name of quality assurance, standards and accreditation. At the intra university level each university must comply with the national guidelines in term of mapping criteria with actual course. Universities within Australia can gain self-accrediting status, which essentially means they can accredit their own degrees. This concept is somewhat a misnomer as it is driven by national government compliance. This is a challenge as first, second and third year units/subjects have to be mapped with competencies consistent with the level of academic year re compliance standards. The quality assurance, standards and accreditation at this step in the process is driven by processes within the university and are dependent on such constructs as course advisory groups, school, faculty and university learning and teaching committees and associated with jumping of administrative hurdles. In addition to these Australian Government drivers in higher education the internal university drivers’ professional societies/associations in exercise and sport science are playing a significant role to influence exercise and sport science curricula at the national level. The level of influence extends to micromanagement of the total curriculum and to the content and skills expected at the level of individual unit/subject. Such compliance may involve responding to multiple criteria as staff numbers, qualifications, staff publication outputs, professional associations staff are expected to belong to, dictating library holdings, size and diversity of teaching and research infrastructure and exact content areas to be covered in units and courses. The result developing higher education/university courses in Australia today is satisfying criteria of external stakeholders, the economic rationalists (government) and the self-perceived knowledge controllers (professional associations) and not necessarily the universities, “the self-accrediting entity. &rdquo...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the role <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> witness {{testimony in the}} trials of social movement actors, discussing {{the trial of the}} "Kingsnorth Six" in Britain and the trials of activists currently mobilising against airport construction at Notre Dame des Landes in western France. Though the study <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> testimony has so far overwhelmingly concentrated on fact-finding and admissibility, the cases here reveal the importance <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> testimony not simply in terms of legal argument, but in "moral" or political terms, as it reflects and constitutes movement cognitive praxis. In the so-called climate change defence presented by the Kingsnorth Six, I argue that expert testimony attained a "negotiation of proximity," connecting different types of contributory expertise to link the scales and <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> climate science with those of everyday understanding and meaning. Expert testimony in the trials of activists in France, however, whilst ostensibly able to develop similar bridging narratives, has instead been used to construct resistance to the airport siting as already proximate, material, and embedded. To explain this, I argue that attention to the symbolic, as well as instrumental, functions <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> testimony reveals the crucial role that collective memory plays in the construction of both knowledge and grievance in these cases. Collective memory is both a constraint on and catalyst for mobilisation, defining the boundaries of the sayable. Testimony in trials both reflects and reproduces these elements and is a vital explanatory tool for understanding the narrativisation and communication of movement identities and objectives...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess which interventions effectively reduce fear of falling in community-living older people. An extensive search for relevant literature comprised a database search of PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> Controlled Trials; <b>expert</b> consultation; and manually searching reference lists from potentially relevant papers. Randomized, controlled trials that assessed fear of falling in community-living older people were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data from full papers on study characteristics, methodological quality, outcomes, and process characteristics of the intervention. The search identified 599 abstracts, and 19 papers met the inclusion criteria. Seven of those papers were identified using expert consultation. Fifty-five percent of all validity items and 39 % of process characteristic items were fulfilled across the 19 trials. Twelve of the 19 papers were of higher methodological quality. In 11 of these trials, fear of falling was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Interventions that showed effectiveness were fall-related multifactorial programs (n= 5), tai chi interventions (n= 3), exercise interventions (n= 2), and a hip protector intervention (n= 1). Three of these interventions explicitly aimed to reduce fear of falling. Several interventions, including interventions not explicitly aimed at fear of falling, resulted in a reduction of fear of falling in community-living older people. Limited but fairly consistent findings in trials of higher methodological quality showed that home-based exercise and fall-related multifactorial programs and community-based tai chi delivered in group format have been effective in reducing fear of falling in community-living older peopl...|$|R

To date, the Assembly <b>of</b> <b>Experts</b> has not challenged any of the Supreme Leader's decisions.
