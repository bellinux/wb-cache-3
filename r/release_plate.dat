[...] ("What we're saying with these songs is: if you don't push yourself, then {{no one else is}} {{going to do it for}} you.")

5000|$|A {{ball head}} {{utilizes}} a ball joint to allow movement of all axes of rotation {{from a single}} point. Some ball heads also have a separate panoramic rotation axis {{on the base of}} the head. The head has two main parts, the ball, which attaches to the camera and the socket, which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick <b>release</b> <b>plate,</b> or a simple UNC 1/4"-20 [...] screw. The socket is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. Ball heads come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also ball friction. Ball heads are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt heads. However, ball heads have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedFaults and fault {{networks}} are heterogeneous structures where elastic strain from ongoing tectonic motions is released in earthquakes. Three studies {{presented in this}} thesis aim to illustrate the importance of fault heterogeneity using numerical models and quantify fault heterogeneity using earthquake data. In the first part, a model fault consisting of a grid of discrete slip patches surrounded by a 3 -D elastic half-space is used to investigate the statistics of earthquake stress drops. Predictions for stress drops on a homogeneous fault with properties constrained by experiments are {{an order of magnitude}} larger than typical observations from seismic data. In the model, heterogeneous frictional properties result in an evolving distribution of spatially heterogeneous stress. Since stress must exceed the fault strength only in the hypocenter region, lower average stress at times of rupture lead to stress drops consistently lower than predictions for a homogeneous fault. The second part of the thesis concerns quantifying the geometry of earthquake faulting for different spatial scales and magnitude ranges in a plate boundary region. We compute and compare potency tensor summations of subsets of a catalog containing ∼ 170, 00 focal mechanisms for 0 < ML ≤ 5 earthquakes from southern California. Results indicate that earthquake deformation is influenced by scales related to plate tectonic motions (∼ 700 km), large scale fault zones (∼ 50 – 250 km) and smaller geometric complexities (∼ 5 – 50 km). However, individual fault zone length-scales have distinct characteristics, indicating departure from self-similarity despite the lack of a single characteristic length-scale. In the third part of the thesis higher quality focal mechanisms are used to compare levels of heterogeneity between nine strike-slip fault zones in California.; Focal mechanism heterogeneity is quantified using two measures that represent the scatter and asymmetry in faulting orientations, both computed from normalized potency tensor summations. The scatter correlates with complexity of the fault surface traces, and asymmetry correlates with the dominant fault orientation relative to plate motion directions. These observations indicate that focal mechanism heterogeneity relates both the long term evolutionary properties of the fault zone and the ability of the fault to efficiently <b>release</b> <b>plate</b> tectonic strains...|$|E

40|$|Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans invades {{periodontal}} pocket epithelium and {{is therefore}} difficult to eliminate by peri-odontal scaling and root planing. It is susceptible to azithromycin, which is taken up bymany types of mammalian cells. This led us to hypothesize that azithromycin accumulation by gingival epithelium could enhance the killing of intraepithelial A. actino-mycetemcomitans. [3 H]azithromycin transport by Smulow-Glickman gingival epithelial cells and SCC- 25 oral epithelial cells was characterized. To test our hypothesis, we infected cultured Smulow-Glickman cell monolayers with A. actinomycetemcomitans (Y 4 or SUNY 465 strain) for 2 h, treated themwith gentamicin to eliminate extracellular bacteria, and then incubated themwith azithromycin for 1 to 4 h. Viable intracellular bacteria were <b>released,</b> <b>plated,</b> and enumerated. Azithromycin transport by both cell lines exhibitedMichaelis-Menten kinetics and was competitively inhibited by L-carnitine and several other organic cations. Cell incubation in medium containing 5 g/ml azithromycin yielded steady-state intracellular concentrations of 144 g/ml in SCC- 25 cells and 118 g/ml in Smulow-Glickman cells. Azithromycin induced dose- and time-dependent intraepithelial killing of both A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. Treatment of infected Smulow-Glickman cells with 0. 125 g/ml azithromycin killed approximately 29 % of the intraepithelial CFU of both strains within 4 h, while treatment with 8 g/ml azithromycin killed> 82 % of the CFU of both strains (P< 0. 05). Addition of carnitine inhibited the killing of intracellular bacteria by azithromycin (P< 0. 05). Thus, human gingival epithelial cells actively accumulate azithromycin through a transport system that facilitates the killing of intraepithelial A. actinomycetemcomitans and is shared with organic cations.
