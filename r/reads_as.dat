5|$|Motion {{argues that}} {{aside from the}} {{sometimes}} facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild xenophobia that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices. Bradford believes that the essay <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in F. W. Bateson's Essays and Criticism had that journal existed in 1943.|$|E

5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis {{decided to do it}} regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of the}} first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, Scrope {{published}} his research from Auvergne in central France in his Geology and Extinct Volcanos of Central France.

The work <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> a moving narrative, giving a very detailed road-map of analyzed data through the region.|$|E
25|$|Craig Evans {{states that}} an {{argument}} in favor of the partial authenticity of the Testimonium is that the passage does not exaggerate the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus. According to Evans, if the passage had been an interpolation after the emergence of conflicts between Jews and Christians, it would have had a more accusative tone, but in its current form <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> one would expect it to read for a passage composed by Josephus {{towards the end of the}} first century.|$|E

25|$|Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona {{runs the}} gamut from {{friendly}} charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. His charm can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have studied his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures across the globe.|$|E
25|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} is used widely across mammalian genomes, however complications {{have arisen}} {{with the discovery}} of a new mammalian DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine converts to cytosine-5-methylsulfonate upon bisulfite treatment, which then <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> a C when sequenced. Therefore, bisulfite sequencing cannot discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. This means that the output from bisulfite sequencing can no longer be defined as solely DNA methylation, as it is the composite of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The development of Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing by Chuan He at the University of Chicago is now able to distinguish between the two modifications at single base resolution.|$|E

25|$|Entering Thai-registered vehicles, {{which use}} the Thai script for series letters and the {{province}} of registration on their number plates, are required to bear strips {{on the front and}} back that translate the plate information into a row of Romanised script (including the corresponding series prefix and 4-digit number, and the province in its official 3-letter abbreviation), resulting in a format that <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> AB 1234 PTN or 1AB 1234 BKK. Although the general practice is to use white characters on black, stickers with colour schemes that resemble their original plate colours may also be acceptable; stickers that emulate the layout and colour of the Thai plates have also been known to be used.|$|E
25|$|Kami are an ever-changing concept, {{but their}} {{presence}} in Japanese life has remained constant. The kami’s earliest roles were as earth-based spirits, assisting the early hunter-gatherer groups in their daily lives. They were worshipped as gods of earth (mountains) and sea. As the cultivation of rice became increasingly important and predominant in Japan, the kami’s identity shifted to more sustaining roles that were {{directly involved in the}} growth of crops; roles such as rain, earth, and rice. This relationship between early Japanese people and the kami was manifested in rituals and ceremonies meant to entreat the kami to grow and protect the harvest. These rituals also became a symbol of power and strength for the early emperors. See Niiname-sai (i.e., 新嘗祭, which also <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> Shinjō-sai).|$|E
25|$|By 2004 / 2005, {{pyrosequencing}} {{had been}} brought to commercial viability by 454 Life Sciences. This new sequencing method generated reads much shorter than those of Sanger sequencing: initially about 100 bases, now 400-500 bases. Its much higher throughput and lower cost (compared to Sanger sequencing) pushed the adoption of this technology by genome centers, which in turn pushed development of sequence assemblers that could efficiently handle the read sets. The sheer amount of data coupled with technology-specific error patterns in the reads delayed development of assemblers; at the beginning in 2004 only the Newbler assembler from 454 was available. Released in mid-2007, the hybrid version of the MIRA assembler by Chevreux et al. was the first freely available assembler that could assemble 454 <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> well as mixtures of 454 reads and Sanger reads. Assembling sequences from different sequencing technologies was subsequently coined hybrid assembly.|$|E

25|$|The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, {{wheeled vehicle}} used {{to discern the}} {{southern}} cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary Fu Xuan. The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the Weilüe, written by the East Han Dynasty politician Yuan Huan also described the south-pointing chariot {{of belonging to the}} Chinese mechanical engineer and politician Ma Jun. The Jin Dynasty (265420 CE) era text of the Shu Zheng Ji (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern gatehouse of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city. However, the later written Song Shu (Book of Song) (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as created background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the Western Zhou Dynasty (1050771 BCE). The book also provided description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text <b>reads</b> <b>as</b> follows.
