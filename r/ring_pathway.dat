40|$|In {{response}} to DNA replication stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DNA replication checkpoint maintains replication fork stability, prevents precocious chromosome segregation, and causes cells to arrest as large-budded cells. The checkpoint kinases Mec 1 and Rad 53 act in this checkpoint. Treatment of mec 1 or rad 53 Δ mutants with replication inhibitors results in replication fork collapse and inappropriate partitioning of partially replicated chromosomes, leading to cell death. We describe a previously unappreciated function of various replication stress checkpoint proteins, including Rad 53, {{in the control}} of cell morphology. Checkpoint mutants have aberrant cell morphology and cell walls, and show defective bud site selection. Rad 53 shows genetic interactions with septin <b>ring</b> <b>pathway</b> components, and, along with other checkpoint proteins, controls the timely degradation of Swe 1 during replication stress, thereby facilitating proper bud growth. Thus, checkpoint proteins {{play an important role}} in coordinating morphogenetic events with DNA replication during replication stress...|$|E
40|$|Cytokinesis in {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs via two coordinated pathways, the {{actomyosin}} contractile ring and the septum-formation process. The actomyosin contractile ring {{is not essential}} for viability in some strains. However, {{in at least one}} of those backgrounds, deletion of hof 1, a gene important in septum formation, results in dependency on the contractile <b>ring</b> <b>pathway</b> for cytokinesis and viability (Vallen et al. 2000). A screen for mutants synthetically lethal with hof 1 was utilized to identify genes required for the actomyosin pathway (Lippincott 2001). Complementation testing indicated that mutations in MYO 1, a gene encoding the only type II myosin in budding yeast, and mutations in CYK 3, a gene involved in the septum formation pathway of cytokinesis were isolated in the screen. Intriguingly, some mutants failed to complement both myo 1 and cyk 3. Meiotic segregation analysis and plasmid-linked suppression determined that most of these mutants carry myo 1 alleles while one carries an allele of MLC 1, a myosin light chain. Further characterization of the myo 1 alleles may help define regions of Myo 1 p required for actomyosin ring assembly and contraction and elucidate mechanisms by which the actomyosin and septum formation pathways are coordinated...|$|E

Degradant structures were elucidated using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR). Compound 1 was found to undergo hydrolysis via two pathways. Pathway 1 involves three hydrolysis steps of the triazine <b>ring.</b> <b>Pathway</b> 2 proceeds through hydroxy substitution of the amino group on the triazine ring followed by its hydrolysis, eventually resulting {{in the formation of}} the same degradant as pathway 1. Stability of 1 in the tablets was dependent on the manufacturing process and degradation appeared to proceed more rapidly in amorphous regions created during processing. Pathways 1 and 2 were observed in the tablets and degradation rate was enhanced at high humidity condition. In addition to pathways 1 and 2, degradation in the tablet formulations was found to proceed through a third pathway involving nucleophilic displacement of the ether methoxy group by the triazine N- 3. The resulting imidazolidinium intermediate was found to undergo a series of hydrolytic steps finally leading to the same end degradant as pathways 1 and 2.

Vibrationally excited products of Cl 2 CO, ClNCO, CCl 3 NCO and NCO {{have been observed}} in the IR emission spectra. Cyclic intermediates are found to play important roles leading to the rich variety of the chemical transformations of the reaction. Mainly two competitive reaction pathways are revealed: the four-membered <b>ring</b> intermediate <b>pathway</b> leading to the products Cl 2 CO + ClCN which is essentially barrierless and the bicyclic <b>ring</b> intermediate <b>pathway</b> leading to the product channels of ClNCO + CCl 2, CCl 3 NCO and CCl 3 + NCO which is rate-limited by a barrier of 42. 9 kJ mol(- 1) higher than the reactants.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The Aurora/Ipl 1 p-related kinase AIR- 2 is {{required}} for mitotic chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Previous studies have relied on non-conditional mutations or RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to inactivate AIR- 2. It has therefore not been possible to determine whether AIR- 2 functions directly in cytokinesis or if the cleavage defect results indirectly from the failure to segregate DNA. One intriguing hypothesis is that AIR- 2 acts to localize the mitotic kinesin-like protein ZEN- 4 (also known as CeMKLP 1), which later functions in cytokinesis. Results: Using conditional alleles, we established that AIR- 2 {{is required}} at metaphase or early anaphase for normal segregation of chromosomes, localization of ZEN- 4, and cytokinesis. ZEN- 4 is first required late in cytokinesis, and also functions to maintain cell separation {{through much of the}} subsequent interphase. DNA segregation defects alone were not sufficient to disrupt cytokinesis in other mutants, suggesting that AIR- 2 acts specifically during cytokinesis through ZEN- 4. AIR- 2 and ZEN- 4 shared similar genetic interactions with the formin homology (FH) protein CYK- 1, suggesting that AIR- 2 and ZEN- 4 function in a single pathway, in parallel to a contractile <b>ring</b> <b>pathway</b> that includes CYK- 1. Using in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that AIR- 2 and ZEN- 4 interact directly. Conclusions: AIR- 2 has two functions during mitosis: one in chromosome segregation, and a second, independent function in cytokinesis through ZEN- 4. AIR- 2 and ZEN- 4 may act in parallel to a second pathway that includes CYK- 1...|$|E

Recent investigation of the degradation of nitroaromatic compounds revealed that some nitroaromatic compounds are initially converted to 2 -aminophenol rather than dihydroxy intermediates by a number of microorganisms. The complete pathway for the metabolism of 2 -aminophenol during the degradation of nitrobenzene by Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes JS 45 has been elucidated previously. The pathway is parallel to the catechol extradiol <b>ring</b> cleavage <b>pathway,</b> except that 2 -aminophenol is the ring cleavage substrate.

The key reaction is the carbonylbiscaprolactam (CBC) mediated amino or hydroxy end group conversion yielding carbamoyl caprolactam functional polymers, without requiring addition of either phosgene or isocyanates. The quantitative CBC conversion of amine end groups occurred in bulk at 100 °C {{in the absence}} of catalysts, yielding N-carbamoyl caprolactam terminated oligomers and caprolactam (<b>ring</b> elimination, <b>pathway</b> RE). The reaction of hydroxy end groups at 100 to 150 °C in the presence of catalysts such as zirconium alcoholates, magnesium bromide or dibutyltindilaurate (DBTDL) produced N-carbamoyl caprolactam end groups via nucleophilic attack of the hydroxy group at one of the CBC caprolactam rings and subsequent ring opening (<b>ring</b> opening, <b>pathway</b> RO).

The {{simultaneous}} degradation of these compounds is prevented in most previously studied isolates because the catabolic pathways are incompatible. The purpose of this study was to determine whether strain JS 6 could degrade mixtures of chloro- and methyl-substituted aromatic compounds. Strain JS 6 was maintained in a chemostat on a minimal medium with toluene or chlorobenzene as the sole carbon source, supplied via a syringe pump. Strain JS 6 contained an active catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase when grown in the presence of chloroaromatic compounds; however, in cell extracts, this enzyme was strongly inhibited by 3 -chlorocatechol. When cells grown to steady state on toluene were exposed to 50 % toluene- 50 % chlorobenzene, 3 -chlorocatechol and 3 -methylcatechol accumulated in the medium and the cell density decreased. After 3 h, the enzyme activities of the modified ortho <b>ring</b> fission <b>pathway</b> were induced, the metabolites disappeared, and the cell density returned to previous levels.

The ring hydroxylation is shown to be stereospecific, exclusively producing the (S) product. The absolute stereospecificity of the ring and side-chain hydroxylations of the DbetaM/CHDEA reaction suggests that the side-chain pro-R hydrogen of the enzyme-bound substrate is close to perpendicular to the aromatic ring of the phenylethylamine substrate or cyclohexadiene ring of CHDEA. The relative activation energy parameters suggest that the partitioning of the <b>ring</b> H abstraction <b>pathway</b> between aromatized and ring hydroxylated products is due to the partitioning of the high-energy intermediates, the cyclohexadienyl radical and the Cu(II) -O(*) species, between carbon-oxygen bond formation and direct electron transfer.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three main structures constitute the actin cytoskeleton: cortical actin patches, cytoplasmic actin cables, and the actin-based cytokinetic ring [1 – 4]. The conserved Arp 2 / 3 complex and a WASP-family protein mediate actin patch formation, whereas the yeast formins (Bni 1 and Bnr 1) promote assembly of actin cables [5 – 9]. However, the mechanism of actin ring formation is currently unclear. Here, we show that actin filaments are required for cytokinesis in S. cerevisiae, and that the actin ring is a highly dynamic structure that undergoes constant turnover. Assembly of the actin ring requires the formin-like proteins and profilin, but is not Arp 2 / 3 -mediated. Furthermore, the formin-dependent actin <b>ring</b> assembly <b>pathway</b> is regulated by the Rho-type GTPase Rho 1 but not Cdc 42.

The other pathway, of archaeal origin, depends on an AdoCbi amidohydrolase (CbiZ) enzyme to generate adenosylcobyric acid (AdoCby), which is converted to AdoCbi-P by the AdoCbi-P synthetase (CobD) enzyme. Here we report that R. sphaeroides strain 2. 4. 1 synthesizes AdoCbl de novo and that it salvages Cbi using both of the predicted Cbi salvaging pathways. AdoCbl produced by R. sphaeroides was identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and bioassay. The deletion of cobB (encoding an essential enzyme of the de novo corrin <b>ring</b> biosynthetic <b>pathway)</b> resulted in a strain of R. sphaeroides that would not grow on acetate {{in the absence of}} exogenous corrinoids. The results from a nutritional analysis showed that the presence of either CbiZ or CobP was necessary and sufficient for Cbi salvaging, that CbiZ-dependent Cbi salvaging depended on the presence of CobD, and that CobP-dependent Cbi salvaging occurred in a cbiZ+ strain. Possible reasons why R. sphaeroides maintains two distinct pathways for Cbi salvaging are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The metabolically {{versatile}} Rhodococcus sp. strain DK 17 {{is able to}} grow on tetralin and indan but cannot {{use their}} respective desaturated counterparts, 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene and indene, as sole carbon and energy sources. Metabolite analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry clearly show that (i) the meta-cleavage dioxygenase mutant strain DK 180 accumulates 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydro- 1, 2 -naphthalene diol, 1, 2 -indene diol, and 3, 4 -dihydro-naphthalene- 1, 2 -diol from tetralin, indene, and 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene, respectively, and (ii) when expressed in Escherichia coli, the DK 17 o-xylene dioxygenase transforms tetralin, indene, and 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene into tetralin cis-dihydrodiol, indan- 1, 2 -diol, and cis- 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene, respectively. Tetralin, which is activated by aromatic hydroxylation, is degraded successfully via the <b>ring</b> cleavage <b>pathway</b> to support growth of DK 17. Indene and 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene do not serve as growth substrates because DK 17 hydroxylates them on the alicyclic ring and further metabolism results in a dead-end metabolite. This study reveals that aromatic hydroxylation {{is a prerequisite for}} proper degradation of bicyclics with aromatic and alicyclic rings by DK 17 and confirms the unique ability of the DK 17 o-xylene dioxygenase to perform distinct regioselective hydroxylations...|$|R

40|$|Observations in 2013 and 2014 of the Centaur 10199 Chariklo and its {{ring system}} {{consistently}} {{indicated that the}} radial width of the inner, more massive ring varies with longitude. That strongly suggests that this ring has a finite eccentricity despite the fast differential precession that Chariklo's large quadrupole moment should induce. If the inferred apse alignment is maintained by the ring's self-gravity, {{as it is for}} the Uranian rings, we estimate a ring mass of a few times 10 ^ 16 g and a typical particle size of a few meters. These imply a short collisional spreading time of ~ 10 ^ 5 years, somewhat shorter than the typical Centaur dynamical lifetime of a few Myrs and much shorter than the age of the solar system. In light of this time constraint, we evaluate previously suggested <b>ring</b> formation <b>pathways</b> including collisional ejection and satellite disruption. We also investigate in detail a contrasting formation mechanism, the lofting of dust particles off Chariklo's surface into orbit via outflows of sublimating CO and/or N_ 2 triggered after Chariklo was scattered inward by giant planets. This latter scenario predicts that rings should be common among 100 -km class Centaurs but rare among Kuiper belt objects and smaller Centaurs. It also predicts that Centaurs should show seasonal variations in cometary activity with activity maxima occurring shortly after equinox. Comment: 26 pages, 4 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R
30|$|Aerobic {{microbial}} degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) has been classically shown to proceed via ‘Hydroquinone (HQ) pathway’ in Gram-negative bacteria, whereas in Gram-positive PNP degraders it proceed via ‘Benzenetriol (BT) pathway’. These pathways {{are characterized by}} the ring cleavage of HQ and BT as terminal aromatic intermediates respectively. Earlier reports on PNP degradation have indicated these pathways to be mutually exclusive. We report involvement of both ‘HQ’ and ‘BT’ <b>ring</b> cleavage <b>pathways</b> in PNP degradation by Burkholderia sp. strain SJ 98. Genetic characterization of an ~ 41 Kb DNA fragment harboring PNP degradation gene cluster cloned and sequenced from strain SJ 98 showed presence of multiple orfs including pnpC and pnpD which corresponded to previously characterized ‘benzenetriol-dioxygenase (BtD)’ and ‘maleylacetate reductase (MaR)’ respectively. This gene cluster also showed presence of pnpE 1 and pnpE 2, which shared strong sequence identity to cognate sub-units of ‘hydroquinone dioxygenase’ (HqD). Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization ascertained the identity of PnpE 1 and PnpE 2. In in vitro assay reconstituted heterotetrameric complex of PnpE 1 and PnpE 2 catalyzed transformation of hydroquinone (HQ) into corresponding hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (HMS) in a substrate specific manner. Together, these results clearly establish branching of PNP degradation in strain SJ 98. We propose that strain SJ 98 presents a useful model system {{for future studies on}} evolution of {{microbial degradation}} of PNP.|$|R
40|$|Trichloroethylene oxide is a {{downstream}} {{product in}} the oxidative metabolism of trichloroethylene (TCE) {{and it may be}} involved in cytochrome P 450 inactivation, protein function destruction, and nucleic acid base alkalization. To explore the hydrolysis mechanism of the decomposition of TCE oxide, an investigation using Second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory in conjunction with density functional theory has been conducted to analyze the effect of the water solvation shell on probable reaction steps. The decomposition of TCE oxide is accelerated by coordinated water molecules (up to seven), which reveals that water molecules can help to solvate the TCE oxide molecule and activate the release of the Cl– leaving group. After the opening of the epoxide <b>ring,</b> several <b>pathways</b> are proposed to account for the dehalogenation step along with the formation of CO as well as three carboxylic acids (formic acid, glyoxylic acid, and dichloroacetic acid). The predominant pathways were examined by comparing the computed activation energies for the formation of the products to each other for the possible reaction steps examined in this work. After rationally analyzing the computational results, the ring-opening reaction has been identified as the rate-determining step. The rate constant estimated for the TCE oxide decomposition from the calculations performed here was found to be reasonably consistent with previous experimental observations reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} mechanisms {{followed by}} ethylene polymerization and selective oligomerization (tri- and tetramerization) are conceptually very different, being a non-redox chain growth and a redox metallacycle <b>ring</b> expansion <b>pathway</b> respectively. With chromium being the metal of choice, metal oxidation {{states and the}} variation of ancillary ligand able to support specific metal oxidation states responsible for selective trimerization, tetramerization or nonselective oligomerization/polymerization were varied. In this research project we have explored {{a broad range of}} novel pyridine containing modified PN ligand scaffolds with the aim of probing the role of the pyridine donor substituent in stabilizing lower oxidation states and ultimately affecting the selectivity of the ethylene in the catalytic cycle. In this study, pyridine PNP pincer ligands in conjunction with chromium salts and alkylaluminium activators have been explored. Their catalytic activities toward ethylene oligomerization were rationalized through the isolation of different chromium-aluminate intermediates in different oxidation states during the catalytic reaction. Moreover, we explored other pyridine modification of NNP type ligand. Its anionic ligand shows a rare example of a Cr(II) hydride cluster which shows a high activity as a nonselective ethylene oligomerization catalyst. Finally, a cyclic PNPN type ligand was explored. The ligand enabled the isolation of a mix-valent Cr(I) /Cr(II) species which was found to be inactive toward ethylene oligomerization due to its geometric constraint...|$|R

50|$|The PI3K-Akt pathway {{has many}} {{downstream}} effects {{and must be}} carefully regulated. One of the ways the pathway is negatively regulated is by reducing PIP3 levels. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) antagonises PI3K by converting PI(3,4,5)P3 into PI(4,5)P2. Loss of PTEN function leads to over-activation of Akt and is common in cancer cells (PTEN is a tumour suppressor). SH2-containing Inositol Phosphatase (SHIP) also dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3, at the 5' position of the inositol <b>ring.</b> The PI3K-Akt <b>pathway</b> regulates PTEN levels by affecting its transcription and activity. Transcription factor NF-κB, activated by Akt, regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARβ/δ) agonists and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), which in turn repress PTEN expression. NEDD4-1, an E3 ligase that recognises PTEN for degradation is up-regulated by the PI3K pathway. Therefore, when Akt is activated, PTEN is further repressed in a positive feedback loop.|$|R
40|$|Growth on 3 -chlorobenzoate {{was found}} to induce the enzymes of the protocatechuate meta <b>ring</b> fission <b>pathway</b> in Alcaligenes sp. strain BR 60. The chlorobenzoate catabolic genes, {{designated}} cba, were localized to a 3. 7 -kb NotI-EcoRI fragment within the nonrepeated region of the composite transposon Tn 5271. The cba genes were cloned onto two broad-host-range vectors and expressed in Escherichia coli and Alcaligenes sp. strain BR 6024. In E. coli, expression of the cba genes with the IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) -inducible tac promoter of the IncQ vector pMMB 66 HE resulted {{in the production of}} protocatechuate and chlorodihydroxybenzoate metabolites of 3 -chlorobenzoate. Expression of this construct in one orientation resulted in the formation of two polypeptides 51 and 42 kDa in size. This result was confirmed by subcloning into pGEM 3 Zf and then incorporating L- 35 S-methionine into newly synthesized proteins, using the thermally regulated T 7 polymerase-promoter system. Introduction of the NotI-EcoRI fragment into Alcaligenes sp. strain BR 6024 (Cba-P), using the IncP broad-host-range, mobilizable plasmid pBW 13, restored the 3 -chlorobenzoate-degradative phenotype and resulted in the accumulation of protocatechuate and chlorodihydroxybenzoate intermediates. The data indicate that a two-component dioxygenase specified by Tn 5271 oxidizes 3 -chlorobenzoate at the 3, 4 - or 4, 5 -positions. This activity extends the range of pathways for chloroaromatic compounds known to be functional in the environment. The new pathway avoids the toxicity attributed to the accumulation of chlorocatechol metabolites in bacteria degrading chlorobenzoates...|$|R
