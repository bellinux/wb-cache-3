40|$|The {{partitioning}} of <b>related</b> <b>objects</b> {{should be}} performed before clustering for an efficient access in object-oriented databases. In this paper, a partition of <b>related</b> <b>objects</b> in object-oriented databases is presented. All subclass nodes in a class inheritance hierarchy of a schema graph are condensed to a class node in the graph because the aggregation hierarchy has more influence on the partition than the class inheritance hierarchy. This reduced graph is called a condensed schema graph. A set function and an accessibility function are defined to characterize a maximal subset of <b>related</b> <b>objects</b> among the set of objects in a class. A set function maps {{a subset of the}} domain class objects to a subset of the range class objects. An accessibility function maps a subset of the objects of a class into a subset of the objects of the same class through a composition of set functions. A partition algorithm is derived to find the <b>related</b> <b>objects</b> of a condensed schema graph using accessibility fu [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{corrosion}} inhibitor is a chemical compound that, when {{added to a}} liquid or gas, decreases the corrosion rate of a material, typically a metal or an alloy. The effectiveness of a {{corrosion inhibitor}} depends on fluid composition, quantity of water, and flow regime. A common mechanism for inhibiting corrosion involves formation of a coating, often a passivation layer, which prevents access of the corrosive substance to the metal. Permanent treatments such as chrome plating are not generally considered inhibitors, however. Instead corrosion inhibitors are additives to the fluids that surround the metal or <b>related</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{software}} library {{is a collection}} of <b>related</b> <b>object</b> code.In the Java language, libraries are typically packaged in JAR files. Libraries can contain objects of different types. The most important type of object contained in a Jar file is a Java class. A class {{can be thought of as}} a named unit of code. The class loader is responsible for locating libraries, reading their contents, and loading the classes contained within the libraries. This loading is typically done [...] "on demand", in that it does not occur until the class is called by the program. A class with a given name can only be loaded once by a given classloader.|$|E
5000|$|BIM {{involves}} {{representing a}} design as combinations of [...] "objects" [...] - vague and undefined, generic or product-specific, solid shapes or void-space oriented (like {{the shape of}} a room), that carry their geometry, relations and attributes. BIM design tools allow extraction of different views from a building model for drawing production and other uses. These different views are automatically consistent, being based on a single definition of each object instance. BIM software also defines objects parametrically; that is, the objects are defined as parameters and relations to other objects, so that if a <b>related</b> <b>object</b> is amended, dependent ones will automatically also change. Each model element can carry attributes for selecting and ordering them automatically, providing cost estimates as well as material tracking and ordering.|$|E

50|$|The mosaic {{fragment}} {{was part}} of a much larger composition which covered the floor of a wealthy family villa. A <b>related</b> <b>object</b> from the same donor and region also specifies that the room within which the floor was located was likely semipublic, such as a reception or dining room. The text suggests that this image was once among several other examples of exotic animals, which giraffes were considered to be at that time since they were non-native to the Mediterranean region and were often only seen while being paraded around at public events. Giraffes were collected by Romans beginning with the first one being brought to Rome by Julius Caesar in 46 CE. Since the region in which this object originated had experienced Roman control prior to the making of the piece, this is a likely influence and possible reason for this particular image’s creation.|$|E
50|$|A datum can {{be related}} to one more item, giving rise to a {{one-to-one}} relationship, or with more than one items, resulting in a one-to-many relationship. The related items, in turn, may be related to other data items as well, resulting in a network of relationships, which is called a many-to-many relationship. Creating a relationship between two Items create another field in the data of the Items concerned which refer the row in the other Item’s table where the <b>related</b> <b>object</b> is stored.In WinFS, a Relationship is an instance of the base type Relationship, which is extended to signify a specialization of a relation. A Relationship is a mapping between two items, a Source and a Target. The source has an Outgoing Relationship, whereas the target gets an Incoming Relationship. WinFS provides three types of primitive relationships - Holding Relationship, Reference Relationship and Embedding Relationship. Any custom relationship between two data types are instances of these relationship types.|$|E
5000|$|Ellen Markman's {{early studies}} showed this {{constraint}} at work. When two- and three-year-olds {{were presented with}} two basic-level objects, two different kinds of dogs, and a third thematically <b>related</b> <b>object,</b> dog food, they showed a tendency to select a dog and dog food; however, {{if one of the}} dogs was labeled with an unfamiliar word, the children were more likely to select the two dogs. Another study conducted by Backscheider & Markman attempted to clarify whether this assumption was powerful enough to overcome the preference for thematic relations when objects are engaged in dynamic thematic relations at the time of labeling. A doll was repeatedly seated in a chair when the child either heard [...] "see the bif" [...] or [...] "see this". The label, [...] "bif", caused children to pick objects of the same kind, whereas, the absence of the label caused them to organize objects to the thematic event they had witnessed. Children use this assumption as early as 18 months of age.|$|E

The cranky postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an important envelope to the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. The proprietor in question, a kindly old lady, then asks the player to rescue her cat from a mysterious sorceress known only as The Evil One. Stepping out of the store, the player finds that quaint Festeron has mysteriously {{been transformed into a}} more sinister town called Witchville. There are but a few hours to defeat The Evil One. Fortunately, the player soon finds the Wishbringer, a magical stone that can grant seven wishes if a suitable object is used in conjunction. To see the future, for example, the player must be wearing glasses and holding the stone. The seven wishes that can be granted by the stone are for advice, darkness, flight, foresight, freedom, luck, and rain. Each wish can only be used once per game, and requires that the player possess some <b>related</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E
50|$|Until {{the advent}} of EnterpriseOne {{applications}} version 8.12 running on tools release/service pack 8.96, {{by far the most}} vulnerable aspect of the CNC technology was that proprietary object specifications had to be copied from full client up to the applications server in order for a JDE user's data selection and processing options to be run as requested on the server. If those proprietary specifications became corrupted, the batch application object, in turn, on the applications server could become corrupted. A rebuild and redeploy of the object was the only fix. Likewise, if there is some intervening process that corrupts object specifications as they come down to the client PC, the <b>related</b> <b>object</b> could become corrupted and no longer function correctly. Since applications upgrade E812 and Tools Release or systems or foundational service pack, the proprietary specifications have been replaced with XML-based object properties which has proven to be more stable and less prone to corruption. In the fall of 2008, Oracle brought out the E900 applications release and by the fall of 2010, the tools release was up to 8.98.3.3. E900 Update 1, or E901 is the latest release as of fall 2010.|$|E
40|$|We {{show how}} a greedy {{approach}} to visual search — i. e., directly {{moving to the}} most likely location of the target — can be suboptimal, if the target object is hard to detect. Instead it is more efficient and leads to higher detection accuracy to first look for other related objects, that are easier to detect. These provide contextual priors for the target that {{make it easier to}} find. We demonstrate this in simulation using POMDP models, focussing on two special cases: where the target object is contained within the <b>related</b> <b>object,</b> and where the target object is spatially adjacent to the <b>related</b> <b>object...</b>|$|E
