BackgroundThe expression of foreign genes into <b>renal</b> <b>glomerular</b> cells holds enormous potential to modulate {{the outcome of}} renal diseases. Recombinant adenoviruses (rAds) are promising {{gene transfer}} vectors {{because they have the}} ability to infect a wide range of nondividing cells. However, despite the fact that renal glomeruli are easily accessible via the renal circulation, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into rodent glomeruli has been problematic. Here, we described our experience using rAd vectors to express foreign genes in rodent renal glomeruli in vivo and in cultured human <b>renal</b> <b>glomerular</b> cells. MethodsWe developed two techniques—the “portal clamping” and “prolonged renal infusion”—to infect mouse and rat renal glomeruli in vivo, respectively. We used E- 1 -deleted rAd vectors carrying the lacZ gene encoding ฿bgr;-galactosidase (Ad. CBlacZ) {{under the control of the}} cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken ฿bgr;-actin promoter. Cultured human <b>renal</b> <b>glomerular</b> podocytes, endothelial and mesangial cells were grown following standard techniques. Transgene expression was evaluated by doing ฿bgr;-galactosidase staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies. ResultsWe found that both a prolonged exposure and a high concentration of circulating adenoviral vectors were required to achieve efficient gene transfer to <b>renal</b> <b>glomerular</b> cells in rodents. The virus-mediated transgene expression in renal glomeruli lasted for at least 42 days in mice and 21 days in rats without causing significant renal injury.

40|$|The {{findings}} of Walker and Oliver (1) {{indicate that the}} <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate</b> in mammals may not be entirely protein-free. A large body of evidence, recently reviewed by Rather (2), {{makes it clear that}} the cells lining the proximal convoluted tubule are able to reabsorb protein from the <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate,</b> and, in some instances, at least partially to degrade it. Dock (3) and Gilson (4) have labelled certain of the plasma proteins in vivo by injecting the dye % 1824 intravenously and have found the dye concentrated in the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. Both workers have interpreted this as evidence of glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption of plasma protein. It has recently been demonstrated (5) that the not inconsiderable normal urinary protein of the rat has the electrophoretic and solubility characteristics of serum alpha and beta globulin. If the glomerular membrane of the rat allows the passage of large serum globulin molecules, {{it would seem that the}} much smaller serum albumin molecules would enter the <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate</b> even more readily. This has been construed as strong evidence that in this species, serum albumin is filtered through the glomerular capillary and is constantly reabsorbed by the cells of the renal tubule. A small but constant proteinuria exists in man, and it has been shown that the A/G ratio of the urinary proteins is the reverse of that in the plasma (6). The concentration of protein in <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate</b> is not known with certainty. The only direct measurements are those of Walker, Bott, Oliver, and MacDowell (7).

40|$|The {{proximal}} tubule (PT) plays {{a critical}} role in the reabsorption of ions, solutes and low molecular weight proteins from the <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate.</b> Although the PT has been known to acutely modulate ion reabsorption in response to changes in flow rates of the <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate,</b> whether apical endocytosis was regulated in response to changes in flow was unknown. I hypothesized that the fluid shear stress (FSS) caused by the flow of <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate</b> on the apical surface of the tubules would stimulate apical endocytosis in PT epithelia. I used a cell culture based parallel plate flow chamber system to test my hypothesis, and used PT cells from opossum, mice and humans in this study. I determined that FSS stimulated a rapidly reversible increase in apical endocytosis of both albumin (Megalin ligand) and dextran (fluid phase marker) in OK cells, which starts within 30 min of exposure to a FSS of 1 dyne/cm 2 and the response increases linearly for at least three hours so long as FSS is maintained. This FSS-stimulated increase in endocytosis is clathrin and dynamin mediated. Primary cilia act as the principal mechanosensor in this process, and cause an increase in [Ca 2 +]i through the release of the ryanodine sensitive pool of calcium from the ER. In addition, purinergic signaling, triggered by the bending of cilia, is also important for both the FSS stimulated Ca 2 + and endocytic responses. Lowe syndrome is a rare X linked genetic disease that affects young boys. It is characterized by the loss of OCRL a lipid phosphatase, and causes proteinuria. The FSS stimulated increase in endocytosis is ablated in OCRL depleted human PT cells, and the length of cilia in OCRL depleted cells is also higher. However, the lengthening of cilia is not responsible for the loss of FSS stimulated responses in these cells. This dissertation synthesizes our current understanding of mechanosensitive regulation of endocytic capacity in proximal tubule epithelia, suggests a mechanism that may define the reason for proteinuria in Lowe syndrome patients, and highlights areas of opportunity for future investigations. ...|$|R

50|$|In renal physiology, {{reabsorption}} or {{tubular reabsorption}} {{is the process}} by which the nephron removes water and solutes from the tubular fluid (pre-urine) and returns them to the circulating blood. It is called reabsorption (and not absorption) both because these substances have already been absorbed once (particularly in the intestines) and because the body is reclaiming them from a postglomerular fluid stream that is {{well on its way to}} becoming urine (that is, they will soon be lost to the urine unless they are reclaimed). Substances are reabsorbed from the tubule into the peritubular capillaries. This happens as a result of sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the Na+/K+ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells. Thus, the <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate</b> becomes more concentrated, which is one of the steps in forming urine. Reabsorption allows many useful solutes (primarily glucose and amino acids), salts and water that have passed through Bowman's capsule, to return to the circulation. These solutes are reabsorbed isotonically, in that the osmotic potential of the fluid leaving the proximal convoluted tubule is the same as that of the initial <b>glomerular</b> <b>filtrate.</b> However, glucose, amino acids, inorganic phosphate, and some other solutes are reabsorbed via secondary active transport through cotransport channels driven by the sodium gradient.|$|R
