5|$|In Portland, the {{nickname}} is often attributed to Leo Samuel, {{who founded the}} Oregon Life Insurance Company in 1906 (known today as Standard Insurance Company). Samuel grew roses outside his home and placed a pair of shears outside his garden, so people could snip a <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> garden to take for themselves.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat and began to make his way towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
25|$|On {{one side}} of the coin is the {{customary}} portrait of Queen Elizabeth; on the other, 16th-century British explorer Martin Frobisher and a compass <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> era, along with images of the ship he sailed in search of the fabled Northwest Passage and an Inuit man paddling his kayak in ice-choked waters.|$|E

25|$|Here the Olympionic Victor was {{received}} with full honour; the King <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat and congratulated him most warmly on his success. Some of the King’s aides-de-camp, and {{several members of}} the Committee {{went so far as to}} kiss and embrace the victor, who finally was carried in triumph to the retiring room under the vaulted entrance. The scene witnessed then inside the Stadion cannot be easily described, even strangers were carried away by the general enthusiasm.|$|E
25|$|According to {{passenger}} testimony, one of {{the passengers}} <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat 10 minutes after takeoff and entered the cockpit, following which the aircraft changed direction and was joined by three Korean People's Air Force fighter jets. The aircraft landed at Sǒndǒk Airfield near Wonsan at 1:18 PM. North Korean soldiers boarded the aircraft afterwards, blindfolded the passengers, and instructed them to disembark. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair on landing. A member of the United States Air Force in South Korea {{was scheduled to be}} a passenger on the ill-fated flight, but instead caught a military transport flight at the last minute.|$|E
25|$|On the April 22, 1998 {{edition of}} Thunder, Bagwell {{wrestled}} a match against Rick Steiner which he won by disqualification when Scott Steiner interfered on his behalf. Just before that, however, Rick attempted his diving bulldog finishing move, {{which was not}} executed correctly and resulted in Bagwell's head striking Steiner's back, jamming his neck and severely injuring him. Bagwell was diagnosed with several damaged vertebrae and developed spinal shock, leading him to use a wheelchair and neck brace for some time. He returned months later for an interview only to be viciously ridiculed by Hollywood Hogan and shoved to the entryway floor. On July 6, after recently having neck surgery, the wheelchair-ridden Bagwell returned to WCW {{in his home state}} of Georgia. Bagwell seemed to have a new attitude and even called out Rick Steiner to offer him his forgiveness. However, Bagwell restrained Rick while fellow nWo member Scott Steiner assaulted him with a steel chair, reaffirming his loyalty to Hogan and the nWo. Bagwell then <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wheelchair and helped Scott beat down Rick. In January 1999, the nWo factions emerged, leading Bagwell and Steiner to side with the nWo Wolfpac. Their alliance ended at Uncensored when Bagwell accidentally hit Steiner with a chair, costing him the World Television Championship.|$|E

25|$|In 1636 the Manchus proclaimed their dynasty as the Qing dynasty and by 1644 {{they had}} {{completed}} their conquest of China under the prince regent Dorgon. The following year their forces approached Amdo on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama {{to visit their}} court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama {{as a means to}} facilitate submission of the Khalka Mongols, traditional patrons of the Karma Kagyu sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a priest-patron relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to kowtow to the emperor, who <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.|$|E
500|$|As a senior, his assist average {{fell from}} 7.1 to 6.1 per game, but his three-point shot and free throw {{percentages}} <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> prior years. [...] He shot 45.1% versus 34.1% in three point shots the prior year, {{which had been}} a career best. [...] Both his junior and senior seasons he took 164 attempts, but he made 74 as a senior versus just 56 as a junior. [...] His free throw percentage also recovered a bit in his senior season moving to 72.4% from 70.7% but still below his sophomore effort of 76.4%. [...] He {{finished second in the}} Big Ten in assists to Darius Morris, but also finished third in three point shooting percentage.|$|E
500|$|For {{the love}} story between {{characters}} Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, and acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and <b>Rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> film Titanic. An interviewer stated, [...] "Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous {{of their relationship}} and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities." [...] Cameron felt that {{whether or not the}} Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists. Though Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters do. Cameron said the two actors [...] "had a great chemistry" [...] during filming.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; {{he was unable to}} sit still and periodically <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E
500|$|About 90 {{minutes after}} Task Force Smith began its {{withdrawal}} from the Battle of Osan, the 34th Infantry sent Shadrick {{as part of a}} small scouting force northward to the village of Sojong-ni, [...] south of Osan. The small force, under the command of Lieutenant Charles E. Payne and consisting mostly of bazooka teams and infantry, halted at a graveyard in the village, where they spotted a North Korean T-34/85 tank on a road to the north. Shadrick and the other bazooka operators began firing on the tank from long-range concealed positions at around 16:00. With them was Sergeant Charles R. Turnbull, a US Army combat photographer. Turnbull asked Shadrick to time a bazooka shot so its flash could be caught in Turnbull's photograph, and Shadrick complied. Shadrick made the shot and paused, then <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> concealed position to see if he had successfully hit the tank, exposing himself. The T-34 returned fire with its machine gun, and two bullets struck Shadrick in the chest and arm. Shadrick died moments later.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1986, he {{resigned}} {{in a bitter}} Cabinet dispute with Thatcher over the Westland affair. He apparently gathered up his papers and <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat proclaiming, [...] "I {{can no longer be}} a member of this Cabinet" [...] and then marched out of the Cabinet Office. Within hours he issued a statement denouncing Thatcher's managerial style and suggesting she was a liar who lacked integrity.|$|E

25|$|A myth {{developed}} {{surrounding his}} death and roses. It was said: “To honour a visitor, the Egyptian beauty Nimet Eloui, Rilke gathered some <b>roses</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> garden. While doing so, he pricked his hand on a thorn. This small wound failed to heal, grew rapidly worse, soon his entire arm was swollen, and his other arm became affected as well”, and so he died.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Jolson <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{seat and}} ran down to the stage. [...] "God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good" [...] he cried to the audience. Stanley Watkins would always {{remember}} Jolson signing autographs after the show, tears streaming down his face. May McAvoy, Jolson's costar remembered that [...] " [...] police were there to control the crowds. It was a very big thing, like The Birth of a Nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, De Casseres {{started working}} as an {{assistant}} to Charles Emory Smith, editor of the Philadelphia Press, for $4 per week. At the Press, De Casseres <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> position {{as an assistant to}} become a [...] "copy boy," [...] editorial paragrapher, dramatic critic, proofreader, and (briefly) city editor. During his ten years at the press, De Casseres had a few publications, including one of his first signed editorials, an article that appeared in Belford's Magazine praising Thomas Brackett Reed.|$|E
2500|$|Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two {{men were}} very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an {{impeccable}} literary taste. In An Uncommon Story he wrote: [...] "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, Oblomov will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 19, 1970, John Norman Collins was {{unanimously}} {{found guilty}} of the first-degree murder of Karen Sue Beineman; he remained impassive upon hearing the jury foreman announce the verdict, although many spectators gasped audibly, and his mother and sister left the courtroom in tears. Formal sentencing was scheduled for 8:30a.m. August 28. On this date, Collins was formally sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Prior to his passing sentence, Judge Conlin asked Collins if he wished {{to address the court}} before mandatory life sentencing was imposed. In response, Collins <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> chair and made the following speech: ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{reached the}} Port of New York City on 17 June and went next to St. Louis in Missouri, a slave state that Koerner deeply abhorred. Shortly after, having {{departed}} that city, {{he and the}} Engelmanns settled down in the Shiloh Valley near Belleville, Illinois. (Demonstrating the sincerity and earnestness of Koerner's attitude toward the abolition of slavery, the 50th anniversary edition of the [...] "Belleviller Zeitung" [...] printed this example from [...] "those memorable days of the anti-slavery movement: A large crowd was gathered in great excitement in Belleville's public square. Koerner, inquiring {{for the cause of}} this unusual gathering and learning that a slave was being offered for sale, <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> horse, went to the auction stand, bought the slave, and immediately gave him freedom.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper {{was unable}} to {{capitalize}} on his Easy Rider success for several years. In 1970 he filmed The Last Movie, cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by Laszlo Kovacs in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like Easy Rider, and {{did not like the}} film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding - as convoluted as an abstract painting. On viewing the first release print, fresh from the lab, in his screening room at Universal, MCA founder Jules Stein <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> chair and said, [...] "I just don't understand this younger generation." [...] During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico, which he had purchased in 1970, for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from Easy Rider, he married Michelle Phillips in October 1970.|$|E
