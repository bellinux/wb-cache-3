40|$|We {{propose a}} Universal Debt Rollover Option with a Penalty (UDROP) to prevent {{liquidity}} crises for foreign-currency debt. All foreign-currency liabilities {{should have an}} attached option entitling the borrower to extend performing debt for a specified period at a penalty rate. UDROP is market-oriented; contracting parties determine the option's price. Subsequent derivatives trading cannot undo it because contingent liabilities must also carry the option. No public money is required and all creditors are automatically 'bailed in'. The proposal is rule based and general. This contrasts with the current practice of discretionary and politicized <b>refinancing</b> <b>arrangements</b> cobbled together by the IMF...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the UDROP {{proposal}} is to prevent debt rollover crises for foreign-currency-denominated debt instruments. For such liabilities, there is no international analogue to the domestic lender of last resort or to domestic deposit insurance. UDROP stands for Universal Debt Rollover Option with a Penalty. Our proposal is that all foreign currency loans should have a rollover option attached to them. The 'pure' version of the option would entitle the borrower to extend or roll-over his performing debt at maturity for a specified period. The pricing of the option would {{be left to the}} contracting parties. A number of variants on the basic version are also considered. These make the individual borrower's ability to exercise his option contingent on the prior declaration of a state of 'disorderly markets', by the national central bank, the International Monetary Fund or an indicator of 'disorderly markets'. All versions of the scheme have the property that no commitment of public money is required, either by national governments or by international agencies such as the IMF or the World Bank. The UDROP proposal is rule based and general: it is mandatory for all foreign-currency debt and automatic. That is, it is exercised at the discretion of the borrower. This stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} current practice of discretionary and politicised <b>refinancing</b> <b>arrangements</b> cobbled together in an ad-hoc manner on a case-by-case basis by the IMF. UDROP is market-oriented: the terms and conditions on any foreign-currency loan and associated roll-over option would be negotiated by the lenders and borrowers.

2500|$|In 1996, the British Parliament {{passed the}} Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996 to reorganise the Humber Bridge Board's debts {{to ensure the}} bridge could be safely maintained. Although a {{significant}} proportion of the debt was suspended in that <b>refinancing</b> <b>arrangement</b> there was no [...] "write off" [...] of debt and the suspended portion is being gradually re-activated as the Bridge Board pays off the remainder of the active debt.|$|R
50|$|In March 1990, in a <b>refinancing</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the Tribune Company of Chicago {{doubled its}} {{shareholding}} to a 17.7% holding, and invested $2.9 million, {{making it the}} largest shareholder. Guardian and Manchester Evening News P.L.C., then without a national Sunday title, also became involved acquiring a 16.6% stake and gave the struggling company a substantial loan. The company had said the paper's break-even point was a circulation of 350,000, but the title was then selling only 220,000 copies.|$|R
