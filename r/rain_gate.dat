5000|$|This flume is 2500 ft long, {{including}} a 284 ft section on a 6 ft suspension bridge. The conduit {{over the bridge}} is 30 x 12 in and runs alongside a footway. The Barbatia provides the largest quantity of clean water: about [...] in the driest month. The flume has a silt tank with scour gates near its intake; in heavy <b>rains,</b> these <b>gates</b> are left partly open so that grit is automatically scoured out.|$|R
50|$|To date, DC Water has {{significantly}} reduced CSOs by eliminating approximately 40 {{percent of the}} overflows through a $140 million construction and mitigation program. This investment included inflatable dams to catch and store overflows during <b>rain</b> storms; tide <b>gates</b> to keep river water from flowing into the sewer system; sewer separation to eliminate CSO outfalls; and pumping station construction and rehabilitation to increase flow capacity.|$|R
50|$|The {{boat house}} {{established}} by Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) in the Kolavai lake which is alongside the NH 45 highway {{has turned into}} a place where people can relax with their families on weekends. The monsoon <b>rains</b> flooded the <b>gates</b> of the lake in December 2005 due to which the TTDC boat club operation has been stopped. It also serves as a bridge connecting all nearby districts with the renowned tourist places like Mahabalipuram, Muttukadu, theme parks on East Coast Road (ECR), Thirukazhukundram, town.|$|R

One {{of a set}} of prints by an {{unidentified}} Russian photographer, bearing caption in English and also captions in Russian on the reverse. They are also accompanied by a hand written list of captions, and where this differs from the caption witten on the print, this has been included in square brackets above.; William Lockhart was among the pioneers of medical missionary work for the LMS. He travelled to Canton [now Guangzhou] in 1838, opening hospitals at Macao [now Macau] and Shanghai before opening a mission in Peking [now Beijing] in 1861. Lockhart left Beijing in 1864, although remained connected with the Society, serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1869. Lockhart obtained these prints during his time in Beijing, and they came into the LMS collection from Constance Patterson [née Brown] who had been given them by Lockhart's daughter, Mrs. Jervis...|$|R
500|$|After Li's {{message was}} unable to get through, Cao Qin began the assault on Dongan Gate, East Chang'an Gate and West Chang'an Gate, setting fire to the western and eastern gates; these fires were {{extinguished}} {{later in the day}} by pouring <b>rain.</b> Defending these <b>gates</b> were 5,610 imperial bodyguards, who were generously rewarded after the conflict for their merit in maintaining a strong defense. Ming troops poured into the area outside the Imperial City to counterattack; Li Xian and Wang Ao were able to flee, but Wu Jin {{and the head of the}} Censorate, Kou Shen (寇深; 13911461), were killed by Cao's soldiers. Kou had earlier denounced Cao as a criminal and was an associate of Lu Gao; when Cao's soldiers found Kou in a waiting room outside Chang'an Gate, he cursed at them before they cut him down.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the atmosphere on nadir directed signal associated with satellite altimeters are examined. Frequencies at 6, 13. 5, and 35 GHz are selected so as to provide a parameter study. Uncertainties are summarized in both existing and proposed techniques which establish ionospheric and tropospheric height corrections. The error summary thus gives values describing {{the best you can}} do in height resolution (as dictated by atmospheric parameters) for a satellite borne altimeter system. The results presented reflect data gleaned from the literature, at large, as well as from the existing body of published literature associated with the Seasat A Altimeter Experiment. Specifically considered are: (1) the effects of precipitation on altimeter signals, (2) range errors due to refractive index variations in both the clear atmosphere (convective and nonconvective) and clouds, and (3) range errors introduced by the ionosphere. A preliminary analysis is pursued establishing the feasibility of incorporating <b>rain</b> rate range <b>gates</b> in a future satellite-borne altimeter system...|$|R
40|$|The {{method for}} the daily {{monitoring}} of the differential reflectivity bias for polarimetric weather radars is developed further. Improved quality control {{is applied to the}} solar signals detected during the operational scanning of the radar, which efficiently removes <b>rain</b> and clutter-contaminated <b>gates</b> occurring in the solar hits. The simultaneous reflectivity data are used as a proxy to determine which data points are to be removed. A number of analysis methods to determine the differential reflectivity bias are compared, and methods based on surface fitting are found superior to simple averaging. A separate fit to the reflectivity of the horizontal and vertical polarization channels is recommended because of stability. Separate fitting also provides, in addition to the differential reflectivity bias, the pointing difference of the polarization channels. Data from the Finnish weather radar network show that the pointing difference is less than 0. 02 ° and that the differential reflectivity bias is stable and determined to better than 0. 04  dB. The results are compared to those from measurements at vertical incidence, which allows us to determine the total differential reflectivity bias including the differential receiver bias and the transmitter bias...|$|R
60|$|All {{this rather}} turned Nat's head; {{and as he}} sat in the {{brilliant}} opera-house, chatted among the ladies at some select coffee-party, or whisked an eminent professor's amiable daughter down the room, trying to imagine she was Daisy, he often asked himself if this gay fellow could be the poor homeless little Street musician who once stood waiting in the <b>rain</b> at the <b>gates</b> of Plumfield. His heart was true, his impulses good, and his ambitions high; but the weak side of his nature came uppermost here; vanity led him astray, pleasure intoxicated him, and for a time he forgot everything but the delights of this new and charming life. Without meaning to deceive, he allowed people to imagine him a youth of good family and prospects; he boasted a little of Mr Laurie's wealth and influence, of Professor Bhaer's eminence, and the flourishing college at which he himself had been educated. Mrs Jo was introduced to the sentimental Frauleins who read her books, and the charms and virtues of his own dear Madchen confided to sympathetic mammas. All these boyish boastings and innocent vanities were duly circulated among the gossips, and his importance much increased thereby, to his surprise and gratification, as well as some shame.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{techniques}} of quality control of radar reflectivity data rely on local texture and vertical profiles {{to discriminate between}} precipitating echoes and non-precipitating echoes. Non-precipitating echoes {{may be due to}} artifacts such as anamalous propagation, ground clutter, electronic interference, sun strobe, and biological contaminants (i. e., birds, bats and insects). The local texture of reflectivity fields suffices to remove most artifacts, except for biological echoes. Biological echoes, also called ”bloom ” echoes because of their circular shape and expanding size during the night time, have proven difficult to remove, especially in peak migration seasons of various biological species, because they can have local and vertical characteristics similar to that of stratiform rain or snow. In this paper, we describe a technique that identifies candidate bloom echoes based on the range-variance of reflectivity in areas of bloom, and uses the global, rather than local, characteristic of the echo to discriminate between bloom and <b>rain.</b> Every range <b>gate</b> is assigned a probability that it corresponds to bloom using morphological (shape-based) operations and a neural network is trained using this probability as one of the input features. We demonstrate that this technique is capable of identifying and removing echoes due to biological targets and other types of artifacts while retaining echoes that correspond to precipitation...|$|R
40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} rainfall statistics {{is that they}} in general depend on the space and time scales over which rain data are averaged. As a part of an earlier effort to determine the sampling error of satellite rain averages, a space-time model of rainfall statistics was developed to describe the statistics of gridded <b>rain</b> observed in <b>GATE.</b> The model allows one to compute the second moment statistics of space- and time-averaged rain rate which can be fitted to satellite or rain gauge data to determine the four model parameters appearing in the precipitation spectrum - an overall strength parameter, a characteristic length separating the long and short wavelength regimes and a characteristic relaxation time for decay of the autocorrelation of the instantaneous local rain rate and a certain 'fractal' power law exponent. For area-averaged instantaneous rain rate, this exponent governs the power law dependence of these statistics on the averaging length scale L predicted by the model {{in the limit of}} small L. In particular, the variance of rain rate averaged over an L × L area exhibits a power law singularity as L → 0. In the present work the model is used to investigate how the statistics of area-averaged rain rate over the tropical Western Pacific measured with ship borne radar during TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmospheric Response Experiment) and gridded on a 2 km grid depends {{on the size of the}} spatial averaging scale. Good agreement is found between the data and predictions from the model over a wide range of averaging length scales...|$|R
500|$|Rain World {{punishing}} gameplay frustrated reviewers, {{who often}} descended into apathy. Considering the random enemy spawns, one-hit kills, infrequent game saves, frequent repetition, crushing rain, some inexplicable enemy movements, and sometimes clumsy controls, IGN wrote {{that any of}} the game's challenging elements taken alone would be [...] "tough but fair", but when considered together, [...] "the odds are stacked so high against the player that it risks toppling the entire structure of the game". Reviewers were bored by the repeated navigation of rooms with random enemies after each death, which tempered their strong urge to explore. Polygon reviewer was miserable following the loss of her multi-hour progression. She wrote about futility as a central tenet of Rain World, and felt that she was not given the proper tools to survive. Reviewers lamented, in particular, how Slugcat's jerky animations and imprecise throwing mechanics led to many unwarranted deaths. Multiple reviewers concluded that while some hardcore players might enjoy the tough gameplay, Rain World excluded a large audience with its design choices, as its choice of emergent enemy strategy would feel unfair to most players. Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the game's checkpointing among the worst in modern platformers, and its challenge, unlike the similarly punishing Dark Souls, without purpose. <b>Rain</b> World karmic <b>gates,</b> which require players to have a positive hibernate to death ratio, were arbitrary goals [...] "disrespectful" [...] of the player's time, according to GameSpot. Making players trudge through an area a dozen times, IGN argued, is [...] "antithetical" [...] in a game in which exploration itself is the reward. PC Gamer reviewer, with time, began to see Rain World cumbersome controls less as [...] "bad design" [...] than as [...] "thematically appropriate", given the game's intent to disempower the player.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a string}} of people already straggling in, whom it was not {{difficult}} to identify as the nondescript messengers, go-betweens, and errand-bearers of the place. Some {{of them had been}} lounging in the <b>rain</b> until the <b>gate</b> should open; others, who had timed their arrival with greater nicety, were coming up now, and passing in with damp whitey-brown paper bags from the grocers, loaves of bread, lumps of butter, eggs, milk, and the like. The shabbiness of these attendants upon shabbiness, the poverty of these insolvent waiters upon insolvency, was a sight to see. Such threadbare coats and trousers, such fusty gowns and shawls, such squashed hats and bonnets, such boots and shoes, such umbrellas and walking-sticks, never were seen in Rag Fair. All of them wore the cast-off clothes of other men and women, were made up of patches and pieces of other people's individuality, and had no sartorial existence of their own proper. Their walk was the walk of a race apart. They had a peculiar way of doggedly slinking round the corner, as if they were eternally going to the pawnbroker's. When they coughed, they coughed like people accustomed to be forgotten on doorsteps and in draughty passages, waiting for answers to letters in faded ink, which gave the recipients of those manuscripts great mental disturbance and no satisfaction. As they eyed the stranger in passing, they eyed him with borrowing eyes--hungry, sharp, speculative as to his softness if they were accredited to him, and the likelihood of his standing something handsome. Mendicity on commission stooped in their high shoulders, shambled in their unsteady legs, buttoned and pinned and darned and dragged their clothes, frayed their button-holes, leaked out of their figures in dirty little ends of tape, and issued from their mouths in alcoholic breathings.|$|R

60|$|I did not {{visit the}} palace, but the Royal Armory I had seen {{two days before}} on a gay morning {{that had not yet}} sorrowed to the afternoon's <b>rain.</b> At the <b>gate</b> of the palace I fell into the keeping of one of the {{authorized}} guides whom I wish I could identify so that I could send the reader to pay him the tip I came short in. It is a pang to think of the repressed disappointment in his face when in a moment of insensate sparing I gave him the bare peseta to which he was officially entitled, instead of the two or three due his zeal and intelligence; and I strongly urge my readers to be on their guard against a mistaken meanness like mine. I can never repair that, for if I went back to the Royal Armory I should not know him by sight, and if I sought among the guides saying I was the stranger who had behaved in that shabby sort, how would that identify me among so many other shabby strangers? He had the intelligence to leave me and the constant companion of these travels to ourselves as we went about that treasury of wonders, but before we got to the armory he stayed us with a delicate gesture outside the court of the palace till a troop for the guard-mounting had gone in. Then he led us across the fine, beautiful quadrangle {{to the door of the}} museum, and waited for us there till we came out. By this time the space was brilliant with the confronted bodies of troops, those about to be relieved of guard duty, and those come to relieve them, and our guide got us excellent places where we could see everything and yet be out of the wind which was beginning to blow cuttingly through the gates and colonnades. There were all arms of the service--horse, foot, and artillery; and the ceremony, with its pantomime and parley, was much more impressive than the changing of the colors which I had once seen at Buckingham Palace. The Spanish privates took the business not less seriously than the British, and however they felt the Spanish officers did not allow themselves to look bored. The marching and countermarching was of a refined stateliness, as if the pace were not a goose step but a peacock step; and the music was of an exquisitely plaintive and tender note, which seemed to grieve rather than exult; I believe it was the royal march which they were playing, but I am not versed in such matters. Nothing could have been fitter than the quiet beauty of the spectacle, opening through the westward colonnade to the hills and woods of the royal demesne, with yellowing and embrowning trees that billowed from distance to distance. Some day these groves and forests must be for the people's pleasure, as all royal belongings seem finally to be; and in the mean time I did not grudge the landscape to the young king and queen who probably would not have grudged it to me. Our guide valued himself upon our admiration of it; without our special admiration he valued himself upon the impressive buildings of the railway station in the middle distance. I forget whether he followed us out of the quadrangle into the roadway where we had the advantage of some picturesque army wagons, and some wagoners in red-faced jackets and red trousers, and top-boots with heavy fringes of leathern strings. Yet it must have been he who made us aware of a high-walled inclosure where soldiers found worthy of death by court martial could be conveniently shot; though I think we discovered for ourselves the old woman curled up out of the wind in a sentry-box, and sweetly asleep there while the boys were playing marbles on the smooth ground before it. I must not omit the peanut-boaster in front of the palace; it was in the figure of an ocean steamer, nearly as large as the Lusitania, and had smoke coming out of the funnel, with rudder and screw complete and doll sailors climbing over the rigging.|$|R
