500|$|While {{promoting}} Deadpool (in which Reynolds portrays another famous {{comic book}} superhero), Reynolds said that filming Green Lantern itself had been frustrating, [...] "You <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> visionary behind {{a movie like}} that, {{but it was the}} classic studio story: [...] "We have a poster, but we don't have a script or know what we want; let's start shooting!" [...] The Deadpool film itself references Reynolds' time as Green Lantern in two scenes, the opening scene which features a drawing of Green Lantern, and a later scene where his character (who has the ability to Break the fourth wall) [...] insists that his suit be neither [...] "green, or animated!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} {{critical}} of the album {{and gave it a}} [...] "D" [...] rating. Although he called it a [...] "nice idea", he found the collection unnecessary and stated, [...] "do we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> Spanish version of 'Don't Rain on My Parade'?". Author Waldman wrote that the album was unsuccessful due to the singer being [...] "dwarfed by the overproduction"; additionally, she felt that Streisand's duet with Ray Charles should have been included on the initial pressing, and Waldman also noted that there were [...] "no new songs added" [...] to the record. She stated that [...] "the message was clear for Streisand ... keep moving forward".|$|E
500|$|Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph reacted {{positively}} {{towards the}} series, stating [...] "episode one was enjoyably sinister. It was also, once or twice, quite amusing, in (of course) a blokey way." [...] Deacon liked {{the beginning of}} the pilot where the main characters record a video message, stating [...] "this is what Mad Dogs did well – like any competent suspense thriller, it made you ask questions throughout. The episode bubbled with foreboding, right up to the cliffhanger." [...] Deacon also noted at the cliffhanger that [...] "the most disturbing sight wasn't the shower of blood but the gunman's rubber mask, which was of a grinning Tony Blair." [...] John Crace of The Guardian was more mixed, starting [...] "after unsuccessfully fobbing us off with endless series of Ross Kemp looking macho, Sky is now throwing serious money at getting viewers to watch something other than sport." [...] Crace was critical of the set up of the episode, stating [...] "I'm all for allowing a drama time to breathe but we didn't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> whole hour just to establish that Alvo was a bit dodgy and that the four others had complications in their lives. Rather than building menace, the snail-like pace dissipated it," [...] However, he reacted positively towards the end, as [...] "things did eventually look up," [...] adding [...] "there's hope for Mad Dogs yet." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1971 Smith {{wrote to}} Klinger that, [...] "It is now {{becoming}} critical that somebody start making films {{out of my}} books. This is essential for my career - which <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> good film to take off in the Alistair Maclean class." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B overall. In her recap, she favored the Belle-centric storyline by giving it a B+: [...] "The upside, though, is a strong episode for Belle; Gaston is downright dishy (although still evil); and a Belle plot means more Rumple time, always welcome." [...] However, the other plotline garnered a C-: [...] "The main plot fared even better compared to the dumb B-plot, with Emma, Hook and Snow Scooby-ing up the place, with an enchanted elevator, a dream sequence, and what {{looks to be a}} wild goose chase that results in the discovery of Red/Ruby. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the culmination of the Ruby/Mulan relationship, but did we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> whole episode just to discover the wolf?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During a UFC 128 post-fight {{interview}} with Ariel Helwani, Evans {{stated that he}} was done training at Jackson's Martial Arts in preparation for his fight with Jon Jones. [...] He then commenced training at Imperial Athletics in Boca Raton, Florida, at a new camp co-founded by Evans and several Brazilian fighters who had concomitantly left American Top Team due to a dispute over management services; these were later joined by some African-American fighters, {{and as a result}} the camp's members became known colloquially as the [...] "Blackzilians," [...] especially on Twitter. Evans gave further insight to MMAWeekly about his leaving Jackson's Submission Fighting, “When you get to a certain point, you <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> lot of time (with the coaches)… make sure you get the one-on-one, and you just need different things,” he explained. “After being at Jackson’s for a while, with so many people at the gym, it just got harder and harder for me to get that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas rarely {{spoke to}} the actors, who felt that he {{expected}} too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "more intense". Kurtz stated that [...] "it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> lot of pampering {{and a lot of}} feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job." [...] Kurtz has said that Lucas [...] "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors." ...|$|E
50|$|Crystal-controlled {{superheterodyne}} receivers {{with better}} selectivity and stability made control equipment more capable and at lower cost. Multi-channel developments were of particular use to aircraft, which <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> {{minimum of three}} control dimensions (yaw, pitch and motor speed), as opposed to boats, which required only two or one.|$|R
50|$|On 29 September 1992, Malaysia {{suffered}} {{a long and}} total power blackout caused by lightning striking a transmission facility and causing a rolling failure in the transmission and distribution system.According to Tan Sri Ani Arope in his memory book, the incident was actually planned and executed by YTL, an IPP company just to prove that how Malaysia <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>an</b> IPP company.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was doing}} a film in New Zealand, on my own, in winter. I <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> book. I {{stumbled}} across a Thorne novel, liked it, and then I looked up Mark online and found a question-and-answer session where {{he said that if}} his books ever made it to the screen, he’d like David Morrissey to play the lead. I thought, [...] "That’s a good start".|$|R

2500|$|Amy Madigan {{originally}} {{read for}} Reva, Cody's sister, and told Hill and Silver {{that she wanted}} {{to play the role of}} McCoy which, she remembers, [...] "was written to be played by an overweight male who was a good soldier and <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> job. It could still be tough and strong and have a woman do it without rewriting the part." [...] Hill liked the idea and cast her.|$|R
50|$|I think I just <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> {{break from}} it. It {{had lost its}} magic for me. Totally. Also, for some reason, I {{had to have a}} bit of a {{rebellion}} against AAE. Maybe it's {{something along the lines of}} why teenagers fall out with their parents and find everything about them embarrassing... Then they grow up a bit and realise that their Mum and Dad aren't too bad at all.|$|R
60|$|Much {{the same}} {{might be said}} of the social hospitalities which raised our visitor's surprise. For example, many people are now asked to dinner who <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> dinner, and not merely those who revolt from the notion of dinner with loathing, and go to it with abhorrence. At the tables of our highest social leaders one now meets on a perfect {{equality}} persons of interesting minds and uncommon gifts who would once have been excluded because they were hungry, or were not in the hostess's set, or had not a new gown or a dress-suit. This contributes greatly to the pleasure of the time, and promotes the increasing kindliness between the rich and poor for which our status is above all things notable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think it}} could be managed so that Rachel and I wouldn't clash at all. It always seemed to me that the reason two women can't get along in one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each other's way. Now, if Rachel came here, she could have the north gable for her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not, for we don't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> spare room at all. She could put her stove there and what {{furniture}} she wanted to keep, and be real comfortable and independent. She'll have enough to live on of course...her children'll see to that...so all I'd be giving her would be house room. Yes, Anne, far as I'm concerned I'd like it." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the largest}} theme parks (especially Disney Parks), popular costumed {{characters}} are {{often accompanied by}} one or more assistants in regular park uniforms, who handle customer service, security, and crowd control. This minimizes the necessity for performers to break character to deal with those kinds of issues. When <b>a</b> performer <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> break (as staying in character is hard work), they simply give a prearranged signal, and their handler will then assure patrons the character will be back momentarily.|$|R
