A Chordal Graph is a graph in which every cycle of length more than 3 has a chord. A Split Graph is a chordal graph whose vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A threshold graph is a split graph in which the neighbourhoods of the independent set vertices form a linear order under set inclusion. In this article, we show the following: 1. The problem of deciding whether a graph can be rainbow coloured using 3 colours remains NP-complete even when restricted to the class of split graphs. However, any split graph can be rainbow coloured in linear time using at most one more colour than the optimum. 2. For every integer k[*]≥[*] 3, the problem of deciding whether a graph can be rainbow coloured using k colours remains NP-complete even when restricted to the class of chordal graphs. 3. For every positive integer k, threshold graphs with rainbow connection number k can be characterised based on their degree sequence alone.

40|$|A rainbow path in an edge {{coloured}} graph is a path {{in which}} no two edges are coloured the same. A <b>rainbow</b> <b>colouring</b> of a connected graph G is a colouring of the edges of G such that every pair of vertices in G is connected {{by at least one}} rainbow path. The minimum number of colours required to rainbow colour G is called its rainbow connection number. It is known that, unless P = NP, the rainbow connection number of a graph cannot be approximated in polynomial time to a multiplicative factor less than 5 / 4, even when the input graph is chordal Chandran and Rajendraprasad, FSTTCS 2013]. In this article, we determine the computational complexity of the above problem on successively more restricted graph classes, viz. : split graphs and threshold graphs. In particular, we establish the following: 1. The problem of deciding whether a given split graph can be rainbow coloured using k colours is NP-complete for k is an element of { 2, 3 }, but can be solved in polynomial time for all other values of k. Furthermore, any split graph can be rainbow coloured in linear time using at most one more colour than the optimum. 2. For every positive integer k, threshold graphs with rainbow connection number k can be characterised based on their degree sequence alone. Furthermore, we can optimally rainbow colour a threshold graph in linear time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A rainbow path in an edge {{coloured}} graph is a path {{in which}} no two edges are coloured the same. A <b>rainbow</b> <b>colouring</b> of a connected graph G is a colouring of the edges of G such that every pair of vertices in G is connected {{by at least one}} rainbow path. The minimum number of colours required to rainbow colour G is called its rainbow connection number. Between them, Chakraborty et al. [J. Comb. Optim., 2011] and Ananth et al. [FSTTCS, 2012] have shown that for every integer k, k ≥ 2, it is NP-complete to decide whether a given graph can be rainbow coloured using k colours. A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. Chandran and Rajendraprasad have shown that the problem of deciding whether a given split graph G can be rainbow coloured using 3 colours is NP-complete and further have described a linear time algorithm to rainbow colour any split graph using at most one colour more than the optimum [COCOON, 2012]. In this article, we settle the computational complexity of the problem on split graphs and thereby discover an interesting dichotomy. Specifically, we show that the problem of deciding whether a given split graph can be rainbow coloured using k colours is NP-complete for k ∈ 2, 3, but can be solved in polynomial time for all other values of k.

40|$|A <b>rainbow</b> <b>colouring</b> of a {{connected}} graph G is a colouring of {{the edges of}} G such that every pair of vertices in G is connected {{by at least one}} path in which no two edges are coloured the same. The minimum number of colours required to rainbow colour G is called its rainbow connection number. Chakraborty, Fischer, Matsliah and Yuster have shown that it is NP-hard to compute the rainbow connection number of graphs [J. Comb. Optim., 2011]. Basavaraju, Chandran, Rajendraprasad and Ramaswamy have reported an (r + 3) -factor approximation algorithm to rainbow colour any graph of radius r [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2012]. In this article, we use a result of Guruswami, Håstad and Sudan on the NP-hardness of colouring a 2 -colourable 4 -uniform hypergraph using constantly many colours [SIAM J. Comput., 2002] to show that for every positive integer k, it is NP-hard to distinguish between graphs with rainbow connection number 2 k + 2 and 4 k + 2. This, in turn, implies that there cannot exist a polynomial time algorithm to rainbow colour graphs with less than twice the optimum number of colours, unless P = NP. The authors have earlier shown that the rainbow connection number problem remains NPhard even when restricted to the class of chordal graphs, though in this case a 4 -factor approximation algorithm is available [COCOON, 2012]. In this article, we improve upon the 4 -factor approximation algorithm to design a linear-time algorithm that can rainbow colour a chordal graph G using at most 3 / 2 times the minimum number of colours if G is bridgeless and at most 5 / 2 times the minimum number of colours otherwise. Finally we show that the rainbow connection number of bridgeless chordal graphs cannot be polynomial-time approximated to a factor less than 5 / 4, unless P = NP...|$|E
40|$|We study graph {{parameters}} {{arising from}} {{different types of}} colourings of random graphs, defined broadly as an assignment of colours to either the vertices or the edges of a graph. The chromatic number X(G) of a graph is the minimum number of colours required for a vertex colouring where no two adjacent vertices are coloured the same. Determining the chromatic number {{is one of the}} classic challenges in random graph theory. In Chapter 3, we give new upper and lower bounds for the chromatic number of the dense random graph &# 119970;(n,p)) where p ∈ (0, 1) is constant. These bounds are the first to match up to an additive term of order o (1) in the denominator, and in particular, they determine the average colour class size in an optimal colouring up to an additive term of order o (1). In Chapter 4, we study a related graph parameter called the equitable chromatic number. This is defined as the minimum number of colours needed for a vertex colouring where no two adjacent vertices are coloured the same and, additionally, all colour classes are as equal in size as possible. We prove one point concentration of the equitable chromatic number of the dense random graph &# 119970;(n,m) with m = pn(n- 1) / 2, p < 1 - 1 / e 2 constant, on a subsequence of the integers. We also show that whp, the dense random graph &# 119970;(n,p) allows an almost equitable colouring with a near optimal number of colours. We call an edge colouring of a graph G a <b>rainbow</b> <b>colouring</b> if every pair of vertices is joined by a rainbow path, which is a path where no colour is repeated. The least number of colours where this is possible is called the rainbow connection number rc(G). Since its introduction in 2008 as a new way to quantify how well connected a given graph is, the rainbow connection number has attracted the attention of a great number of researchers. For any graph G, rc(G) ≥diam(G), where diam(G) denotes the diameter. In Chapter 5, we will see that in the random graph G(n,p), rainbow connection number 2 is essentially equivalent to diameter 2. More specifically, we consider G ∼ &# 119970;(n,p) close to the diameter 2 threshold and show that whp rc(G) = diam(G) ∈ { 2, 3 }. Furthermore, we show that in the random graph process, whp the hitting times of diameter 2 and of rainbow connection number 2 coincide. In Chapter 6, we investigate sharp thresholds for the property rc(G) ≤=r where r is a fixed integer. The results of Chapter 6 imply that for r= 2, the properties rc(G) ≤= 2 and diam(G) ≤= 2 share the same sharp threshold. For r≥ 3, the situation seems quite different. We propose an alternative threshold and prove that this is an upper bound for the sharp threshold for rc(G) ≤=r where r≥ 3. </p...|$|E
