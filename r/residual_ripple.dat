50|$|Originally, most AC/DC {{adapters}} were linear power supplies, {{containing a}} transformer {{to convert the}} mains electricity voltage to a lower voltage, a rectifier to convert it to pulsating DC, and a filter to smooth the pulsating waveform to DC, with <b>residual</b> <b>ripple</b> variations small enough to leave the powered device unaffected. Size and weight of the device was largely determined by the transformer, which in turn {{was determined by the}} power output and mains frequency. Ratings over a few watts made the devices too large and heavy to be physically supported by a wall outlet. The output voltage of these adapters varied with load; for equipment requiring a more stable voltage, linear voltage regulator circuitry was added. Losses in the transformer and the linear regulator were considerable; efficiency was relatively low, and significant power dissipated as heat even when not driving a load.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of televisions in the 1930s {{was determined by}} a number of technical limitations. The AC power line frequency was used for the vertical refresh rate for two reasons. The first reason was that the television's vacuum tube was susceptible to interference from the unit's power supply, including <b>residual</b> <b>ripple.</b> This could cause drifting horizontal bars (hum bars). Using the same frequency reduced this, and made interference static on the screen and therefore less obtrusive. The second reason was that television studios would use AC lamps, filming at a different frequency would cause strobing. Thus producers {{had little choice but to}} run sets at 60 Hz in America, and 50 Hz in Europe. These rates formed the basis for the sets used today: 60 Hz System M (almost always used with NTSC color coding) and 50 Hz System B/G (almost always used with PAL or SECAM color coding). This accident of chance gave European sets higher resolution, in exchange for lower frame-rates. Compare System M (704 × 480 at 30i) and System B/G (704 × 576 at 25i). However, the lower refresh rate of 50 Hz introduces more flicker, so sets that use digital technology to double the refresh rate to 100 Hz are now very popular.

There are several tool paths utilized in CCOS processes, such as the regular raster and spiral paths, and several kinds of random path [9 – 11]. The random path is claimed to be useful for reducing the MSF error, [12] but is hard to achieve a high precision surface form because of the difficulty in tool speed management [7]. The spiral and raster paths are more prone to generating MSF error in terms of <b>residual</b> <b>ripples</b> due to their inherent regular pattern. Spiral paths are suitable for circular optics as the tool is driven to traverse a radius while the optic mounted on a turntable rotates simultaneously [13].|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Although well {{established}} in the aviation community, low-cost and vehicle-independent “black-box” technology for accident analysis, adapted to mass-market ground-based vehicles, is an emerging technology with growing importance. Whilst several products suited for cars {{are available on the}} market, almost no devices adapted for motorcycles exist. Due mainly to their particular dynamics and lack of space for installing any external device, the design of a data-recorder technology for motorcycles is nontrival. This becomes even more challenging if the technology has to be independent of the motorcycle type, low-cost, easy and fast to mount, and not based on GNSS technology (for autonomy and privacy issues). Motorcycle speed is an essential information for analyzing the driver’s behavior at pre-crash phase. Based on inertial data delivered from an autarkic low-cost, MEMSbased inertial measurement unit (IMU) and voltage ripple signals taken from the motorcycles battery, we reconstruct forward velocity of a motorcycle respecting 5 % error bars over a wide velocity range. The off-line reconstruction is based on a strapdown navigation algorithm combined with an autonomous (i. e. without GNSS) aiding via an extended Kalman filter. To stabilize the growth of inertial error the filter uses as the external measurements the residual periodic voltage fluctuations of the motorcycle’s generator – the <b>residual</b> AC <b>ripple</b> – together with available information on vehicle transmission and its geometry. Despite the structural simplicity of the algorithm and the relatively low performance of the IMU, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed off-line estimator delivers accurate autarkic speed estimates for a large class of motorcycles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract|The {{response}} {{functions in}} many engineer-ing problems are piecewise smooth functions, although globally {{they can be}} highly nonlinear. The lin-ear Shepard algorithm (a moving window weighted least squares method based on linear functions) usu-ally creates reasonable approximations. When used to approximate data obtained from piecewise linear functions, a better approximation near the function creases is obtained when a robust linear Shepard algorithm is used. Due to limitations of the ro-bust linear Shepard algorithm in high dimensions, <b>RIPPLE</b> (<b>residual</b> initiated polynomial-time piecewise linear estimation) was developed for piecewise linear estimation of high dimensional data. RIPPLE selects minimal sets of data based on a minimal residual criterion. Once the best minimal set is obtained, RIPPLE adds other consistent data points using a robust statistical procedure. RIPPLE is resistant to outliers. It produces good approximations even if the data contains signicant random errors. The code L 2 WPMA (least squares weighted piecewise monotonic approximation, ACM TOMS Algorithm 863) calculates a piecewise monotonic approximation to n univariate data points contaminated by random errors. The continuous piecewise linear approximation consists of k (a positive integer provided by the user) monotonic linear splines, alternately monotonically increasing and monotonically decreasing. An optimal approximation is obtained if there are at most k monotonic sections in the exact data.

40|$|Today's {{world of}} {{electronics}} {{becomes more and}} more digital and therefore CMOS becomes the dominant technology. A CMOS process compared to a bipolar process offers several advantages, mainly a low power consumption which is important for portable systems powered by batteries or for large systems. Another point is the smaller device geometries, which increase the number of gates that can be packed on a single chip. Parallel to the increasing digital domain the analog field persists, because the origin of physical phenomenons and their perception is analog. Electronic sensors perceive these analog events and deliver a corresponding output signal. If this analog signal is not suitable for digital processing some analog preconditioning must be done [YEN 82]. Combining both types of signal processing on the same chip to obtain the best possible performances is therefore desirable [MID 84]. CMOS technology has led to a wide use of voltages and charge transfers for signal processing. As the feature sizes shrink a lower supply voltage is imposed, which reduces the dynamic voltage range of the circuits. Because process parameters are chosen to optimize digital performances, the analog functional blocks have to adapt themselves to the restricted voltage range. Current mode circuits offer a solution to these problems as they require only a baseline digital process and avoid many of the anticipated low voltage problems by operating in the current domain [HUG 89]. Due to the non-linear current-voltage relationship the dynamic range of current-mode signals is larger than that of voltage-mode signals. Therefore the current mode approach can provide attractive and elegant solutions for many circuit and system problems [TOU 90]. A ubiquitous elementary building block in most analog integrated circuits is the current mirror which is able to multiply and duplicate an imposed input current, that contains the information (bias or signal). The reproduced output current of is then available for any subsequent processing. Unfortunately, due to random process variations, transistor parameters are affected by a certain variation of the transconductance parameter and of the threshold voltage [SHY 84], [LAK 86]. Hence, the output currents of transistors which have been designed identically are different. These random variations, the so-called devices mismatch, are a major limitation for most accurate and precise current mode circuit applications. Another main limitation of CMOS circuits is the 1 /f flicker noise of the MOS transistors. The standard technique to reduce this 1 /f noise and the error due to mismatch is to increase the transistor area and to overwhelm the threshold mismatch with a high gate voltage overhead, which simultaneously increases the saturation voltage of the devices. The performance of a mirror with low saturation voltage can be improved by using lateral bipolar transistors [VIT 83]. The resulting current error can be lower than 1 %, but the major handicap is that only one type of mirror can be built (source or sink depending on the technology used). Special circuit techniques allow us to reduce the inherent noise and offset in MOS amplifiers, like the chopper technique [HSI 81], [ENZ 89], and the auto-zero technique [YEN 82], [DEG 85]. The auto-zero technique is also used to ensure adequate biasing of CMOS inverters or analog-to-digital converters [CAN 82]. Dynamic element matching [VdP 76] is based on the chopper technique and shifts the error components to higher frequencies. The drawback of this technique is the high <b>residual</b> output <b>ripple,</b> which for most applications must be filtered out by using external components. Furthermore multiple mirrors are difficult to implement. Dynamic analog techniques [VIT 85. 1] exploit the absence of gate current to temporarily store some analog information on the gate capacitance of the MOS device. A reported application of this analog storage capability is the dynamic comparator [YEE 78] which sequentially uses the same transistor as the two devices of a differential pair. With this auto-zero technique the very notion of mismatch disappears. The achievable precision is moved to new limits and depends on the capability of accurately storage the signal, mainly limited by charge injection from the MOS transistors used as switches. Although the idea of current sampling was formulated over ten years ago [OGU 78], the first accurate implementation dates from 1988, because the circuit theory and process technology did not allow researchers to obtain the expected results. In the "Electronics Letters" issue of December 1988 [DAU 88] published the idea and some simulated results, which induced a series of publications during the year of 1989. Several research laboratories have focused on the subject during the last few years, with the reported results of [GRO 89] concerning D/A converters, [NAI 89. 2] for A/D converters, [HUG 89] for current mode circuits and filters, and ourselves [VIT 88], [WEG 89. 1] for dynamic current mirrors. The primary objective being pursued in this dissertation is to investigate the different possibilities, to design and to analyze the performances and limitations of a new type of current mirror, a so-called dynamic mirror or current copier. The goal is to build highly accurate current mirrors in the simplest and most compact way. The best strategy for a given problem can be chosen only if all parameters influencing the circuit performances are known. The outline of this thesis is the following: Chapter 2 presents the principle of memorization of a current copier. The main limitations which influence the achievable accuracy are deduced and cell structures which reduce these effects derived. In Chapter 3 the principle and the different configurations of dynamic current mirrors are extensively described, and their advantages and disadvantages discussed and compared. Possibilities of realizing multiple, multiplying and dividing current mirrors are highlighted. Chapter 4 provides a deeper look at the different parameters, which limit the accuracy of a dynamic current mirror, namely drain voltage variations, leakage currents, noise and charge injection. The sampling of white noise and 1 /f noise is analyzed and their contribution calculated. The influence of charge injection is evaluated and the interfering parameters shown. The transient behavior is considered in Chapter 5, where the output spikes and the trade-off between speed and accuracy are highlighted. Chapter 6 emphasizes layout considerations and the practical implementation of a dynamic current mirror. Chapter 7 summarizes the experimental results obtained with such mirrors. Chapter 8 deals with the different possible applications, focusing on a continuous time filter. The principle of D/A & A/D converters and switched current filters are outlined, and the extension to other functional blocs is suggested. Finally Chapter 9 provides summarizing remarks and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|PurposeMultispectral imaging (MSI) {{significantly}} reduces metal artifacts. Yet, {{especially in}} techniques that use gradient selection, such as slice encoding for metal artifact correction (SEMAC), a <b>residual</b> <b>ripple</b> artifact may be prominent. Here, an analysis is presented of the ripple artifact and of slice overlap as {{an approach to}} reduce the artifact. MethodsThe ripple artifact was analyzed theoretically to clarify its cause. Slice overlap, conceptually similar to spectral bin overlap in multi-acquisition with variable resonances image combination (MAVRIC), was achieved by reducing the selection gradient and, thus, increasing the slice profile width. Time domain simulations and phantom experiments were performed to validate the analyses and proposed solution. ResultsDiscontinuities between slices are aggravated by signal displacement in the frequency encoding direction in areas with deviating B- 0. Specifically, it was demonstrated that ripple artifacts appear only where B- 0 varies both in-plane and through-plane. Simulations and phantom studies of metal implants confirmed the efficacy of slice overlap to reduce the artifact. ConclusionThe ripple artifact is an important limitation of gradient selection based MSI techniques, and can be understood using the presented simulations. At a scan-time penalty, slice overlap effectively addressed the artifact, thereby improving image quality near metal implants. Magn Reson Med 73 : 318 - 324, 2015.

The interest for this novel transducer technology relies on its full compatibility with standard integrated circuit technology that makes it possible to integrate on the same chip the transducers and the electronics, thus enabling the realization of extremely low-cost and high-performance devices, including both 1 -D or 2 -D arrays. Being capacitive transducers, CMUTs require a high bias voltage to be properly operated in pulse-echo imaging applications. The typical bias supply <b>residual</b> <b>ripple</b> of high-quality high-voltage (HV) generators is in the millivolt range, which is comparable with the amplitude of the received echo signals, and it is particularly difficult to minimize. The aim of this paper is to analyze the classical CMUT biasing circuits, highlighting the features of each one, and to propose two novel HV generator architectures optimized for CMUT biasing applications. The first circuit proposed is an ultralow-residual ripple (< 5 μV) HV generator that uses an extremely stable sinusoidal power oscillator topology. The second circuit employs a commercially available integrated stepup converter characterized by a particularly efficient switching topology. The circuit is used to bias the CMUT by charging a buffer capacitor synchronously with the pulsing sequence, thus reducing the impact of the switching noise on the received echo signals. The small area of the circuit (about 1. 5 cm 2) makes it possible to generate the bias voltage inside the probe, very close to the CMUT, making the proposed solution attractive for portable applications. Measurements and experiments are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approaches presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With {{the advent}} of {{wireless}} microsensors and other microscale applications, switching supplies fully integrated on chip or into the package are desirable and often necessary. The problem with small inductors is that they exhibit low inductance and larger equivalent series resistance (ESR); in other words, they induce larger ripples in the output and higher conduction power losses. This brief presents and verifies a current-ripple suppression technique in which a discrete 2 × 2 × 1 mm 3 4. 7 -μH inductor is effectively multiplied by subtracting {{a replica of the}} inductor’s ac ripple current, allowing only a <b>residual</b> <b>ripple</b> to reach the output. Experimental results from a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor integrated circuit prototype demonstrate a current- and output-ripple reduction of 10. 8 × and 25. 8 ×, respectively. The ESR power savings in the smaller inductor favorably offset the quiescent power lost in the multiplier (128 mW), outperforming its higher nonmultiplied 47 -μH counterpart at high loads (above 250 mA). Index Terms—Active filter, dc–dc power conversion, inductor, multiplier, power electronics, switching supply. I. INTEGRATED INDUCTORS DUE TO their versatility and efficiency, switched-inductor regulators are commonly featured in portable and stationary electronics. Unfortunately, the inductors are large and bulky when compared {{to other parts of the}} circuit. Their size cannot easily be reduced because the inherent switching action of these converters creates an undesirable output voltage ripple that is inversely proportional to the inductance. The buck converter in Fig. 1, for example, alternately connects vSW to dc input supply VIN and ground to produce a square voltage that LO and CO filter. Filtered vO is therefore equivalent to vSW’s average (dc portion) plus a small ripple ΔvO, whose ripple amplitude depends on LO and CO. AlowerLO, as a result, generates larger current and voltage ripples ΔiL and ΔvO, i. e. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of TIF diameter and path spacing on the ripples {{is similar to}} the previous research results [13]. The following analysis focuses on the {{influence of}} path type on the RMSr. Figure  13 shows the contours of residual ripples with three paths, i.e., raster path, circle path, random path, with keeping other process parameters consistent. Figure  14 is the curves of residual ripples with three paths. It can be seen from Fig.  14 that the ripple amplitude of raster path is minimal, and the ripple amplitude of circle path is slightly larger than that of raster path, and the ripple amplitude of random path is maximal. According to the characters of three paths, it shows that the ripple feature is related to the turn angle on the path. When the angle between the dwell points on the path is less than 180 °, the extra removal exhibits on the corner. Theoretically, the turn angle on the raster path is 180 °, and the turn angle between the dwell points on the circle path is related to the radius of circle. The smaller the radius is, the more extra removal is, so the <b>residual</b> <b>ripple</b> of circle path is slightly larger than the raster path, and is prone to produce “center error” at the center of circle path. Since the turn angle is generally large (more than 90 °), the extra removal produced by the circle path is not significant. There are three angles, such as 60 °, 120 °, and 180 ° between the dwell points on the random path. Comparing the removal depth at the corner with different angles, the removal depth with corner angle 60 ° is the maximal, and the removal depth with corner angle 180 ° is the minimal, as shown in Fig.  15. Since the RMSr {{is directly related to the}} amplitude of ripple, the raster path produces the minimum ripple, while the random path produces the maximum ripple.|$|E
40|$|Usually, {{each phase}} of the direct {{reluctance}} motor is fed separately by its own inverter producing a squarewave phase current depending on the rotor position. In the present work, a star-connection of the three stator phases is used and the direct reluctance motor is fed by a three-phase switched inverter. The space phasor theory shows that three-phase sinewave currents can produce a constant electromagnetic torque. In this case, the rotating reference frame rotates at half of the rotor speed and in the opposite direction. This command strategy allows to reduce the stator deformation due to the electromagnetic radial force which is very high {{in this type of}} motor and which is mainly responsible for the acoustic noise. The electromagnetic torque control is realised by a sliding mode control of the three phase currents. In the rotating reference frame, it is possible to show that the eight commutation states of the switched inverter are placed around an ellipse in the complex plane of the derivatives of the space phasor of the phase current. A study of this ellipse has allowed to determine the maximal torque {{as a function of the}} speed for a given continuous voltage. It is important to insure that the torque reference will never exceed this limitation in order to avoid a pullout phenomenon, highly unwanted in the speed control. Despite the fact that the resolver inside the casing of the direct reluctance motor produces a small periodic error, it is accurate enough for the position measurement and to produce the three current references. However, the derivative of the position measurement provides a speed evaluation with such a ripple that the speed control cannot be outstanding. So, for the speed measurement, an additional laser rotary encoder is used. The experimental study in the steady-state mode of the speed control shows the presence of an electromagnetic torque ripple. This is a <b>residual</b> <b>ripple</b> caused by the dissimilarity between the stator poles teeth-shapes and the magnetic saturation effect. Although this torque ripple is rather low compared with the usual command strategy, two methods are proposed in order to compensate it. The first method is based on the use of a correction factor depending on the tooth angle. First, in steady-state conditions, the correction factor is stored off-line in a table. Then it is used in-line as a feedforward disturbance compensation. The second method of reducing the residual torque ripple consists in implementing an observer of variable disturbance. This is a disturbance observer able to determine the frequency content of the torque ripple. For instance, in order to observe the continuous component, the fundamental wave as well as the harmonics 2, 3, and 6, the observer must have ten poles. The main difficulty to deal with such an observer is the fact that each pole moves quickly as a function of the motor speed. So, in order to guarantee the observer stability over a large range of speed, the poles are located dynamically regarding to the motor speed by the way of a discontinuous adaptation of the feedforward coefficients. The theoretical study and the numerical simulation have allowed to formulate some criteria about the way of locating the poles. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the observer of variable disturbance in order to reduce the electromagnetic torque ripple...|$|E
