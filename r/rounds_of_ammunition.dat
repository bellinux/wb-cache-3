Only one third of the officers in the task force had combat experience from World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience.

5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Petropavlovsk was still incomplete. She was {{nevertheless}} {{used as a}} floating battery {{in the defense of}} Leningrad in August of that year. Several other ships, including the cruiser , joined Petropavlovsk in shelling the advancing Germans. On 7 September, the ship fired on German forces encircling the city; she fired forty salvos from her forward main battery turrets—the only two operational—expending some 700 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> during the attack. On 17 September 1941, the ship was disabled by German heavy artillery; after being hit 53 times, the ship was forced to beach herself to avoid sinking.|$|E

5|$|At 2:00a.m. on 30 July, the Pashtuns {{launched}} another attack, {{during which}} Costello, and the Pashtun Mullah, were both wounded; the British also recorded one fatality among the sepoy contingent. That evening a further attack was repulsed by a bayonet {{charge of the}} 45th Sikhs. The following morning, on 31 July, {{the remainder of the}} 38th Dogras and 35th Sikhs entered Malakand South under the command of Colonel Reid, bringing with them 243 mules carrying 291,600 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> But with their attention now drawn towards the nearby British outpost of Chakdara, attacks by the Pashtuns on Malakand South began to reduce until they ceased altogether. Churchill records a total of three British officers killed in action and 10 wounded, seven sepoy officers wounded, and 153 non-commissioned officers killed and wounded during the siege of Malakand South.|$|E

50|$|With a pump-action firearm, {{the action}} is {{operated}} by a movable fore-end that goes backwards and forwards to eject, extract, and chamber a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Pump-actions are usually associated with shotguns, but {{one example of a}} pump-action rifle is the Remington Model 7600 series.|$|R
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and {{miscellaneous}} equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of open violence, the city set about forming two new regiments of national guard to expand available forces. The local news recounted on the 24th, that Abbot's engineer corps had re-purposed the armory of the 5th Regiment {{for use as a}} recruiting station, toward the goal of forming the now authorized 8th Regiment, to include a company of artillery. They brought with them from the armory of the 6th, two howitzers, 2,000 <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> and 250 muskets. The Governor and Adjutant General put out a call for volunteers to fill each regiment with 1,000 men. General James Howard was chosen to command the 7th, and General Charles E. Phelps the 8th.|$|E
5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons {{had the advantage of}} height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> each, as a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E
