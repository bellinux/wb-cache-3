40|$|The {{main feature}} of the boar’s head used to root around for food is the front part, {{which is similar to}} the ridger in terms of function, load, and environment. In this paper, the boar’s head was {{selected}} as the biological prototype for developing a new ridger. The point cloud of the head was captured by a 3 D scanner, and then, the head surface was reconstructed using 3 D coordinates. The characteristic curves of the front part of the boar’s head were extracted, and then, five cross-sectional curves and one vertical section curve were fitted. Based on the fitted curves, five kinds of bionic ridgers were designed. The penetrating resistances of the bionic <b>ridgers</b> <b>and</b> traditional <b>ridger</b> were tested at different speeds in an indoor soil bin. The test results showed that bionic ridger B had the best penetrating resistance reduction ratio of 16. 67 % at 4. 2 [*]km/h velocity. In order to further evaluate the performance of the best bionic ridger (bionic ridger B), both the bionic <b>ridger</b> <b>and</b> traditional <b>ridger</b> were tested in a field under the same working conditions. The field results indicate that the bionic ridger reduces penetrating resistance by 6. 91 % compared to the traditional <b>ridger,</b> <b>and</b> the test results validate that the bionic ridger has an effect on reducing penetrating resistance...|$|R

40|$|In its gregarious phase the locust Dociostaurus maroccanus (Thunberg) (Orthoptera Acrididae) has {{periodically}} caused significant yield {{losses in}} many Mediterranean and Asian countries, and alarm {{in the general}} public. Population outbreaks {{in recent years have}} frequently required the application of control measures, based on those that have low environmental impact, which are only possible with a sound knowledge of locust bio-ethology and ecology. Our research was aimed at studying the spatial distribution of D. maroccanus egg pods in two Apulian egg bed areas in southern Italy, thus contributing to the rationalization of control methods. The distribution of D. maroccanus egg pods was investigated using a geostatistical approach. Three sampling designs (called A, B and C), characterized by different mesh <b>and</b> <b>clod</b> sizes, were compared to evaluate their effectiveness and affordability. In both egg bed areas, the variogram models were asymptotic with a small nugget effect, and indicated an aggregated distribution of egg pods. Contour maps showed that design A, based on a larger mesh <b>and</b> <b>clod</b> size, was characterized by few hot spots and an extended zone of “low density” egg pods, while design B, involving a smaller mesh <b>and</b> <b>clod</b> size, showed a more structured distribution, with various hot spots alternating with zero level zones. Finally, design C, based on a larger mesh size <b>and</b> smaller <b>clods,</b> showed a single extended hot spot surrounded by a large area without egg pods. Moreover, because of the larger amount of soil to be examined, design A was about 2. 6 - and 10. 9 -fold more time consuming than designs B and C, respectively. Our data showed that sampling designs providing smaller and denser samples should be preferred over designs with fewer and larger samples when information on both the distribution and density of egg pods is needed...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{which helps}} detecting in-line potato tubers without singulation {{when they are}} mixed with clods was developed. It is particularly useful for sorting and grading purposes whether at the packhouses or the potato harvester. The algorithm scans images which include clusters of tubers <b>and</b> <b>clods</b> {{from left to right}} until it encounters a cluster. Once encountered, a scan around the periphery of the cluster starts until returning to the original point where the scanning around the periphery started. At the end of the periphery scanning, the periphery pixels are erased and the new width of the cluster is compared with the previous width. Contouring the periphery continues until a sudden shrink in the width of the cluster occurs which indicates the detection of a contact point. The left-to-right scanning resumes from the contact point until it reaches the right end of the image repeating the periphery scanning every time a cluster is encountered. The algorithm was tested by detecting 380 contact points between tubers and 112 contact points between tubers <b>and</b> <b>clods.</b> Results showed that approximately 99 % of the contact points were detected successfully. It was found that the only reason of error was the lack of cusp between a tuber <b>and</b> a <b>clod</b> when the clod did not have an oval shape. It could be concluded that the algorithm is able to detect any contact point between any oval shaped adjacent objects as long as they form a cusp between them, which is guaranteed between any adjacent tubers. Therefore, the algorithm can be applied at the packhouses to replace the long, bulky and expensive conveyors needed to create spaces between the in-line potato tubers so as to aid machine vision-based size grading. Moreover, the algorithm can be used at the potato harvester to help in discriminating between the touching tubers <b>and</b> <b>clods</b> so as to automate the removal of the clods during harvesting...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} (PA) {{is associated}} with many positive health benefits {{in children and adolescents}} (Parfitt and Eston, 2005), but many young people do not accumulate sufficient quantities of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to satisfy the current recommendations (Pate, 2002). Furthermore, PA tends to decrease from childhood to adolescence (Van der Horst, Paw, Twisk and Van Mechelen, 2007), hence the importance of having an objective estimate of this behaviour during the key transitional period of early adolescence using tools such as accelerometers (Bornstein et al., 2011). For youth physical activity promotion research to move forward, it is important to better understand the factors that can be targeted in behavioural interventions (Fairclough, <b>Ridgers</b> <b>and</b> Welk, 2012).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to conduct a field survey in order to find out the values of the factors affecting the agricultural machinery operation cost in farming processes, and then substitute these values in calculating the agricultural machinery operations costs using the equations developed by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) and compare the results with the actual costs of agricultural machinery operations collected from the field. A survey and data collection were conducted via visits to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry- Department of Agricultural Engineering, the Sudanese Harvesters Company, Central Trading Company, Alneelain Insurance Co., the Agricultural Bank (Sudan), Hilat Kuku Souk for second hand agricultural machinery and the Central Bank of Sudan, beside interviews with agricultural machinery users in both public and private sectors. The study covered the calculation of agricultural machinery cost of operation for three processes; primary tillage, secondary tillage and harvesting). In all three processes, a New Holland tractor model TT 75, 3 - bottom disc plough, Faza 4 rows <b>ridger</b> <b>and</b> Crop Tiger Wheel-TAF 28 harvester were used. Using the ASABE equations, the cost of operation for the primary tillage by the disc plough was found to be SDG 46. 60 per feddan, SDG 34. 83 per feddan for the secondary tillage operation using <b>ridger</b> <b>and</b> SDG 166. 73 per feddan for the cost of harvesting using harvester, while the actual values of the average cost of operation per feddan for the primary and secondary tillage operations using disc plough <b>and</b> <b>ridger</b> were found to be SDG 35 and SDG 20 per feddan respectively, and the average cost of operation for wheat harvesting process using harvester was SDG 40 per feddan. The study has revealed a considerable variation in the operation cost per feddan for agricultural machines when the equations of the ASABE were applied as compared to the actual cost per feddan for agricultural processes collected from the field in Sudan, a matter which calls for further field studies to recheck validity of findings stated in this research, aiming at setting standards for the calculations of agricultural machinery cost of operation in the Sudan...|$|R
