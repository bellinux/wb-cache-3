5000|$|The Lacy is {{a working}} breed, and does much better when given a job, which {{allows them to}} burn off {{excessive}} energy. Work they excel at includes herding livestock, blood trailing or tracking, treeing game, <b>running</b> <b>trap</b> lines, and hunting wild hogs. Modern activities like agility that stress intelligence, passion, speed and nimbleness may be appropriate substitutes for traditional work. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lacys generally exhibit herding instincts, and can be trained to compete in stock dog trials, or hog bays. During recent years, Lacy dogs have also become recognized for their great tracking skills, and sought after {{to be used to}} locate [...] "lost" [...] game animals.|$|E
5000|$|February 2006-Villanova, {{holding the}} #4 ranking in the nation, faced off against St. Joe's at the Palestra in {{a celebration of}} the 50th anniversary of the Big 5 and with the Big 5 title on the line. With the arena split 50/50 with fans of each school, St. Joe's got off to a {{blistering}} start. Villanova looked flat, shooting 30 percent {{in the first half and}} trailing 34-22 at halftime. The second half was a different story, Villanova came out <b>running,</b> <b>trapping</b> and scoring at such a rapid rate that St. Joe's was helpless to stop them. A dominanting 21-3 run led by Kyle Lowry and Allan Ray turned the game around for good. Lowry scored 17 of his 25 points in the second half and completed the only dunk of his college career.|$|R
50|$|Jigsaw {{is usually}} seen {{wearing a black}} {{theatrical}} robe with a large hood and red lining when <b>running</b> <b>traps</b> or abducting victims. On the commentary track for the first Saw film, it was explained that the producers originally wanted Jigsaw to have the red robe with black interior. Thinking that the red robe was too vibrant for the film, they reversed the robe to make it black with red interior. Amanda wore a similar robe in Saw III {{in an attempt to}} symbolically emulate her mentor.Although Hoffman, while wearing the pig mask, always wore the dark blue rain parka he'd worn since the murder of Seth Baxter, further illustrating the gap between him and Jigsaw. Also, both Pighead and Pighead II wear similar robes to Jigsaw, the only difference being that the Pighead robe is red.|$|R

5000|$|GameSpot's Daniel Hindes {{stated that}} the game is a remake that [...] "was crafted with love and respect" [...] and praised the puzzles, environments, new visuals, and the dynamic camera, but had issues with Abe's walking and running both being mapped to the left thumbstick, leading to {{occasionally}} imprecise platforming as he found himself <b>running</b> into <b>traps</b> when he meant to walk slightly. Hindes was also critical of in-game advertising, in which adverts for other video games appeared on in-game billboards: [...] "For a game that is staunchly anti-capitalism, ... it seems contradictory for those billboards to then scroll to reveal a poster for an upcoming PS4 game." [...] However, Hindes did concede that these ads were rarely seen.|$|R

Clarke continued research in his retirement and in 1988 he rediscovered a scarlet tiger moth colony on the Wirral Way, West Kirby, that had been started in 1961 by Philip Sheppard. The colony was useful for study of the genetics of changes in populations.|$|R

Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a <b>trap,</b> <b>running</b> aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops.

5000|$|Wing T offense: The {{traditional}} [...] "wing T" [...] offense employs many of {{the concepts}} of the wishbone offense. It often employs three running back formations, especially in the Bay City version of the offense. The wing T helped change the game of football in its formative years, and changed the traditional role of the quarterback from a blocker much like a modern fullback in the classic [...] "single wing", to the primary distributor of the ball. As the triple-option became prominent, the wing T quickly incorporated the veer into its arsenal. In conjunction, it tends to employ significantly more misdirection <b>running</b> plays. The <b>traps,</b> crosses, fakes, pulls, sweeps, and counters that characterize the wing T are often supplemented by {{a heavy dose of}} option runs—most notably the veer triple option. The veer is well suited to the wing T offense, especially the Delaware version. The Delaware version of the wing T, with its predominant two running back sets, gained significant prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was most notably employed by the Notre Dame Fighting Irish during the Parseghian era. It continues to be employed by high schools and small college teams.|$|R
2500|$|Mega Man 9 is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the titular character and must complete a number of 2D side-scrolling stages. The start of the game presents a select screen of eight stages from which the player can choose to complete in any order desired. Within each stage, the player advances by <b>running,</b> jumping, avoiding <b>traps,</b> shooting enemies and mini-bosses, and ultimately battling the Robot Master boss at the end. Mega Man begins with a [...] "Mega Buster" [...] arm-cannon weapon, but as each boss is defeated, a unique weapon is added to his arsenal. Because each Robot Master is weak to a specific weapon, the player may strategize the order which the stages are cleared. The player also begins the game with the option to call on Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a [...] "Coil" [...] springboard for jumping higher or a [...] "Jet" [...] for transversing long distances in the air. Mega Man's health, his special weapons, and his Rush options are all limited by energy gauges that can be refilled by picking up items found throughout each level. Special screws can also be picked up and used to buy items at Auto's shop between stages. These items include extra lives, tanks that refill energy, and one-time-use items that call on Mega Man's companions Eddie and Beat for help.|$|R
60|$|Dikes are {{frequent}} in the metamorphic schists of the Chonos Islands, and seem feebly to represent that great band of trappean and ancient volcanic rocks on the south-western coast of Tierra del Fuego. At S. Andres I {{observed in the}} space of half-a-mile, seven broad, parallel dikes, composed of three varieties of <b>trap,</b> <b>running</b> in a N.W. and S.E. line, parallel to the neighbouring mountain-ranges of altered clay-slate; but they must be of long subsequent origin to these mountains; for they intersected the volcanic formation described in the last chapter. North of Tres Montes, I noticed three dikes differing from each other in composition, one of them having a euritic base including large octagons of quartz; these dikes, as well as several of porphyritic greenstone at Vallenar Bay, extended N.E. and S.W., nearly at right angles to the foliation of the schists, but in the line of their joints. At Low's Harbour, however, a set of great parallel dikes, one ninety yards and another sixty yards in width, have been guided by the foliation of the mica-schist, and hence are inclined westward at an angle of 45 degrees: these dikes are formed of various porphyritic traps, some of which are remarkable from containing numerous rounded grains of quartz. A porphyritic trap of this latter kind, passed in one of the dikes into a most curious hornstone, perfectly white, with a waxy fracture and pellucid edges, fusible, and containing many grains of quartz and specks of iron pyrites. In the ninety-yard dike several large, apparently now quite isolated, fragments of mica-slate were embedded: but as their foliation was exactly parallel to that of the surrounding solid rock, no doubt these new separate fragments originally formed wedge-shaped depending portions of a continuous vault or crust, once extending over the dike, but since worn down and denuded.|$|R
40|$|How can secular Western IR theory {{deal with}} {{religion}}? Bringing {{in the debates}} on religion in the public sphere, the paper’s goal is to foster {{a deeper understanding of}} the nexus between religion and international relations. Religion in global politics challenges the notion of a secular world order based on contract and custom in a system of states, as they had developed since the Westphalian settlement. According to this foundational myth religion mattered only domestically, and there only within the 'private' realm. The forces of globalization inevitably transcend the traditional boundaries of the state and also the fundamental distinction between the public and the private. The ongoing IR debate based on terrorism, and asymmetric conflict is decidedly too narrow to understand this fundamental challenge. It is here that the discussion in political theory which focused on the changing configuration of the public sphere (public/private distinction) attains it importance for the IR debate about religion in a global perspective. It supplements the debate in international relations that addresses the re-drawing of boundaries that had traditionally marked the internal/ external (global) distinction, but offers more than Huntington or Norris and Inglehart. For both of them the decisive breaks in the tectonics of world politics are cultural fault-lines where a secular segment of the world population is facing a religious one. The problem with this kind of argument is that of a dangerous selffulfilling prophecy. Contrary to others who still hope to round up the wagons and fight back the passing raids of the challengers, Habermas has understood that it does not make much sense trying to push religion into the camp of fundamentalism. In our paper we use Habermas’s notion of a post-secular society in a global perspective to understand the challenge of the Westphalian system without <b>running</b> into the <b>trap</b> of a clash of civilizations. To do so, we contrast Habermas’s suggestion of a post-secular society with Berger’s claim of the desecularization of the world and Connolly’s deep pluralism and politics of becoming. Based on Chambers’s interpretation of Habermas we offer a strong and a weak reading of the concept of a post-secular society and argue that only a strong reading can meet the needs of a global public sphere...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 8) In 1973 {{an archaeological}} team working near the Dead Sea discovered a late bronze age site which they named Tantura. The name {{first appeared on}} fragments found in Hebron and later, in ancient literature in Syria. Artifacts recovered from the preliminary surface survey indicated that Tantura, an isolated culture, dated from 1, 500 B. c. ?? 50. In 1974 the archaeological team, funded {{by a grant from}} the Institut Biblique D'Arche'ologie, Lyon, France, returned to the site to begin preliminary excavations. Tantura is situated in and on the cliffs overlooking the western shore of the Dead Sea, between Qumran and Ein Gedi, on the border of the Judean Wilderness (see fig. 1). The barren hills of the Wilderness are cut by deep ravines which wind through the rocky slopes down to the Dead Sea. Numerous caves open up on the face of the steep cliffs. The village of Tantura (see fig. 2) is on the plateau and is located between two dry river-beds, the larger Wadi Tantura and the Wadi Ab. There are indications that Tanturians built stone darns across the once <b>running</b> rivers to <b>trap</b> soil and rainwater for farming. Tantura came to light when a cave was discovered containing fragments of a culture that had disappeared centuries ago. Similar pieces had shown up in several disparate locations throughout the area and through careful study it was determined that all these artifacts emanated from one culture [...] -Tantura. The first discovery to be made was at Site I and includes the two sacred caves (see fig. 2). These caves are situated in the cliffs and are reached by a small path leading from the tops of the cliffs. The Burial cave (which has been surveyed, but not yet excavated) lies to the west of the Ritual Cave. The two caves are joined by a narrow, natural passageway. The Ritual Cave contains a large, stone altar and has yielded numerous artifacts (see figs. 4 - 7). The seriation of artifacts from the Ritual Cave (dating from 1, 500 B. C. ?? 50 through 1, 00 B. C. ?? 50) indicates that the Tanturian culture had its beginnings in these caves, and did not evolve and expand to the cliff top (Site II) until sometime after 1, 375 B. C. (See more in text...|$|R
