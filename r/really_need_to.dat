It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> focus on having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas.

Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E

500|$|While Radiohead has {{expressed}} anti-war sentiments in the past—including {{a contribution to}} the 1995 War Child charity compilation The Help Album—"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" [...] marks {{the first time that a}} Radiohead song explicitly refers to war in its lyrics, marking a departure from Yorke's typically abstract writing. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including [...] "Give your leaders each a gun and then let them fight it out themselves" [...] and [...] "The next will be chemical but they will never learn", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an [...] "innocent and youthful falsetto"; the NME said his singing is [...] "subdued to the point where you <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> read the lyrics".|$|E
500|$|The adult fandom {{has been}} {{perceived}} negatively by others, with {{coverage of the}} brony fandom overshadowing the show itself. Much of the fandom's ridicule from others comes from {{the perception of the}} mostly adult male fanbase enjoying a show that is marketed to the young female demographic. Through this, the brony community has encountered ridicule through trolling on internet forums, not only from its inception at 4chan, but after moving away from the site. This has also been called out in popular media. The Fox News Channel comedy talk program Red Eye poked fun at the fandom because it largely consists of young adult males. Kurt Schlichter of BigHollywood.com called the phenomenon a [...] "terrifying new trend", and wrote, [...] "Hollywood, do you <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> enable the creepy immaturity of these geebos? No. It's time to stop the insanity." [...] Commenting on Schlichter's article, Greg Pollowitz of the National Review Online wrote that considering the target audience he could not understand the show's appeal to adult men. Jerry Springer attempted to bring bronies onto his talk for a segment on [...] "Outrageously Guilty Pleasures", though the fandom warned others about the potential ridicule.|$|E

[...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But do we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly {{to make sense of}} that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, {{but it was}} never officially released. Stefani's long time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the music video during Gwen's first concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. A minute long clip of the video surfaced on YouTube on October 13, 2006. At the beginning of the clip, Stefani and her dance troupe, the Harajuku Girls, are shown dancing on various rooftops in a city. The women also appear in front of a yellow building advertisement that reads [...] "Cash Loan" [...] in a red font, followed by [...] "Buy · Sell · Trade" [...] in a green font below. The ladies sport [...] "'80s hairstyles", to which a critic from Spin predicted was in an attempt [...] "to rival some of the best videos from two decades ago". Other parts of the video display the dancers wearing jumpsuits or camouflage outfits; Stefani also wears a denim skirt or a pair of white shorts with a matching tank top. The clip was featured in a list compiled by VH1's Christopher Rosa, titled [...] "8 Amazing Unreleased Music Videos That We <b>Really</b> <b>Need</b> <b>To</b> See". Rosa noted that the video [...] "is now virtually unfindable on the Web", and was disappointed by stating: [...] "We wanted some Madonna realness, Gwen!" ...|$|E
500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stand Up for Love" [...] {{received}} negative reviews by most music critics. James Blake {{writing for}} BBC Online, described [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] as a [...] "sugary ballad". Pitchfork Medias writer Jess Harvell criticized the song by writing, [...] "Opener 'Stand Up for Love' is subtitled the '2005 World Children's Day Anthem', which {{should tell you}} all you <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know, i.e. Diane Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions". Fiona Mckinlay criticized {{the fact that the}} song was used as an opener for #1's and felt it wasn't [...] "really causing any kind of reaction before they get started properly with Independent Woman Pt.1". Houston Chronicles Michael D. Clark described the track as [...] "overwrought and overproduced; at best, it's a future prom theme". Matthew Jacobs of The Huffington Post felt it was [...] "great" [...] the song was used for World's Children day but described it as a [...] "total snoozefest". A writer for Billboard magazine commented that the song lacked the potential to become a chart-topper. He went on to describe it as a [...] "schmaltzy AC ballad aiming to display the individual talents" [...] of Destiny's Child's members, adding that it was [...] "ironic" [...] as the group's other songs on the disc focused mainly on production. He finished his review by saying that [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] was a [...] "disappointing nonstarter".|$|E

500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's all I <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an American Idol, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops." [...] In a quick review, Billboard described Breakaway as a [...] "rare exhibition of substance over style".|$|E
