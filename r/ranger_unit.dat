5|$|With {{the defeat}} of the NK 766th Regiment at the Battle of P'ohang-dong, and the {{strength}} of U.S. infantry units in question, U.S. commanders felt recreating Ranger units was essential. In early August, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army, in command of all US forces in Korea, ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, the head of its G-3 Operations miscellaneous division, to create a new experimental Army <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit,</b> the Eighth Army Ranger Company. In the meantime, the Ranger Training Center was established at Fort Benning, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{separate}} Company E was a <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit</b> given federal recognition effective 1 April 1971, {{and had a}} total authorized {{strength of}} 198 personnel. It {{was added to the}} PR ARNG on that date while the 755th Transportation Company (Medium Truck, Cargo) was deleted. Co E (Ranger), 65th Infantry relocated from Vega Baja to San Juan on 2 February 1976, and was inactivated as federal recognition was withdrawn effective 29 February 1980. This resulted in the allocation of an ARNG ranger company being transferred from the PR ARNG to the Texas ARNG, in which Company G (Ranger), 143rd Infantry was activated in Houston from elements of the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 143rd Infantry, 36th Airborne Brigade, which was being inactivated effective 1 April 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army Ranger Company, {{also known}} as the 8213th Army Unit, was a Ranger light {{infantry}} company of the United States Army that was active during the Korean War. As a small special forces unit, it specialized in irregular warfare. Intended to combat the North Korean (NK) commandos who had been effective at infiltration and disruption behind United Nations (UN) lines, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was formed {{at the height of the}} Battle of Pusan Perimeter in September 1950 and was the first U.S. Army <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit</b> created since World War II. The company went into action as a part of the 25th Infantry Division during the UN advance into North Korea in October and November. It was best known for its defense of Hill 205 against an overwhelming Chinese attack during the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River which resulted 41 of the 51 Rangers becoming casualties.|$|E

While helping the Vietnamese Army <b>Ranger</b> <b>Units</b> he would be wounded numerous times, for which he would receive three Gallantry crosses. Within a year of becoming an adviser in the Vietnamese Army <b>Rangers</b> <b>Unit,</b> Landin started his first of three volunteer tours in Vietnam in 1961. His first tour was primarily to teach the Vietnamese Army about weapons and different guerrilla war tactics commonly used during the war. While in his first tour he became extremely familiar with the topography in the Danang area as well as the Mekong Delta.|$|R

5|$|In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, {{the head}} of its G-3 Operations Miscellaneous Division, to seek volunteers for a new {{experimental}} Army <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit.</b> McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat, as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire, and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Because of this limitation, volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea, though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II. From the Eighth Army replacement pool, McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience, to serve as the company commander. Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings, Jr., became Puckett's two platoon leaders. Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army, though few had combat experience. Through a quick and informal selection process, Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications, athleticism, and duty performance. There was no time to administer physical fitness tests for the applicants, and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred. Recruits were told they would receive no hazard pay.|$|E
500|$|Formed in 1917, the {{division}} deployed to France {{as a part}} of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. Called up for service again in World War II, {{the division}}'s 116th Regiment, attached to the First Infantry Division, was in the first wave of troops ashore during Operation Overlord, the landings in Normandy, France. It supported a special <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit</b> tasked with clearing strong points at Omaha Beach. The rest of the 29th ID came ashore later then advanced to Saint-Lô, and eventually through France and into Germany itself.|$|E
500|$|UN units, {{spread out}} along the Pusan Perimeter, had a {{difficult}} time repelling these units as they were untrained in combating guerrilla warfare. North Korean special forces units like the NK 766th Independent Infantry Regiment had great success in defeating ROK troops, prompting U.S. Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins to order the creation of an elite force which could [...] "infiltrate through enemy lines and attack command posts, artillery, tank parks, and key communications centers or facilities." [...] All U.S. Army Ranger units, which had previously undertaken this role, had been disbanded after World War II because they required time-consuming training, specialization, and expensive equipment. With the defeat of the NK 766th Regiment at the Battle of P'ohang-dong, and the strength of U.S. infantry units in question, U.S. commanders felt the recreation of Ranger units was essential. In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began, the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, the head of its G-3 Operations miscellaneous division, to create a new experimental Army <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit,</b> the Eighth Army Ranger Company, to trial the concept of reestablishing small light infantry companies that specialized in infiltration and irregular warfare. In the meantime, the Ranger Training Center was established at Fort Benning, Georgia.|$|E

However, in 1974 their colors and lineage were passed to newly formed Ranger Battalions based in the United States.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the <b>Ranger</b> <b>units,</b> the 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other <b>Ranger</b> <b>units,</b> most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|R
500|$|The 7th Infantry Division reached full {{strength}} and saw action around Chungju and Pyeongchang {{as part of}} an effort to push the North Korean and Chinese forces back above the 38th parallel and away from Seoul. In early February, the 7th Infantry Division engaged in a series of successful [...] "limited objective" [...] small unit attacks and ambushes before advancing slowly as it cleared enemy hilltop positions throughout the remainder of the month. In this time, the 2nd Ranger Company acted as a probing force and spearhead for attacks. On 20 February it led the 17th Infantry Regiment in an attack on Chuchon, taking the town from a superior force of Chinese troops. The action was undertaken with several war correspondents observing the battle, bringing international attention to the <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit.</b> The Rangers were commended for a particularly aggressive attack in which they pursued and surprised a Chinese column moving into the village, persisting in their attack with fixed bayonets even when it became apparent that the Chinese force was larger than anticipated. The Chinese were routed in heavy fighting. A few days later, field commanders reported to The Pentagon that the company was performing extremely well, and it was pulled from the lines for a new mission.|$|E

His command, the 43rd Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, known as Mosby's Rangers or Mosby's Raiders, was a partisan <b>ranger</b> <b>unit</b> noted for its lightning-quick raids {{and its ability to}} elude Union Army pursuers and disappear, blending in with local farmers and townsmen. The area of northern central Virginia in which Mosby operated with impunity was known during the war and ever since as Mosby's Confederacy. After the war, Mosby became a Republican and worked as an attorney and supported his former enemy's commander, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant.

2500|$|Unlike {{the vast}} {{majority}} of peer colleges in the South, the university was kept open throughout the Civil War, an especially remarkable feat with its state seeing more bloodshed than any other and the near 100% conscription of the entire American South. After Jubal Early's total loss at the Battle of Waynesboro, Charlottesville was willingly surrendered to Union forces to avoid mass bloodshed and UVA faculty convinced George Armstrong Custer to preserve Jefferson's university. Though Union troops camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational mission. However, an extremely high number of officers of both Confederacy and Union were alumni. UVA produced 1,481 officers in the Confederate Army alone, including four major-generals, twenty-one brigadier-generals, and sixty-seven colonels from ten different states. John S. Mosby, the infamous [...] "Gray Ghost" [...] and commander of the lightning-fast 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry <b>ranger</b> <b>unit,</b> had also been a UVA student.|$|E

To put these enemy warning stations out of action, the attack group arrived off the islands at daybreak of 17 October. Cruiser Denver had the honor of firing the opening gun for the liberation of Leyte at 08:00 and Company D of the 6th Rangers was landed on Suluan Island some 20 minutes later—the first Americans to [...] "return" [...] to the Philippines. Robinson escorted the <b>Ranger</b> <b>unit</b> to Dinagat Island where they made an unopposed landing.
