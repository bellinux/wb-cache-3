Commonly observed components of borrelial vesicle preparations are borrelial surface antigens, bovine serum albumin, {{and the heavy}} chains of rabbit immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M. This study employed ultracentrifugation to harvest borrelial vesicles and analyzed these preparations by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting. We demonstrated that the rabbit mu heavy-chain band observed was devoid of OspA or at most levels below those detectable by immunoblot.

However, no single set of standard operating conditions in terms of centrifuge time and speed have been defined. This study investigated centrifuge conditions {{on the effect of}} volume of soil water and phosphorus concentrations extracted to determine a set of standard operating conditions {{that could be used for}} soil water extraction in the future. Two contrasting soils that had been dried and rewet, a Ferrosol and a Dermosol, were used to investigate centrifuge speed (1000 - 3000 r. p. m.) and centrifuge time (5 - 30 min) on the extraction of soil water. Centrifuge speeds of 1000, 2000, and 3000 r. p. m. were trialed in this study giving <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> of 220, 881, and 1982 g respectively. Increasing centrifuge time significantly increased (P < 0. 001) the volume of soil water extracted. Almost twice as much soil water was extracted when the centrifuge time was increased from 5 to 30 min. Centrifuge speed was also a highly significant factor (P < 0. 001) in increasing the volume of soil water extracted. The amount of soil water extracted increased by up to 15 % when the centrifuge speed was increased from 1000 to 3000 r. p. m. The concentration of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) did not change significantly with either centrifuge speed or time. The most important factor in determining the concentration of TDP was the soil type.

40|$|A {{centrifuge}} generates {{centrifugal force}} to separate solids from a liquid. Through {{a combination of}} speed (rotations per minute – rpm) and the radius of the centrifuge’s rotor, the <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> (rcf) can be calculated. Optimal rcf ranges have been determined for urine and blood specimens in order to consistently prepare quality specimens for laboratory testing. Centrifuging blood at higher than recommended rpm speeds can result in hemolized blood specimens or cause specimen tubes to break. Lower speeds may not completely separate solids from fluids. Safety Concerns Centrifuges must be located on level, solid work surfaces. To maximize safety, the immediate area around the centrifuge must be kept clear of other objects. The surface must be smooth to allow the suction cups (feet) of the centrifuge to grip the surface and hold the centrifuge in place during operation. Centrifuges are very dangerous when operated improperly. Read the operator’s manual and follow instructions to minimize hazards...|$|E
40|$|Microvesicles were {{isolated}} from the conditioned media of 3 cell lines (MDA-MB- 231, AsPC- 1 and A 375) by ultracentrifugation at a range of <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces,</b> and the tissue factor (TF) protein and activity, microvesicle number, size distribution and relative density compared. Also, by expressing TF-tGFP in cells and isolating the microvesicles, the relative density of TF-containing microvesicles was established. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) indicated that the larger-diameter microvesicles (> 200 nm) were primarily sedimented at 100, 000 g and possessed TF-dependent thrombin and factor Xa generation potential, while {{in the absence of}} factor VII, all microvesicles possessed some thrombin generation capacity. Immuno-precipitation of TF-containing microvesicles followed by NTA also indicated the range of these microvesicles to be 200 - 400 nm. Analysis of the microvesicles by gradient density centrifugation showed that lower-density (< 1. 1 g/ml) microvesicles were mainly present in the samples recovered at 100, 000 g and were associated with TF antigen and activity. Analysis of these fractions by NTA confirmed that these fractions were principally composed of the larger-diameter microvesicles. Similar analysis of microvesicles from healthy or patient plasma supported those obtained from conditioned media indicating that TF activity was mainly associated with lower-density microvesicles. Furthermore, centrifugation of healthy plasma, supplemented with TF-tGFP-containing microvesicles, resulted in 67 % retrieval of the fluorescent microvesicles at 100, 000 g, but only 26 % could be recovered at 20, 000 g. Pre-centrifugation of conditioned media or plasma at 10, 000 g improved the speed and yield of recovered TF-containing microvesicles by subsequent centrifugation at either 20, 000 g or 100, 000 g. In conclusion, TF appears to be associated with low-density (1. 03 - 1. 08 g/ml), larger-diameter (200 - 350 nm) microvesicles...|$|R
40|$|One-dimensional high {{aspect ratio}} {{nanostructures}} {{grown from a}} copper foil are considered for intracellular delivery of bioactive molecules, such as drugs and genetic material. The cupric oxide (CuO) nanowires are coated with silicon oxides (SiOx), and embedded in a transparent polymer membrane consisting of the photoresist SU- 8 and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Nanowires are envisaged as one way two deliver bioactive molecules to many cells in parallel. It has previously been shown that both HeLa and AR 42 J cells grow and spread on this nanowire surface. The overarching goal of the current project is to test and optimize delivery of genetic material to cells grown on nanowires. It is first shown that nanowires {{are not able to}} induce knockdown of a constitutively expressed protein by delivering siRNA, when cells are sedimenting on top of an array of nanowires by gravitation. It is then shown that nanowire-mediated transfection of plasmids perform similar to flat surfaces, which are chemically identical apart from the nanowires, when HeLa cells are sedimenting down on a nanowire surface by gravitational pull. Increasing the sedimenting force by centrifugation has no effect on transfection efficiency, with <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>forces</b> up to 88, 500 × g tested. Tapping the nanowire surface face-down on cells deposited at a high concentration, which is a well documented method in published articles, also performs similar to flat sur faces, with transfection efficiencies of 1 % commonly seen, and occasionally higher (5 %). Fluorescently labeled plasmid is quite efficiently delivered to cells by both flat surfaces and nanowire surfaces, with a trend towards more efficient delivery by nanowires. Delivered cargo is however confined to small sections of cells. Cells are not transfected in experiments with identical setups, indicating that delivered biomolecules are isolated from the internal machinery of a cell. In conclusion, our transfection efficiency results are on par with most published experiments. In published experiments control experiments with flat surfaces are often lacking, and our results emphasize the importance for proper controls when investigating nanowire-mediated transfection and delivery of biomolecules. </p...|$|R

Opposite relationships were measured for P-TOT, molybdate-reactive P and Mo, whereas concentrations of Mn and S did not vary much according to RCF level. A comparison between centrifugation of soil cores at undisturbed stratification and mixed samples uncovered no great differences in soil solution pH or concentrations of major constituents, though concentrations of Ca, Si and S were 10 - 20 % lower in solution from undisturbed cores.

By conventional definition, microsomal membranes are collected by centrifugation of a postmitochondrial fraction at 100, 000 g in an ultracentrifuge, a method originally developed for large amounts of mammalian tissue. We present a method for isolating microsomal-type membranes from small amounts of Arabidopsis thaliana plant material that does not rely on ultracentrifugation but instead uses the lower <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> (21, 000 g) of a microcentrifuge.

Our method incorporates specific manipulation of sample density throughout the procedure, with minimal preclearance, minimal volumes of extraction buffer, and minimal sedimentation pathlength. These features allow maximal membrane yields, enabling membrane isolation from limited amounts of material. We further demonstrate that conventional ultracentrifuge-based protocols give submaximal yields due to losses during {{early stages of the}} procedure; that is, extensive amounts of microsomal-type membranes can sediment prematurely during the typical preclearance steps.

The key variables studied are the cell suspension hold time prior to centrifugation, the <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> (RCF), time of centrifugation, cell pellet resuspension velocities, and number of resuspension passes. The cell critical quality attributes studied are the cell membrane integrity {{and the presence of}} selected surface markers. Greater hold times and higher RCF values for longer spin times all led to the increased loss of cell membrane integrity. However, this loss was found to occur during intense cell resuspension rather than the preceding centrifugation stage. Controlled resuspension at low stress conditions below a possible critical stress point led to essentially complete cell recovery even at conditions of extreme centrifugation (e. g., RCFof 10000 g for 30 mins) and long (~ 2 h) holding times before centrifugation. The susceptibility to cell loss during resuspension under conditions of high stress depended on cell type and the age of cells before centrifugation and the level of matrix crosslinking within the cell pellet as determined by the presence of detachment enzymes or possibly the nature of the resuspension medium.

Approx. 0.1  mg oil sludge was added to 3  mL MS medium (1  L contains: 0.6  g Na 2 HPO 4, 0.2  g KH 2 PO 4, 4.0  g NaNO 3, 0.3  g MgSO 4, 0.01  g CaCl 2, 0.01  g FeSO) (Zajic and Supplisson 1972) supplemented with 2 % yeast extract (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) as nutrients for microbial growth at 30  °C with orbital shaking at 200  rpm min− 1. The resulting culture was used as seed to inoculate in MS medium supplemented with 2 % olive oil (Betis, Torres Y Ribelles SA, Dos Hermanas, Spain). Growth was determined by gravimetric method in which 15 – 50  mL culture was pelleted and washed with distill water twice using centrifugation at a <b>relative</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> of 12, 000 ×g for 20  min (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Washed cell pellet was resuspended in 100  µL and transferred to pre-weighted glass fiber filter (GE Healthcare, Kent, UK) and dried in oven at 80  °C overnight. CDW was gravimetrically determined in triplicate using the AG 204 balance (Mettler-Toledo Inc., Columbus, OH, USA).|$|E
50|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is an outward force {{associated with}} rotation. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> {{is one of}} several so-called pseudo-forces (also known as inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> in {{countering}} gravity, {{as in this}} behavior of the tides, has led <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> sometimes to be called [...] "false gravity" [...] or [...] "imitation gravity" [...] or [...] "quasi-gravity".|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{reactive}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> is sometimes used in mechanics and engineering. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} just <b>centrifugal</b> <b>force</b> rather than as reactive centrifugal forcealthough this usage is deprecated in elementary mechanics.|$|R
