5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe <b>rolls,</b> <b>and</b> further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign <b>rolls,</b> <b>and</b> all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For buliding the mathmatical {{model of}} elastic {{deformation}} for rolls {{system with a}} composite back-up roll assemblled by the shrinkage fit, the <b>roll</b> sleeve <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> mandrel was studied individually, the bending force was acted on the working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the load acted on the contact zone was discreted segment by segment, then the deflection model of the working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the <b>roll</b> sleeve <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> mandrel was put forward based on the influence function method. According to the force equilibrim function and the deformation compatibility function between the roll sleeve, the <b>roll</b> mandrel <b>and</b> working <b>roll,</b> the solution matrix was listed and the solving programe was compiled to solve the deflection of working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> composite back-up <b>roll,</b> the pressure between the working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the <b>roll</b> sleeve <b>and</b> the cross-section thickness of rolled strip. Therefore, {{it is an important}} theoretical foundation to improve the manufacturing technology and practical application of the composite back-up roll. ...|$|R

5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> cymbals.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} aboard {{is in some}} doubt, but an estimate of 638 was published in The Times. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54seamen (all ranks), 7women, 13children {{and at least one}} male civilian, but these numbers cannot be substantiated, as muster <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> books were lost with the ship.|$|E
50|$|Montgomery devised {{different}} control {{methods for}} his gliders, including weight shifting for <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> an elevator for pitch (1884). Subsequent designs used hinged, pilot-operated trailing edge flaps {{on the wings}} (1885-1886) for <b>roll</b> control, <b>and</b> later, full wing warping systems for <b>roll</b> (1903-1905) <b>and</b> for both pitch <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> (1911).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{attitude control}} of a small gravity gradient stabilised satellite. A gravity gradient stabilised satellite has limited stability and pointing capabilities, and magnetic coils are added {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the attitude control. The magnetic coils are controlled using a fuzzy logic controller, based on a combination of membership functions and rules. The control of the pitch axis is separated from the <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth axes and excellent pitch angle accuracy is achieved. The <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth axes are controlled using a common magnetic coil, that has a non-linear and time-varying torque characteristic <b>and,</b> therefore, accurate <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth angular control become much more difficult to achieve. However, combining one <b>roll</b> controller <b>and</b> two azimuth controllers result in an acceptable <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth angular accuracy after a few orbital periods...|$|R

These nine men set about expanding the society's membership <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> reviving its library. Over the next few years, 20 younger members {{were added to the}} society's rolls.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter <b>rolls,</b> <b>and</b> limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a {{three roll mill}} (called the feed <b>roll,</b> centre <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> apron <b>roll)</b> rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually {{in the form of}} paste, is fed between the feed <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the center <b>roll.</b> Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> apron <b>roll.</b> This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> typically, a smaller gap than between the feed <b>and</b> centre <b>rolls.</b> A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the paste <b>rolls</b> down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|R

The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> stacks of books were piled against walls.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda <b>Rolls,</b> <b>and</b> other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Montacute House {{was built}} in about 1598 by Sir Edward Phelips, whose family {{had lived in the}} Montacute area since at least 1460, first as yeomen farmers before rising in status. The site was bought from the Cluniac Montacute Priory by Thomas Phelips and passed to his grandson, also called Thomas, who started {{planning}} the house, but died before it was built and left the completion of the work to his son Edward. Edward Phelips was a lawyer who had been in Parliament since 1584. He was knighted in 1603 and a year later became Speaker of the House. James I appointed him Master of the <b>Rolls</b> <b>and</b> Chancellor to his son and heir Henry, Prince of Wales. Phelips remained at the hub of English political life, and his legal skills were employed when he became opening prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters.|$|E

Vanessa cannot move while attacking, {{and so the}} player must often use the environment as cover. Defeated enemies sometimes drop items that replenish health and energy or that trigger a combo timer, which multiplies the points earned from enemies destroyed consecutively. Each mission {{takes place in a}} series of rooms that contain a fixed number of enemies and may include a boss robot. At the end of a mission, the player receives a score {{based on the number of}} rooms explored and enemies destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The British Government {{decided to}} {{introduce}} cross-voting as {{a compromise between}} the Fijian and European delegates {{on one side and}} the Indians on the other. According to the cross-voting system, multiracial electorates voted for candidates of different ethnic groups. The Legislative Council was enlarged to 36 members, consisting of 14 Fijians (9 elected on a communal roll, 3 on a cross-voting <b>roll,</b> <b>and</b> two nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs), 12 Indians (9 elected on a communal <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> 3 on a cross-voting <b>roll)</b> <b>and</b> 10 Europeans (7 elected on an acommunal <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> 3 on a cross-voting roll). Some of the non-contentious proposals by the Federation Party were accepted. These were the establishment of Public Service Commission, Police Service Commission, and Judicial and Legal Services Commission and a Bill of Rights.|$|R

5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain {{the inner workings of the}} Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E
5|$|The Knicks in March {{replaced}} D'Antoni with Mike Woodson, who ran fewer pick-and <b>rolls</b> <b>and</b> more isolation plays. Lin had excelled running pick-and-rolls under D'Antoni. After the March 24 {{game against}} the Detroit Pistons he complained about a sore knee, and an MRI later revealed a small meniscus tear in the left knee. Lin opted to have knee surgery and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season. He averaged 18.5 points and 7.6 assists during his 26 games as an everyday player. In the first 10 games, Lin averaged 24.6 points and 9.2 assists, shooting 49.7 percent from the field but with 5.6 turnovers. In the next seven games, he averaged 16 points and 7.7 assists with 3.9 turnovers. In the last nine games, Lin averaged 13.6 points and 5.9 assists and shot only 39.1 percent while dealing with his then-undisclosed knee injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred <b>Rolls,</b> <b>and</b> their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E
