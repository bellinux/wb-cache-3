40|$|The {{inadequate}} housing allowance, rental allowance, taxable {{subsidies and}} housing shortages {{in developing countries}} {{are some of the}} challenges of the 21 st century. Namibia is no exception. The study is aimed at figuring out whether government actions and interventions are meant to address homelessness challenges for low-income households. Furthermore, the research problem is broadened to gain insight on the effects from four countries’ housing policies as covered in the study; namely Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria and South Africa. The literature review undertaken proved that Botswana and South Africa have the best housing allowance schemes for public servants below management cadres, and have already successfully addressed public housing problems in their respective countries. Other findings of the study are; land shortage for housing development, housing affordability problems, escalating prices for building materials, lack of intergovernmental relations systems, unemployment and low incomes. Several recommendations include; to assist the Namibian government to emulate good examples of Botswana and South Africa, especially by providing land free of charge to its citizens (in the case of Botswana), solve financial institutions’ attitude of denying low-in-come earners loans, review housing <b>allowances,</b> <b>rent</b> <b>allowances</b> and subsidies every two years, increase government/member contribution ratios to either 50 percent or 100 percent due to high inflation rates.

Most of the employees are not familiar with the performance based pay scheme and do not understand what they are required to do to benefit from it and therefore it’s recommended that the management of the schools should clearly explained this scheme to the different categories of staff of the school. It’s recommended that the school management improves these conditions prior to increasing staff numbers. Hence it’s suggested that the different trainings should be specified to the specific career of the individuals in the school, staff should be given a forum to suggest which programs would be appropriate for them.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the welfare {{costs of the}} main medium-term options for significantly reducing U. S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, including carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems applied economy-wide and to the power sector only, and an emissions rate standard for power generation. The key theme is that welfare costs depend importantly on how policies interact with distortions in the economy created by the broader fiscal system. If <b>allowance</b> <b>rent</b> is not used to increase economic efficiency, economy-wide cap-and-trade systems perform the worst on cost-effectiveness grounds. In contrast, if revenues are used to substitute for distortionary income taxes (either directly, or indirectly through deficit reduction), economy-wide carbon taxes (or auctioned allowance systems) may have (slightly) negative costs. The {{bottom line is that}} revenues or rents created under economy-wide, market-based carbon policies must be used to increase economic efficiency to ensure that these instruments are more cost-effective than regulatory or sectoral approaches. carbon tax, cap-and-trade, cost-effectiveness, distortionary taxes, revenue recycling...|$|R
