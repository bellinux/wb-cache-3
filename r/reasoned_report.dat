40|$|A {{range of}} neutral, hydrogen-bonding ferrocenoyl anion receptors and redox sensors {{operable}} in nonaqueous solvents are reported {{and a series}} of anion-binding and -sensing experiments presented. Thioamide-based receptor L 2 binds halide anions more effectively than its carboxamide analogue L 1, with the thioamide (N-H) group proving to be a better NMR antenna for detecting the recognition event. The binding of this class of neutral hydrogen-bonding receptor has favorable DeltaH degrees and unfavorable DeltaS degrees. Multidentate amide receptor L 5 binds halide guests more strongly, with the effect of solvent on this binding process being studied. The introduction of a primary amine functionality (L 4) causes remarkably strong HSO(4) (-) binding, the first <b>reasoned</b> <b>report</b> of selectivity for this acidic anionic guest. Analogously to many biological anion recognition processes, different binding modes operate dependent on guest acidity. In this way, the chemical properties of the substrate are addressed, yielding novel anion selectivities. All the receptors investigated exhibit electrochemical anion recognition. Typically, an EC mechanistic response is observed as ferrocene oxidation "switches-on" electrostatic interactions with the bound guest. Remarkable cathodic shifts of the ferrocene oxidation wave are also induced (up to 220 mV with HSO(4) (-) and 240 mV with H(2) PO(4) (-)) as the proximate bound negative charge stabilizes positively charged ferrocenium. Difunctional receptor L 8 shows a large, novel UV-visible spectroscopic enhancement with H(2) PO(4) (-) ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} the effect of perceived need on exercise and healthy eating using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). In addition, it investigated the determinants of perceived need. Method. Participants completed a questionnaire measuring components of TPB and perceived need. A follow-up questionnaire I week later measured behaviour. The questionnaires were completed by e-mail. The initial questionnaire was completed by 331 adults, and 286 follow-up questionnaires were returned. Results. Perceived behavioural control was the main predictor of exercise intention and affective attitude was the main predictor of healthy eating intention. Perceived need significantly contributed {{to the prediction of}} healthy eating intention but not to exercise intention. Intention and perceived behavioural control predicted actual behaviour but perceived need did not. <b>Reasons</b> <b>reported</b> for the perception of needing to engage in both behaviours mainly focused on physical health and weight control. Conclusions. <b>Reasons</b> <b>reported</b> for low perceived need suggest that the concept of perceived need may be rather ambiguous, particularly in the case of exercise. Therefore, {{further research is needed to}} elucidate the role of perceived need in relation to a variety of health behaviours. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, {{progressive}} and frequently lethal cystic lung disease that almost exclusively affects women {{and has no}} proven therapies. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis has identified promising molecular targets for clinical trials. Although barriers, modifiers, and benefits for clinical trial participation in common diseases such as cancer have been studied, we are unaware of such evaluations concerning rare diseases. MethodsWe performed a survey of a population-based registry of 780 LAM subjects in North America to identify predictors of trial participation. Logistic regression analysis evaluated the association of demographic and clinical features with trial participation. Results 41 of 263 (16 %) LAM patient respondents in North America had participated in a clinical trial. Age, disease duration, lack of any college education, use of oxygen therapy, and presentation without chest pain were associated with trial participation in unadjusted analyses. Multivariate analyses indicate that patient age was the strongest independent predictor for trial participation (OR= 2. 07, p= 0. 004 per decade greater of patient age). Common <b>reasons</b> <b>reported</b> against trial participation included not meeting enrollment criteria (44 %), drug toxicity (25 %), and stable disease (20 %). The most frequent <b>reason</b> <b>reported</b> for trial participation was to help future patients (85 %). ConclusionsStudy entry criteria, drug toxicity, and stability of disease are barriers to trial enrollment among subjects with LAM.
