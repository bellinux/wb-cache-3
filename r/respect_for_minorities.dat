Amongst the recognized constitutional principles are federalism, liberal democracy, constitutionalism, the rule of law, and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minorities.</b> Other principles include responsible government, representation by population, judicial independence, parliamentary supremacy, and an implied bill of rights. In one case, the Provincial Judges Reference (1997), it was found a law can be held invalid for contradicting unwritten principles, in this case judicial independence.|$|E

However, the Supreme Court of Canada has found that this list is not intended to be exhaustive, and in 1998's Reference re Secession of Quebec identified four [...] "supporting principles and rules" [...] that are included as unwritten elements of the constitution: federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minorities.</b> While these principles are an enforceable part of Canada's constitution, Canadian courts have not used them to override the written text of the constitution, instead confining their role to [...] "filling gaps".|$|E

Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Dimitris Delavekouras said that the perpetrators acted out of ethnic prejudice and that such incidents were designed to stir ethnic tensions and undermine Greek-Albanian relations. [...] He called for [...] "swift and proper" [...] justice and further underlined that <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minorities</b> is one of the conditions for EU membership. [...] The main opposition New Democracy (ND) party and the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) also sharply condemned the incident and called on the Greek government to take all necessary measures to ensure that a full investigation and judicial actions are taken.

San Marino's Foreign Minister Fabio Berardi visited Belgrade on July 15, 2005 where he met with Serbian President Boris Tadić, Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Drašković. During the visit, Berardi promised that San Marino will support all Serbia's {{requests}} in the Council of Europe, during its chairmanship, regarding urge for the affirmation of dialogue and territorial sovereignty of Serbia. In 2008 after the Republic of Kosovo declared its independence, San Marino Foreign Ministry stated that San Marino recognises the right to self-determination but that it also believes that [...] "the Helsinki Final Act plays {{an important part of the}} precious equilibrium". The statement pointed at the problem of ethnic hatred in the area of former Yugoslavia. Although the proclamation of independence has been accompanied by statements from the new authorities of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minorities,</b> there is a remaining fear that without the protection of the international forces there could be a mass exodus of Serbs. San Marino does not wish to rekindle ethnic and religious conflicts by recognizing Kosovo as an independent state, although it believes that all the people of Kosovo need to be supported by international solidarity. San Marino supports the continued presence of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Kosovo and will wait with the decision on recognition until the status of Kosovo is resolved through dialogue of both sides under the supervision of United Nations, so that both sides can count on international impartiality of judgement.|$|E

While {{there is evidence that}} democratic states contribute to international peace, the converse, that democracies enjoy internal peace, seems problematic. In fact, the evidence seems to suggest that authoritarian states face fewer separatist challenges of a violent nature than do democratic ones.

On the other hand, the research shows that Colombian society keeps being Christian, but its Christianity is changing, and the Catholic Church has lost its monopoly on symbolic goods of salvation.

40|$|This {{working paper}} explores {{the role of}} some recent {{components}} under the European Union legal and political aegis and its coexistence with the CoE, here approached as a potential advancement of the protection, promotion and preservation of national minority groups in European Union member states. Although the European Union has been slow {{in the development of}} clear competences on minority rights, several considerations pertinent to national minorities can be depicted across the European Union frameworks. The European Union treaty is committed to the safe guard of human rights and the <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minorities</b> in its ‘values article’ which are applicable under Community Action. This basis is further accompanied by other policy functions which stimulate action on the promotion and preservation of minority identities, in particular in the fields of language and culture. Such policies are prescribed in different degrees of European Union competences and modes of implementation, ranging between formal legal effects and informal political consequences, generating varied forms of Europeanization. At the same time, nearly all European Union member states are bound by additional transnational regulations on human and minority rights, such as those developed by the Council of Europe. This level of transnational human rights is gradually also becoming embodied into European Union structures, while already embodied by most European states’ constitutions. By taking account of some developments under each process, their interaction, but also coexistence, this paper aims to identify how Europeanization and transnational forces can help to construct and sustain a policy field, namely a national minority policy...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{illuminates}} the talk radio phenomenon in Kenya and its increased usage {{as a tool}} for participation towards democratization. It illustrates the sometimes tenuous relationship between radio and democracy more broadly, and deepens our understanding of how talk radio shows in Kenya open up spaces for Kenyan citizens to air their views and opinions about matters that concern them as a people; through public opinion expressions on democratic participation and political discussion. Adopting Jürgen Habermas’ (1974) concept of the public sphere as a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed and is guaranteed to all citizens; this research seeks to understand the democratic role of the media, by exploring how Radio Citizen, specifically through its talk show program Jambo Kenya, mediates public discussion, through components such as the talk radio genre and hosts, interviews, commentary and audience call-in. The interrogation of whether Jambo Kenya provides content or procedures on important associated democratic principles such as: informed participants, freedom of expression, and right of access to public information, rule of law, checks and balances on power, human rights, and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>minorities</b> in the society seeks to find out how talk radio content contributes to the democratic life of society and how it acts {{as a tool for}} achieving democratic aims. The study takes a thematic content analysis of the occurring comments and suggestions made by the listeners regarding Kenya’s governance through Jambo Kenya; interrogating how the program constructs and reflects power struggles and the way these aspects are likely to enhance mediated deliberative democratic practices. Findings from the study reveal that talk show Jambo Kenya promotes citizen participation and public discourse where call-in listeners compare agendas. The interpretations of the findings foreground an understanding that the talk radio genre as taking a lead role in fostering a nexus between citizens and politics, and its audiences participate significantly in shaping public opinion...|$|E
