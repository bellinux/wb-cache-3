5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{butterfly}} colony areas still host economic {{activities such as}} subsistence farming and livestock raising. In some areas, such as Sierra Chincua, Cerro Pelon and El Rosario, there are still problems with illegal logging to supply local fuel needs {{as well as for}} raw materials for handicrafts. El Rosario is named after the local ejido which belongs to about 10,000 “campesinos” or rural farmers. Many of these people make a living through farming and the sale of handcrafts and foods to tourists. Information about the butterflies is insufficient as it is not know the full extent of their wintering areas, nor the ecology of the area. Because of this, it is not known how large the reserve <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> to be for the preservation of {{the butterfly}}.|$|E

500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. There is a real, human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E

500|$|In The Globe and Mail, Canadian author Paul William Roberts {{praised the}} book, calling it [...] "... the most {{important}} use of printed word and post-consumer recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme Deshusses's Délivrez Prométhée, 25 years ago." [...] Roberts explains, [...] " [...] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, {{not just because of}} the density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..." [...] On the other hand, in the National Post review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for [...] "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable."

[...] In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said [...] "a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about." [...] Rothman added that [...] "what it <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision." [...] By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, [...] but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. On September 3, 2012, Duncan died, precluding him from reprising his role as Kingpin.|$|E

You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E

500|$|On a $25 million budget, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, [...] "Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those." [...] Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film. The scene featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, [...] "A director <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs." [...] He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing {{the outside of the}} prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.|$|E
500|$|When public {{relations}} specialist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life but he causes {{the train to}} derail and nearly injures another driver. Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray invites him home for dinner with his wife, Mary ( [...] Charlize Theron), and their son, Aaron, during which Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image. Hancock goes back home to ponder the offer and returns to his house {{the next day and}} grudgingly accepts. Ray convinces the alcoholic superhero to agree to be jailed for outstanding warrants so they can show Los Angeles how much the city <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> Hancock. Hancock tries to resist the urge to break out of jail using his powers and refuses to talk during a prison group therapy but frequent visits by Ray and his family encouraged him to be patient. When crime rates rise after Hancock's incarceration, the superhero is contacted by the Chief of Police. Reluctantly donning a new costume (which has been provided by Ray), Hancock foils a bank robbery and aids a wounded officer. He prevents Red Parker (Eddie Marsan) from detonating explosive-laden vests attached to the bank hostages, by slicing off his hand (which was holding onto a [...] "deadman's switch").|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg halted {{production}} of the show after the third season had been completed {{to focus on the}} making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was set for release in 2004: [...] "I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time. We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] <b>really</b> <b>needs.</b> It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel [...] "truly was the most influential artistic person in [...] life." [...] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie grossed $140 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. The review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 68 percent positive based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus states in summary, [...] "Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a more {{negative}} review, Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "not even B-squad urban cabaret pop from A-list production heavyweights can arouse our interest {{for a whole}} 45 minutes."

2500|$|On 17 February, Willie Mullins {{announced}} that Faugheen has been ruled {{out for the}} rest of the season with a , described by the trainer as [...] "small injury, but just bad timing.. It <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> eight or nine weeks rest, and that would be plenty, unfortunately that rules out all of the rest of the National Hunt season". With his forced retreat for the campaign, Mullins was still left with the front three challengers in the Champion Hurdle market but his retained jockey Ruby Walsh explained: [...] "It’s like someone whipping the ace out of the pack and handing you the rest of the cards". The injury followed the roller coaster events of Faugheen's season that started with the surprise defeat on reappearance and succeeded with the latest performance for which he was rated the best two-mile hurdler of the century by the official handicappers, as well as the private organizations Timeform [...] and Racing Post. However, Mullins was optimistic about the prospect of Faugheen returning for the next season [...] "The prognosis is very good..

2500|$|Schedeen awarded Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, stating, [...] "This Arrow episode worked {{much better}} as a 100th episode celebration than it did the middle act of the Invasion crossover. The Cisco/Team Arrow subplot did little to advance the larger narrative. On the other hand, the dream prison premise served as an emotionally rich and action-packed way to {{celebrate}} the show's first 100 episodes. But with only one episode left to go in this crossover, the pacing <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> to pick up if fans {{are going to get}} the epic superhero mash-up they deserve." [...] Alasdair Wilkins for The A.V. Club gave Arrow an [...] "A", saying, [...] ""Invasion!" [...] could have been an unholy mess, balancing the needs of a three-part crossover with the Arrow-specific celebration of the 100-episode milestone. But the decision to focus on the show's past and bring back old favorites like Moira, Deathstroke, Robert, and Moira—Moira is worth listing twice—ends up giving the show a way to develop the power and the threat of the Dominators without this crossover just being three straight episodes of heroes and aliens punching each other. Tonight's episode also once again proves that Arrow doesn't need to be gloomy or choked by petty interpersonal conflict to tell effective stories". Wilkins concluded: [...] "If this is how Arrow marks 100 episodes, then here's to 100 more. If this isn’t the best episode in Arrows history, it's damn close." ...|$|E
