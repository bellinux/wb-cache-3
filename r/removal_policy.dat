5|$|From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian {{democracy}} began a set {{of reforms}} which included wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian <b>removal</b> <b>policy</b> that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E

Following, we present an investigation with residents threatened with removal, regarding the meanings they attribute to house, neighborhood, and neighborhood relations. From the analysis of statements obtained in the field research, we discuss what the experiences and meanings produced by these social subjects may indicate about <b>removal</b> <b>policies</b> and urban resettlement. </em...|$|R

25|$|This {{program has}} been {{evaluated}} by the World Bank {{as one of the}} most effective programmes of its kind globally. Under her leadership, the National Bureau of Statistics carried out a rebasing exercise; the first in 24 years, which saw Nigeria emerge as the largest economy in Africa. She took a lot of heat, more-so than any other government official for the fuel subsidy <b>removal</b> <b>policy</b> by the Nigerian government which led to protests in January 2012. In May 2016, the new Nigerian administration eventually removed the fuel subsidy after it became apparent that it was unsustainable and inefficient.|$|E
25|$|Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia {{area was}} home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians {{in the village of}} Shackamaxon. The Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government. They are also called Delaware Indians, and their {{historical}} territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian <b>removal</b> <b>policy.</b> In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of Oklahoma, with some communities living also in Wisconsin, Ontario (Canada) and their traditional homelands.|$|E
25|$|The {{treaty was}} part of the greater Indian <b>Removal</b> <b>policy,</b> {{originally}} proposed by President Thomas Jefferson, by which the Five Civilized Tribes were to allow for white settlement in the south by ceding their territory and relocating west of the Mississippi River. It was one of several removal treaties signed by the Muscogee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee in the 1830s relocating them to the new territories in present-day Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Chickasaw were essentially doomed to removal with the others, when, in 1806 Jefferson promised the southern states that the Federal Government would encourage the migration of all Indians to land west of the Mississippi. The other factor underlying the removal of the Indians was land speculation, one of the primary sources of money for the landed aristocracy of the South {{since the early days of}} the Virginia colony. The trio of Andrew Jackson, John Coffee and James Jackson (unrelated), were each land speculators, militiamen and politicians who worked the cessions of huge tracts of Indians lands, the defeat of Indian resistance and eventually the complete removal of the Chickasaw, as well as the rest of the Five Civilized Tribes, to make way for white settlers –often at great personal profit.|$|E

500|$|As the 19th century progressed, the United States government's Indian <b>removal</b> <b>policy</b> pushed Native American tribes {{west of the}} Mississippi River. [...] In 1830, the Indian Removal Act {{was signed}} into law, and though that act did not {{directly}} address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal. [...] In {{what came to be}} known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death, about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas. [...] On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois. [...] Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.|$|E

2500|$|Cherokees were {{displaced}} from their ancestral lands in northern Georgia and the Carolinas {{in a period}} of rapidly expanding white population. Some of the rapid expansion was due to a gold rush around Dahlonega, Georgia in the 1830s. [...] President Andrew Jackson said <b>removal</b> <b>policy</b> was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing the fate of [...] "the Mohegan, the Narragansett, and the Delaware". However, there is ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques, and a modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus.|$|E
2500|$|By late November, 1835, white {{settlers}} in the Territory of Florida were becoming alarmed by {{the activities of the}} Seminole Indians, some of whose leaders vehemently protested the official Indian <b>removal</b> <b>policy</b> of the United States, and Osceola's killing of Charley Emathla threatened to provoke an armed confrontation. On December 17, 1835, Gen. Joseph Hernández ordered troops to protect the plantations {{in the vicinity of the}} Matanzas, Tomoka, and Mosquito Rivers. Major Benjamin A. Putnam, a St. Augustine lawyer, led a detachment of the local militia, Company A of the St. Augustine Guards, to Dunlawton, where [...] "the Anderson brothers were endeavoring to place the estate in a condition for defense by erecting a stockade.
