5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages {{per person per}} day in 1986, and six entire newspapers {{per person per day}} by 2007. Given this growth, telecommunications play an increasingly important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> economy and the global telecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012. The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was {{the manner}} in which it led to the emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began to take a more assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E

25|$|In the 18thcentury the UK was {{the first}} country to industrialise, and during the 19thcentury it had a {{dominant}} role in the global economy, accounting for 9.1% of the world's GDP in 1970.

25|$|Post–Second World War {{economic}} and political decline, as well as changing attitudes in British society and government, were reflected by the armed forces' contracting global role, and later epitomised by its political defeat during the Suez Crisis (1956). Reflecting Britain's new <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and the escalation of the Cold War (1947–1991), the country became {{a founding member of}} the NATO military alliance in 1949. Defence Reviews, such as those in 1957 and 1966, announced significant reductions in conventional forces, the pursuement of a doctrine based on nuclear deterrence, and a permanent military withdrawal East of Suez. By the mid-1970s, the armed forces had reconfigured to focus on the responsibilities allocated to them by NATO. The British Army of the Rhine and RAF Germany consequently represented the largest and most important overseas commitments that the armed forces had during this period, while the Royal Navy developed an anti-submarine warfare specialisation, with a particular focus on countering Soviet submarines in the Eastern Atlantic and North Sea.|$|E

500|$|Many of Shelley's {{stories are}} set in places or times far removed from early 19th-century Britain, such as Greece and the reign of Henry IV of France.

In her stories, female identity is tied to a woman's short-lived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed {{through the use of}} money. Although Mary Shelley wrote twenty-one short stories for the annuals between 1823 and 1839, she always saw herself, above all, as a novelist.

It is always useful as individuals or nations to ask how we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict." [...] Gyllenhaal took part in Artists United to Win Without War, a campaign started by Robert Greenwald that aimed to advance progressive causes and voicing opposition to the Iraq War.
