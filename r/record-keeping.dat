5|$|Alden Bradford Weston (1805–1880). One {{of three}} sons to inherit the firm. Of the three, Alden {{was the most}} heavily {{involved}} in managing the fleet with his father. Beginning in 1825, Alden was made head clerk of the Boston counting rooms and had charge {{of much of the}} firm's <b>record-keeping</b> from that time forward. Alden inherited the King Caesar House.|$|E
5|$|Beaufort {{developed}} the Wind Force Scale and Weather Notation coding, {{which he was}} to use in his journals {{for the remainder of}} his life. He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, and with his friend William Whewell, expanded weather <b>record-keeping</b> at 200 British Coast guard stations.|$|E
5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. This {{was one of}} the reasons why it was the wettest June in San Diego, since <b>record-keeping</b> began in 1850. Despite this, less than an inch (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Kimball married, {{his father}} {{called him to}} serve as clerk for the St. Joseph Stake. In the 1920s, local stake clerks still {{performed}} the extensive <b>record-keeping</b> and reporting duties that are now digitized and done centrally at the LDS Church's headquarters in Salt Lake City. The position of stake clerk was essentially a part-time job, and those called were paid a monthly salary of $50.|$|E
5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and <b>record-keeping</b> affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} advocates have voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and <b>record-keeping</b> for all gun sales. Contrarily, gun rights advocates have stated {{that there is no}} loophole, that current laws provide a single, uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale, and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non-commercial, intrastate transfers of legal firearms types between private citizens.|$|E
5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could be written much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal <b>record-keeping.</b> Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} shorthand script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could be written in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous <b>record-keeping.</b> These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Jessica {{was born}} in Falmouth, Massachusetts to Lisa Blair Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff {{and moved to the}} San Francisco Bay Area in California when she was four. Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff did not possess a medical {{certificate}} or a student pilot certificate, since they require a minimum age of 16, or a pilot certificate that requires a minimum age of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. There was also no <b>record-keeping</b> body {{at the time of her}} trip recognizing any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized her story, and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending.|$|E
5|$|John Linton Treloar, OBE (10December 1894 – 28January 1952) was an Australian {{archivist}} and {{the second}} director of the Australian War Memorial (AWM). During World War I he served in several staff roles and later headed the First Australian Imperial Force's (AIF) <b>record-keeping</b> unit. From 1920 Treloar {{played an important role}} in establishing the AWM as its director. He headed an Australian Government department during the first years of World War II, and spent the remainder of the war in charge of the Australian military's history section. Treloar returned to the AWM in 1946, and continued as its director until his death.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000people in Honduras, with 11,000missing in {{the months}} after the storm. There were 8,000people listed as missing about ten days after Mitch struck, {{although}} problems with <b>record-keeping</b> made it difficult to determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Morazán Department, which includes Tegucigalpa, had about 1,000deaths, and Yoro Department had 911fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves or were cremated. The storm injured 12,272people nationwide, mostly in Choluteca and Cortés departments.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Tanana Valley flood or the 2008 Fairbanks flood was a {{flood in}} late July and early August 2008 that {{affected}} several rivers {{in the central}} portion of the American state of Alaska. The city of Fairbanks, Alaska saw high water levels, while the towns of Nenana, Salcha, and Old Minto received heavy damage. The Salcha River and Tanana River reached their second-highest levels since <b>record-keeping</b> began (the highest was during the 1967 Tanana Valley Flood), while the Chena River, which bisects Fairbanks, was kept below flood stage {{by the use of}} the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project.|$|E
5|$|The {{avenues for}} {{research}} {{have been limited}} by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and {{a great number of}} works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The <b>record-keeping</b> in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.|$|E
5|$|Although operationally {{placed at}} the {{disposal}} of the British, the AIF was administered as a separate national force, with the Australian government reserving the responsibility for the promotion, pay, clothing, equipment and feeding of its personnel. The AIF was administered separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a parallel system was set up to deal with non-operational matters including <b>record-keeping,</b> finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London. Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|Andres {{originated}} from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm {{status as a}} second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After {{a brief period of}} a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since <b>record-keeping</b> began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours, {{emerging}} into the South China Sea before 1800UTC on December2. Though land interaction with the Philippines did not significantly affect the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait. At 0000UTC on December3, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status. Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December3, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of}} the convection. At 2340UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108years of <b>record-keeping.</b> Roughly six hours later on December4, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, creating a more powerful system that later tracked over Japan.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, {{laid out in a}} thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor <b>record-keeping.</b> The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence and support of Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E
5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' <b>record-keeping</b> systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied {{by a member of the}} imperial family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for <b>record-keeping</b> of all nobles, a register being updated at the beginning of each year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E

Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury. The AIF Headquarters and its subordinate units were almost entirely independent from the British Army, which allowed the force to be self-sustaining in many fields. The AIF generally followed British administrative policy and procedures, including for the awarding of imperial honours and awards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern <b>record-keeping</b> began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established {{at all levels of}} the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31. Then centered 165mi (270km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it {{claims to have}} one of the longest continuous <b>record-keeping</b> traditions in Britain. Records were initially kept in the Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended to them in the 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
25|$|Finally in 2007, WWC {{purchased}} and installed a state-of-the-art, computerized patient <b>record-keeping</b> system.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 2009, {{officials}} with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) expressed concerns over possible violations of normal federal government <b>record-keeping</b> procedures at the State Department under then-Secretary Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Skills {{acquired}} include practical enterprise {{organization and}} management skills including labor and time management, financial <b>record-keeping</b> and reporting, planning, quoting and tendering for work, vocational {{skills such as}} e.g. building, welding, tailoring, farming, catering or IT skills, and literacy and numeracy development.|$|E
25|$|The School of Computing and Information {{is home to}} over 100 {{faculty members}} whose {{expertise}} ranges from wireless security and Web semantics to cyber-scholarship and <b>record-keeping</b> systems. The school also had 26 adjunct faculty with joint appointments from fields as diverse as pathology, medicine and business.|$|E
25|$|During a June 2009 speech, President Barack Obama {{outlined}} {{his strategy}} for reform. He mentioned electronic <b>record-keeping,</b> preventing expensive conditions, reducing obesity, refocusing doctor incentives from quantity of care to quality, bundling payments {{for treatment of}} conditions rather than specific services, better identifying and communicating the most cost-effective treatments, and reducing defensive medicine.|$|E
25|$|The India Mission's first cover {{name was}} GS I(k), {{which made it}} {{appear to be a}} <b>record-keeping</b> branch of GHQ India. The name, Force 136 was adopted in March 1944. From December 1944, the organisation's {{headquarters}} moved to Kandy in Ceylon, and co-operated closely with South East Asia Command which was also located there.|$|E
25|$|Corruption {{is common}} among Sudanese {{government}} officials, who routinely act with total impunity, {{knowing that they}} will almost certainly not be investigated for any transgression. Sources have stated that the opportunities for corruption are created by an inefficient administration and bureaucracy, along with poor <b>record-keeping</b> {{and a lack of}} transparency. Bribes are commonly demanded by government employees.|$|E
25|$|Accompanying the tornadoes was a storm which dumped {{several inches}} of rain on the city in a few hours, {{resulting}} in flooding which effectively shut down the mass transit system. Several people were injured by the tornado, and one person died from the associated flooding. The tornado {{was the first to}} hit Brooklyn since 1950 when modern <b>record-keeping</b> began.|$|E
25|$|Actuary Walter G. Bowerman {{stated that}} ill-founded {{longevity}} assertions originate mainly in remote, underdeveloped regions, among non-literate peoples, with only family testimony available as evidence. This means that {{people living in}} areas of the world with historically more comprehensive resources for <b>record-keeping</b> have tended to hold more claims to longevity, {{regardless of whether or not}} individuals in other parts of the world have lived longer.|$|E
25|$|The third {{town clerk}} of Hingham was Daniel Cushing, who emigrated to Hingham from Hingham, Norfolk, {{with his father}} Matthew in 1638. Cushing's meticulous records of early Hingham enabled {{subsequent}} town historians to reconstruct much of early Hingham history {{as well as that}} of the early families. Cushing was rather unusual in that he included the town's gossip along with the more conventional formal <b>record-keeping.</b>|$|E
25|$|Star Fleet Battles On-Line is a {{software}} client {{that allows a}} person to play SFB against other people on the internet. While it does still require a personal understanding of the rules to play, the client does contain all the <b>record-keeping</b> functions of the game, and provides for some easier handling of places that require 'simultaneous' decisions (which have always been difficult in normal face-to-face play).|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2012, the TAIC {{released}} an urgent safety recommendation after investigators found apparent anomalies {{in the maintenance}} of the crash balloon. The recommendation to the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that they urgently check the maintenance practices and airworthiness, especially in relation to the inspection of burners, fuel systems and envelopes, and maintenance <b>record-keeping,</b> of the other 74 hot air balloons registered in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry also {{recommended}} a registration scheme for people {{working with children}} and vulnerable adults such as the elderly. The development of this recommendation led to {{the foundation of the}} Independent Safeguarding Authority. It also suggested a national system should be set up for police forces to share intelligence information. The report said there should also be a clear code of practice on <b>record-keeping</b> by all police forces.|$|E
25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient <b>record-keeping</b> and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E
