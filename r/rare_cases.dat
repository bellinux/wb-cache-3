5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green in <b>rare</b> <b>cases.</b> Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with a silky luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|In <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> {{where none}} of the oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary.

5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population. In <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn.|$|E

5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|In <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the creosote bush in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.|$|E

5|$|In <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in <b>rare</b> <b>cases,</b> be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to rule out delirium).|$|E
