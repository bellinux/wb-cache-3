40|$|Kevlar {{material}} {{is being used}} in parachute systems require high strength-to-weight ratios or becoming resistance to sustain high temperatures. However, Nylon-Kevlar parachutes are popular these days and are first preference of the parachute designers specially for recovery system of reentry vehicles. Tests of using Kevlar suspension lines, radials, vent and skirt re-enforcements, risers demonstrated that the Kevlar material can be used successfully in <b>Ringslot</b> <b>parachute.</b> The opening shock experienced by the parachute does not differ from all-Nylon parachutes. The parachute is much lighter and capable of withstanding higher load and therefore {{can be used for}} extraction or deceleration in recovery system of reentry vehicles. The design and performance of a hybrid Ringslot was investigated experimentally in sled test. The experimental method and performance data are described in this paper...|$|E
