25|$|To date, TAAR1 {{has been}} {{identified}} and cloned in five different mammal genomes: human, mouse, rat, monkey, and chimpanzee. In rats, mRNA for TAAR1 is found at low to moderate levels in peripheral tissues like the stomach, kidney, and lungs, and at low levels in the brain. Rhesus monkey Taar1 and human TAAR1 (hTAAR1) share high sequence similarity, and TAAR1 mRNA is highly expressed in the same important monoaminergic regions of both species. These regions include the dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, amygdala, and <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus.</b> TAAR1 has also been identified in human astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|The reticular {{activating}} system {{consists of}} three groups of neurons in the brain stem: pedunculopontine nucleus, locus caeruleus and <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus.</b> When awake, it receives all kinds of non-specific sensory information and relays them to the cortex. It also modulates fight or flight responses and is hence linked to the motor system. During sleep onset, it acts via two pathways. The first is the cholinergic pathway that clears the way for thalamocortical transmission; {{the second is the}} monoaminergic pathway (which starts in the upper brain and projects to the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex) that can cause wakefulness if inactive. It is also predicted {{to play a role in}} REM sleep by modulating muscle tone, causing the muscle atonia characteristic of REM sleep. During NREM sleep this system is blocked by the preoptic nucleus neurons.|$|E
50|$|The neurons of the <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> are the {{principal}} source of 5-HT release in the brain.There are nine <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei,</b> designated B1-B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the <b>nuclei</b> <b>raphes</b> lineares into one nucleus), {{all of which are}} located along the midline of the brainstem, and centered on the reticular formation.Axons from the neurons of the <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> form a neurotransmitter system reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> terminate in the cerebellum and spinal cord, while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.|$|R
50|$|The <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> provide {{feedback}} to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), thus contributing in circadian rhythms in animals. The SCN transmits to the <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> via the dorsomedial hypothalamus nucleus altering serotonin levels for sleep/wake states. The <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> will then transmit {{feedback to the}} SCN about the animal's vigilance and levels of alertness. This reciprocal feedback between the two structures provides an adaptable yet stable basis of circadian rhythms.|$|R
50|$|The {{serotonin}} nuclei {{may also}} {{be divided into two}} main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively. The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> (B6 and B7) and the median <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The caudal group consists of the <b>nucleus</b> <b>raphe</b> magnus (B3), <b>raphe</b> obscurus <b>nucleus</b> (B2), <b>raphe</b> pallidus <b>nucleus</b> (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem.|$|R

2500|$|Furthermore, GIRKs {{have been}} found {{to play a role in}} a group of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus,</b> {{specifically}} those associated with the neuropeptide hormone orexin. [...] The 5-HT1A receptor, a serotonin receptor and type of GPCR, has been shown to be coupled directly with the α-subunit of a G protein, while the βγ-complex activates GIRK without use of a second messenger. The subsequent activation of the GIRK channel mediates hyperpolarization of orexin neurons, which regulate the release of many other neurotransmitters including noradrenaline and acetylcholine.|$|E
2500|$|Antagonism of the α2-adrenergic receptors, which {{function}} {{largely as}} inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, enhances adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, notably central 5-HT1A receptor mediated transmission in the dorsal <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus</b> and hippocampus; hence, mirtazapine's classification as a NaSSA. Indirect α1 adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory α2 heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are {{held responsible for}} the increase in extracellular serotonin. Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional [...] "indirect agonist" [...] of the 5-HT1A receptor. Increased activation of the central 5-HT1A receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs.|$|E

40|$|The GATA- 3 {{transcription}} factor shows a specific and restricted expression {{pattern in the}} developing and adult mouse brain. In the present study we investigated the role of GATA- 3 in the caudal raphe system, which is known to operate as a modulator of motor activity. We demonstrate that virtually all neurons in the caudal <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> that express GATA- 3 also produce serotonin. Absence of GATA- 3, as analyzed in chimeric 2 / 2 mice, affects the cytoarchitecture of serotonergic neurons in the caudal <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> As a result the chimeras show a serious defect in their locomotor performance on a rotating rod. In sum, we conclude that GATA- 3 {{plays a major role}} in the development of the serotonergic neurons of the caudal <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei,</b> and that it is crucial for their role in locomotion.

50|$|More {{recent studies}} of the Raphe Nuclei done with rats involve the effects of Ghrelin on the dorsal <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus.</b> When administered, larger doses of Ghrelin act {{centrally}} on the <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus,</b> hippocampus, and amygdala which causes dramatic increases in food intake, memory retention, and increases in anxiety. The effects of ghrelin are seen on the <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus</b> as soon as an hour after injection, suggesting rapid changes in the nucleus' structure.

50|$|As an {{important}} homeostatic control {{center of the}} body, the locus caoeruleus receives afferents from the hypothalamus.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is {{involved}} in both photic and non-photic synchronization of the mammalian biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We have previously demonstrated that tryptophan hydroxylase protein (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme of 5 -HT synthesis, shows circadian rhythmicity in the pathways projecting from the <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> to the intergeniculate leaflets of the thalamus on one hand, and to the SCN on the other hand. In this study, we investigate whether the circadian rhythmicity in TPH protein could result from the rhythmic expression of tph gene in the <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> We thus cloned specific tph 1 and tph 2 partial cDNAs and assessed the daily profiles of TPH mRNA levels by in situ hybridization in the rat <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Our results demonstrate that: (i) tph 2 gene is exclusively expressed in the <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei,</b> whereas tph 1 gene is expressed in the pineal gland; (ii) under light-dark cycle (LD), TPH 2 mRNA levels present daily variation within both median and dorsal raphe nuclei; (iii) under constant darkness TPH 2 mRNA levels in both nuclei exhibit the same variation reported under LD cycle. These data show that the circadian 5 -HT synthesis within the serotonergic neurons projecting to the circadian system might {{be explained by the}} rhythmic transcription of the tph 2 gene in <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Taking our result with previous data into consideration, we further suggest that 5 -HT synthesis and release within the circadian system could be directly or indirectly {{under the control of the}} SCN...|$|R
