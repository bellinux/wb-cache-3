40|$|This paper {{presents}} a connectionist model of human reasoning that uses temporal relations between node firing. Temporal synchrony {{is used for}} representing variable binding and concepts. Temporal succession serves to represent rules by linking antecedent to consequent parts of the rule.

40|$|Neuronal {{activities}} often exhibit <b>rythmic</b> patterns, with {{a frequency}} that changes from one band to another. These oscillations can be reproduced in network models of coupled inhibitors. However, the mechanism {{that controls the}} period of the oscillations is not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that various types of inhibitory interneurons may release transmitters synchronously or asynchronously. Could this diversity explain changes in the rythm of the oscillation? To answer this, we studied the effect of synchronous versus asynchronous inhibition, in a network of coupled inhibitory neurons. We observed that frequency and synchronization are reduced when release is asynchronous; the standard deviation of activity bursts increases linearly, while their period increases in a sublinear way. A mathematical analysis supports these observations. This suggests that the release mode of inhibition could {{play an important role in}} setting up the oscillatory frequency of inhibitory coupled neurons...|$|E

From 1995 and 2003, 25 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic or periampullary cancer. The reconstruction was carried out by: end-to-end gastro-jejunal anastomosis (first jejunal loop); a Roux-en-Y T-T pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis leaving a silastic catheter in the Wirsung; hepatico-jejunostomy and jejuno-jejunostomy below the biliary anastomosis; superselective vagotomy. Mortality was 8 %. Regarding the complications, we observed 3 biliary fistulas, mean duration 5 days, with spontaneous healing; 8 pleural effusions and 7 wound infections. Postoperative 3 months reevaluation showed weight gain in 14 patients with no other digestive symptoms (vomiting, fullness, dumping). With a scintigraphic meal we observed a good <b>rythmic</b> and regular gastric emptying. No jejunal peptic ulcers were noted in all patients after the gastric protonic pump inhibitors were discontinued. Fecal fats were evaluated in all cases for malabsorption 3 months after operation with low fat fecal levels. The preliminary results of our recent experience seem to be encouraging.

40|$|The {{beach and}} nearshore area of Teignmouth (UK) {{has been the}} object of a {{multidisciplinary}} research project, COAST 3 D, carried out by 11 European institutions. This paper emphasises the sedimentological and morphological investigations of the intertidal and nearshore area using a variety of techniques. From the results presented, {{it is clear that the}} Teignmouth site is very dynamic. Sediment mobility is high during fair-weather conditions owing to the strong jet-like current flows associated with the presence of the narrow estuary mouth. The beach at Teignmouth can be categorised as composite with a dissipative low-tide terrace and a reflective upper beach. From surficial sediment sampling, selective transport processes were identified, imposed by the high current velocities at the estuary mouth. This process also leads to the formation of characteristic depositional lobes with poorly sorted sediment. From digital side-scan sonar mosaicing, cross-shore and longshore-oriented bedforms could be observed, with their characteristics being dependent on the pre-survey hydro-meteo conditions. Although the nearshore system is dominated by the jet-outflow, littoral drift processes can also be important. They proved to be im portant for beach morphological changes leading to a <b>rythmic</b> alongshore beach behaviour which was attributed to a reversal of the littoral drift imposed by a period o...|$|E

With hyperpolarization greater than 15 mV the amplitude decreased, and the slow wave became reduced, and less dependent on polarization.

40|$|We have endeavoured {{to analyse}} audio {{recordings}} of solo Irish fiddle players {{with the objective}} of measuring micro <b>rythmic</b> deviations, and in particular the presence of swing. In the scope of our study, the autocorrelation meth-ods have yielded good results in both pitch and tempo ex-traction. BACKGROUND As in blues, country and jazz music, Irish traditional fiddle music is often played with swing rhythm, which consists in performing eighth notes where downbeats and upbeats re-ceive approximately 2 / 3 and 1 / 3 of the beat, respectively, giving a triplet feel and providing a rhythmic lift to the music. Swing ratio can be defined as the ratio of the two successive beats durations (long/short). The amount of swing varies among performers and repertoires, from no swing (1 : 1) to hard swing (3 : 1). Usual swing ratio in Irish traditional fiddle music is around 2 : 1 (triple meter). Al-though swing can be clearly perceived by experienced per-formers, it is a very subtle rhythmic variation that can not be easily quantified perceptually and that provokes many debates among musicians. AIM The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the amount of swing through the analysis of audio recordings of Irish fiddle per-formances. The subject of swing has been of interest for many years in the scientific community, and a considerable amount of work has been done (Gouyon 2005) As in the case of the violin, the attacks are not well defined, we de-cided to avoid techniques based on measuring the energy of the signal such as the ones used by Bilmes (1993).

40|$|The Carlingford {{volcanic}} complex has {{an intense}} swarm of minor intrusions associated with it. Field work {{demonstrates that the}} swarm is composite, having involved the repeated injection of magma as dykes, cone sheets and complementary cone sheets {{in at least three}} <b>rythmic</b> cycles. Three major rock series are represented in these bodies: the tholeiitic basalt - craignurite series, the alkali basalt series and the high alumina basalt series, other rock types such as felsites, quartz feldspar porphyries and lamprophyres are present in minor proportions. Analysis of the structure of individual swarms suggests that basaltic magma was injected into the crust as an elongate ridge like body culminating in a cupola beneath the complex, from which cone sheet and radial dyke swarms emerged; linear dyke swarms arose from the ridge crest. Detailed geochemical investigations show, that the main magma series were derived by fractionation from basaltic parents; that two fractionation paths are represented in the alkali basalt series (the trachy basalt - tristanite series and hawaiite - mugearite - benmorite series); that craignurites represent a true fractionation product of tholeiitic magma and are petrochemically distinct from icelandites. Basalt fractionation at Carlingford was dominated by the separation of olivine and plagioclase at low pressure while the petrochemistry of the rocks suggests that the three parental stems - tholeiitic basaft, alkali basalt and high alumina basalt, were derived from a common parent by fractionation at higher pressure. Time relations indicate that common parent to be olivine tholeiite magma which it is suggested was formed at depths in excess of 60 km. Miscellaneous rock types, including felsites,lamprophyres and quartz feldspar porphyries are shown to have been derived by melting of crustal rocks during the injection of basic magma within the complex...|$|E
