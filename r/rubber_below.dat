50|$|Interaction between rubber {{particles}} and crazes puts elongation pressures onto the {{particles in the}} direction of stress. If this force overcomes the surface adhesion between the rubber and polymer, debonding will occur, thereby diminishing the toughening effect associated with crazing. If the particle is harder, it will be less able to deform, and thus debonding occurs under less stress. This is one reason why dispersed <b>rubbers,</b> <b>below</b> their own glass transition temperature, do not toughen plastics effectively.|$|R

30|$|In general, the {{approaches}} used to incorporate crumb rubber modifier (CRM) in road paving materials {{are classified as}} the dry method and the wet method [2]. Wet method is applied {{in most of the}} rubberized asphalt projects in China, which entails adding the crumb rubber to the binder before mixing it with aggregate [3]. The behavior of asphalt–rubber with wet method depends on several factors, such as, the origin, fabrication process and grain size distribution of the crumb rubber, the type of base asphalt binder used in the mixture, and the temperature and time of the mixing process. Anderson et al. [4] investigated the rheological and physical properties of binders modified with rubber, for <b>rubber</b> contents <b>below</b> 20  % by weight. Huang et al. [5] and Shen and Amirkhanian [6] suggested the optimal preparation of asphalt–rubber according to comparative tests on material properties of asphalt binder.|$|R
30|$|Sensors were {{reinforced}} with vinyl laminate to prevent shear force damage and reduce drift. Once laminated, the sensor was preconditioned using a 2  MPa cyclic load for 30  cycles inside the Tekscan equilibration device, which applied a uniform {{pressure to the}} sensing matrix area through an air-filled bladder. In addition, a three-point equilibration process was performed to account for sensing element variation at 50, 100, and 150 raw digital outputs. After equilibration, the sensor was calibrated using a Mechanical Testing System (MTS Bionix 370.02, MTS Corp., Eden Prairie, MN) by applying incremental loads from 0 to 750  N to the sensor. The sensor was compressed between a metal plate and a flat high-density polyethylene block with a 1.5  mm thick silicon <b>rubber</b> sheet <b>below</b> to evenly distribute loads, covering approximately 75 % of the sensor matrix area. The raw digital output was then correlated to contact pressures using a power law curve to best fit the non-linear sensor behavior.|$|R
40|$|A large-sized {{cover part}} for air cleaner was {{injection}} molded with ABS resin, and its incomplete filling defect was analyzed using commercial Moldflow software. To investigate {{the effect of}} processing temperature on incomplete filling defect, tensile properties, weight loss, and phase separation behavior of ABS resin were evaluated. The tensile properties of dumbbell samples were not changed up to 250 °C and decreased significantly thereafter. SEM micrographs indicated no {{significant changes in the}} status of polybutadiene <b>rubber</b> phase <b>below</b> 250 °C. These different test results indicated that ABS resin little affected the thermal decomposition in processing temperature range. The Moldflow simulation was performed using measured thickness of molded cover and actual mold design with the defects. As expected, the cover part showed unbalanced filling and incomplete sections. To improve these defects, two possible cases of hot runner system have been simulated. When applying modified 5 -gate system, the maximum injection pressure was decreased approximately 5. 5 % more than that of actual gate system. In case of 6 -gate system, the maximum injection pressure reduced by 23 %, and the injection pressure required to fill is well within the range of the molding equipment. The maximum clamping force of 6 -gate system was also significantly reduced than that of actual and 5 -gate system...|$|R
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of rubber hand illusion was first reported by Botvinick and Cohen (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998) {{in which a}} rubber hand was {{placed in front of}} the participants while their own hands were hidden from sight. As long as there were synchronous touches that existed on both rubber hand and real hand, a perceptual illusion would be felt. Besides recognizing the fake model hand as being part of their own body, participants also reported that they felt as if the touch they sensed originated from the location on the rubber hand where they saw the brush touching the rubber hand, rather than from their real hand (Makin, Holmes, & Ehrsson, 2008). Furthermore, recent studies show <b>below</b> <b>rubber</b> hand illusion implicate that the brain is capable of integrating “natural” visual input and direct cortical-somatosensory stimulation to create the multisensory perception that an artificial limb belongs to one’s own body (Tsakiris, 2017; Collins et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Crumb rubber {{modified}} {{asphalt mixtures}} (CRM, dry process) involve the blending of crumb rubber (usually 1 %– 3 % by {{weight of the}} total mixture, sizes 2. 0 mm/ 6. 3 mm) with hot aggregates prior to mixing with asphalt binder. It may cost more than conventional asphalt concretes. On the contrary, the wet process implies incorporating crumb rubber into asphalt binder prior to mixing with aggregates (usually about 1 % by weight of the total mixture, 18 – 25 % by weight of bitumen, <b>rubber</b> sizes <b>below</b> about 0. 18 – 0. 42 mm) and has a wide and quite sound theory and procedure system behind it. Crumb rubber modified asphalt pavements may cost 1. 5 to 2 {{times as much as}} conventional asphalt concrete. Importantly, although the dry process has a number of technical issues (including lack of standards, and uncertain performance), {{it has the potential to}} recycle more crumb rubber compared with the wet process and its mechanical properties (modulus and mechanical impedance) appear to have the potential for constructing innovative urban and rural infrastructures and for greening European city terminals. In light of the above, the goals of this study were the following: a) designing and testing innovative bituminous mixtures containing high percentages of crumb rubber (dry process); b) designing and testing innovative pavements in which the pressures caused by vehicles and/or motorcycles and/or pedestrians are converted into energy. Several mixes were designed and produced. Based on the results obtained, several options emerged as a possible solution for urban and rural roads, aiming at a better management of flow of goods and transport activities in urban areas while considering lower environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite real applications having complex triaxial loading, current physical test methods to predict component behaviour are mainly uniaxial. But previous work has indicated {{that there may be}} substantial differences between the rubber's uniaxial and biaxial behaviour and hence through incompressibility, its triaxial properties. In order to quantify these differences equipment was developed to assess the biaxial performance of selected rubber compounds using inflated circular diaphragms. Although allowing higher extensions than stretching a sheet in its own plane, such tests do not allow stress and strain to be measured directly, requiring careful marking of the sample, or calculation through simulation. On the grounds of perceived accuracy, the latter was chosen, requiring accurate, general, elastic constants to high extensions. In this thesis the development of this apparatus, along with the associated techniques is described, along with {{the development of a new}} elastic theory. The tests on this new apparatus indicated significant differences between the uniaxial and biaxial strength and fatigue of rubber. In a unimdal test natural rubber (NR) is much stronger than styrene butadiene <b>rubber</b> (SBR) <b>below</b> 35 pphr of carbon black. In a biaxial test though the converse is true, although there is some evidence of crystallinity in NR during the biaxial test. Distinct differences were also found in fatigue between the two load cases. When plotted against extension ratio the biaxial life of SBR was found to increase, while the converse is true for NR. However if life is plotted against a function of strain energy, the biaxial life of both polymers increases for a given energy...|$|R

For this behaviour the non-abelian behaviour of the gauge group is essential.|$|R

The grille design was cleaned up, and the tail lights were changed to match the new aerodynamic look of the grille. Side marker lights changed from the flush mounted side markers to the surface-mounted units that were adopted across the entire Chrysler line-up for the 1972 model year. The optional bumper guards for 1972 included a rubber strip surrounding the tail lights and a <b>rubber</b> strip <b>below</b> the grille. The big differences came in the cutting back of performance options for the car. The suspension, rear axle ratios (a 3:55 ratio was the tallest available), and most noticeably the engines changed, with the big-block 383 being replaced by a larger-bore (and lower performance) 400 CID version as the standard engine. The small-block 340 CID {{as well as the}} performance version of the 440 CID engine (with a 4-barrel carburetor, performance camshaft, and dual exhausts) were also available, and for the last time a 4-speed manual transmission could be paired with any of the three engines. All of the engines suffered a drop in compression ratios to allow use of low-lead/no-lead gas and to meet the first round of emissions regulations. The [...] 440 engine was the basis for the Road Runner GTX (the GTX was no longer a separate model) and was available on Road Runners from 1972 to 1974. The 1971-72 Road Runner sheetmetal was used by several NASCAR racing teams for their racecars and ran well on the circuit during the 1971-74 seasons. Richard Petty won the championship both in 1971 and 1972 using the Road Runner-based cars, winning 30 races over the two seasons.|$|R
2500|$|The major {{differences}} between the two were in the fuselages. The Zögling had a very simple open frame girder fuselage, the Prüfling a more conventional hexagonal cross section, wood framed structure, ply covered forward from under the wing and fabric covered aft. The wing was supported over the fuselage with a pair of parallel lift struts on each side, bracing it at almost mid-span at the spars to the lower fuselage longerons. The open cockpit was below the wing centre section which was supported by two pairs of cabane struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The forward pair, placed {{just in front of the}} cockpit were single, upright struts but the rear ones, just behind, were each an inverted V-pair. [...] At the centre there was a noticeable gap between the wings, bridged by a short chord wooden link. [...] The horizontal tail was positioned on the upper longerons. with a triangular fin carrying an upright, straight edged balanced rudder which was slightly angled below the heel and extended down to the keel. The Prüfling landed on a <b>rubber</b> sprung skid <b>below</b> the whole forward, ply skinned fuselage, assisted by a very small tailskid.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the export performance of rubber sector in Malaysia. Thus according to Ministry of International Trade stated that Malaysia expects to maintain its position as the world's leading producer and exporter of natural rubber gloves catherers and latex thread in 2005. Moreover, demand for rubber product is expected to increase further, {{as a result of the}} projected growth in the electrical and electronics and automotive industries. The objective of this study is to examine the export performance of the five types of rubber which are the natural rubber, synthetic rubber, material of rubber, rubber tire and article of rubber from the year 2000 to 2006. Beside that this study also aims to study the trend of export of rubber. There are two methods of data analysis used in this study; the trend analysis and the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) that provides a rough indicator of the strength of a product in terms of its comparative advantage in the world export market relative to others. This method consists of net export/total trade ratio and export performance ratio. For the trend analysis, researchers found out that the fluctuation happens on each types of rubber during the period of export performance. In addition, the trend also shows that the export and total trade of rubber are consistent. Among the five types of rubber trend, the natural rubber shows the highest increase in total trade and export from the year 2000 to 2006, which is from 2, 913, 933 to 2, 332, 113. This is followed by the material of rubber, synthetic rubber, article of rubber and rubber tire. Referring to the total trade/ net export, it is learnt that the material of rubber has the highest ratio. On the other hand, by using the export performance ratio, the result shows that the article rubber has the highest ratio, where the ratio of the natural rubber and the material <b>rubber</b> are <b>below</b> than one...|$|R
