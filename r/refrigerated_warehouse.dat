2500|$|Soon, {{the demand}} for cocaine was skyrocketing in the United States, and Escobar {{organized}} more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, {{and other parts of}} the country. He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the Bahamas, an island called Norman's Cay about [...] southeast of the Florida coast. According to his brother, Escobar did not purchase Norman's Cay; it was, instead, a sole venture of Lehder's. Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a [...] airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouse</b> to store the cocaine. From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medellín Cartel. With the enormous profits generated by this route, Escobar was soon able to purchase [...] of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the Hacienda Nápoles. The luxury house he created contained a zoo, a lake, a sculpture garden, a private bullring, and other diversions for his family and the cartel.|$|E

40|$|Industrial <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses</b> that {{implemented}} {{energy efficiency}} measures and have centralized control {{systems can be}} excellent candidates for Automated Demand Response (Auto-DR) due to equipment synergies, and receptivity of facility managers to strategies that control energy costs without disrupting facility operations. Auto-DR utilizes OpenADR protocol for continuous and open communication signals over internet, allowing facilities to automate their Demand Response (DR). <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses</b> were selected for research because: They have significant power demand especially during utility peak periods; most processes are not sensitive to short-term (2 - 4 hours) lower power and DR activities are often not disruptive to facility operations; the number of processes is limited and well understood; and past experience with some DR strategies successful in commercial buildings may apply to <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses.</b> This paper presents {{an overview of the}} potential for load sheds and shifts from baseline electricity use in response to DR events, along with physical configurations and operating characteristics of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses.</b> Analysis of data from two case studies and nine facilities in Pacific Gas and Electric territory, confirmed the DR abilities inherent to <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses</b> but showed significant variation across facilities. Further, while load from California's <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses</b> in 2008 was 360 MW with estimated DR potential of 45 - 90 MW, actual achieved was much less due to low participation. Efforts to overcome barriers to increased participation may include, improved marketing and recruitment of potential DR sites, better alignment and emphasis on financial benefits of participation, and use of Auto-DR to increase consistency of participation...|$|R

50|$|PEM fuel-cell-powered forklifts provide {{benefits}} over petroleum powered forklifts as {{they produce}} no local emissions.

Fuel cell power efficiency (40-50%) {{is about half}} that of lithium-ion batteries (80-90%), {{but they have a}} higher energy density which may allow forklifts to run longer. Fuel-cell-powered forklifts are often used in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>warehouses</b> as their performance is not as affected by temperature as some types of lithium batteries. Most fuel cells used for material handling purposes are powered by PEM fuel cells, although some DMFC forklifts are coming onto the market.
