5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves <b>Registration</b> <b>and</b> Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave <b>registration</b> <b>and</b> began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter <b>registration</b> <b>and</b> electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Most of Denmark's top legal {{courts and}} {{institutions}} {{are based in}} Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (Københavns Byret), {{it is the largest}} of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør and Tårnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a <b>Registration</b> <b>and</b> Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (Sø- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (Højesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins Jørgens Gård in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.|$|E
5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through a third party, a domain name registrar. The {{relationship}} between Norid, the registrar and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. The registrar registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per <b>registration</b> <b>and</b> change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E

The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
