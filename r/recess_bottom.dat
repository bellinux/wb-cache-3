40|$|Abstract. Calculation of stress-deformed {{states of}} high {{pressure}} apparatus (HPA) of “anvils with recesses ” type for sintering of nanomaterials is realized by {{finite element analysis}} (FEA). At first three general regimes of HPA: “assembly”, “loading ” and “unloading ” are considered together. It is shown, that in certain zones of HPA hard alloy anvils arisen stresses {{as a result of}} pressure difference in the interior and from the outside of the apparatus are higher at the apparatus unloading than at the apparatus loading. At loading and unloading of HPA tensile stresses riches the maximal values at the edge of trapezoidal <b>recess</b> <b>bottom</b> of an-vil. At this place the destruction probability is high.

50|$|A bench joiner {{will need}} to be aware of the correct {{procedure}} for assembly of this type of door. Firstly he will glue and wedge the rails to the meeting stiles and then join the two meeting stiles together with the folding wedges, the through top rail and the metal bar <b>recessed</b> into the <b>bottom</b> of the door. Then the panels are slid into their places from the outsides. Of course he will follow good practice when inserting the panels, he will ensure that there is no glue in the groove that will stick the panels to the groove thus allowing the panels to move independently of the rails and stiles so they will not split as the door shrinks or expands. If the door is to be polished he will ensure that the panels are pre-polished with at least one coat to ensure that no bare wood is shown if the panels shrink. Once the panels are inserted the bench joiner will assemble the outer stiles, cramp and ensure the door is square before wedging up the mortise and tenons of the outer stiles.|$|R
5000|$|Shimano in 1990 {{introduced}} the Shimano Pedaling Dynamics (SPD) range of clipless pedals and matching shoes, specifically {{designed so that}} the shoes {{could be used for}} walking. The shoes have a <b>recess</b> in the <b>bottom</b> of the sole for fitting the smaller cleats and therefore it does not protrude, while conventional clipless road pedals are designed for road cycling shoes which have smooth soles with large protruding cleats, which are awkward for walking. The SPD range, in addition to other off-road refinements, were designed to be used with treaded soles that more closely resemble rugged hiking boots. SPD pedals and shoes soon established themselves as the market standard in this sector, although many other manufacturers have developed alternatives which are arguably less prone to being clogged by mud and/or easier to adjust. However, the SPD dominance in this sector has meant that alternative pedal manufacturers nearly always design their pedals to be usable with Shimano shoes, and likewise mountain bike shoe manufacturers make their shoes [...] "Shimano SPD" [...] compatible. SPD has spawned 2 types of road cleats which are incompatible with standard SPD pedals and some shoes - SPD-R and SPD-SL. SPD-R is a now defunct pedal standard. SPD-SL is basically a copy of the standard Look clipless pedal system. It has a wide, one-sided platform and a triangular cleat that is Look 3-bolt compatible.|$|R
40|$|Waterjet {{propulsion}} of ship {{is based}} on application of 3 rd principle of Newton’s dynamics: „If two bodies mutually interact, their interaction forces are equal {{to each other and}} pointing in opposite directions”. In the waterjet propulsion a crucial role is played by a pump. Located nearby ship’s stern, it takes in water through a <b>recess</b> in ship’s <b>bottom.</b> From outlet of the pump the water is directed under high pressure to a nozzle placed in the ship’s stern. The force pushing out the water from the stern is equal – as to its value – to the force moving the ship in the opposite direction. As to rotate the noz-zle is possible practically by an arbitrary angle the same ship propulsion force can be obtained at any arbitrary position of the nozzle. The ship propulsion force depends on water flow rate at the nozzle outlet. The pump is driven – through the shaft – by a diesel engine (in most applications which have been realized so far) or a gas turbine. The waterjet propulsion may even be of a higher energy efficiency as compared with that of the conventional propulsion (screw propeller), however only in the case if the nozzle, pump and driving engine are properly selected. The steering of waterjet-propelled ship (change of direction of its motion) is effected by an appropriate change of outlet nozzle position. Astern motion is ensured by application of a deflector with the use of which the change of sense of ship propulsion force can be obtained. In general, the waterjet pro-pulsion is considered favourable at the ship speed exceeding 25 knots. However, a correctly designed waterjet propulsion may be competitive against conventional one also at much smaller speeds. The waterjet propulsion extends its application to the recreation ships and sea-going coastal ships of special use. As compared with conventional one the waterjet propulsion has many advantages which are discussed below...|$|R
40|$|Additional thesis - The Maeslant barrier was {{the final}} piece of the Delta works which protects a large area of the Netherlands. However the present barrier seems to fulfil his function, several Dutch experts have doubts about the system. However the {{discussion}} on the Maeslant barrier not being safe enough refers mostly to future scenarios. Experts expect that the barrier already will not provide enough protection from storm surges as of 2070. The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate an alternative solution for the upgrading of the existing Maeslant barrier {{in order to make it}} more reliable for the future. The two functional requirements that all future solutions must fulfil are assuring enough safety against storm surges and providing enough navigation space for ships. The new waterway has to be accessible at any time during normal conditions. For the hydraulic boundary conditions future water levels are taken into account by implying the most extreme Deltascenario steem. In a variant study four different designs are worked out. Design A introduces a solution with navigation locks. This solution closes of the new waterway entirely which can be an advantage for safety reasons but also a disadvantage in terms of navigation. The second design consist of an inflatable rubber barrier like the Ramspol barrier. The mode of operation and in terms of maintenance the inflatable barrier has a lot of advantages, two of the biggest disadvantages are however the tension forces and stresses in the membrane and the fact that the dimensions exceed the largest inflatable rubber barrier by the triple. Design C consist of a new barrier with tumble gates either hydraulic or pneumatic. This design was already introduced as one of the alternatives for the existing Maeslant barrier. However these kind of gates are straightforward and simple the disadvantage is that large movable parts are placed under water which makes maintenance work laboured and expensive. The last design consists of several rising sector gates as it has already been built at the Thames in the UK. The dimensions would be in the same range and therefore a lot of the experience could be used for the design. This design however leads to fixed structures within the water way which are a hindrance for navigation. The inflatable barrier is worked out in more detail. After taking a closer look at the biggest inflatable barrier in the world, the Ramspol barrier in the Netherlands, working out general information on inflatable barriers provides the basics for the design of the new Maeslant barrier. Because of the positive experience at the Ramspol barrier a combination of water and air was chosen to be the filling material. A purely air filled barrier leads to high tension forces in the membrane that exceed the bearing capacity. By using factors between the crest-height and the base width of the clamping lines and the crest-height and the circumferential length of the membrane based on the Ramspol barrier, the initial parameters for the new Maeslant barrier could be calculated using a crest-height of 22 meters. From that an iterative calculation process using a excel spread sheet calculates the shape, the internal air pressure and tension force in the membrane. First results than lead to an inflatable rubber barrier with a crest-height of 22. 55 m, an internal air pressure of 0. 6 bar and a tension force of 730 kN/m 2. Optimizing the structure leady to a final design with a smaller base width, slightly longer circumferential length, lower tension force and internal air pressure and a higher crestheight. Using the calculated tension force the horizontal and vertical clamping forces are calculated and can be used to design the clamping lines and the foundation. The foundation also includes the <b>bottom</b> <b>recess</b> where the membrane is stored in the deflated situation. The membrane fits exactly over the ribs created by conveyors to facilitate the horizontal transport. The membrane will then be held in place by applying an under-pressure in the membrane.
