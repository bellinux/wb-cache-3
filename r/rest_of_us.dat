All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C.

40|$|Background The adult smoking {{prevalence}} {{has declined}} more in California than the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> {{in the past}} 2 decades. Further, California has faster declines in cancer mortality, lung cancer incidence and heart disease mortality. However, no study has examined smoking-related cancer mortality between California and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US.</b> Methods The smoking-attributable cancer mortality rate (SACMR) from 1979 to 2005 in California and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> are calculated among men and women 35 {{years of age or}} older using the Joinpoint regression model to calculate the SACMR annual percentage change. The SACMR is the sum of the smoking-attributable death rates of 10 smoking-attributable cancers. Results The SACMR has declined more in California (25. 7 %) than the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> (8. 9 %) from 1979 to 2005. California men had a lower SACMR than the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> over the entire study period, with the difference tripling from 7. 4 % in 1979 to 23. 9 % in 2005. The difference of female SACMR between California and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> went from 17. 9 % higher in 1979 to 13. 4 % lower in 2005. Conclusions California’s SACMR decrease started 7 years earlier than the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> (1984 vs 1991), and California experienced an accelerated decline of SACMR compared to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> overall and among men and women from 1979 to 2005.

25|$|Many other figures, like a {{great part}} of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, Menelaus, and the {{historical}} pugilist Cleomedes of Astupalaea, were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a later invention, which, although influential, never had a breakthrough in the Greek world. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, traditional Greek believers maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> we could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead souls.|$|E
