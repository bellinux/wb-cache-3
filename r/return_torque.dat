25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system. The system will make the car 100% rear wheel drive when driving at a steady speed. When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can send up to 50% of torque to the front wheels. When the car's speed becomes steady again, the drivetrain will <b>return</b> <b>torque</b> to the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer torque to the front wheels if the system detects loss of traction. This technology was first used in the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, and has since been used in subsequent Skylines, and other vehicles in Japan and overseas, including the Nissan Bluebird, and Nissan Stagea.|$|E

Both 03 & 04 six-speed manual models {{had the option of}} Brembo brakes and the Performance Tire and Wheel Package. On the 2005 coupes, three new colors, Athens Blue, Lakeshore Slate, and Serengeti Sand, replaced Twilight Blue, Caribbean Blue, and Desert Platinum respectively; also, the Willow Cloth interior option was removed, and Stone leather became available.|$|E
5000|$|However, that {{an engine}} [...] "pulls hard" [...] {{all the way}} to its redline and running the engine to the redline before {{shifting}} does not automatically guarantee maximum performance and efficiency. Tachometer redlines generally indicate the maximum safe operating speed of the engine, rather than their peak efficiency and power production speed. Engine and chassis dynamometer testing nearly always reveals decreasing <b>returns</b> in <b>torque</b> and horsepower as an engine nears its redline, as volumetric efficiency and parasitic loads result in diminishing returns relative to fuel and air consumed. Engine builders and tuners strive for maximum area [...] "under the curve", referring to the horsepower curve resulting from engine testing. Horsepower is the rate at which an engine is performing work rather than a measurement of an engine's actual power output at a given time, which is actually indicated by torque, or the twisting force available at the crankshaft. Torque is what performs the actual work, and high torque output over a large [...] "power band" [...] indicates better engine [...] "balance" [...] and tuning.|$|R

He releases her, and helps her get a boat to Carnate where she plans to search for her husband and children. He is then ambushed by Foundation soldiers. However, a truck driven by Jordan rescues him. She explains her men have betrayed her, and are working directly for Blackmore, who has been funding the Foundation for years. She is taking him to Eastern Correctional, Blackmore's location.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2014, The TU250X placed {{fifth in}} a five bike {{comparison}} by Motorcycle.com, against the Yamaha SR400 (Japan-built), Suzuki GW250 (China-built), Royal Enfield Continental GT (India-built), and Honda CB300F (Thailand-built). The reviewer noted the TU's engine developed 14.8 hp @ 7300rpm with 11.5 lb-ft of <b>torque,</b> <b>returning</b> 67mpg. The reviewer said [...] "the elegantly styled retro bike is overwhelmingly competent in many areas. Four {{of the five}} testers gave it favorable reviews", adding “it does everything it’s meant to do - turn, brake, accelerate - with unquestionable proficiency. For the novice, especially one who is slight in stature, the TU is simply the best bike on which {{to learn how to}} ride a motorcycle.” ...|$|R

However, Blackmore leaves, compelling Torque to follow him. [...] They <b>return</b> to where <b>Torque</b> grew up; Garvey Children's Home. Inside, Torque remembers meeting Blackmore {{for the first}} time. However, in his memory, Blackmore is an adult, Torque is a child, {{and none of the}} staff can see or hear Blackmore. Blackmore then confronts Torque, telling him that the ties that bind them can never be cut. Torque realizes the truth - Blackmore is not real, he is Torque's alter ego. When Torque blacks out, Blackmore's personality takes over, but now, Blackmore wants to be in control all the time; [...] "we've only got the one body, and I'm tired of sharing." [...] He transforms into a monster, and he and Torque fight, with Torque defeating him. Blackmore disappears, and Torque is approached by Carmen, who tells him [...] "I never want us to be apart again." ...|$|R
40|$|Topography exerts a {{profound}} {{influence on the}} large-scale circulation of western boundary and circumpolar currents. Flow over variable topography generates topographical torques (bottom pressure torques) which can drive meridional flows and indirectly influence the internal structure. The role of topography, and in particular that of bottom pressure torques, on idealised, wind-driven gyre and channel models is investigated. In gyre models with sloping side-walls, the wind-driven transport is returned across latitude lines by bottom pressure torques, while friction is important in altering potential vorticity (PV) within an isopycnal layer and allowing a closed circulation. In the channel model zonal jets develop at latitudes where the topography does not reach the surface. Bottom pressure torques again drive meridional flows along topography. These bottom pressure <b>torques</b> <b>return</b> the wind-driven flow along western boundaries as in the gyre models, and can act to transfer vorticity from the wind-driven gyres into zonal jets. Through steering the depth-integrated flow, the topography influences the frictional torques in the layer, and hence the location and relative magnitudes of the PV sources. Differences in these sources can lead to regional differences in the homogenised P...|$|R

Molecular modeling is a vital component for structure-based drug design. Currently implemented technology combines data and graphics to give the user visual capabilities to assist in discovering possible binding arrangements. Visual modeling has become a tremendous help to scientists in reducing the amount of time needed to create new inhibitory compounds. However, the visual medium used for modeling lacks the ability to convey the forces between the molecules to the user. Potentially, tactile feedback can provide this missing information. SensAble Devices has developed a device capable of producing force feedback to a user-defined environment called the PHANToM, The PHANToM is a 6 dimensional (3 translational and 3 rotational) haptic device that can <b>return</b> force and <b>torque</b> to the user through a hand held stylus. The system configuration for molecular modeling consists of integrating the haptic device with a high-end PC running Windows NT and developing code to model the intermolecular forces. The programming language used was C with some C++ constructs and the OpenGL graphics library for the graphics implementation. The optimized code running with the system has proven capable of calculating and relaying tactile feedback between a 100 -atom active site of a protein and a small 15 -atom inhibitor in real time (ca. 1 millisecond). Trials are now underway on the system to evaluate accuracy and explore other forms of useful output. Once this is accomplished, modeling will be done on an active site and an untested inhibitor to evaluate novel binding modes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of an initial bout of eccentric or concentric actions and a subsequent bout of eccentric actions on muscular strength. Twenty-four healthy males, 24 - 45 yr old, were placed in three groups that performed eccentric actions in bouts 1 and 2 (ECC/ECC, N = 8), concentric actions in bout 1, and eccentric actions in bout 2 (CON/ECC, N = 8) or served as controls (N = 8). Bouts involved unilateral actions with {{the left and right}} quadriceps femoris. Ten sets of 10 repetitions with an initial resistance equal to 85 % of the eccentric or concentric one repetition maximum (1 RM) were performed for each bout. Three minutes of rest were given between sets and 3 wk between bouts. Two weeks before bout 1 and 1, 4, 7, and 10 d after bouts 1 and 2, eccentric and concentric 1 RM were measured for the right quadriceps femoris and a speed-torque relation established for the left quadriceps femoris. Eccentric and concentric 1 RM decreased (P less than 0. 05) 32 % 1 d after bout 1 for group ECC/ECC. The speed-torque relation was down-shifted (P less than 0. 05) 38 %. Eccentric 1 RM and eccentric and isometric <b>torque</b> <b>returned</b> to normal 6 d later. Concentric 1 RM and torque at 3. 14 rad-s(exp - 1) had not recovered on day 10 (- 7 % for both, P less than 0. 05). Decreases in strength after bout 2 for group ECC/ECC only occurred on day 1 (- 9 % for concentric 1 RM and 16 % downshift of the speed- torque relation). Group CONIECC showed the opposite responses; marked decreases in strength after bout 2 but not bout 1. The results indicate that the initial decrease in strength after performance of a novel bout of eccentric exercise is comparable for eccentric, concentric and isometric muscle actions. Recovery of strength, however, appears to occur more rapidly for eccentric and isometric actions. They suggest that performance of a prior bout of eccentric but not concentric actions, as done in this study, can essentially eradicate decreases in strength after a subsequent bout of eccentric exercise. It is suggested that neural factors are, in part, responsible for adaptations to eccentric exercise...|$|R
