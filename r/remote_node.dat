50|$|In computing, {{traceroute}} is {{a computer}} network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

An access from a <b>remote</b> <b>node</b> may cause that data to migrate. Compared to NUMA, this reduces the number of redundant copies and may allow more efficient use of the memory resources. On the other hand, it raises problems of {{how to find a}} particular data (there is no longer a home node) and what to do if a local memory fills up (migrating some data into the local memory then needs to evict some other data, which doesn't have a home to go to).

Such compression can reduce the accuracy of centrally run automated object tracking algorithms.

We propose a tracking-aware, H. 264 -compliant compression algorithm that removes temporal components of low tracking interest and optimizes the quantization of frequency coefficients, particularly those that most influence trackers, significantly reducing bitrate while maintaining comparable tracking accuracy. We utilize tracking accuracy as our compression criterion in lieu of mean squared error metrics. Our proposed system is designed with low processing power and memory requirements in mind, and as such can be deployed on <b>remote</b> <b>nodes.</b> Using H. 264 /AVC video coding and a commonly used state-of-the-art tracker we show that our algorithm allows for over 90 bitrate savings while maintaining comparable tracking accuracy...|$|R
