40|$|In southeastern Alaska, the {{collision}} of the Yakutat microplate with North America has led to uplift of the highest costal mountain range in the world, the Chugach and St. Elias Mountains. Once uplift of the ranges produced sufficient topography to intercept precipitation sourced from the Gulf of Alaska, glaciation on the margin was initiated. The margin now presents a unique area to study the interactions between tectonics and climate driven processes. The area of maximum uplift and exhumation is termed the southeastern Alaskan syntaxis, and is characterized by complicated patterns of deformation and sedimentation in an offshore basin. This study presents a two dimensional compressional velocity model that helps to constrain patterns of deformation offshore of the syntaxis. The velocity model is also interpreted {{in conjunction with a}} coincident seismic <b>reflection</b> <b>line</b> in order to characterize Cenozoic sediment packages at depth and better understand the evolution of a tectonically active glaciated margin. The study is able to constrain the front of lateral compaction due to porosity loss to a narrow band between the Malaspina Fault and Yakutat Bay, as well as the offshore location of the pinch out of the Poul Creek Formation. Interpretation of the seismic <b>reflection</b> <b>line</b> reveals transitions in sediment depositional processes, depocenters, and sources in the central Yakutat shelf over time, particularly the transition to the Malaspina Glacier as the major sediment source in the area.

Over this ramp, the overthrusting sediments form a fault-bend fold on which ODP Site 808 is located. The spacing of the first three thrusts at the toe of the prism is approximately 1. 5 - 1. 7 km. Thrust spacing decreases arcward to less than 1 km as horizontal shortening progresses.

The MCS data reveal a 1. 2 -km-high fault scarp associated with a 20 -km-wide arcward-tilted block in the mid-forearc; these features indicate large-scale gravitational collapse, and earthquake data are consistent with trench-normal extension at shallow depth in this area. There is, however, little evidence of distributed extension within the interior of the Sandwich plate. The MCS data show a small frontal wedge that achieves its maximum thickness only 18 km from the trench. Backarc magnetic data, mid-forearc extension, and the small size of the frontal wedge are all consistent with long-term and ongoing subduction erosion. Earthquake data suggest that this erosion is taking place in an environment of low interplate stress. ...|$|E
40|$|Amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) {{analysis}} of a seismic <b>reflection</b> <b>line,</b> imaged 13 km from Russell Glacier terminus, near the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), suggests the presence of sediment at the bed. The analysis was complicated {{by the lack of}} identifiable multiples in the data due to a highly irregular and crevassed ice surface, rendering deeper seismic returns noisy. A modified technique for AVA processing of glacial seismic data using forward modelling with primary reflection amplitudes and simulated multiple amplitudes is presented here. Our analysis demonstrates that AVA analysis can be applied to areas with noisy seismic returns and indicates that sediment underlies the seismic study site. Our data are inconsistent with the common assumption that the GrIS is underlain only by hard bedrock, but consistent with the presence of subglacial sediment with porosity between 30 % and 40 %. As analysis and modelling of ice-sheet dynamics requires a sound knowledge of the underlying basal materials, subglacial sediment should be taken into account when considering ice dynamics in this region of the GrIS.
