In 1986, she returned to vision <b>research,</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> to University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI). She worked {{on the role of}} colour in flight simulation displays for the Air Force Human Resources Lab at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona (e.g., Howard, 1992; Howard, 1994; Howard, 1996). Her work on the dim light available from early color displays led her to participate in the Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) division on mesopic photometry (e.g., Howard, 1997). She also completed research on the relation between the McCollough effect and global pattern-processing (McCollough, 2000).|$|E
50|$|Between 1951 and 1955 Cessna used {{modifications}} of the 170 and its derivative, the U.S. Army L-19, as test beds for Boundary layer control <b>research,</b> <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> to the Office of Naval Research and the Army Transportation Corps,designating {{them as the}} models 309 and 319. The project was done {{in conjunction with the}} University of Wichita which conducted extensive wind tunnel tests of the concept. The model 309 utilized the German World War II Arado lift-increasing system in which a jet pump inside the wing sucked in stagnant air from the flap area, energized it and blew the higher-speed air over the ailerons. Various chemicals and enhancements were used to power the jet pump. Better results were obtained by departing from the Arado jet pump method and using an engine-driven generator to power electric motors driving axial fans to move the internal air. This concept was adopted on the Model 319 but substituted an engine-driven hydraulic pump to drive hydraulic-powered axial fans. This model was more successful and resulted in the highest lift capacity, as measured by the maximum lift coefficient recorded up to that time. The 319 demonstrated the capability of taking off in 190 ft, landing in 160 ft and clearing a 50 ft obstacle in 450 ft. The aircraft had a stall speed of 28 kn.The 309 and 319 were meant to be research aircraft only, and no plans were developed to incorporate boundary layer control technology in then-current Cessna models. An adaptation of the concept, used only to improve landing performance, was incorporated in U.S. Cold War fighter aircraft like the United States Air Force Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the multi-service McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to the verification of a multi-process program consisting of a fixed but unbounded number of processes executing an identical program. The approach is illustrated on an algorithm for mutual exclusion that contains tests that refer to many shared variables at the same time. We analyze the algorithm first {{under the assumption that}} these tests are atomic. We then consider the more realistic assumption that they are molecular, i. e. performed by several steps, each reading a single shared variable. We show that the algorithm is correct only for the limited implementation in which the variables are checked in ascending order of indices.
