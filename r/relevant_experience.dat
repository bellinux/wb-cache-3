5|$|In Westminster, {{the three}} {{government}} departments {{concerned with the}} British role in Sierra Leone—the MoD, the FCO, and DfID—struggled {{to agree on the}} objectives of the military deployment beyond the evacuation, which led to delays in issuing orders. Richards did not receive precise instructions until after Operation Palliser had commenced, and rules of engagement (ROEs) were not issued {{before the start of the}} operation. Commanders defaulted to the ROEs used in Northern Ireland, their most recent <b>relevant</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} lacked governmental or institutional support, and {{relied on}} private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, Nimrod, {{was less than}} half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott's 1901–04 expedition ship Discovery, and Shackleton's crew lacked <b>relevant</b> <b>experience.</b> Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound, close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson, carried out extensive geological, zoological and meteorological work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on Manchurian ponies, motor traction, and sled dogs, were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.|$|E

500|$|In May 1966, Raw {{was posted}} to South Vietnam {{as the air}} support {{commander}} for the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF). This force was composed primarily of Australian Army units, and had recently arrived in the country {{as part of an}} expansion of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. Although he did not have any background in air/land warfare, Raw's main responsibility in this position was to coordinate helicopter support for the task force's two infantry battalions. He was given only two weeks to prepare for the role between handing over command of No. 82 Wing and departing for South Vietnam; during this period he received briefings on the situation in the country and began to familiarise himself with the operations of the RAAF's tactical transport units. Historian Alan Stephens has written that [...] "Group Captain Raw's background as one of the RAAF's most respected bomber leaders was inappropriate for the job of task force air commander: too often he struggled to make the timely decisions demanded by tactical air/land operations". Stephens has also stated that the RAAF's Air Board should have selected an officer with more <b>relevant</b> <b>experience</b> for the role.|$|E

500|$|On the {{programming}} front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by [...] physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The {{program was a}} new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, [...] "dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code." [...] Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of <b>relevant</b> <b>experience</b> to his work—he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments. In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performers—Mercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network {{for more than a}} decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of The Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston. He played the part anonymously at first. But, as one chronicler put it, [...] "nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long." ...|$|E

40|$|Through a {{comparison}} of the life and career trajectories of thirty male and thirty female CEOs of large organizations, this study offers insights into the genesis of gender disparity in corporate leadership positions, discusses the implications for leadership development, and puts forward a model explaining the disparity in CEO roles. We found gendered patterns in the accumulation of career <b>relevant</b> <b>experiences</b> stretching back to birth into working lives that created significant and cumulative limitations upon the ability of women to access CEO roles and the types of CEO appointments available to them. Limited access to career <b>relevant</b> <b>experiences</b> in childhood, adolescence and in organizations lead to on-going limitations in capital accumulation throughout women 2 ̆ 7 s careers. Implications of our findings for both theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
2500|$|On {{revealing}} the individual salaries of the appointees, the government faced further {{questions about the}} apparent lack of <b>relevant</b> <b>experience</b> of some appointees. Citing the example of Paul Chan, reportedly earning between HK$20,000 and 30,000 , Liberal Party leader James Tien said it was [...] "unreasonable {{to see that he}} will be earning at least $130,000." [...] Democrats continued to pressure the government for information on its precise selection standards and how it scored the new appointees, and the factors determining their pay; CEO of CLP Group, and Chairman of Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, Andrew Brandler, said the government should have been transparent from the outset.|$|E
2500|$|Consider some {{subtleties}} {{that people}} are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than <b>relevant</b> <b>experience.</b> As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to [...] "negative data," [...] information about what does not occur.|$|E
2500|$|He concluded: [...] The {{record in}} this {{litigation}} documents a process that, at the outset, {{had the potential}} to produce a testing procedure that was true to the promise of Title VII: No individual should face workplace discrimination based on race. Respondents thought about promotion qualifications and <b>relevant</b> <b>experience</b> in neutral ways. They were careful to ensure broad racial participation {{in the design of the}} test itself and its administration. As we have discussed at length, the process was open and fair. [...] The problem, of course, is that after the tests were completed, the raw racial results became the predominant rationale for the City's refusal to certify the results. The injury arises in part from the high, and justified, expectations of the candidates who had participated in the testing process on the terms the City had established for the promotional process. Many of the candidates had studied for months, at considerable personal and financial expense, and thus the injury caused by the City's reliance on raw racial statistics at the end of the process was all the more severe. Confronted with arguments both for and against certifying the test results— and threats of a lawsuit either way— the City was required to make a difficult inquiry. But its hearings produced no strong evidence of a disparate-impact violation, and the City was not entitled to disregard the tests based solely on the racial disparity in the results.|$|E
