5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapy</b> (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world.

The analysis of therapy results showed that antibioticsfree treatment of watery diarrhea patients worked well, and prescription of antibacterial therapy for the concomitant bacterial infection does not influence the time of gastroenteritis reduction. The results of dehydration therapy show that oral rehydration is not always effective for the 2 nd stage dehydration, especially with late treatment.

40|$|Therapeutic {{management}} of childhood diarrhea {{had led to}} {{a significant decrease in}} diarrhea related morbidity and mortality. However, diarrhea diseases remain one of the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, especially in children under 5 years. The work presented in this dissertation intended to evaluate the current the {{management of}} childhood diarrhea, to identify the major gaps in the management and introduce a novel approach to address these gaps. First, an assessment of oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapies</b> (ORT) coverage in the management of childhood diarrhea is performed to evaluate healthcare providers’ prescriptive practices of ORT in South Asia. Next, we assess the effect of breastfeeding cessation in reported episodes of diarrhea using a national database. The study highlighted suboptimal breastfeeding practices among American mothers who participated in the study and its impact on reported onset of diarrhea episodes in infants during their first year of life. The results show that breastfeeding cessation before the first 6 months is a significant predictor of diarrhea between 7 and 12 months. Lastly, sensitivity of a diarrheagenic pathogen identification tool was tested in two laboratory simulated environments. Despite the limitation of the experiments, the study offers insight of the tool’s properties under specific environment, guiding future optimization. The manuscripts comprised in this dissertation provide evidence for the need to re-evaluate the use of therapies known to be effective and to conduct future research in innovative approach to the management of childhood diarrhea...|$|R
40|$|Background For {{children}} worldwide, diarrhea is {{the second}} leading cause of death. These deaths are preventable by fluid resuscitation. Nasogastric tubes (NGs) {{have been shown to}} be equivalent to intravenous fluids for rehydration and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in severe dehydration. Despite this, NGs are rarely used for rehydration in Kenya. Our objective was to evaluate clinicians’ adherence to rehydration guidelines and to identify barriers to the use of NGs for resuscitating dehydrated children. Methods A case-based structured survey was administered to pediatric care providers in western Kenya to determine their choices for alternative <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapies</b> when oral <b>rehydration</b> and intravenous fluids fail. Providers then participated in a qualitative, semi-structured interview to identify barriers to using nasogastric tubes for rehydration. Analysis included manual, progressive coding of interview transcripts to identify emerging central themes. Results Of 44 participants, only four (9 %) followed WHO guidelines that recommend quickly switching to NG for rehydration in their case responses. Participants identified that placing intravenous lines in dehydrated children is a challenge. However, when discussing NG use, many believed NGs are not effective for rehydration. Other participants’ concerns surrounded knowledge and training regarding guidelines as well as not having NGs available. Discussion Healthcare providers in western Kenya do not report using NGs for rehydration in accordance with WHO guidelines for diarrheal illness with severe dehydration. Barriers to the use of NG tubes were lack of knowledge and availability. Education and implementation of guidelines using NG tubes for rehydration may improve outcomes of children suffering from diarrheal illness with severe dehydration...|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{the cross}} of βENaC-Tg mice with NE−/− mice {{demonstrates}} that NE is {{implicated in the}} in vivo pathogenesis of several key features of CF-like lung disease including the modulation of neutrophilic airway inflammation, induction of goblet cell metaplasia and mucin hypersecretion, and structural lung damage [15]. Further, whole-genome expression profiling as an unbiased bottom-up approach led to the identification of MMP 12 released from activated macrophages as an important contributor to tissue damage in CF-like lung disease [52]. Importantly, genetic deletion of NE and MMP 12 did not exacerbate spontaneous airway infection in βENaC-Tg mice. These data support that these proteases are promising targets for novel anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective therapies in CF. Interestingly, localization of protease activity with sensitive FRET reporters showed that the activities of both NE and MMP 12 are invariably increased {{on the surface of}} activated neutrophils and macrophages, respectively, even under conditions when “free” activity of these secreted proteases is absorbed by an intact antiprotease shield [15, 52]. These results suggest that membrane-bound protease activity may {{play a critical role in}} airway damage and that NE and MMP 12 may have to be inhibited at the surface of inflammatory cells to achieve maximal therapeutic effects. In this context, translational studies in clinical specimens (BAL and sputum) from patients with CF indicate that lipidated FRET reporters designed to measure protease activity at the surface of inflammatory cells, such as NEmo- 2 and LaRee- 1 [11, 16], may be sensitive novel tools to identify CF patients with the greatest risk to develop severe lung damage. However, additional studies in a larger number of patients that address the relationship with clinical indices of lung disease severity, such as lung function and imaging endpoints, will be required to determine the value of membrane-bound protease activity as an inflammation biomarker in CF and potentially other neutrophilic airway diseases. Of note, studies in βENaC-Tg mice also demonstrated that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NE and MMP 12 does not prevent dehydration-induced airway mucus plugging in vivo indicating that additional <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapies</b> such as osmolytes [19] or modulators of epithelial ion channels including CFTR, ENaC, or alternative Cl− channels [33] may be required for effective treatment of airway mucus plugging in CF.|$|R
25|$|In {{many cases}} of diarrhea, {{replacing}} lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapy</b> – or, in severe cases, intravenously. Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research {{does not support the}} limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea. To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning. CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat.|$|E
25|$|A further {{significant}} finding of Preston's {{study was that}} the curve has shifted upwards during the 20th century. This means that life expectancy has increased in most countries, independently of changes in income. Preston credited education, better technology, vaccinations, improved provision of public health services, oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapy</b> and better nutrition with these exogenous improvements in health. According to Preston, the independent increases in life expectancy have been greatest in the poor countries, although he also believed that {{a good portion of}} the potential gains from better medical technology have not been realized. Several poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have actually seen declines in life expectancy in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even if their per capita incomes have increased during this time.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} rehydrating {{a severely}} undernourished {{child who has}} diarrhea relatively slowly. The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called oral rehydration solution (ORS). The oral rehydration solution is both slightly sweet and slightly salty and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium. Fluids by nasogastric tube may be use in {{those who do not}} drink. Intravenous fluids are recommended only in those who have significant dehydration due to their potential complications. These complications include congestive heart failure. Over time, ORS developed into ORT, or oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapy,</b> which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{cardiac arrest}} due to {{pulseless}} electrical activity has a poor outcome, except when reversible {{factors such as}} acute hyperkalaemia are identified and managed early. Hyperosmolar diabetic non-ketotic coma may lead to acute hyperkalaemia. Hyperosmolar diabetic non-ketotic coma is a metabolic emergency usually seen in elderly non-insulin dependent diabetics, characterized by severe hyperglycaemia, volume depletion, altered consciousness, confusion and less frequently neurological deficit. Cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack may be mistakenly diagnosed, particularly if the patient has no history of diabetes mellitus. Delays in diagnosis and management of glycaemic emergencies presenting as a constellation of neurological abnormalities can be avoided by routine early measurement of blood glucose. Hyperosmolar diabetic non-ketotic coma {{should be considered in}} any patient with altered consciousness or neurologic deficit in conjunction with hyperglycaemia. As hyperosmolar diabetic non-ketotic coma results in severe fluid depletion, electrolyte disturbance, profound hyperglycaemia and an altered mental state, the guiding principles of <b>therapy</b> include aggressive <b>rehydration,</b> insulin <b>therapy,</b> correction of electrolyte abnormalities and treatment of any underlying illnesses.

40|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{diarrhea}} (CID) is {{a common}} side effect of cancer treatment and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Diarrhea is frequently severe enough to require a dose reduction of, a delay in, or a discontinuation of chemotherapy. Diarrheaassociated mortality {{has been reported to}} be as high as 3. 5 % in clinical trials of irinotecan and bolus 5 -fluorouracil in colorectal cancer. The frequency of CID and its impact on patient management are frequently under-recognized in clinical practice. A Canadian working group, consisting of medical oncologists and an oncology pharmacist, was formed in 2001 to review the optimal approach to managing CID and to identify and implement new areas of research. The recommendations that follow are the result of the group’s work. Acute medical management of CID includes loperamide or diphenoxylate as first-line agents. Subcutaneous octreotide is recommended for intractable grade 2 diarrhea and may be considered for grade 1 CID that does not resolve with high-dose loperamide. Hospitalization is recommended for patients with grades 3 and 4 CID; in-hospital care includes <b>rehydration,</b> antibiotic <b>therapy,</b> and octreotide. A chemotherapy dose reduction is generally advised for patients who have experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in a previous chemotherapy cycle. If a dose reduction is not desired, prophylaxis with intramuscular long-acting release octreotide may be considered. The foregoing recommendations are based on expert opinion and require validation in prospective clinical trials...|$|R

25|$|Control of {{outbreaks}} requires coordinated medical services, {{alongside a}} certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes.

40|$|Introduction Leuprolide acetate is a {{synthetic}} analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone {{used for the}} treatment of prostate cancer. Its side effects are hot flashes, nausea, and fatigue. We report a case of a patient with proximal inflammatory myopathy accompanied by severe rhabdomyolysis and renal failure following the second application of leuprolide acetate. Drug withdrawal and steroid therapy resulted in remission within six weeks of the diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, our case report describes the second case of leuprolide acetate-induced inflammatory myopathy and the first case of severe leuprolide acetate-induced rhabdomyolysis and renal failure in the literature. Case presentation A 64 -year-old Swiss Caucasian man was admitted to the hospital because of progressive proximal muscle weakness, dyspnea, and oliguria. He had been treated twice with leuprolide acetate in monthly doses. We performed a muscle biopsy, which excluded other causes of myopathy.

40|$|PURPOSE: Dry eye {{syndrome}} is a multifactorial chronic disabling disease {{mainly caused by}} the functional disruptions in the lacrimal gland. The treatment involves palliation like ocular surface lubrication and <b>rehydration.</b> Cell <b>therapy</b> involving replacement of the gland is a promising alternative for providing long-term relief to patients. This study aimed to establish functionally competent lacrimal gland cultures in-vitro and explore the presence of stem cells in the native gland and the established in-vitro cultures. METHODS: Fresh human lacrimal gland from patients undergoing exenteration was harvested for cultures after IRB approval. The freshly isolated cells were evaluated by flow cytometry for expression of stem cell markers ABCG 2, high ALDH 1 levels and c-kit. Cultures were established on Matrigel, collagen and HAM and the cultured cells evaluated {{for the presence of}} stem cell markers and differentiating markers of epithelial (E-cadherin, EpCAM), mesenchymal (Vimentin, CD 90) and myofibroblastic (α-SMA, S- 100) origin by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. The conditioned media was tested for secretory proteins (scIgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme) post carbachol (100 µM) stimulation by ELISA. RESULTS: Native human lacrimal gland expressed ABCG 2 (mean±SEM: 3. 1 ± 0. 61 %), high ALDH 1 (3. 8 ± 1. 26 %) and c-kit (6. 7 ± 2. 0 %). Lacrimal gland cultures formed a monolayer, in order of preference on Matrigel, collagen and HAM within 15 - 20 days, containing a heterogeneous population of stem-like and differentiated cells. The epithelial cells formed 'spherules' with duct like connections, suggestive of ductal origin. The levels of scIgA (47. 43 to 61. 56 ng/ml), lysozyme (24. 36 to 144. 74 ng/ml) and lactoferrin (32. 45 to 40. 31 ng/ml) in the conditioned media were significantly higher than the negative controls (p< 0. 05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: The study reports the novel finding of establishing functionally competent human lacrimal gland cultures in-vitro. It also provides preliminary data on the presence of stem cells and duct-like cells in the fresh and in-vitro cultured human lacrimal gland. These significant findings could pave way for cell therapy in future...|$|R
40|$|In {{sea turtles}} the {{cervical}} sinus and jugular vein {{is commonly used}} for blood collection and administration of bolus fluid therapy, but placement and maintenance of intravascular catheters in these sites is difficult. In these species radiohumeral venous plexus catheterization is commonly used after a deep cutdown incision in the dorsal surface of the fore flippers. For this painful and stressful procedure, sedation or anaesthesia may be necessary; moreover, these techniques can be dangerous in critically ill patients. In this study the authors describe an atraumatic and easy procedure for placement and maintenance of cephalic vein catheterization {{with the aid of}} ultrasound guidance. The ultrasound examinations were performed with a GE Logiq 400 machine connected to a multifrequency (7 – 11 MHz) linear array transducer with the frequency set at 11 MHz. Turtles were placed on foam-rubber blocks on an operating table; one forelimb was extended and restrained manually. In order to find the cephalic vein, longitudinal and transversal colour doppler ultrasonographic examination of the flipper’s dorsal surface was made, along the caudal margin of the humerus and ulna. Once the vein was located, a needle catheter (20 - 22 gauge, {{depending on the size of}} the animal) was inserted in the skin beneath the ultrasound probe, distoproximal and dorsoventral, inclined at 10 - 15 degrees to skin surface. The catheter’s progress was monitored with ultrasound until successfully inserted into the vein. After placement, the catheter was secured to the skin with a suture (two single surgical stitches with 2 - 0 / 1 - 0 braided polyester or polyamide monofilament), and an injection cap was connected to the catheter hub. When it was necessary to maintain the catheter in situ for an extended period, it was covered and secured with noncompressing self-adhesive elastic bandage that encompassed the flipper. The authors think that an ultrasound guided catheterization of the cephalic vein allows an easy, atraumatic and durable vascular access for drug administration, <b>rehydration</b> and emergency <b>therapy</b> in sea turtles, compared with other previously described techniques...|$|R

40|$|To the Editor, Celiac disease (CD) is {{associated}} with autoimmune disorders and immune deficits, such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [1]. CVID is a heterogeneous group of deficient antibody production diagnosed by well- stated criteria [2]. It may display infectious diarrhea [3] and its association with CD has been controversial, since villous atrophy {{may not always be}} improved by a gluten-free diet (GFD). This aspect has been clarified by Biagi et al who pointed out the possibility that the only suitable tool is the response to GFD [4]. Both CD and CVID show a family inheritance and inducible co-stimulator (ICOS, a genetic polymorphisms invoked for CD) has a crucial role in altered lymphocyte maturation characterizing CVID [5]. Nevertheless, the presence of CD in first-degree relatives of patients affected by CVID has never been detected. Therefore, we believe it is of interest to report the case of a 30 -year young male patient with CD whose sister suffered from CVID. Admitted to our Unit for acute diarrhea and fever, his family history revealed a sister affected by CVID, treated with periodic immunoglobulin replacement. Empiric <b>rehydration</b> and antibiotic <b>therapy</b> (ciprofloxacin 250 mg x 2 /day) induced rapid disappearance of symptoms. Laboratory tests excluded humoral immune deficiency, but showed folate, B 12 vitamin, iron and transferrin saturation deficiency. So, we performed the anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium assay (positive) and upper endoscopy with distal duodenum histology (Marsh grade 3 A CD). A GFD was initiated and six months later laboratory and duodenal histology became normal. Accordingly, we believe that this case could stimulate a better knowledge of the topic. The principal point is the possibility that CD and CVID association may be observed not only in the same subject, but even in two different first-degree relatives. Moreover, it emphasizes some other points. Firstly, patients with CVID could be screened for infectious, immunological causes of gastrointestinal symptoms and CD. In the presence of malabsorption and absence of intestinal infections, a distal duodenal biopsy should be performed. On the other hand, in first-degree relatives of patients with CVID, in the presence of either atypical clinical signs of CD and features of malabsorption, the search for anti-transglutaminase antibodies could be useful. This approach may be interesting to detect inheritance patterns between CD and CVID in a large series of patients...|$|R

Dolhun's goal was to manufacture an oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>therapy</b> more cost-effective than intravenous hydration treatments and that tastes better than existing oral solutions. In 2010, he settled on a formula and began manufacturing. DripDrop partnered with Doctors Outreach Clinic to provide its ORT solution to those affected by the 2010 Pakistan floods.|$|E
