5000|$|Century's roadway {{network is}} highly irregular. It does {{not conform to}} the state of Florida's section, {{township}} and <b>range</b> <b>survey</b> system, for two reasons. The first is because Spanish land grants were issued along the Escambia River in the 16th and 17th centuries. These boundaries established a unique survey system that contorted east-to-west survey boundaries once Florida became a state and a state survey system was adopted, at which time previously existing survey systems were [...] "grandfathered" [...] in. The second reason for an irregular roadway and property boundary system is due to the community originally being built around the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now the CSX railway). Automobile highways were eventually constructed, and closely paralleled the railway. A more modern highway (US 29) was constructed and moved many of the commercial operations west of the small original core of the community (now mostly located within the Alger-Sullivan Lumber Company Residential Historic District).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The small flight-style Delphin AUV is {{designed}} to evaluate {{the performance of a}} long <b>range</b> <b>survey</b> AUV with the additional capability to hover and manoeuvre at slow speed. Delphin’s hull form is based on a scaled version of Autosub 6000, and in addition to the main thruster and control surfaces {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, Delphin is equipped with four rim driven tunnel thrusters. In order to reduce the development cycle time, Delphin was designed to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors and thrusters interfaced to a standard PC motherboard running the control software within the MS Windows environment. To further simplify the development, the autonomy system uses the State-Flow Toolbox within the Matlab/Simulink environment. While the autonomy software is running, image processing routines are used for obstacle avoidance and target tracking, within the commercial Scorpion Vision software. This runs as a parallel thread and passes results to Matlab via the TCP/IP communication protocol. The COTS based development approach has proved effective. However, a powerful PC is required to effectively run Matlab and Simulink, and, due to the nature of the Windows environment, it is impossible to run the control in hard real-time. The autonomy system will be recoded to run under the Matlab Windows Real-Time Windows Target in the near future.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from a galaxy redshift survey provides {{one of the}} most promising methods for probing dark energy. In this paper, we clarify the assumptions that go into the forecasts of dark energy constraints from BAO. We show that assuming a constant nP_{ 0. 2 }/G^ 2 (z) (where P_{ 0. 2 } is the real space galaxy power spectrum at k= 0. 2 h/Mpc and redshift z) gives a good approximation of the observed galaxy number density expected from a realistic flux-limited galaxy redshift survey. We find that assuming nP_{ 0. 2 }/G^ 2 (z) = 10 gives very similar dark energy constraints to assuming nP_{ 0. 2 }= 3, but the latter corresponds to a galaxy number density larger by ~ 70 % at z= 2. We show how the Figure-of-Merit (FoM) for constraining dark energy depends on the assumed galaxy number density, redshift accuracy, redshift <b>range,</b> <b>survey</b> area, and the systematic errors due to calibration and uncertainties in the theory of nonlinear evolution and galaxy biasing. We find that an additive systematic noise of up to 0. 4 - 0. 5 % per dz= 0. 1 redshift slice does not lead to significant decrease in the BAO FoM. Comment: 10 pages, 10 color figures.

40|$|A minor {{field study}} was {{conducted}} with the aim of examining the range forage condition in relation to livestock condition during the dry season (May – August, 1999) in Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA). Two grazing routes were selected for forage <b>range</b> <b>survey</b> and pastoral household communities for fecal sampling and livestock condition. The routes were first Oloirobi – Endulen and secondly Oloirobi – Malanja Depression – Olbalbal routes. The Four households were identified in each route and fecal samples were collected during June – August. From this study, pastoralists identified over 20 forage species as preferred by livestock. On average the percentage chemical composition for the forage sampled were 93. 38, 10. 19, 72. 07 and 71. 60 for DM, CP, IN-VDMD and IN-IOMD respectively. While the mean percentage on mineral composition for K, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, P and Na were 3. 02, 1. 47, 0. 26, 1. 21 and 0. 93 respectively.

40|$|A space-based galaxy {{redshift}} survey {{would have}} enormous power in constraining dark energy and testing general relativity, provided that its parameters are suitably optimized. We study viable space-based galaxy redshift surveys, exploring {{the dependence of}} the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) figure-of-merit (FoM) on redshift accuracy, redshift <b>range,</b> <b>survey</b> area, target selection and forecast method. Fitting formulae are provided for convenience. We also consider the dependence on the information used: the full galaxy power spectrum P(k), P(k) marginalized over its shape, or just the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We find that the inclusion of growth rate information (extracted using redshift space distortion and galaxy clustering amplitude measurements) leads to a factor of ∼ 3 improvement in the FoM, assuming general relativity is not modified. This inclusion partially compensates {{for the loss of}} information when only the BAO are used to give geometrical constraints, rather than using the full P(k) as a standard ruler. We find that a space-based galaxy redshift survey covering ∼ 20 000 deg 2 over Graphic with σz/(1 +z) ≤ 0. 001 exploits a redshift range that is only easily accessible from space, extends to sufficiently low redshifts to allow both a vast 3 D map of the universe using a single tracer population, and overlaps with ground-based surveys to enable robust modelling of systematic effects.

40|$|Marstonia lustrica is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} aquatic snail, relatively rare throughout its range and {{listed in the}} State of Massachusetts as Endangered (MNHESP 2010, Hershler et al. 1987). It is the northern-most cold temperate species of its genus, {{with other members of}} the genus occurring along the southern edge of its range and in the southeastern United States (Thompson 1977). The current range of M. lustrica appears to follow the maximum extent of the Laurentide Glacier (20 – 25 kya), extending from Minnesota to western Massachusetts. Research regarding the distribution, ecology, and phylogeny of M. lustrica in the State of Massachusetts and eastern New York raised the possible role of glaciers and pro-glacial lakes in the establishment and distribution of the snail, leading to the hypothesis that its distribution and evolution may be dependent upon glacial processes. A full <b>range</b> <b>survey</b> was completed in 2007 and 2008, with populations identified in 20 water bodies from Minnesota to Massachusetts, and Ohio to Ontario, Canada.

We conducted a 2 -year study to evaluate four survey methods (scat deposition surveys, scent station surveys, spotlight survey, and trapping) for detecting kit foxes and measuring fox abundance. We determined the probability of detection for each method, and examined the correlation between the relative abundance as estimated by each survey method and the known minimum kit fox abundance as determined by radio-collared animals. All surveys were conducted on 15 5 -km transects during the 3 biological seasons of the kit fox. Scat deposition surveys had both the highest detection probabilities (p = 0. 88) and were most closely related to minimum known fox abundance (r 2 = 0. 50, P = 0. 001). The next best method for kit fox detection was the scent station survey (p = 0. 73), which had the second highest correlation to fox abundance (r 2 = 0. 46, P, 0. 001). For detecting kit foxes in a low density population we suggest using scat deposition transects during the breeding season. Scat deposition surveys have low costs, resilience to weather, low labor requirements, and pose no risk to the study animals.

These properties contain hazardous, toxic, and radioactive wastes in the soil and water or in containers, such as underground storage tanks. The Corps is responsible for cleaning up the hazards, including removing underground storage tanks. DOD's annual report on its environmental restoration activities can provide a misleading picture of the Corps' accomplishments.

In reality, only about 32 percent of those projects that required actual cleanup actions have been completed, and those are the cheapest and least technologically challenging.

40|$|Abstract: Barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) were reintroduced to the Nushagak Peninsula, Alaska in February of 1988 {{after an}} absence of more than 100 years. Since reintroduction, herd growth and {{population}} dynamics have been monitored closely. At this time, {{there has been no}} significant dispersal from the herds ' core range. The Nushagak Peninsula Caribou Herd (NPCH) grew rapidly from 146 reintroduced individuals to over 1000 in 13 years. Dramatic mean annual growth during the first 6 years (1988 - 1994) of 38 % (r = 0. 32) {{can be attributed to the}} high percentage of females in the initial reintroduction, high calf production and survival, exceptional range conditions, few predators, and no hunting. However, the populations ' exceptional growth (peak counts of 1400) slowed and stabilized between 1996 ¬ 1998 and then decreased between 1998 and 2000. Size, body condition and weights of calves captured in 2000 were sig-nificantly lower than those captured in 1995 and 1997. Although calf production also decreased from close to 100 % (1990 - 1995) to about 91 % (1996 - 2000), overall calf survival continued to be high. Legal harvest began in 1995, and harvest reports have accounted for approximately 3 % of population mortality annually. Although brown bears (Ursus arc-tos) and wolves (Canis lupus) are present, the extent of predation is unknown. Mean home range of the N P C H was 674 km 2 and group sizes were greatest during post-calving aggregation in July (x = 127).

40|$|Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are a {{developing}} technology with multiple applications including oceanographic research, military missions and commercial {{activities such as}} oil and gas field exploration. The reported research covers two main areas, namely, {{the assessment of the}} survey performance of AUVs and the development of the next generation of multi-purpose AUVs. The performance characteristics of long range survey-style AUVs are examined and improvements in performance are sought through the use of hybrid devices. Hybrid devices are defined as those that provide both propulsion and manoeuvring forces. Two devices were chosen for detailed investigation; a vectored thruster and a collective and cyclic pitch propeller. The manoeuvring performance of both devices was found to be insufficient to justify the additional engineering complexity associated with them. The aim of the next generation of AUVs {{is to be able to}} combine long <b>range</b> <b>survey</b> capabilities with low speed investigation of the environment encountered. An assessment of a likely mission profile and a review of the available design options demonstrate that maintaining the survey efficiency of the AUV is of principal importance. Therefore the investigation focuses on approaches to the addition of low speed control to an existing survey-style AUV design using propeller based thrusters. Externally mounted thrusters and through-body tunnel thrusters are reviewed and new experimental investigations are reported to provide insight into the performance characteristics on a survey-style AUV hull form. The main body of the experimental programme characterises forward and aft mounted tunnel thruster performance over a range of forward speeds and small yaw angles. The results are used to develop a new, simple modelling procedure representing the performance of tunnel thrusters on an AUV which facilitates the incorporation of the characteristics of tunnel thrusters into numerical simulations of AUV performance. Such a simulation is used to examine approaches to undertaking the transition phase between high speed survey and low speed manoeuvring operation. The results demonstrate the advantageous nature of undertaking a smooth interchange between control approaches considering both the vehicle performance and the energy demands.
