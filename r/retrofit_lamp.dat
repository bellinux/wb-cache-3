40|$|This report {{summarizes}} work {{to develop}} a high efficiency LED-based MR 16 lamp downlight at OSRAM SYLVANIA under US Department of Energy contract DE-EE 0000611. A new multichip LED package, electronic driver, and reflector optic were developed for these lamps. At steady-state, the lamp luminous flux was 409 lumens (lm), luminous efficacy of 87 lumens per watt (LPW), CRI (Ra) of 87, and R 9 of 85 at a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3285 K. The LED alone achieved 120 lumens per watt efficacy and 600 lumen flux output at 25 C. The driver had 90 % electrical conversion efficiency while maintaining excellent power quality with power factor > 0. 90 at a power of only 5 watts. Compared to similar existing MR 16 lamps using LED sources, these lamps had much higher efficacy and color quality. The objective of this work was to demonstrate a LED-based MR 16 <b>retrofit</b> <b>lamp</b> for replacement of 35 W halogen MR 16 lamps having (1) luminous flux of 500 lumens, (2) luminous efficacy of 100 lumens per watt, (3) beam angle less than 40 {sup o} and center beam candlepower of at least 1000 candelas, and (4) excellent color quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{market for}} LED lighting fixtures (excluding <b>retrofit</b> <b>lamps)</b> is about USD 20 billion in 2013, equal to around 25 % {{of the worldwide}} consumption (and probably some 15 % in terms of physical units). Yearly growth has been about 45 % in 2013, that {{is in line with}} previous forecast (October 2012). It is shown that growth of LED lighting sales has been around by 27 % per year among 2008 and 2010, and much more (over 50 % per year) among 2010 and 2013). The worldwide market for lighting fixtures in the year 2018 will be close to 105 billion USD. Today’s LED lighting market is made by around 85 % of lighting fixtures (focus of our study) and 15 % LED <b>retrofit</b> <b>lamps.</b> One hundred among the top manufacturers of lighting fixtures hold around 60 % of the total LED lighting market for 2013.

40|$|For many {{cut flowers}} {{production}} and quality are enhanced by adding artificial assimilation light {{during periods of}} low light. For many seasonal flowers, the use of high intensity assimilation light is unprofitable or requires too high investment. Therefore the effect of day length extension with low intensity LED light (Philips production modules 94 % red / 6 % blue) was tested. In stock (Matthiola incana) the use of low intensity LED lighting accelerated harvest date by 10 to 20 days as light intensity increased from 5 to 20 μmol. m- 2. s- 1 measured at plant level. In snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) the effect was less pronounced and visible only from 10 μmol. m- 2. s- 1. In Trachelium caeruleum the effect was even less and only visible at 20 μmol. m- 2. s- 1 {{in two of the}} three varieties used. The use of LED lighting during the daytime on the short day plant Ranunculus asiaticus had no effect on the time of harvest. In most crops leaf colour improved and leaf colour became darker as light intensity increased. The leaf colour of snowball (Viburnum opulus ‘Roseum’) also improved under red, blue, and 94 % red/ 6 % blue LED lights and under <b>Retrofit</b> <b>lamps</b> when compared to no artificial light. Moreover, leaves and stem below the inflorescence remained more compact and quality improved under red, blue, and red/blue light. Far-red LED light gave the opposite effect with lighter leaf colour, increased stem elongation and smaller and more pointed leaves...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} thermal {{influence}} of a light-emitting diode (LED) driver on a <b>retrofit</b> LED <b>lamp,</b> also reporting on a procedure for its thermal characterization and multiscale modeling. In this analysis, temperature is measured by infrared thermography and monitoring specific locations with thermocouples. Experimental results point out that temperature increases considerably in all lamp parts when the driver is installed in the lamp (up to 15 % for LED board). The multiscale simulation approach is set with thermal parameters (thermal conductivity, emissivity, and LED board thermal resistance) measured from several parts of the lamp, reaching an agreement between experiment and simulation smaller than 10 %. With this model, the driver temperature is investigated under operational conditions accounting for two alternative thermal designs. First, the driver is completely surrounded with a filling material (air completely removed, Case A), and, second, only the thermal contact between the board and the lamp is improved (air is kept, Case B). In both cases, the heat removal from the driver to the ambient by conduction is enhanced, observing that temperature decreases in its most heated components up to 10 °C in Case A, and up to 7 °C in Case B. cop. 1986 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the present paper is the {{derivation}} of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED spot lights. The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of spot lights through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in spot lights. A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order {{was derived from the}} subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of LED <b>retrofit</b> spot <b>lamps.</b> The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of spot lights without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} various LED board technologies from thermal, mechanical and reliability point of view provided by an accurate 3 -D modelling. LED boards are proposed as a possible technology replacement of FR 4 LED boards used in 400 lumen <b>retrofit</b> SSL <b>lamps.</b> Presented design methodology {{can be used for}} other high power SSL lamp designs. The performance of new LED board designs were evaluated by numerical modeling. Modeling methodology was proven by measurement on reference FR 4 LED board. Thermal performance was compared by extracting of LED boards thermal resistances and thermal stress has been inspected considering the widest temperature operating range according to standards (- 40 to + 125 C). Thermo-mechanical and reliability analysis have been performed to study parameters of each LED board technology, using thermal boundary conditions extracted from the thermal simulation of a whole LED lamp. Elastic-plastic analysis with temperature dependent stress-strain material properties has been performed. The objective of the work is to optimize not only the thermal management by thermal simulation of LED boards, but also to find potential problems from mechanical failure point of view and to present a methodology to design SSL LED boards for reliability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{lighting}} system provides many options for cost-effective energy saving with low or no inconvenience. Lighting improvements are excellent investments in most public buildings, {{it is usually}} cost-effective to address because lighting improvements are often easier to make than many process upgrades. For public buildings, the easy no and low cost options to help save money and improve the energy performance are: Understand energy use. Identify options Prioritize actions Make the changes and measure the savings. Continue managing energy efficiency. The challenge is to <b>retrofit</b> traditional <b>lamps</b> with LED lamps of good quality. The benefits of LED light bulbs are long-lasting, durable, cool, mercury free, more efficient, and cost effective. The light Emitting Diode (LED) bulb uses a semiconductor as its light source, and is currently {{one of the most}} energy efficient and quickly developing types of bulbs for lighting. LEDs increasingly are being purchased to replace traditional bulbs. LEDs are relatively more expensive than other types of bulbs, but are very cost-effective because they use only a fraction of electricity of traditional lighting methods nd can last for longer. Benchmarking guides decision makers to policies aimed at the energy sector through better understanding of energy consumption trends nationwide, e. g. : energy price, moderating, peak demand, and encouraging sectors, low energy expansions. The “Improving Energy Efficiency Project of Lighting and Appliances” carried out energy audits and implemented opportunities of energy saving in lighting for different type of public buildings. To rationalize the use of energy by giving guidelines to consumers, the IEEL&A project prepared some brochures. This paper leads with the results of case studies as energy audits, opportunities in {{lighting system}}s, energy saving and CO 2 reduction. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The University of Pittsburgh {{acquired}} the former Masonic Temple on December 23, 1993 for $8.5 million ($ in [...] dollars). [...] A two-year, $16 million ($ in [...] dollars) {{renovation of the}} structure and its adaptation {{for use by the}} University departments began in November 1998 and was completed in February 2000. During the initial design process, a study was performed to evaluate the architectural and historic significance of each major area of the building. As a result, four main lobbies, the ballroom and three main entrances, and portions of several two-story spaces on the third and fifth floors were kept and restored. Special attention was given to restore the Masonic Temple’s original historic condition. As such, approximately 95% of the existing historical light fixtures were rewired, <b>retrofitted</b> with energy-efficient <b>lamps,</b> refinished, and rehung in their original locations. Nearly all of the original wood doors, window casings and baseboards were refinished and reinstalled. Five new automatic elevators were installed and original bronze and stainless steel cabs were retrofitted to two of the new elevator platforms. Approximately 100 original bronze door hardware sets were modified to ADA compliance, refinished and reinstalled. One thousand square feet of marble flooring originally from Pennsylvania Hall (the previous home of Pitt’s medical school since torn down) was utilized in vestibules, corridors, elevator lobbies and cabs. Marble from the Masonic Temple’s original marble restroom stalls was also recycled for use in these areas. The building was decorated and furnished in a color scheme of primarily blues, mauves and burgundy to complement the mahogany woodwork.|$|R
40|$|Depending on your farm operation, {{taking the}} {{following}} actions could reduce your energy consumption. Refer to the references {{at the end}} of the bulletin for more information. Outdoor lighting 1. Ask yourself why am I lighting this area. Is lighting necessary all night? If it’s not needed, turn it off and save. A timer, photo sensor or motion sensor can be used to turn the light off when not needed. 2. Change mercury vapor fixtures to metal-halide or high-pressure sodium fixtures when the lamp needs to be replaced. These provide more efficient lighting and reduce the environmental risk posed by the mercury vapor <b>lamp.</b> <b>Retrofit</b> bulbs are available but are very expensive—about the same cost as replacing the fixture. A 100 -watt high-pressure sodium or 150 -watt metal halide lamp will provide slightly more light than a 175 -watt mercury vapor lamp. 3. Use motion sensors on incandescent or halogen flood lamps to turn on the light only when there is activity in the area. 4. Replace incandescent and halogen flood lamps with highintensity discharge lamps (metal halide or high pressure sodium) in areas with motion more than 30 % of the time during nighttime hours. 5. Install full cut-off reflectors on lights. This reduces light losses to the night sky by more than 20 % and can increase the light level of an intended area by up to 70 %. A 70 w high pressure sodium lamp with a full cutoff reflector will provide the same light as the typical 175 w mercury vapor yard lamp—a 60 % energy savings! 6. Install a DNP half-night photo sensor on yard lights. It shuts off the light halfway through the night reducing the operating cost by half. Payback is typically 2 years or less. 7. Install a clock timer to shut off lighting that is not needed all night. 8. Install photo sensors to turn lights on/off at sunset and sunrise. 9. Keep tree limbs trimmed away from light fixtures. Indoor lighting 1. Provide the proper levels and color of light for the most efficient plant or animal production. 2.

40|$|In this study, a {{measurement}} and verification (M&V) cost minimisation model is proposed {{to deal with}} both the M&V modelling and sampling uncertainties. In order to find the optimal solutions {{in terms of the}} modelling accuracy level, and the sample size, the M&V cost that includes the modelling cost, sampling cost, and overhead cost is formulated as the objective function, in which the modelling cost is developed {{as a function of the}} modelling accuracy in terms of the coefficient of variation of the room mean square error (CV(RMSE)), and the sampling cost, which is directly related to the sample size. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, an optimal M&V modelling and sampling strategy is designed for a traffic intersection <b>lamp</b> <b>retrofit</b> project. In addition, partial optimal M&V plans designed with optimal sampling but non-optimal modelling solutions, or with optimal modelling but non-optimal sampling solutions are employed as the benchmark. Comparisons between the optimal and non-optimal solutions show advantageous cost savings performance in the execution of sampling and modelling activities for the case study. More precisely, the optimal solutions reduce the sampling cost by 55 % and the total M&V cost by 14 % against the solutions obtained by optimal modelling but non-optimal sampling solutions. To test the applicability and flexibility of the proposed model for the cost-effective design of similar traffic light retrofit projects, simulations have been carried out to evaluate the model performance when applying the model to M&V projects with different characteristics. The simulation results show that the proposed model is able to offer flexible trade-offs between the modelling and sampling uncertainties; namely, using more accurate baseline models and smaller sample sizes or less accurate baseline models but greater sample sizes to accommodate different practical needs in executing M&V projects with different characteristics. The major contributions of this study can be highlighted as follows: 1) a M&V modelling cost model is developed, which is able to offer a quantitative analysis of the M&V baseline model uncertainty and cost; and, 2) a M&V cost minimisation model is proposed to handle both the M&V modelling and sampling uncertainties cost-effectively. The effectiveness and flexibility of this model are demonstrated by a case study and simulations.
