5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are <b>rimmed</b> <b>with</b> a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Distal {{myopathy}} <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles/hereditary {{inclusion body}} myopathy is clinically {{characterized by the}} early involvement of distal leg muscles. The striking pathological features of the myopathy are muscle fibers <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles. To date, the role of aquaporin- 4 water channel in distal myopathy <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy has not been studied. Case presentation Here, we studied the expression of aquaporin- 4 in muscle fibers of a patient with distal myopathy <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses showed that sarcolemmal aquaporin- 4 immunoreactivity was reduced in many muscle fibers of the patient. However, the intensity of aquaporin- 4 staining was markedly increased at rimmed vacuoles or its surrounding areas and in some muscle fibers. The fast-twitch type 2 fibers were predominantly involved with the strong aquaporin- 4 -positive rimmed vacuoles and TAR-DNA-binding protein- 43 aggregations. Rimmed vacuoles with strong aquaporin- 4 expression seen in the distal myopathy <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy patient were not found in control muscles without evidence of neuromuscular disorders and the other disease-controls. Conclusions Aquaporin- 4 might be crucial in determining the survival or degeneration of fast-twitch type 2 fibers in distal myopathy <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy. </p...|$|R
25|$|They also {{possess the}} {{characteristic}} pair of humps {{on the front}} side of their abdomen, somewhat resembling 'shoulders' and giving them the distinctive triangular shape. On the upper side are eight prominent sigilla (small pit-like depressions) arranged in two rows. The abdomen is subrectangular, with somewhat flat sides, and has small tubercules at the front. It is longer than it is wide and tapers down towards the rear. The bottom side of the abdomen is usually brown with yellow book lungs. The spinnerets are <b>rimmed</b> <b>with</b> white. The epigynum in females possesses a short triangular scape (or ovipositor). The sperm receptacles (spermathecae) are globular.|$|E
25|$|A {{main source}} for the {{construction}} of racing bigae is a number of bronze figurines found throughout the Roman Empire, a particularly detailed example of which is held by the British Museum. Other sources are reliefs and mosaics. These show a lightweight frame, to which a minimal shell of fabric or leather was lashed. The center of gravity was low, and the wheels were relatively small, around 65cm in diameter in proportion to a body 60cm wide and 55cm deep, with a breastwork of about 70cm in height. The wheels may have been <b>rimmed</b> <b>with</b> iron, but otherwise metal fittings are kept to a minimum. The design facilitated speed, maneuverability and stability.|$|E
25|$|The interpretable {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Kuiper quadrangle is primarily a record of decreasing meteoroid flux during which large craters and basins formed and plains materials were deposited. A decreasing rate of crater production is indicated by progressively fewer craters in each successively younger crater class. Approximately half of the mapped area contains a high density of craters and multiringed basins formed by the intense early bombardment. It is doubtful that any primary crustal material has been preserved without brecciation and redistribution by repeated impacts. The present crater population represents only the craters surviving {{at the end of}} the stage of highest meteoroid flux. As the impact flux decreased, cratered plains materials of possible volcanic origin were deposited in broad, low-lying areas, flooding, embaying, or partially burying preexisting craters. The youngest multiringed basins (Renoir, Rodin, and the unnamed basin at 15° S., 15°) formed near the end of this stage (about c3 time), as did the Caloris Basin on the opposite side of the planet (McCauley and others, 1981; Schaber andMcCauley, 1980). Craters that formed still later during the period of low impact rates are well preserved. During this late stage, smooth plains materials were deposited in basins, craters, and localised low areas and have low crater density. The youngest craters are sharp <b>rimmed</b> <b>with</b> bright rays.|$|E

2500|$|Fueled {{in part by}} the 1729 ban on madak, {{which at}} first {{effectively}} exempted pure opium as a potentially medicinal product, the smoking of pure opium became more popular in the 18th century.

40|$|Background: Myopathies <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles are a {{heterogeneous}} group of muscle disorders with progressive muscle weakness and varied clinical manifestations but similar features in muscle biopsies. Here, we describe a novel autosomal dominant myopathy <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles {{in a large}} family with 11 patients of three generations affected. Methods: A clinical study including family history, obstetric, pediatric, and development history was recorded. Clinical examinations including physical examination, electromyography (EMG), serum creatine kinase (CK), bone X-rays, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in this family. Open muscle biopsies were performed on the proband and his mother. To find the causative gene, the whole-exome sequencing was carried out. Results: Disease onset was from adolescence to adulthood, but the affected patients of the third generation presented an earlier onset and more severe clinical manifestations than the older generations. Clinical features were characterized as dysarthria, dysphagia, external ophthalmoplegia, limb weakness, hypophrenia, deafness, and impaired vision. However, not every patient manifested all symptoms. Serum CK was mildly elevated and EMG indicated a myopathic pattern. Brain MRI showed cerebellum and brain stem mildly atrophy. Rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies were observed in muscle biopsy. The whole-exome sequencing was performed, but the causative gene has not been found. Conclusions: We reported a novel autosomal dominant myopathy <b>with</b> <b>rimmed</b> vacuoles characterized by dysarthria, dysphagia, external ophthalmoplegia, limb weakness, hypophrenia, deafness, and impaired vision, but the causative gene has not been found and needs further study...|$|R
