40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2007. The thesis {{begins with}} a {{literature}} review on {{the political economy of}} communication, paying particular attention to the impact of globalisation on the communications sector. It highlights conflictual relationships between commercialisation and democratisation in transforming broadcasting and telecommunications in an era of globalisation. In doing this the study contends that the process of democratisation and commercialisation are 'mutually incompatible', as one can only be realised {{at the expense of the}} other. Namibia gained its independence in 1990 and set out to transform and restructure its communication systems to respond to the demands of a new society. At the same time the country had to address the demands of an emerging global order. While trying to democratise and build a new nation based on the values of equity, social justice and participation, Namibia had to respond to commercial imperatives of global capitalism that were not necessarily compatible with the demands of democratisation and nationbuilding. The thesis argues that these conflicting demands resulted in challenges and contradictions experienced in the entire transformation process of the communications sector, which the State failed to overcome. The thesis examines the policy, legal and regulatory practices adopted by the State to transform the communications sector and assess the internal and external factors that led to the adoption of these practices. It illuminates the roles and responsibilities of this sector in the broader transitional process. In Chapters Six and Seven the thesis examines the restructuring processes of NBC and Telecom Namibia, at a micro level. This analysis pays particular attention to the manner in which these two institutions were streamlined (downsized and <b>rightsized)</b> in order to become effective, efficient and profitable in discharging their new mandate. It argues that the streamlining process prevented these institutions from properly performing some of their core mandates, particularly the provision of non-profitable public services. The thesis also interrogates the penetration of the new Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in Namibian society in Chapter Eight. It argues that while government adopted most of the relevant policies to establish an enabling environment for the transformation of the country into an 'information society', the penetration of the ICTs remained dismal. This elucidates the factors that led to this poor penetration. In conclusion the thesis provides a summary of the major findings and arguments. It contends that the neo-liberal policies of commercialisation and liberalisation adopted to transform the communications sector coupled with the restructuring of the national broadcaster and telecommunications operator along commercial lines tended to diminish rather than advance the goal of universal and affordable communications services to the majority of the people...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Effective human capital planning can enable the Department of Defense (DOD) {{to have the right}} people, with the right skills, doing the right jobs, in the right places, at the right time by making flexible use of its internal workforce and appropriately using contractors. According to the department, as of March 2010, DOD's total civilian workforce included about 718, 000 full-time civilians, including more than 2, 900 civilians in the senior management, functional, and technical personnel workforce (hereafter referred to as senior leader workforce). Further, DOD reported that, as of the end of September 2009, there were more than 118, 000 civilians in DOD's acquisition workforce. DOD has acknowledged, however, that with approximately 30 percent of its workforce eligible to retire by March 31, 2015, and the need to reduce its reliance on contractors to augment the current workforce, it faces a number of significant challenges. For example, in its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), DOD stressed the need for leadership in human capital management, to improve its capabilities for contributing to civilian-led activities and operations supporting "unity of effort" in homeland security, and an appropriately sized cadre of acquisition personnel who have the skills and training necessary to successfully perform their jobs. In that regard, the 2010 QDR stressed the importance of involving senior leadership in human capital management and also stated that DOD must (1) align its resources to establish a balanced total workforce, (2) possess an up-to-date human capital strategy, and (3) continue developing programs to recruit, shape, and sustain the force it needs. DOD's 2009 strategic workforce plan states that in April 2009, the Secretary of Defense announced his intention to rebalance and <b>rightsize</b> the acquisition workforce by adding 20, 000 personnel by fiscal year 2015 [...] including 10, 000 new hires and an additional 10, 000 employees as a result of in-sourcing work that had been previously performed by contractors. Most recently, in August 2010, the Secretary of Defense announced initiatives to reduce duplication, overhead, and excess and instill a culture of savings and restraint across DOD that could affect DOD's civilian workforce planning efforts. These initiatives included reducing the funding available for service support contractors, freezing the number of DOD civilian senior executives and flag officers at the fiscal year 2010 level, and at a minimum, reducing the number of Senior Executive Service members by 150 over the next 2 years. Strategic workforce planning [...] an integral part of human capital management [...] helps organizations to determine if they have staff with the necessary skills and competencies to accomplish their strategic goals. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 required us to review and report on DOD's workforce plans for 2009 through 2012 no later than 180 days after DOD's submissions. On March 31, 2010, DOD submitted its 2009 update to the human capital strategic plan, which was intended to address the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (FY 2006 NDAA). Our objectives were {{to determine the extent to}} which DOD's strategic workforce plan addresses the FY 2010 NDAA requirements applicable to (1) the overall civilian workforce, (2) the senior leader workforce, and (3) the acquisition workforce.

40|$|The {{pressure}} for economic integration has been reinforced by developments in technology, changes in market structures {{and the emergence}} of transnational corporations. <b>Rightsizing</b> has emerged as a critical process in this present era of shrinking space, shrinking time and disappearing borders in the context of employee engagement and human capital. It is often adopted by most organizations to help them become more agile and flexible and thereby cater to the competitive demands. The diverse impacts of <b>rightsizing</b> on various actors however question the justice aspect of the entire process. This study addresses <b>rightsizing</b> from the perspective of social justice by taking into consideration the assessments of the processes by the affected actors namely, the implementers who drive the <b>rightsizing</b> processes; the separated who leave the organization as a result of rightsizing; and the stayers who remain in the organization and have observed the process. It also aims at understanding the various <b>rightsizing</b> processes from an empirical perspective and examines the causal relatedness of the <b>rightsizing</b> processes and outcome across some of the Indian organizations and the actors. Review of literature: The gamut of literature in <b>rightsizing</b> has provided a strong foundation for the researcher to gain a critical understanding of the various processes underlying <b>rightsizing.</b> The key challenge in <b>rightsizing</b> concerns the fairness aspect of the entire process considering the fact that in most cases <b>rightsizing</b> results in gains for some people and loss for others. Given that judgments of fairness are highly subjective, the lack of an absolute standard for determining fairness in this situation has been identified as a gap. As many studies highlight the ambivalence in results with regard to the outcome of <b>rightsizing</b> and attribute them to the <b>rightsizing</b> processes, the relationship of the <b>rightsizing</b> processes and the outcome has emerged as an area of interest. Though there have been correlation based analysis between various <b>rightsizing</b> variables, causal models that link the <b>rightsizing</b> processes to the outcome have been found missing. The dearth of studies from the Indian set up have also prompted the need to build segregate and aggregate causal models of <b>rightsizing</b> processes and outcome at the organization and actor levels. Aim, objectives and methodology: The aim of this study has been to identify the <b>rightsizing</b> processes that contribute towards positive outcome for both the organization and the individuals concerned from the social justice perspective. The objectives were: 1. 	To compare and contrast the implementation of <b>rightsizing</b> processes in some of the Indian organizations. 2. 	To develop a framework for understanding and classifying <b>rightsizing</b> processes in relation to the social justice perspective. 3. 	To identify the effective <b>rightsizing</b> processes that contribute significantly towards minimizing individual stress and maximizing commitment towards the organization. 4. 	To outline appropriate guidelines based on the justice perspectives of the actors for better implementation of <b>rightsizing</b> in organizations. The conceptual model links the actors, their assessments of the <b>rightsizing</b> processes and the outcome of the entire process as affecting their individual stress and commitment towards the organization. The just processes of <b>rightsizing</b> have been decided based on the assessment of actors and on the extent of their agreement with one another on implementation of the discrete <b>rightsizing</b> practices. Accordingly those practices that all the three groups of actors, namely the implementers, stayers and separated perceive to have been implemented will be classified as the "best practices" or system 4 practices; the practices that have been perceived to have been implemented by the implementers and stayers but not the separated will be classified as the "better practices" or system 3 practices; those practices that the implementers and separated perceive as implemented will be the "ineffective practices" or system 2 practices; and the practices where all the three groups differ with one another with regard to the extent of implementation will be termed the "poor practices" or system 1 practices. The questionnaire was finalized after a preliminary and pilot study. Data was collected from 727 respondents across four organizations, one private manufacturing unit referred to as Org- 1, one state public sector unit referred to as Org- 2, two central public sector units referred to as Org- 3 and Org- 4. The total sample consisted of 137 implementers, 320 stayers and 270 separated. Results and discussion: The first part of the analysis focused on validating the <b>rightsizing</b> processes through factor analysis and also testing the reliability using Chronbach alpha. The implementation of the <b>rightsizing</b> processes across the four organizations was compared using Bonferroni post hoc comparisons. Org- 1 and Org- 4 had implemented most of the <b>rightsizing</b> practices adequately. The perceptions of the employees of Org- 2 and Org- 3 were found to be significantly inadequate when compared to Org- 1 and Org- 4 with respect to many of the practices. The second set of analysis compares the assessments of the actors with regard to the implementation of the various <b>rightsizing</b> practices, and classifies them into one of the four systems based on the framework developed. The system 4 practices consist of, the notification period; the severance package; {{the amount of money that}} the organizations wished to save after <b>rightsizing</b> and avoidance of ineffective cost reduction strategies. The outcome of <b>rightsizing</b> with respect to role clarity and role sufficiency also falls into system 4. The system 3 practices consist of understanding the need for rightsizing; the need for manpower reduction, proactive cost reduction strategies, separation of the sick and criteria for separation of the redundant. System 1 practices comprise of internal stakeholders, alternate strategies adopted by the organization before resorting to separation of the employees, preparation and communication, leadership, review and control and assistance provided to the separated. The outcome with regard to job security and commitment also falls in this category. The final set of analysis aims at identifying those processes that contribute significantly towards the outcome at both the organizational level and from the perceptions of the actors through path analysis. The path analysis was conducted at the segregate and aggregate levels for the organizations and the actors. Initially a full segregate model where all the independent variables are linked to the dependent variables was fit for the 4 organizations and for the 3 categories of actors. Those processes that contributed significantly towards the outcome with respect to the actors and the organizations were structured onto two final aggregate models. The validity of these aggregate models was examined for the organizations and actors respectively. Conclusion: This study provides a deeper understanding of the various processes underlying <b>rightsizing</b> in the three different stages of implementation. These validated measures can be used as a template by the organizations to study and guide further <b>rightsizing</b> initiatives. Through this research three groups of individuals diversely affected by <b>rightsizing</b> have been brought together under one common framework which is a methodological innovation. Inspite of having different interests, it is possible to obtain a consensus in their assessments of some of the <b>rightsizing</b> practices. This is an important conclusion that can be drawn in support of the social justice perspective with regard to <b>rightsizing.</b> The relationship between the <b>rightsizing</b> processes as affecting the outcome of stress and commitment can also be understood from a causal perspective across organizations and actors through segregate and aggregate models. The best practices with knowledge capital and social capital can also be included in understanding the perspectives of the actors and classification of <b>rightsizing</b> best practices in future work...|$|E

Using a sample of SMEs in Zhejiang Province, China, this paper aimed to explore the <b>rightsizing</b> strategies used by Chinese SMEs {{as a result of the}} worsening economic conditions to promote survival. Analysis of survey data indicated that Chinese SMEs were adopting a range of <b>rightsizing</b> strategies in order to maintain operations.

S. embassies in Africa. GAO was asked to discuss three reports, including two being issued today, on <b>rightsizing</b> [...] that is, realigning the number and location of staff [...] at U. S. embassies and consulates: (1) the <b>rightsizing</b> framework GAO developed last year, (2) follow-on work to further test the framework, and (3) the processes to project staffing levels for new embassy construction and the proposals to share construction costs among U. S. agencies. ...|$|E

To support this long-standing need and in support of the President's Management Agenda, GAO developed a framework for assessing overseas workforce size and identified options for <b>rightsizing.</b> Because the framework was largely based on work at the U. S. embassy in Paris, GAO was asked to determine whether the <b>rightsizing</b> framework is applicable at U. S. embassies in developing countries. To accomplish this objective, we visited three U. S. embassies in West Africa [...] a medium-sized post in Dakar, Senegal; and two small embassies in Banjul, The Gambia; and Nouakchott, Mauritania [...] and applied the framework and its corresponding questions there. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Community {{colleges have}} long been {{thought of as the}} "people's college. " For some thirty years, Oregonians have looked to their 16 {{community}} colleges as the less expensive, more accessible route to a college education. Oregon's community colleges have traditionally had the broad mission of providing comprehensive educational opportunities to all adults who can profit from the instruction. This foundation of open access, however, has recently been challenged. Issues in Oregon's social, political, and economic environments the past few years have resulted in substantial financial pressure on the community colleges. This situation has prompted many Oregon community college leaders to make tough operational decisions. <b>Rightsizing</b> strategies encompassing all budget categories have been extensive across the state. In many cases, community college leaders have been able to manage decline successfully, maintaining the institution's broad mission. In other cases, however, leaders have selected strategies in direct conflict with the stated mission of open access. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the consistency between the <b>rightsizing</b> behavior of Oregon's community college leaders and the community college mission of open educational access. The study employed a Tylerian objective-oriented evaluation methodology as a theoretical framework. In general, this approach compares the consistency between expected behaviors based on stated goals and demonstrated behaviors as measured via survey instrumentation. Frequency and statistical analyses were employed to address specific research questions developed to guide the study. Overall, there were substantial findings supporting the conclusion that Oregon community college leaders, in both past and planned <b>rightsizing</b> behaviors, were acting consistently with the mission of open educational access...|$|E
