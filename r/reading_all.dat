5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about the similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after <b>reading</b> <b>all</b> of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E

25|$|It {{is good to}} {{remember}} that all these documents were written by humans, who used human judgment as to whether to note something. For example, once in Europe, German air raids and picking up dead bodies from the sea were fairly common occurrences. At some point, they became too common to report. The Deck Log might mention an air raid on one day but the War Diary might make no mention of it. A week later, the opposite might be true. The clearest picture comes from <b>reading</b> <b>all</b> the documents.|$|E
25|$|Creator Susan Harris {{went on to}} {{contribute}} another four episodes to the first season, but became less involved with the sitcom throughout its run; she continued <b>reading</b> <b>all</b> scripts, though, and remained familiar {{with most of the}} storylines. Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman were the first head writers of the series and wrote for the show's first four seasons. As head writers, Speer and Grossman, along with Mort Nathan and Barry Fanaro, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing the first season, gave general ideas to lower staff writers, and personally wrote a handful of scripts each season.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister John Key had {{stated that}} he would support any {{same-sex}} marriage bill in its first reading initially, but after Louisa Wall's bill was drawn Key {{stated that he}} would support it through all stages.

New Zealand First announced it would abstain, and that the legalisation of same-sex marriage should be put to a referendum. However, at the first <b>reading,</b> <b>all</b> New Zealand First MPs opposed the bill, largely because abstentions reduce the majority needed for a bill to pass.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene that}} {{corresponds}} with [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while {{stuck in the}} air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role {{and there is nothing}} to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, {{he would not be able}} to walk as he is a [...] "straw paper dummy". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their [...] "Crow Commandments": [...] "Thou shall honor all crows", [...] "Thou shall stop <b>reading</b> <b>all</b> bits of paper and literature" [...] and [...] "Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, [...] "You Can't Win". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing [...] "Ease on Down the Road" [...] as they go.|$|E
500|$|Higgins {{ventured into}} real estate at [...] first, {{and with the}} money that he saved as a logger, he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to {{manufacture}} bricks. The business sparked his interest in oil and gas, as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly. He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs {{to the presence of}} underground oil. Studying geology on his own, he dedicated himself to finding these clues by <b>reading</b> <b>all</b> the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find. The details he learned reminded him of what some Beaumont locals back home referred to as [...] "Sour Hill Mound", a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings. This mound was described as [...] "sour" [...] due to the unpleasant sulfur smell {{that came out of the}} springs around it. Convinced that this salt dome mound had oil below it, Higgins first partnered with George O'Brien, George Carroll, Emma John, and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company in 1892. It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States. Higgins' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper. However, his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage, and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture. Work began the following year, but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill. Higgins held onto his ownership and leases of land over the salt dome, but resigned from the company.|$|E
