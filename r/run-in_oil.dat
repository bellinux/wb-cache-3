40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{quantification}} of influence of operation on flow properties of motorcycle engine oil. Three different kinds of synthetic engine oil (MOTUL) were tested, namely unused oil, <b>run-in</b> <b>oil</b> (650 [*]km after engine reboring) and regular engine oil (6200 [*]km of motorcycle operation). The samples were frozen to below zero temperatures and kinematic viscosity was continuously monitored {{in the range of}} − 5 [*]°C and + 115 [*]°C. Consequently, the kinematic viscosity at reference temperatures of 0, 40 and 100 [*]°C was compared. Viscosity was measured by digital viscometer with concentric cylinders measuring geometry. The biggest difference occurred in case of lower temperatures where e. g. at 0 [*]°C decrease to 29 [*]% and 43 [*]% of its original value was detected for used oil and <b>run-in</b> <b>oil</b> respectively. Flow behavior was modeled using several mathematical models –Arrhenius equation, exponential, and Gaussian equation. The best match between experimental and computed data was received in case of Gaussian fit with R 2 = 0. 997 and 0. 992 for run-in and used oil, respectively. The models are ge­ne­ral­ly usable for description of rheological behavior of given engine oil...|$|E
