5000|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>charts</b> are {{a useful}} way to display multivariate {{observations}} with an arbitrary number of variables. [...] Each star represents a single observation. Typically, <b>radar</b> <b>charts</b> are generated in a multi-plot format with many stars on each page and each star representing one observation. The star plot {{was first used}} by Georg von Mayr in 1877. <b>Radar</b> <b>charts</b> differ from glyph plots in that all variables are used to construct the plotted star figure. There is no separation into foreground and background variables. Instead, the star-shaped figures are usually arranged in a rectangular array on the page. It is somewhat easier to see patterns in the data if the observations are arranged in some non-arbitrary order (if the variables are assigned to the rays of the star in some meaningful order).|$|R

50|$|Conversely, <b>radar</b> <b>charts</b> {{have been}} criticized as poorly suited for making {{trade-off}} decisions - when one chart is greater than another on some variables, but less on others.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>charts</b> {{are helpful}} for small-to-moderate-sized multivariate data sets. Their primary {{weakness}} {{is that their}} effectiveness is limited to data sets {{with less than a}} few hundred points. After that, they tend to be overwhelming.|$|R
50|$|For {{graphical}} qualitative {{comparison of}} 2-dimensional tabular data in several variables, a common alternative are Harvey Balls, {{which are used}} extensively by Consumer Reports.

50|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> is {{also known}} as web chart, spider chart, star chart, star plot, cobweb chart, {{irregular}} polygon, polar chart, or Kiviat diagram. It is equivalent to a parallel coordinates plot in polar coordinates.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{alternating}} data 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1 {{yields a}} spiking <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> (which {{goes in and}} out), while reordering the data as 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1 instead yields two distinct wedges (sectors).|$|E

40|$|When {{engineering}} different decentralised {{autonomic computing}} solutions {{for a certain}} application {{there is a lack}} of a common and usable evaluation and comparison approach. Useful metrics and measurements are mostly domain-specific and are hard to generalise. This paper proposes to use <b>radar</b> <b>charts</b> which allow to apply these domain-specific metrics in an overall evaluation and comparison approach. As such, multiple solutions can be compared with each other and evaluated along multiple dimensions that are important for evaluating decentralised autonomic systems. The approach is illustrated in mobile ad-hoc network management...|$|R

A survey comprising questionnaires, interviews and practical observations were administered targeting members of the faculty from three various engineering disciplines within the School of Engineering (SoE). Raw data was generated to establish the status quo of BL tools that are most preferred among faculty members using <b>radar</b> <b>charts.</b> A framework using the Plan, Do, Check and Action (PDCA) cycle used to monitor the progress of BL in engineering undergraduate programmes is developed...|$|R
50|$|The chosen {{criteria}} {{are often used}} best as a basis of comparison for two or more similar packaging designs; not as an absolute success or failure. Such a multi-variable comparison is often presented as a <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> (spider chart, star chart, etc.).|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} {{there is a}} natural structure, and radar charts can be well-suited. For example, for {{diagrams}} of data that vary over a 24-hour cycle, the hourly data is naturally related to its neighbor, and has a cyclic structure, so it can naturally be displayed as a <b>radar</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E

The projection onto the circle results in the aforementioned <b>Radar</b> <b>chart.</b> This could prove to be a powerful computer-aided multivariable visualization method if, upon projection onto the common tridimensional sphere, the layers are given some degree of transparency on their alpha channel so as to allow to see through.|$|E

The impact of city size on municipal expenditures from different funding sources is evaluated. Cross-tabulations of city size identify revenue sources for various expenditures and activities.
