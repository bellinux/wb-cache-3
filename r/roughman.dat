50|$|The tavern {{society in}} Fowey is as rough as that in Plymouth; in particular, a bully called <b>Roughman</b> {{disrupts}} {{the business at}} Bess's tavern. In the belief that bullies are generally cowards, Bess disguises herself as a man to confront and humiliate Roughman; in response, he reforms and becomes her brave and loyal follower. Goodlack returns from the Azores, in the false belief that Spencer has been killed in action. Spencer has named Bess his heir in his last will and testamentâ€”providing she has maintained her honor; otherwise the estate goes to Goodlack. With a strong financial motive to prove her unchaste, Goodlack tests Bess, insults and humiliates her; but she behaves with dignified restraint, winning his admiration. Under the mistaken impression of Spencer's death, Bess turns privateer: she uses her wealth to equip a ship, and leads Goodlack, <b>Roughman,</b> Clem and her crew in attacking Spanish and Turkish shipping.|$|E
