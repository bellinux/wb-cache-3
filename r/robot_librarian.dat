Funded by Academy of Robotics in the UK, the robot was first introduced in February 2016. Hugh stands 1.4 metres tall and weighs 60 pounds, its core function is to help users by locating and navigating them to desired books in the library.|$|E

While at university he was credited with inventing the worlds first artificially intelligent <b>robot</b> <b>librarian,</b> Hugh (robot). The robot was capable of holding a conversation or taking verbal commands and {{would be able to}} navigate users to any one of several million books in the library.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the UJI <b>Librarian</b> <b>Robot,</b> a mobile manipulator that {{is able to}} autonomously locate a book in an ordinary library, and grasp it from a bookshelf, by using eye-in-hand stereo vision and force sensing. The robot is only provided with the book code, a library map and some knowledge about its logical structure and {{takes advantage of the}} spatio-temporal constraints and regularities of the environment by applying disparate techniques such as stereo vision, visual tracking, probabilistic matching, motion estimation, multisensor-based grasping, visual servoing and hybrid control, {{in such a way that}} it exhibits a robust and dependable performance. The system has been tested, and experimental results show how it is able to robustly locate and grasp a book in a reasonable time without human intervention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} recent {{progress in}} the <b>librarian</b> <b>robot</b> designed in our University, in order to assist users in a friendly manner. With this aim, a robotic system was initially conceived and initial results were obtained. Now we present new results achieved with this system, in particular those related to the fusion of vision and force to guide the extraction of a book. It is remarkable that among the main tasks evolved on this complex problem we are focus mainly on the scanner task of a book in a self and its posterior extraction. Thus, the system must integrate automatic book recognition, via Optical Character Recognition, visually guided grasping, and force feedback, among other advanced capabilities. Implementation details about the main modules developed presently are shown. Furthermore, advantages and limitations are higligthed from performance results, and some future lines are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ After {{several years}} working in {{different}} aspects of service robotics with the aim to improve different capabilities, we are currently devoted to a real life specific problem. This consists {{on the construction of}} a complete robotic system designed to assist users in a library, namely the UJI (i. e. the acronym of our University) <b>librarian</b> <b>robot.</b> During the last year new hardware and software has been necessary to improve the different skills required for this task. Thus we present new results achieved with this system, in particular those related to guide the extraction of a book on a shelf, now by using a hybrid control law, integrating force and visual servoing. At the same time, new results have been obtained improving the automatic book recognition process. All these improvements are aimed at the achievement of the ultimate objective of this very interdisciplinary problem which is the autonomous extraction of a book from the user specification requirement...|$|R
