40|$|Abstract—Heterogeneous {{networks}} (HetNets) are {{typified by}} cellular deployments with multiple types of cells {{of different sizes}} and overlapping coverage areas using a common frequency band. Especially, hotzone cells overlaid on a macrocell to cover hotspot areas are expected to prevail in HetNets, thus cost-effectively enhancing cellular capacity via spatial reuse of spectrum resource and offloading macrocells. In order to fully achieve such benefits, users need to be properly distributed/assigned to the overlaid hotzone cells such that the <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> therein are fully utilized. To this end, we propose a new architecture called Adaptive Range Control of Hotzone Cells for Heterogeneous Networks (ARCHoN) that jointly <b>controls</b> the <b>radio</b> <b>resource</b> allocations and ranges of OFDMA-based hotzone cells. The use of cell ranges for distributing users in ARCHoN is advantageous in {{that it can be}} implemented within a conventional cell-selection framework without modifying user devices or an air interface. In ARCHoN, each cell allocates users radio (frequency, time and power) resources in a non-cooperative manner, deriving a sequence of allocations monotonically decreasing the entire load. For range control, two algorithms are proposed: per-cell and universal, which have a tradeoff between performance and computational complexity. The solution yielded by the combination of these <b>radio</b> <b>resource</b> and range <b>control</b> algorithms is analytically proven to converge to a unique fixed point. Our indepth evaluation has shown ARCHoN to significantly improve the service quality of users; in an example simulation scenario, ARCHoN is shown to improve the signal-to-interference and noise ratios (SINRs) of users, on average, by up to 3. 5 dB in downlink and 18. 8 dB in uplink, over the case of the conventional handover framework.

40|$|An {{efficient}} use of the <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> in wireless communications presents a fundamental challenge. While power {{is one of the}} most important <b>radio</b> <b>resources,</b> and its <b>control</b> has been studied extensively for voice communications, the increase demand of wireless data service makes it very important to establish power control algorithms for such service. In Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular systems we have a number of users who are simultaneously sharing the air interface. Each user wants to achieve a high Signal-to-Interference ratio (SIR) at the Base-Station (BS) with the lowest possible transmitted power level. These conflicting objectives of the users make the framework of game theory suitable to establish power control algorithms. In [1] a non-cooperative power control game (NPG) was proposed where each user unilaterally maximizes his quality of service (QoS), referred to as a ”utility”. The result of such NPG however, is a Nash equilibrium which is not efficient. To obtain a Pareto improvement, [1] introduced a pricing of the transmit power in which each user’s goal is to maximize a difference between the utility function of NPG and a linear pricing function with respect to the transmit power. However, in [1] the channel model is not realistic, as they only considered deterministic channel path gains from the BS to the user. Signals in a wireless communications experience different types of fading. In this paper we consider the problem studied in [1] with three cases of fading: Rayleigh flat fading, Rician flat fading and Nakagami flat fading. In all cases, the channel is assumed to be quasi static, i. e, the fading coefficient is constant during each packet’s duration. IEE...|$|R
