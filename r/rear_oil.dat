Hence many studies on odour issues are more commonly pertain to its intensity, concentration, types, standards, measurement methods, law and impacts on physical and human environments. Nevertheless, odour analysis can be conducted empirically or based on human sensorial. Among major sources of odour pollution are animal <b>rearing,</b> <b>oil</b> palm and rubber mills, dumpsites, industries and sewage treatments. This study attempted to measure odour pollution generated by Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) operation. The analysis was conducted {{at different times of}} day (morning, evening and night) and weather conditions (normal days and after rains). 10 sampling stations were selected for observations using the Odour Concentration Meter Siri XP- 329 III. The results indicated that there existed different level of odour concentrations on normal days and after rains due to the influence of meteorological environment. Distance factors also influenced the odour concentrations, whereby gradually, the stations further from RDF operation recorded higher odour concentration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} previously demonstrated reductions in photoreceptor sensitivity to light in n- 3 fatty-acid-deficient rats {{can be explained by}} alterations in rhodopsin content, and/or function. Methods. Sprague-Dawlcy rats were reared throughout gestation, lactation, and up to 24 weeks of age on a diet containing sarTlower oil (n- 3 fatty-acid-deficient) or soybean oil as the sole source of lipids. Dark-adapted content and in vivo regeneration of rhodopsin after bleaching were measured by detergent extraction. The regeneration rate constants and number of photons absorbed by rhodopsin under steady-state bleach conditions were calculated from these values. The rate of metarhodopsin II (Mil) formation in vitro was determined by flash bleaching extracted pigment and native rod outer segment membranes. Rod outer segment length and photoreceptor cell density were determined in histologic sections through the inferior central retina. Results. Dark-adapted rhodopsin content of retinas from rats <b>reared</b> on sarTlower <b>oil</b> was 12 % to 15 % higher than that of rats raised on soybean oil at every age measured.

To assess feasibility, experimental wetlands mimicking proposed reclamation scenarios were constructed on mining leases. This research assessed the health of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) nesting on these sites where they were naturally exposed to a mixture of chemicals including unrecovered bitumen, naphthenic acids (NAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Endpoints reflecting health were compared among three experimental wetlands and one reference site. In order to specifically investigate toxicity of NAs to birds, an experimental exposure to NAs was also conducted on a subset of nestlings on the reference site. In 2003 and 2004, approximately 50 breeding pairs (total, per year) nesting on the following sites were monitored: Suncor’s “Consolidated Tailings” and “Natural Wetlands”; Syncrude’s “Demo Pond” and “Poplar Creek” reference site. In 2003, reproductive success was very low on OSPM-sites compared to the reference site, but was relatively unaffected in 2004. Compromised reproductive performance in 2003 was linked to harsh weather, during which mortality rates of nestlings reached 100 % on the site with the highest levels of PAHs and NAs, while they did not surpass 50 % on the reference site. In 2004, mortality rates were low but nestlings from OSPM-sites weighed less and showed greater hepatic detoxification efforts (etoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity) than those on the reference site. Furthermore, nestlings on OSPM-sites exhibited higher levels of thyroid hormones and suffered parasitic burdens (Protocalliphora spp.) approximately twice that of those on the reference site. Several of these findings may be associated with low post-fledging survival, suggesting that wet landscape reclamation strategy is not optimal for avian species and may require improvement. As part of a separate study investigating toxicity of naphthenic acids, twenty nestlings from the reference site were randomly selected for an experimental exposure. Nestlings received 0. 1 ml/day of NAs (15 g/L) orally from day 7 to day 13 of age while being reared normally by their free-ranging parents. Nestling growth, hematocrit, blood biochemistry, organ weights and etoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity (EROD) activity appeared unaffected by naphthenic acids. No toxic changes were detected on histopathological evaluation of major organs. These findings suggest that for nestlings <b>reared</b> on <b>oil</b> sands reclaimed sites, exposure to other chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is a greater concern than exposure to NAs. However, this study did not investigate the chronic or reproductive toxicity of naphthenic acids. More research still needs to be conducted as a part of an assessment of the sustainability of wet landscape reclamation because a previous study found that chronic exposure to NAs severely compromised reproduction in mammals...|$|R
40|$|This project uses {{experimental}} {{techniques to}} explore the effects of surface active agent (surfactant) adsorption on a droplet of oil suspended in a flow. The fluorescent surfactant Rhodamine- 6 G was used to enable the use of optical techniques to visualise the build-up of surfactant {{at the rear of}} the droplet and its effects on the internal circulation within the droplet. This was done to enable an exploration of how surfactant accumulates behind a droplet with the aim of predicting the behaviour based on the internal circulation for non- fluorescentt surfactants. An experiment was designed along with calibration procedures in order to utilise the non-intrusive measurement techniques laser-induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry to measure the volume of surfactant held behind the droplet, the angle of the visible cap caused by the build-up of Rhodamine- 6 G, and the cap angle of the stagnant region obtained by measuring the velocity of the circulation within the droplet. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was used to visualise the development of a surfactant-rich cap that formed at the <b>rear</b> of the <b>oil</b> droplet as it rose through an aqueous solution, with different bulk concentrations of surfactant. The aqueous solution soluble surfactant, adsorbed to the forwards facing part of the droplet, was transported around to the rear where it accumulated in a surfactant cap before being swept back into the ow behind the droplet. The fluorescent properties of Rhodamine- 6 G were utilised to measure the size of the visible surfactant cap angle and the volume of surfactant stored within the cap. The results showed that increased concentrations of surfactant caused a larger volume of surfactant to be held behind the droplet with larger droplets resulting in smaller surfactant cap angles. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used {{to explore the}} effects of surfactant at the interface on the internal circulation within the droplet. As surfactant accumulated an area of very low velocity {{at the rear of the}} droplet appeared. This was quantified by measuring the tangential velocity around the droplet with the area of low velocity signifying the presence of a stagnant cap. Measuring the internal velocity around the droplet close to the interface showed that the stagnant cap angle had large growth over the initial region of the tank, with larger droplets resulting in smaller surfactant cap angles. The visible cap angle measured by LIF was related to the stagnant cap angle measured by PIV to compare how the results for each technique developed over the height of the tank. The angles for both techniques exhibited the same trends as the droplet height increased, although they showed different magnitudes revealing that the experimental procedure could be improved in the future to obtain better agreement. ...|$|R
