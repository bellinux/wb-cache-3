A <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> is the unique identification of a vehicle. Automatic <b>Number</b> <b>Plate</b> Recognition (ANPR) is designed to locate and recognize the <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> of a moving vehicle automatically. For Bangladeshi Vehicles there are no fixed rules for <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> like other countries. Because {{of the variety of}} conditions and patterns, the recognition process of <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> for Bangladeshi vehicles is so difficult.

40|$|Automatic <b>Number</b> <b>Plate</b> Recognition (ANPR) is a mass {{surveillance}} system that captures {{the image of}} vehicles and recognizes their license number. ANPR can be assisted in the revealing of stolen vehicles. The recognition of stolen vehicles {{can be done in}} an efficient manner by using the ANPR systems located in the highways.
