In their statement, Singapore Airlines reiterated the points brought up by the Singapore investigators and added that air traffic control (ATC) did not follow their own procedure when they gave clearance for SQ006 to take off despite ATC's not being able to see the aircraft. Singapore Airlines also clarified that the paravisual display (PVD) was meant to help the flight crew maintain the runway centreline in poor visibility, rather than to identify the <b>runway</b> <b>in</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{airport was}} built by the United States Army Air Forces during 1942/43 as an {{axillary}} airfield for Stuttgart Army Airfield, near Stuttgart, Arkansas. It was known simply as Stuttgart Army Airfield Auxiliary #2. The <b>runways</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> today were built during that period. It was used to help train medium bomber and transport pilots, who used it for emergencies on it or practiced touch-and-go landings. It was not manned, {{and at the end}} of World War II it was simply abandoned and the land turned over to local authorities, like many other small auxiliary airfields.|$|R

50|$|The {{airfield}} was {{manned by}} shifts of eight airmen responsible for lighting flare lamps with a portable generator at night that simulated a <b>runway</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> {{with the intention}} of drawing the attention of any German bombers looking to attack an airfield.

5000|$|Prior to arrival, {{the pilot}} might talk with {{air traffic control}} (ATC) over the radio to {{establish}} the <b>runway</b> <b>in</b> <b>use,</b> the circuit height and direction (left or right hand), and the [...] QFE (atmospheric pressure) of the field. If the airfield is not equipped with ATC or radio, the pilot will establish these things before arrival by contacting the airfield prior to departure, or by using weather forecasts and the like.|$|E
50|$|Two runway complexes, West Field and North Field, {{having a}} {{combined}} {{total of six}} 8,500-foot (2,600-meter) runways, were constructed.

50|$|Many airfields have runways {{facing a}} variety of directions. The purpose {{of this is to}} provide {{arriving}} aircraft with the best runway to land on, according to the wind direction. Runway orientation is determined from historical data of the prevailing winds in the area. This is especially important for single-runway airports that do not have the option of a second runway pointed in an alternative direction. A common scenario is to have two runways arranged at or close to 90 degrees to one another, so that aircraft can always find a suitable runway. Almost all runways are reversible, and aircraft use whichever runway in whichever direction is best suited to the wind. In light and variable wind conditions, the direction of the <b>runway</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> might change several times during the day.|$|E
50|$|As the 1960s progressed, {{increased}} urbanization led to {{the closure}} of other general aviation airports in the Washington D.C area to include Beacon Field Airport in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. The closure of that facility resulted in many of its aircraft relocating to the Washington-Virginia Airport. By the mid-1960s over 100 aircraft were housed in Washington-Virginia's hangars or on the fields adjacent to the runways.A 1968 Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association airport directory said that the airport offered fuel, repairs, hangar, flight instruction, and charter services and that bus, taxi, rental cars, food and lodging were also available. The airport's manager was listed as Charles D. Benn. The directory also stated that the airport had only one <b>runway</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> (12/30) as the north-south runway (17/35) had been closed {{at the request of}} the state for safety reasons.|$|E
50|$|Flight 6517 {{departed}} Bajawa Turulelo Soa Airport at 09.00 a.m {{local time}} carrying 46 passengers and 4 crews {{on board with}} an ETA of 9:40 a.m. The flight was uneventful until its landing. First Officer Vunpin was the pilot flying and Captain Aditya was the Pilot Monitoring. At 09:22, the flight crews made first communication with El Tari Control Tower controller (El Tari Tower) and reported their position and maintaining 11,500 ft. The pilot received information that the <b>runway</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b> was 07 and the weather information. Flight 6517 later descended approved their descent clearance of 5.000 ft. At 09.38 local time, the crew reported the aircraft was passing 10,500 ft and stated that the flight was on Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). El Tari Airport then obtained visual contact with Flight 6517 and issued a landing clearance. At 09.51 a.m, the crew reported that their position was on final and the El Tari Tower re-issued the landing clearance. Flight 6517 then retracted its landing gear.|$|E
