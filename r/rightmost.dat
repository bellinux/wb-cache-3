5|$|The two layout forms {{originate}} from two graphic forms of {{presentation of the}} same periodic table. Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks). Also, a common presentation is to put all 15 lanthanide and actinide columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. The fifteenth (<b>rightmost)</b> lanthanide and actinide are d-block elements, belonging to group 3, with scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|Chamunda is {{included}} in the Saptamatrika (seven Matrikas or mothers) lists in the Hindu texts like Mahabharata (Chapter 'Vana-parva'), Devi Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana. She is often depicted in the Saptamatrika group in sculptures, examples of which are Ellora and Elephanta caves. Though she is always portrayed last (<b>rightmost)</b> in the group, she is sometimes referred to {{as the leader of the}} group. While other Matrikas are considered as Shaktis (powers) of male divinities and resemble them in their appearance, Chamunda is the only Matrika who is a Shakti of the great Goddess Devi rather than a male god. She is also the only Matrika who enjoys independent worship of her own; all other Matrikas are always worshipped together.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory {{can be thought of}} as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the <b>rightmost</b> example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.|$|E
5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be {{the starting point of}} all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the <b>rightmost</b> flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be {{in front of the other}} flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three hundred yards away, at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the <b>rightmost</b> 11th Sudanese.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between leftmost derivation and <b>rightmost</b> derivation {{is important because}} in most parsers {{the transformation of the}} input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} whether the parser determines a leftmost or a <b>rightmost</b> derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example LL parsers and LR parsers.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic ink – Some {{areas of}} the euro notes feature {{magnetic}} ink. For example, the <b>rightmost</b> church window on the €20 note is magnetic, {{as well as the}} large zero above it.|$|E
25|$|Left {{vertical}} strokes {{are written}} before enclosing strokes. In {{the following two}} examples, the leftmost vertical stroke (|) is written first, followed by the uppermost and <b>rightmost</b> lines (┐) (which are written as one stroke): 日 and 口.|$|E
25|$|In this example, two numerals {{are being}} added together: 011012 (1310) and 101112 (2310). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the <b>rightmost</b> column, 1 + 1 = 102. The 1 is {{carried to the}} left, and the 0 is written {{at the bottom of}} the <b>rightmost</b> column. The second column from the right is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 102 again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 112. This time, a 1 is carried, and a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 1001002 (36 decimal).|$|E
25|$|Applicative order: The <b>rightmost,</b> {{innermost}} redex {{is always}} reduced first. Intuitively {{this means a}} function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Donald Knuth {{invented the}} LR parser (Left to Right, <b>Rightmost</b> derivation). The LR parser can {{recognize}} any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time. <b>Rightmost</b> derivation has very large memory requirements and implementing an LR parser was impractical {{due to the}} limited memory of computers at that time. To address this shortcoming, in 1969, Frank DeRemer proposed two simplified versions of the LR parser, namely the Look-Ahead LR (LALR) and the Simple LR parser that had much lower memory requirements {{at the cost of}} less language-recognition power, with the LALR parser being the most-powerful alternative. In 1977, memory optimizations for the LR parser were invented but still the LR parser was less memory-efficient than the simplified alternatives.|$|E
25|$|The chmod {{numerical}} format accepts {{up to four}} octal digits. The three <b>rightmost</b> digits refer to permissions for the file owner, the group, and other users. The optional leading digit, when 4 digits are given, specifies the special setuid, setgid, and sticky flags.|$|E
25|$|Suppose for {{simplicity}} {{that the}} multiplicand has three digits. The first digit is the hundreds-digit, the middle digit is the tens-digit, and the last, <b>rightmost,</b> digit is the ones-digit. The multiplier {{only has a}} ones-digit. The ones-digits of the multiplicand and multiplier form a column: the ones-column.|$|E
25|$|For 64-bit PowerPC processors, {{the virtual}} address {{resides in the}} <b>rightmost</b> 64 bits of a pointer while it was 48 bits in the S/38 and CISC AS/400. The 64-bit address space {{references}} main memory and disk as a single address set which is the single-level storage concept.|$|E
25|$|For simplicity, {{consider}} only {{numbers with}} three digits or fewer. To add {{a pair of}} numbers (written in Arabic numerals), write the second number under the first one, so that digits line up in columns: the <b>rightmost</b> column will contain the ones-digit of the second number under the ones-digit of the first number. This <b>rightmost</b> column is the ones-column. The column immediately to its left is the tens-column. The tens-column will have the tens-digit of the second number (if it has one) under the tens-digit of the first number (if it has one). The column immediately {{to the left of}} the tens-column is the hundreds-column. The hundreds-column will line up the hundreds-digit of the second number (if there is one) under the hundreds-digit of the first number (if there is one).|$|E
25|$|Each {{internal}} node’s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if {{an internal}} node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) {{then it must}} have 2 keys: a1 and a2. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than a1, all values in the middle subtree will be between a1 and a2, and all values in the <b>rightmost</b> subtree will be greater than a2.|$|E
25|$|Each {{internal}} node of a B-tree {{contains a}} number of keys. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: a1 and a2. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than a1, all values in the middle subtree will be between a1 and a2, and all values in the <b>rightmost</b> subtree will be greater than a2.|$|E
25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi site {{is divided}} into two reactor groups, the leftmost group - when viewing from the ocean - {{contains}} units 4, 3, 2 and 1 going from left to right. The <b>rightmost</b> group - when viewing from the ocean - contains the newer units 5 and 6, respectively, the positions from left to right. A set of seawalls protrude into the ocean, with the water intake in the middle and water discharge outlets on either side.|$|E
25|$|In two dimensions, the {{convex hull}} is {{sometimes}} partitioned into two polygonal chains, the upper hull {{and the lower}} hull, stretching between the leftmost and <b>rightmost</b> points of the hull. More generally, for points in any dimension in general position, each facet of the convex hull is either oriented upwards (separating the hull from points directly above it) or downwards; the union of the upward-facing facets forms a topological disk, the upper hull, and similarly the union of the downward-facing facets forms the lower hull.|$|E
25|$|Applicative {{order is}} not a {{normalising}} strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define Ω = ωω where ω = λx.xx. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again Ω. Since {{this is the only}} available reduction, Ω has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression KIΩ = (λx.λy.x) (λx.x)Ω is reduced by first reducing Ω to normal form (since it is the <b>rightmost</b> redex), but since Ω has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for KIΩ.|$|E
25|$|Stress is {{generally}} predictable in Unami. The <b>rightmost</b> nonfinal strong vowel is stressed, or a strong vowel in final position {{if it is}} {{the only one in the}} word. Often when stress would be expected to fall on the antepenult it is shifted to the penult. This change is found in three conjunct endings: /-ak/, /-at/, and /-an/. In the last case, the accent shifts to the penultimate /-an/ only if it would otherwise fall on an antepenultimate short vowel, and if the consonant between them is voiced.|$|E
25|$|In {{the base}} 10 numeral system, in almost {{universal}} use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base {{is the number}} of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base10 system, the <b>rightmost</b> digit of a natural number has a place value of1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.|$|E
25|$|When mice {{have more}} than one button, the {{software}} may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (<b>rightmost</b> in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.|$|E
25|$|Algorism {{comprises}} all of {{the rules}} for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value9, the result is represented with two digits. The <b>rightmost</b> digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by {{the value of the}} second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a carry of the value1.|$|E
25|$|The Duke of York drew up {{a daring}} plan of attack that {{amounted}} to an attempt at double envelopment of the Franco-Batavian army. He divided his forces over four columns. The <b>rightmost</b> column, under the Russian Lieutenant-General Hermann, with 9,000 Russians and 2,500 British troops, starting from Petten and Krabbendam, had as objective the village of Bergen. Next to it marched an Anglo-Russian force of 6,500 troops under Lieutenant-General Dundas with as objective Schoorldam. The next column, 5,000 men under Lieutenant-General Pulteney had as objective the area of Langedijk with the hamlets of Oudkarspel and Heerhugowaard. Finally, the fourth column, 9,000 infantry and 160 cavalry under Lieutenant-General Abercromby, was intended to turn the Franco-Batavian right flank, by first attaining Hoorn and then thrusting southward to Purmerend.|$|E
25|$|The 4×4×4 {{and larger}} cubes use an {{extended}} notation {{to refer to}} the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (F B U D L R) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (f b u d l r) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (Rr)l2f means to turn the two <b>rightmost</b> layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.|$|E
25|$|In a {{complete}} binary tree, a node's breadth-index (i − (2d − 1)) {{can be used}} as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit d − 1, where d is the node's distance from the root (d = ⌊log2(i+1)⌋) and the node in question is not the root itself (d > 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit d − 1, the bit values 0 and 1 mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more. The <b>rightmost</b> bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating {{a complete}} binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s.|$|E
25|$|Organizing {{his company}} into {{a battery of}} light artillery. In September Smith's (Mississippi) Battery, as it was named, {{became part of the}} brigade of Brigadier Benjamin F. Cheatham in the Army of Tennessee. It participated in the Battle of Belmont, where it shelled the federal troops on the {{opposite}} river bank and shot on the gunboats that transported U. S. Grant. After the indecisive battle he received praise by commanding Major General Leonidas Polk. At the Battle of Shiloh on April 6 the 6-gun battery was still with the brigade, now under command of Colonel William H. Stephens. It fought an artillery duel with the 1st Minnesota Light Artillery Battery before it formed the <b>rightmost</b> part of Ruggles's Battery. On April 7 a two-gun section under Lt. Eckford fought on the Confederate left; and when the battle ended the battery had swapped three of its pieces for three rifled James cannons. Smith's service was officially noted by General Cheatham.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} {{on the south side}} of Castle Square are all of a similar age but show a great variety of sizes and styles. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is one of the taller buildings at four storeys in height. The slate-tiled gambrel roof has dormer windows and is partly hidden behind a balustrade which sits on top of a parapet and cornice. The façade is stuccoed and projects as a segmental-arched bow front. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. The entrance is in the <b>rightmost</b> of the three bays and is flanked by granite pilasters topped by brackets with foliage decoration. Above this, an iron balcony runs across the full width of the building at first-floor level; this dates from the late 19th century and has finials in the form of interlinked dolphins and crowns, recalling the Borough of Brighton's emblem. Each storey has three windows, but they are treated in various ways; those at first-floor level have architraves, the second-storey windows have a small individual iron balcony with anthemion decoration; and those on the top floor have prominent sills.|$|E
25|$|If the {{computer}} controlling the display knows the exact position {{and color of}} all the subpixels on the screen, it {{can take advantage of}} this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only {{one or two of the}} subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the <b>rightmost</b> portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).|$|E

The mint mark is on the reverse, adjacent to the <b>rightmost</b> pine cone and directly above the letter [...] "O" [...] in [...] "San Francisco".|$|E
500|$|The {{image on}} the left shows the glyph for śrī, which is {{composed}} of the letter ś with a ligature indicating the r below and the vowel [...] ī marked above. Most other conjunct consonants are made with an explicit virama, called al-lakuna or hal kirīma, and the zero-width joiner {{as shown in the}} following table, some of which may not display correctly due to limitations of your system. Some of the more common are displayed in the following table. Note that although modern Sinhala sounds are not aspirated, aspiration is marked in the sound where it was historically present to highlight the differences in modern spelling. Also note that all of the combinations are encoded with the al-lakuna (Unicode U+0DCA) first, followed by the zero-width joiner (Unicode U+200D) except for touching letters which have the zero-width joiner (Unicode U+200D) first followed by the al-lakuna (Unicode U+0DCA). Touching letters were used in ancient scriptures but are not used in modern Sinhala. Vowels may be attached to any of the ligatures formed, attaching to the <b>rightmost</b> part of the glyph except for vowels that use the kombuva, where the kombuva is written before the ligature or cluster and the remainder of the vowel, if any, is attached to the <b>rightmost</b> part. In the table below, appending [...] "o" [...] (kombuva saha ælepilla – kombuva with ælepilla) to the cluster [...] "ky" [...] only adds a single code point, but adds two vowel strokes, one each to the left and right of the consonant cluster.|$|E
500|$|Improving several {{previous}} solutions, [...] {{showed how}} to reconstruct connected orthogonally convex shapes efficiently, using 2-SAT. The idea of {{their solution is}} to guess the indexes of rows containing the leftmost and <b>rightmost</b> cells of the shape to be reconstructed, and then {{to set up a}} 2-satisfiability problem that tests whether there exists a shape consistent with these guesses and with the given row and column sums. They use four 2-satisfiability variables for each square that might be part of the given shape, one to indicate whether it belongs to each of four possible [...] "corner regions" [...] of the shape, and they use constraints that force these regions to be disjoint, to have the desired shapes, to form an overall shape with contiguous rows and columns, and to have the desired row and column sums. Their algorithm takes time [...] where [...] is the smaller of the two dimensions of the input shape and [...] is the larger of the two dimensions.
