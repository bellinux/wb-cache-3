500|$|Pitchfork Media critic Tim Finney {{described}} the album as [...] "a whirlwind trip through bizarre but lovable pop gadgetry that may leave the uninitiated reeling." [...] He complimented the songs' [...] "deathless hooks and multi-genre pyrotechnics" [...] {{and noted that}} they are diverse, varying from different genres while embracing [...] "elements of electroclash, big beat, and even skiffle." [...] Leonie Cooper of The Guardian characterised the album as [...] "slick ... near-faultless high-octane pop all the way"; however, she felt that the ballads were not <b>really</b> <b>necessary,</b> as [...] "Girls Aloud sound far more exciting when they're simply having fun".|$|E

Praising Duerr's use of source material, Stewart notes that many anthropologists would be critical of using ethnographic data to [...] "construct a moral parable" [...] for Western society, and he went on to question whether it was <b>really</b> <b>necessary</b> for Westerners to return to [...] "archaic" [...] modes of thought.|$|E

500|$|Various actresses {{auditioned for}} the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before Lisa Bonet secured the part. Bonet was then known for her role on the family-oriented sitcom The Cosby Show, and her casting in Angel Heart sparked {{significant}} controversy. Parker cast Bonet based on the strength of her audition and was unaware of her role on The Cosby Show. On preparing {{for the role}}, Bonet said, [...] "I did a lot of meditation and a lot of self-inquiry. I did some research on voodoo. My earnest endeavor was really to let go of all my inhibitions.

[...] However, Gleiberman continued, [...] "Mulan finally falls a notch short of Disney's best... because the heroine's empowerment remains... an emotionally isolated quest." [...] Similarly, Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times hailed Mulan as [...] "a strong, engaging character who, unlike many of her Disney counterparts, needs no one to rescue her from danger," [...] while questioning her personality, asking, [...] "was it <b>really</b> <b>necessary</b> to bestow Mulan with self-esteem problems? Because she seems so confident and intelligent, her sad statement that she wants to 'see something worthwhile' in the mirror comes as a bit of a shock." ...|$|E

[...] He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life [...] "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, [...] " [...] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't {{have anything to do with}} the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not <b>really</b> <b>necessary</b> to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now." [...] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be [...] "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it [...] "funny and seditious" [...] by including humor to temper the sinister element.|$|E

500|$|Live Undead is {{the first}} live album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was {{released}} through Metal Blade Records and recorded in New York City {{in front of a}} room of people. It has been questioned by both critics and authors that the audience sound {{may or may not be}} faked. However, in 1984, WBAB Fingers Metal Shop, a radio station, held a contest to meet and hang out with Slayer during a live recording. The album was recorded at Tiki Recording Studios in Glen Cove, NY in front of around a dozen people. The album was originally intended to be recorded in front of a live audience, but things went wrong. Nevertheless, when asked if they were fake, producer Bill Metoyer said, [...] "I don't know if I should tell you." [...] The album begins with an extended introduction of [...] "Black Magic", followed by a small speech. The remaining tracks include both those of 1983's Show No Mercy and 1984's Haunting the Chapel. Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album two and a half out of five stars, and noted that it [...] "isn't <b>really</b> <b>necessary</b> except for the hardest of hardcore fans.|$|E

The angles are awkward, especially when the audience members are shown touching Madonna's hand. Was it <b>really</b> <b>necessary</b> to show a fan coming unannounced on the stage?" [...] Terry Atkinson from the same paper said, [...] "This follows the typical concert video format of putting you in the best seat {{in the hall and}} letting the aura of a superior performer encaptivate your senses." [...] Sylvia Chase from The Wichita Eagle said that [...] "seeing Madonna live in an arena and seeing her up, close and personal in the tour cassette is totally different. The energy, the movements, the provocation—all captures you more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave it a positive review, stating [...] "filmed with abrupt, swooping camera movements that accentuate the singer's flouncing, slightly ungainly style of dancing, Madonna Live vividly captures the contradictory elements that have made the performer into a cultural icon in spite of a shrill, limited singing voice. In close-up, Madonna's provocative pouts, wiggles and come-hither glances become a more than half-deliberate burlesque of erotic centerfold photography. Both her post-disco music and defiant strut suggest a child's parody of grown-up posturing." ...|$|E

The performance was confirmed by James Corden on BBC Radio 2 several hours prior to the ceremony, following rumours that circulated for several weeks. Beyoncé appeared on stage wearing a shimmering, floor-length sequin blue gown designed by Vrettos Vrettakos containing 140,000 blue zircon crystals and big earrings. The singer performed {{in front of a}} simple set of flashing neon lights along with fireworks and lasers on a screen as well as smoke surrounding her dedicating the performance to her fans. Sam Lansky of Time magazine praised the simplicity of the performance as [...] "classy and spare" [...] and wrote that the singer [...] "more than did it justice" [...] with her [...] "pretty much peerless" [...] vocals. MTV News' Emily Blake favorably reviewed the performance as more [...] "subdued" [...] in comparison with the other live shows by Beyoncé.

Vanity Fair writer Josh Duboff described the performance as [...] "powerful and fairly straightforward, sedate even". E!

There was no extra glitz or glamour (not <b>really</b> <b>necessary</b> with a dress like that) or backup dancers and crazy antics. The singer's main focus were her powerhouse vocals". Mark Savage of BBC News opined, [...] " [...] unbilled, stripped-back performance of XO was undoubtedly the night's most flawless vocal". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described her as [...] "clearly the star of the show". However, Mark Sutherland of the Rolling Stone gave a mixed review about the performance saying it was [...] "a bit... dull". At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, Beyoncé performed [...] "XO" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album.
