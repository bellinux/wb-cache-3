In late 2007, after {{settling}} down in a more permanent residence, she explained that she [...] "didn't want to be alone" [...] but that [...] "it wasn't {{a way of life}} ... not very consistent." [...] She had a series of car accidents that were widely reported, in August 2004, October 2005, and November 2006, when she suffered minor injuries because a paparazzo who was following her for a photograph hit her car.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Lohan had two lead roles. The first film, Disney's teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, {{earned a}} {{domestic}} box office total of $29million, with Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo commenting {{that it was}} [...] "well above expectations as it was strictly for young girls." [...] But the film did not meet with critical acclaim. Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "though still a promising star, Lohan {{will have to do}} a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions." [...] Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. Based in part on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes, the film stars Lohan as a previously homeschooled 16-year-old learning to navigate the social cliques of a public high school. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, [...] "cementing her status as the new teen movie queen." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy." [...] David Rooney from Variety said that [...] "Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing." [...] Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star. Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. With Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly. Vanity Fair described how she became a household name. Paparazzi began following her and her love life and partying became frequent targets of gossip sites and the tabloid media. Following Mean Girls, which was scripted by former [...] "Not <b>Ready</b> <b>For</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Time</b> Actress" [...] Tina Fey and featured several other veterans of Saturday Night Live's [...] "Not <b>Ready</b> <b>For</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Time</b> Company," [...] Lohan hosted the show three times between 2004 and 2006. In 2004, when Lohan was 17, she became the youngest host of the MTV Movie Awards and in 2006 she hosted the 2006 World Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News, who did {{not like}} [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] proved the series could be funny. He {{specifically}} complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism. Simon wrote, [...] "It's all very bitter social satire, and if it weren't on Comedy Central, believe me, no one in networkland would think it <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time.</b> And you know what else? It's funny." [...] Likewise, The Washington Post critic Tom Shales strongly criticized [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", but said the second episode was funny and included [...] "cleverly intertwined" [...] plot-lines. Shales said, [...] " [...] suggests the show may be an attempt at satire and not just poopy humor ... Yes, it's still sick and still twisted, but somehow this episode at least appears to have some comic ingenuity behind it, whereas the first was just a smutfest." [...] In 2006, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was identified by Winnipeg Free Press {{as one of the}} ten most memorable South Park episodes, and ranked twelfth in a list of the top 25 greatest Cartman moments, as determined by voters on the Comedy Central website. The Daily Record in Scotland listed the episode's ending, and the [...] "Beefcake!" [...] line, as one of the six most memorable moments in the series.|$|E
