5|$|In 1995, Schumacher and Williams driver David Coulthard were disqualified {{for fuel}} irregularities, after a switch to Renault engines and Elf oils. On appeal, both drivers had their results and points reinstated, but both teams lost the points the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> {{normally}} have earned in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|Miller's form {{mirrored}} {{the rest of}} the Hibs team as it went into a slump in 2010, leading to the departure of Hughes. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved <b>results</b> <b>would</b> bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a top-level player. Miller expressed a desire to stay at Hibs in March 2011, but the two parties did not agree a new contract, which allowed him to leave the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who {{he was going to}} vote for and the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{not include}} the 1985 winner, Bernard Hinault. An El Mundo Deportivo writer believed LeMond, Moser, and Saronni to be the favorites to win the overall crown. In addition, the writer felt that Pedro Muñoz had the best chances to win the race, out of all the Spanish riders entering the event. Atala-Ofmega sports director Franco Criblori believed that Saronni's <b>results</b> <b>would</b> depend on what form he could maintain in the mountains. In addition, Criblori thought Dutchman Johan van der Velde and Swiss rider Niki Rüttimann were two foreigners to consider for a high place in the general classification.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys {{should return to}} Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more actionable requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{computational}} random number generators, generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work. <b>Results</b> <b>would</b> sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables.|$|E

25|$|The {{result is}} {{unbiased}} in that if, for example, 0.3 {{were added to}} 0 with rounding to nearest a hundred times, the <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be 0, but with stochastic rounding, the average value of the <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be 30, {{which would be the}} value obtained without rounding.

25|$|Usually, good <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be {{expected}} from plastic surgery that emphasize careful planning of incisions so that they fall within the line of natural skin folds or lines, appropriate choice of wound closure, use of best available suture materials, and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the first}} round of auditions was completed, the series moved to the Criterion Theatre, where further auditions saw the judges decide on a group of 50. Unusually, this was the final point at which the judges had direct control over the contestants' fates, as the {{remainder}} of the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be driven solely by viewer voting.|$|E

25|$|Cho won the 8th Kisei title, {{defending}} {{it against}} Rin Kaiho. For {{the fourth time}} in 5 years, Cho faced Otake Hideo in the Meijin final. He went down 3 games again, only to win 4 straight games and defend his Meijin for the 5th time. His <b>results</b> <b>would</b> have to be called a success, he failed once more to make the Honinbo League.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} concert, the pieces {{that were to}} carry a 17Hz {{undertone}} were swapped so that test <b>results</b> <b>would</b> not focus on any specific musical piece. The participants were not told which pieces included the low-level 17Hz near-infrasonic tone. The presence of the tone resulted in a significant number (22%) of respondents reporting feeling uneasy or sorrowful, getting chills down the spine or nervous feelings of revulsion or fear.|$|E
25|$|The Commission {{stated that}} it is {{continuing}} its investigation into {{who was responsible for}} the disposal of human remains in this way, that it has also asked the relevant State authorities {{to take responsibility for the}} appropriate treatment of the remains, and that it has notified the coroner. Minister for Children, Katherine Zappone said that the coroner's <b>results</b> <b>would</b> determine the direction of the investigation and that the commission will determine if other sites need to be excavated, including another part of the Tuam site.|$|E

If my thumb was pointed to the left or offside as I let the ball go, the <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be legbreak. If it pointed to the right or legside the <b>result</b> <b>would</b> be a wrong'un.

25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's source {{languages}} {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} source languages were used, the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|E
25|$|Some {{stations}} lack {{proper and}} safe approach roads, thus deterring passengers from reaching the stations. A study jointly conducted by Southern Railways and CMDA is currently in progress, and the survey <b>results</b> <b>would</b> help to identify the infrastructure problems that hinder ridership on MRTS and Mono Rail {{on the need to}} provide infrastructure like ramps, skywalks, nearby bus stops and pedestrians walkways. Access to the Chennai MRTS remains a crucial issue to the line's success, as it does not fully integrate with other modes of transportation in the city,.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{interesting}} coincidences {{of the war was}} that the Germans had already developed their own version of chaff under the code-name Düppel, and had tested it near Berlin and over the Baltic. However, Hermann Göring was worried that if they used Düppel over the UK, the RAF would quickly copy the concept and use it against them. As Bomber Command's fleet was rapidly growing, the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> likely be greatly in the RAF's favour. Learning from past mistakes when older material had leaked, Göring had most of the paperwork on Düppel destroyed.|$|E

25|$|It {{had also}} been {{announced}} that, unlike the previous two years, a 50:50 mix of jury and televoting would return to EMA to select the winner, however in previous years, {{the results of the}} jury had not been consistent with public opinion and it would be unknown how the jury <b>results</b> <b>would</b> pan out {{on the night of the}} contest. As well as this, there would be no super final to be held against the top two songs, with only one televoting round being held to select the winner.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen's Drivers' Championship {{was briefly}} put into doubt when race {{stewards}} began an investigation after identifying possible fuel irregularities in the cars of Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld following post-race inspection. Their disqualification and a race reclassification {{would have seen}} Hamilton lifted from seventh to fourth in the race result. However the race stewards decided that no sanctions would be given, meaning the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> stand. McLaren appealed against the decision, however the FIA Court of Appeal rejected their appeal on 16 November 2007 thus confirming Räikkönen as the champion.|$|E
25|$|A {{construction}} {{site for a}} section of the new line was announced publicly on 30 March 1999. The Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit justified this {{in the absence of a}} financial agreement with the federal government. About DM 650million had previously been invested by the company in the project. The Federal Ministry of Transport and Communications emphasised that the project would be re-examined and that the <b>results</b> <b>would</b> be available within weeks. At the end of May 1999, it became apparent that the project would not be realised in the planned form, especially due to the substitution of cheaper materials.|$|E
