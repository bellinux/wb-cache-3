40|$|Although it is {{generally}} believed that bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs should not be combined in vivo, in vitro experiments using the checkerboard dilution technique revealed no antagonism between penicillin/cephalothin and <b>rolitetracycline</b> but rather additive or synergistic activity of either drug combination in 40 to 50 % of 20 Escherichia coli, and 14 Staphylococcus aureus strains. Slight antagonism occurred only between 3 and 8 h after combining penicillin/cephalothin and <b>rolitetracycline</b> in either bacteriostatic or bactericidal concentrations, but not after 24 h of incubation, nor was antagonism found with combinations of these drugs in bacteriostatic concentrations. Neither bacteriostatic nor bactericidal activity of penicillin/cephalothin and <b>rolitetracycline</b> was inhibited by pretreatment of one E. coli strain with bacteriostatic <b>rolitetracycline</b> or bacteriostatic penicillin/cephalothin concentrations. Penicillin and cephalothin could exert a bactericidal effect after 2 -h exposure of the E. coli strain to bacteriostatic <b>rolitetracycline</b> concentrations. Combined action of subinhibitory penicillin and <b>rolitetracycline</b> concentrations resulted in more pronounced inhibition of growth than either drug alone. The higher activity of penicillin/cephalothin in combination with <b>rolitetracycline</b> on some E. coli and S. aureus strains {{might be due to}} a better access of <b>rolitetracycline</b> into bacterial cells whose cell walls have been weakened by cell wall-active, bactericidal drugs. Thus, growth of penicillin-induced spheroplasts of E. coli and stable staphylococcal L-forms was inhibited by much lower concentrations of <b>rolitetracycline</b> than were the corresponding parent cells with intact cell walls...|$|E
40|$|The minimal {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} 45 antimicrobial agents were determined for 14 strains of Bacterium actinomycetem comitans (Actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans). All the strains showed good susceptibility to tetracyclines and chloramphenicol, {{but not to}} lincomycins. Some strains were clearly resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and nitroimidazoles. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were observed with tetracycline, <b>rolitetracycline,</b> methacycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{covalent}} immobilization of tetracycline and <b>rolitetracycline</b> over anionic collagen membranes {{and the drug}} release studies {{as an effort to}} develop a two stage drug release based on diffusion (fast release) and on the rate of membrane biodegradation (slow release). Independent from casting conditions antibiotics incorporated by dispersion were released in the range from 80 to 100 % within 7 hours in concentrations significantly higher than those described for the prevention of bacterial growth. Antibiotic release within this period was predominantly diffusion controlled. Covalent immobilization by a modified azide procedure occurred with preservation of collagen structure independently from pH of casting and reaction conditions. Its expected that anionic collagen membranes with dispersed and covalently bound <b>rolitetracycline</b> or tetracycline, in association with conventional therapy, may significantly reduce membrane induced infections observed post-implantation, one of the major problem associated with periodontal ligaments reconstruction by the Guided Tissue Regeneration procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{activity was}} determined at different intervals {{of time on}} plasma samples, taken from rats treated with {{a certain number of}} commonly used antibiotics, and kept at − 20 C up to 8 weeks. The results of the microbiological assays demonstrate that the stability of the antibiotics in the frozen plasma decreases in the following order: oxytetracycline > cephalexin, streptomycin, erythromycin > demeclocycline > ampicillin, amoxycillin > penicillin G, cephaloridine, <b>rolitetracycline,</b> and tetracycline...|$|E
40|$|Accidental intra-arterial {{injection}} of intramuscular antibiotic preparations {{is described in}} 3 cases in infants. In 2 benzathine penicillin was injected, and in 1 <b>rolitetracycline.</b> The clinical features are dominated by arteriolar obstruction which produces gangrene of the most severely affected limb. In addition, neuroloigcal involvement occurs when vessels to nerves or spinal cord are involved. The arteriolateral aspect of the thigh is preferable to the buttock as a site for intramuscular injection, and a short (2. 5 cm) needle {{should be used to}} minimise the risk of intra-arterial injection...|$|E
40|$|An International Standard for <b>Rolitetracycline</b> {{has been}} {{established}} and the international unit of this antibiotic defined as the activity contained in 0. 001004 mg of the international standard. The definition of the international unit {{was based on the}} results of a collaborative assay in which 8 laboratories in 6 different countries participated; a total of 133 assays were performed. The assay was in terms of the Working Standard of the USA Food and Drug Administration; mean potencies for individual laboratories varied within a range of only 2 % of the mean for all assays although 7 different test organisms were used in both diffusion and turbidimetric assays. Individual assays, however, provided potencies that varied within a range of 40 %...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{pathological}} features of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Cellular toxicity {{has been shown to}} be associated with fibrillar forms of Abeta; preventing this fibril formation is therefore viewed as a possible method of slowing disease progression in Alzheimer's disease. With the use of a series of tetracyclic and carbazole-type compounds as inhibitors of Abeta fibril formation, we here describe a number of common structural features that seem to be associated with the inhibitory properties of these agents. Compounds such as carvedilol, <b>rolitetracycline</b> and daunomycin, which are shown to inhibit Abeta fibril formation, also prevent the formation of species of peptide that demonstrate biological activity in a human neuroblastoma cell line. Molecular modelling data suggest that these compounds have in common the ability to adopt a specific three-dimensional pharmacophore conformation that might be essential for binding to Abeta and preventing it from forming fibrils. Understanding such drug-peptide interactions might aid the development of disease-modifying agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of cyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, and <b>rolitetracycline),</b> macrolides (erythromycin, spiramycin, roxithromycin, and lincomycin), quinolones (norfloxacin and ofloxacin), rifampin, thiamphenicol, tobramycin, metronidazole, vancomycin, phosphomycin, and cephalosporins (cephalexin, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefuroxime, ceftriazone, cefotaxime, and cefoxitin) were evaluated on Plasmodium falciparum clones, using an isotopic, micro-drug susceptibility test. Only tetracyclines, macrolides, quinolones, and rifampin demonstrated in vitro activity against P. falciparum, which increased after a prolonged exposure (96 or 144 h). In {{the presence of}} iron (FeCl 3), only the activities of tetracyclines and norfloxacin were decreased. Their in vitro activity against intraerythrocytic stages of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum and their efficacy in vivo favor the use of antibiotics as antimalarial drugs. However, due to their slow antimalarial action and {{to the fact that}} they act better after prolonged contact, they probably need to be administered in conjunction with a rapidly acting antimalarial drug, such as a short course of chloroquine or quinine...|$|E
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for {{the determination of}} oxytetracycline (OTC), 4 -epi oxytetracycline (4 -epi OTC), tetracycline (TC), 4 -epi tetracycline (4 -epi TC), chlortetracycline (CTC), 4 -epi chlortetracycline (4 -epi CTC), doxycycline (DC), minocycline (MINO), methacycline (META) and <b>rolitetracycline</b> (ROLI) residues in muscles was developed. The procedure consisted of an oxalic acid extraction followed by protein removal with trichloroacetic acid. Further solid phase clean-up on polymeric (Strata X) reversed phase columns was performed to obtain an extract suitable for LC-MS/MS analysis. The tetracyclines were separated on a C 18 analytical column with mobile phase consisting of 0. 01 % formic acid in acetonitrile and 0. 01 % formic acid in water in gradient mode. The method was validated according to the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The recoveries of all target compounds were 91. 8 % – 103. 6 %. The decision limits were from 109. 0 to 119. 8 μg/kg and detection capability varied {{within the range of}} 122. 2 to 137. 6 μg/kg, depending on the analyte...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of new antibiotics, Doxycycline (DOT C) and <b>Rolitetracycline</b> (Roli-TC) {{with the use of}} intravenous administration in urinary tract infections, a well-controlled open study was carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1) Any significant difference between the efficancy of these two drugs in urinary tract infections could not be found with the statistical analysis using x 2 -test, direct probability, multiple regression analysis, and discriminant analysis with calculated sample score by quantification theory. 2) A simple mathematical values calculated on the efficacy of these drugs with the incidence of the significant or efficient therapeutic results were 56. 5 % in DOTC-group and 42. 0 % in Roli-TC-group. And the incidence of the side-effects, including anorexia, flare, slight increase of serum GOT and GPT, and 1 case of allergic hives, and 3 cases of paralysed feeling of the tongue, were 3. 2 % in DOTC-group and 7. 8 % in Roli-TC-group. Four cases in Roli-TC-group dropped out due to lack of post-administrative clinical data, including one case of exanthema as the side-effect...|$|E
40|$|Pleural {{effusion}} {{represents a}} frequent feature both of Hodgkin's (HL) and non-Hodgkin's (NHL) lymphoma. The {{aims of the}} present study were: 1) to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of thoracoscopy as compared to pleural cytology in patients with lymphoma and concurrent pleural effusion; and 2) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} chemical pleurodesis with the tetracycline derivative, <b>rolitetracycline.</b> Seventeen patients with pleural effusion and concurrent lymphoma (10 NHL and seven HL) were studied. Analysis of pleural fluid revealed the presence of lymphoma cells in six cases (four NHL and two HL); histopathological examination of samples obtained by thoracoscopy was consistent with pleural infiltration by NHL in eight cases and by HL in six cases. Overall sensitivities of pleural cytology and histology were 35 and 82 %, respectively. Following chemical pleurodesis, complete response was observed in five of the 17 cases (two NHL and three HL), partial response in four cases (two NHL and two HL), whereas failure was observed in the remaining eight cases. Two patients who had presented failure underwent subsequent pleurectomy by thoracotomy (one case of HL) or video-thoracoscopy (one case of NHL). Complete response was observed in both cases following this treatment. No major complication was recorded after chemical pleurodesis or pleurectomy. Thoracoscopy may be considered a useful tool to evaluate the involvement of pleural space in patients presenting with pleural effusion in the course of lymphoma. Chemical pleurodesis plays an important role in the palliative treatment of this condition. Further studies are necessary to assess the role of pleurectomy in the treatment of such patients...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic and {{antifungal}} agents used in {{supportive care}} regimens for {{bone marrow transplantation}} recipients contribute to a significant dose-modifying effect of otherwise lethal total body irradiation. To determine whether drugs used in supportive care and other commonly used antibiotics such as tetracycline function as radiation protectors or damage mitigators in vitro, 13 drugs were tested for radiation protection and radiation damage mitigation of 32 D cl 3 hematopoietic progenitor cells in clonagenic survival curves in vitro. Antibiotic/Antifungal agents including cilastatin, amikacin, ceftazidine, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, methacycline, minocycline, meclocycline, Oxytet racycline and <b>rolitetracycline</b> were added in 1, 10, or 100 micromolar concentrations to murine interleukin- 3 -dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line 32 D cl 3 cells either before or after irradiation of 0 to 8 Gy. Control irradiated 32 D cl 3 cells showed radiosensitivity comparable to freshly explanted mouse marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (D 0 1. 1 ± 0. 1 Gy, Ñ 15 ± 0. 4). Positive control GS-nitroxide JP 4 - 039 (known radiation mitigator) treated 32 D cl 3 cells were radioresistant (D 0 1. 2 ± 0. 1, Ñ 5. 8 ± 2. 4 (p= 0. 009)). Of the 13 drugs tested, tetracycline {{was found to be}} a significant radiation mitigator (D 0 0. 9 ± 0. 1, Ñ 13. 9 ± 0. 4 (p= 0. 0027)). Thus, the radiation dose-modifying effect of some antibiotics, but not those currently used in the supportive care (antibiotic/antifungal regimens) for marrow transplant patients, may act as radiation damage mitigators for hematopoietic cells as well as decreasing the growth and inflammatory response to microbial pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{structural}} {{information of}} drug targets, cellular toxicity possessed by lead compounds, and {{large amounts of}} potential leads are the major issues facing the design-oriented approach of discovering new leads. In an attempt to tackle these issues, we have developed a process of virtual screening based on the observation that conformational rearrangements of the dengue virus envelope protein are essential for the mediation of viral entry into host cells via membrane fusion. Screening was {{based solely on the}} structural information of the Dengue virus envelope protein and was focused on a target site that is presumably important for the conformational rearrangements necessary for viral entry. To circumvent the issue of lead compound toxicity, we performed screening based on molecular docking using structural databases of medical compounds. To enhance the identification of hits, we further categorized and selected candidates according to their novel structural characteristics. Finally, the selected candidates were subjected to a biological validation assay to assess inhibition of Dengue virus propagation in mammalian host cells using a plaque formation assay. Among the 10 compounds examined, <b>rolitetracycline</b> and doxycycline significantly inhibited plaque formation, demonstrating their inhibitory effect on dengue virus propagation. Both compounds were tetracycline derivatives with IC 50 s estimated to be 67. 1 µM and 55. 6 µM, respectively. Their docked conformations displayed common hydrophobic interactions with critical residues that affected membrane fusion during viral entry. These interactions will therefore position the tetracyclic ring moieties of both inhibitors to bind firmly to the target and, subsequently, disrupt conformational rearrangement and block viral entry. This process can be applied to other drug targets in which conformational rearrangement is critical to function...|$|E
