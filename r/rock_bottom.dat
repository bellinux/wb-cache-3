5|$|In mid-2000, a love {{triangle}} storyline began featuring McMahon, Triple H and Kurt Angle. The storyline {{continued at}} Unforgiven when Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree following a low blow from McMahon, proving her loyalty to him. McMahon later became Angle's manager {{and was in}} his corner when he defeated The Rock for the WWF Championship at No Mercy. The alliance was short lived, however, as after The Rock performed his <b>Rock</b> <b>Bottom</b> maneuver on McMahon at No Mercy, Triple H attacked Angle, considering it his fault that McMahon was hurt due to her managing Angle at the time. On the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw, McMahon lost the WWF's Women's Championship to Lita despite the interferences from Angle and Triple H after special referee, The Rock, performed a spinebuster on McMahon.|$|E
50|$|Reefs are breaks {{that have}} <b>rock</b> <b>bottoms</b> instead of sand bottoms. They have deeper {{channels}} {{next to the}} shallower water which gives a good form to the wave. They can often force waves to shoal quickly from deep to shallow water causing large and hollow surf.|$|R

At WrestleMania 32, The Rock announced that WWE had broken the all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock defeated Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan in an impromptu match, giving him a <b>Rock</b> <b>Bottom</b> and pinning him in six seconds, which set {{the record for the}} fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by the returning John Cena to fend off the remaining members of The Wyatt Family, Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman.

As revenge for the Attitude Adjustment Cena had given him on Raw, Rock hit Cena with the <b>Rock</b> <b>Bottom,</b> allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the People's Elbow. The following night on Raw, Cena challenged The Rock to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year, which Rock accepted.

He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon.

50|$|This worm can be {{confused}} with other species, particularly the closely related Phyllodoce mucosa, so its precise range is unclear; it {{is present in the}} Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, the Skagerrak and Kattegat, the western Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel. Its depth range is from the intertidal zone down to about 400 m, and it is found on sand, muddy-sand, shelly gravel and <b>rock</b> <b>bottoms.</b>|$|R

5|$|Roaring Brook then {{enters the}} Elmhurst Reservoir, where it briefly enters Roaring Brook Township before {{entering}} Elmhurst Township and receiving the tributary White Oak Run from the right. The stream continues flowing north-northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 435 and reentering Roaring Brook Township several tenths {{of a mile}} further downstream. It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary <b>Rock</b> <b>Bottom</b> Creek from the right as its valley becomes much deeper and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest {{for more than a}} mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 before turning south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering Roaring Brook Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little Roaring Brook from the right before turning south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 before turning southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at <b>rock</b> <b>bottom</b> now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams in the same order.|$|E

50|$|Females usually lay 300-500 eggs {{contained}} in a sticky gel, but have been reported lay as many as 1000 eggs in captivity. The female deposits her fertilized eggs in several different locationswithin the breeding water: on vegetation, <b>rocks,</b> <b>bottom</b> of the pool, or anything else thatanchors the eggs. After mating, females return to their burrows. Males stay at the breeding pool and continue vocalizing until females stop arriving (presumably because all females in the vicinity have mated); then the males also return to their burrows.|$|R

Jericho reversed it into his own Sharpshooter, but The Rock got to the ropes to break the hold. Jericho then applied the Walls of Jericho, but The Rock countered it into a roll-up. The Rock hit a <b>Rock</b> <b>Bottom,</b> as Mr. McMahon came down to ringside. The Rock went for the pinfall but McMahon distracted the referee.
