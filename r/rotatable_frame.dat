40|$|Abstract. The small {{landslide}} {{physical model}} testing frame {{was designed and}} made in order to analyze the induction mechanism of landslide by rainfall and reservoir water level variation by adopting the physical model tests. It is consisted by exterior frame, internal body box, water supply and discharge pipelines, hoisting jacks and steel rollers. Some functions such as uniform sample preparation, confined effect reduction, lifting flexibility as well as water level change simulation and so on are realized through some design technologies like removable model frame, adjustable width, <b>rotatable</b> <b>frame</b> body,mobile model frame and water supply and discharge pipeline and so on...|$|E
30|$|Every {{pixel sensor}} is mounted within an {{aluminium}} jig, three jigs are in turn mounted {{on each of}} the two aluminium arms. The jigs feature a beam window around the position of the sensor location, minimising the material budget. Lightproof Kapton foils of 25 μm thickness protect the sensors on each side. The overall material of the beam telescope thus amounts to 300 μm of silicon and 300 μm of Kapton. The two telescope arms, usually one up- and one downstream of the DUT, are movable along the direction of the beam in order to allow for variably sized DUTs to be fitted into the set-up. The minimal distance between two sensors is given by the jig thickness of 20 mm, the maximal distance is restricted by the length of the aluminium arms to 150 mm at equidistant spacing. Furthermore, the jigs are cooled keeping the MIMOSA 26 sensors at a constant temperature of typically 18 °C for stable operation. The entire beam telescope is placed on a <b>rotatable</b> <b>frame</b> easing adjustment of its orientation parallel to the beam. Additionally, this frame is mounted on a sturdy structure providing stability over time and wheels for easy transportation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{measurement}} setup to identify bending and torsional properties of ice hockey sticks with similar stiffness and length from various manufacturers during static bending and torsion tests on a test stand. The test stand is composed of a clamp system, a spindle lifting gear with a load cell and three distance sensors. For the bending test the ice hockey sticks were clamped to the test stand and a three point load test simulated real conditions. To bend the stick identically to an actual wrist shot the supports were positioned in order that the distance of the supports conforms to the distance between the hands of an ice hockey player during a wrist shot. Three different loads of 150, 200 and 250 N were applied on ten test positions along the hockey sticks’ shaft and blade. For the torsion test the hockey sticks were also clamped to the test stand, but the second support was removed. A special <b>rotatable</b> <b>frame</b> was mounted on five different positions along the shaft down to the blade where torque was applied (29, 43. 5 and 58 Nm). The bending test showed that the differences increase with increasing distance to clamping position and higher loads. At each position the deviation of stick B is higher compared to the deviation of stick A, despite similar FLEX values. The results for the torsion tests show that the torsion of stick A is higher compared to the torsion of stick B. This trend could be observed at each position and torque. With the same torque applied at the same position the torsion angle of stick A is twice as high compared to stick B. Based on the findings of this research further studies of how the different bending and torsional properties affect the accuracy and speed of actual wrist shots will be performed in the near future...|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} {{combined}} subtemporal presigmoid and suboccipital retrosigmoid multidirectional approach {{with the aid}} of a <b>rotatable</b> head <b>frame</b> (periauricular three-quarter twist-rotation approach) in 20 cases of petroclival meningiomas. Patients were placed in the lateral decubitus (park-bench) position. The head is twisted, rotated, and positioned 30 degrees face down in the Sugita <b>rotatable</b> head <b>frame.</b> By rotating this head frame, a 30 - to 60 -degree face-down position can be obtained when the suboccipital retrosigmoid route is used. Alternatively, the straight lateral or slightly brow-up position is obtained when the subtemporal presigmoid route is used. This twist-rotation approach provides multiple trajectories through the petroclival region with minimal drilling of the petrous bone, fatigue of the surgeon, and retraction of the brain...|$|R
50|$|Under an {{internally}} funded project, {{the firm}} Lorenz AG developed a pulse-modulated set. The Heer contracted {{for a few}} sets for Flak (anti-aircraft) support, but then this mission {{was transferred to the}} Luftwaffe. Over several years, Lorenz was unsuccessful in selling new versions called Kurfürst and Kurmark (both Holy Roman Imperial terms). As the war continued, a need was seen by the Luftwaffe for additional radars. Lorenz again modified their sets to become the Tiefentwiel, a transportable system built to complement the Freya against low-flying aircraft, and the Jagdwagen, a mobile unit used for air surveillance. These 54-cm (560-MHz) units with plan-position indicators, had two antennas backed by parabolic, mesh reflectors on <b>rotatable,</b> forked <b>frames</b> that lifted above the equipment cabin. Starting in 1944, both of these systems were produced by Lorenz for the Luftwaffe in relatively small numbers.|$|R
40|$|PatentA sensor for {{remotely}} detecting an {{angular position}} of a shaft <b>rotatable</b> within a <b>frame</b> includes: first means for generating collimated first, second, third, and polarized optical beams; second means positioned proximate to the first means for receiving and combining the first. second, third, and polarized optical beams into a composite optical beam having an intensity; and a code wheel fixedly mounted to the shaft and interposed {{between the first and}} second means. The code wheel includes first, 'second, and third channel mask patterns and a first polarizing filter positioned to transect the first, second, third, and polarized optical beams, respectively. Interaction between the code wheel and the light beams results in the composite light beam being encoded such that the angular position of the wheel is functionally related to the intensity of the composite opitical beam. The sensor further includes third means operably coupled to receive the composite optical beam for providing an output corresponding to the angular position of the code wheel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the behaviors and stability of rock strata surrounding an entry with bolt supporting in large dip coal seams (LDCSs) dipping from 25 ° to 45 °, a self-developed <b>rotatable</b> experimental <b>frame</b> for similar material simulation {{test was used to}} build the model with the dip of 30 °, based on analyses of geological and technological conditions in Huainan mine area, Anhui, China. The strata behaviors, such as extracting- and mining-induced stresses development, deformation and failure modes, were synthetically integrated during working face advancing. Results show that the development characteristics of mining-induced stress and deformation are asymmetrical in the roadway. The strata behaviors are totally different in different sections of the roadway. Because of asymmetrically geometrical structure influenced by increasing dip, strata dislocating, rock falling and breaking occur in roof. Then, squeezing, collapsing and caving of coal happen in upper- and lower-rib due to shearing action caused by asymmetrical roof bending and dislocating. Owing to the absence of supporting, floor heaving is very violent and usually the zone of floor heaving develops from the lower-rib to upper-rib. Engineering practices show that, due to the asymmetrical characteristics of rock pressure and roadway configuration, it is more difficult to implement bolt supporting system to control rock stability of roadways in LDCSs. The upper-rib and roof of entries are the key sections. Consequently, it is reliable to use asymmetrical bolt-mesh-cable supporting system to control rock stability of roadways based on the asymmetrical characteristics of roadway configuration and strata behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Since 2006 an {{underground}} laboratory is in operation in Unirea salt mine from Slanic Prahova Romania. A new rotatable detector for {{measurements of the}} directional variation of the muon flux has been designed and will be put in operation {{at the end of}} 2013. The detector will be used to investigate the possible presence of unknown cavities in the salt ore. Preliminary muon flux measurements performed in the underground of Slanic Prahova salt mine show an important variation of the flux with the thickness of the rock but indicate also that more precise data are necessary. Based on that, a modern detector using 4 layers of plastic scintillators bars has been designed. The detector is installed on a <b>rotatable</b> and mobile <b>frame</b> which allows precise directional measurements of the muon flux on different locations in the mine. In order to investigate the performances of the detector, detailed Monte Carlo simulations have been performed using several codes available on the market. The simulations show that the detector can be used for measurements of the differential flux of cosmic ray muons and for the detection of hidden cavities in the ore...|$|R
