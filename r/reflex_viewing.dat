2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

50|$|The final {{configuration}} of the camera could run 1-30 frames per second. The Origin II camera featured an optical <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> system with rotating mirror similar to 35 mm film cameras and uses standard PL mount 35 mm film gate lenses.

40|$|This brief review {{summarizes}} {{work done}} in mammalian neuroscience concerning the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of four neuronal types; Cerebellar Purkinje cells, inferior olivary cells, thalamic cells, and some cortical interneurons. It is a personal perspective addressing an interesting time in neuroscience when the <b>reflex</b> <b>view</b> of brain function, as the paradigm to understand global neuroscience, began to be modified towards one in which sensory input modulates rather than dictates brain function. The perspective of the paper is not a comprehensive description of the intrinsic electrical properties of all nerve cells but rather addresses a set of cell types that provide indicative examples of mechanisms that modulate brain function...|$|R
5000|$|Minolta {{created a}} new {{category}} of [...] "bridge cameras," [...] {{with the introduction of}} the DiMAGE 7. Designed for use by people familiar with 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras but without the added cost or complication of interchangeable lenses or optical reflex viewfinders, the DiMAGE incorporated many of the features of a higher-level film camera with the simplicity of smaller compact digicams. The camera had a traditional zoom ring and focus ring on the lens barrel and was equipped with an electronic viewfinder (EVF) rather than the direct optical <b>reflex</b> <b>view</b> of an SLR. It added other features such as a histogram, and the cameras were compatible with Minolta's flashes for modern film SLRs.|$|R
25|$|A Class 2M laser is safe {{because of}} the blink <b>reflex</b> if not <b>viewed</b> through optical instruments.

50|$|The instant clip-on {{design of}} the camera {{magazine}} of the Caméflex and later the NPR, ACL, EX16 and PANORAM models' coaxial magazines revolutionized filmmaking, in particular documentary films, since magazine changes could now be made in seconds without the need to spend time lacing the film in the camera. The ACL model used a focal plane shutter for exposure and a side-to-side oscillating mirror for <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> to keep the camera body size to a minimum. A handheld Eclair camera {{was used in the}} shower scene in the 1960 film, Psycho.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, Arri {{introduced}} the Arriflex 16ST, the first professional 16mm camera with a <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> system. In 1965, a self-blimped 16mm camera was released: the Arriflex 16BL. The Arriflex 35BL followed in 1972 as a lightweight, quiet {{alternative to the}} rather heavy and cumbersome blimped cameras of the time. Also in 1972, Arri pioneered the development of daylight luminaires with the Arrisonne 2000 W. The Arriflex 16SR, launched in 1975, featured a redesigned viewfinder with a through-the-lens light meter. The Arriflex 765, a 65mm camera, was released in 1989, partly {{in response to the}} growing industry demand for 70mm release prints.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{models were}} copied {{in whole or}} in part by the U.S.S.R., mostly models which were {{intended}} for filming animation or special effects process plates, or for high-speed filming. In a few cases, the U.S.S.R. added spinning mirror-shutter <b>reflex</b> focusing and <b>viewing,</b> thereby deleting the Mitchell-designed rackover focusing mechanism and the Mitchell-designed side viewer.|$|R
50|$|Parallax {{also affects}} optical {{instruments}} such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens <b>reflex</b> cameras that <b>view</b> objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; {{this process is}} known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, {{and there is a}} device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.|$|R

50|$|Prior to WWII Leica and {{competing}} Contax cameras from Zeiss Ikon {{were considered to}} be the finest 35mm cameras, but post-WWII the companies had competition from Soviet and Japanese copies. During the 1950s Japanese quality and innovation, along with low pricing, devastated the European camera industry. Leica became an expensive type of camera bought largely by professional or serious photographers. However, the advent of reflex camera technology made rangefinders somewhat obsolete, leaving Leica the main product of a diminishing market segment. Despite never using <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> or consumer digital production to any major extent, Leica has remained a notable trade-name into the 21st Century.|$|E
50|$|The {{optional}} {{motor drive}} for the F3, {{known as the}} MD-4, contained either 8 AA batteries or a special NiCd battery pack that would be recharged. Its performance surpassed that of past Nikon models, with a capability of 4 frames per second with uninterrupted <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing,</b> or 6 frame/s with the reflex mirror locked up. The integral seamless design of the MD-4 motor drive made it an extremely popular option for many F3 users. A bulk film back could be fitted {{in lieu of the}} normal back to the F3. This film back, known as the MF-4, was capable of handling up to 10 meters (33 ft) of 35mm film, or 250 exposures.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, Arnold and Richter {{developed}} their first film camera, {{the small and}} portable Kinarri 35. In 1937, Arri introduced the world's first reflex mirror shutter in the Arriflex 35 camera, an invention of longtime engineer Erich Kästner. This technology employs a rotating mirror that allows a continuous motor to operate the camera while providing parallax-free <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> to the operator, {{and the ability to}} focus the image by eye through the viewfinder, much like an SLR camera for still photography. The reflex design was subsequently used in almost every professional motion picture film camera and is still used in the Arri Alexa Studio digital camera. The first Hollywood film to employ an Arriflex was the 1947 Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall film Dark Passage in 1947. Over the years, more than 17,000 Arriflex 35s were built. The design was recognized with two Scientific and Technical Academy Awards in 1966 and 1982.|$|E
40|$|Work {{accidents}} can be {{traumatic events}} {{that might give}} rise to a variety of dysfunctional stress responses. An integrated assessment of stress responses after work-related trauma is considered as a valuable approach in clinical practice. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess affective adjustment after work-related accidents using a multidimensional assessment. Fourteen males who had experienced work-related accidents and 13 male controls were assessed using self-report instruments and the recording of skin conductance response and the startle <b>reflex</b> during the <b>viewing</b> of standardized trauma-related and trauma-unrelated pictures. Participants who underwent a work accident reported more severe maladjustment symptoms than controls, as indicated by higher Post-traumatic stress disorder Symptom Scale (PSS) scores. Moreover, participants with higher PSS scores showed more severe depressive symptomatology and general psychopathology, and lower psychophysiological reactivity than participants with lower PSS scores. Long-lasting maladjustment problems after work-related accidents influence various affective domains even many years after the traumatic event. In those individuals who showed higher post-stress symptoms, an integrated assessment highlights a lack of concordance between self-reported symptoms and physiological activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis is the {{attitude}} of political parties {{to the implementation of}} gender quotas and their approach to feminism as well. The thesis looks at the differences between the opinions of individuals, for example, whether there is a different approach between men and women. Also another important aspect is the influence of the European Union and for example the divergent approach of the politicians of the particular parties in the EU, compared to their Czech counterparts. The context of this issue is the historical development of feminism in Czech Republic, ir in Czechoslovakia, which is important for understanding the current state. The stigmatization of feminism, which {{has its roots in the}} 1990 s, is reflected in both public and political views today. The second contextual level is the public's attitude, which is also influenced by the anti-feminist wave, and I believe that whose <b>views</b> <b>reflex</b> our political representatives.

50|$|Single-lens <b>reflex</b> (SLR) cameras <b>viewed</b> {{the scene}} through the taking lens. Early SLRs were plate cameras, with a {{mechanism}} to insert a mirror between the lens and the film which reflected the light upwards, where it could be seen at waist level on a ground glass screen. When {{ready to take the}} picture, the mirror was pivoted out of the way (without moving the camera). Later SLRs had a mechanism which flipped the mirror out of the way when the shutter button was pressed, followed immediately by the shutter opening. Instead of a waist-level arrangement, a prism was used to allow the camera to be held to the eye. The big advantage of the SLR was that any lens, or other optical device, could be used; the viewfinder always showed exactly the image that would be projected onto the film. The live preview feature of digital cameras share this advantage of the SLR, as they also show the image exactly as it will be recorded, with no additional optics or parallax error.|$|R
50|$|Instead of the M42 {{screw mount}} used by Pentax and other camera manufacturers, Nikon had {{introduced}} the three-claw F-mount bayonet lens mount system, {{which is still}} current in a more modified form today. The focal plane shutter had titanium foil blinds and was rated for 100,000 shutter releases. At the time, other SLRs used cloth blinds, which had the disadvantage {{that it was possible}} to burn a hole into the cloth of the shutter during mirror lock-up in bright sunlight.The F was also a modular system camera, with various assemblies such as the viewfinders; the focusing screens; the special 35 mm roll film 250 exposure film back and two Speed Magny film backs--one using the Polaroid 100 (now 600) type pack films, and another designed for 4x5 film accessories, including Polaroid's own 4x5 instant film back. Each of these assemblies could be fitted and removed, allowing the camera to adapt to almost any particular task. It was the first 35 mm camera offered with a successful motor drive system as opposed to a film winder. It was capable of firing up to 4 frames per second (mirror locked up) or 3 frames per section with full <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> maintained.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, as a {{response}} to an increased demand for 65 mm cameras (in the mid-80's Steven Spielberg had wanted to film Empire of the Sun in Super Panavision 70 but didn't want to work with the old 65 mm camera equipment), Panavision introduced an updated line of 65 mm cameras and optics known as [...] "Panavision System 65" [...] and was monikered on Advertising and Release prints as [...] "Panavision Super 70", which was designed to compete with the parallel development of the Arri 765 camera. The new System 65 camera was Self-Blimped, with <b>Reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> designed as the 65mm cousin to the 35mm Panaflex camera (and used many of the same accessories). Only two System 65 cameras were ever built--and the small fleet of old 65mm Hand-Held Reflex cameras had their lens mounts modified to accept the System 65 lenses. The System 65 lenses were all a medium-format variant of lens designs from the (then) current line of Panavision Primos. All System 65 telephoto lenses (i.e. 300 mm, 400 mm, 500 mm) were converted Canon telephotos. In the wake of the box office failure of the first Panavision System 65/Super 70 feature, the Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman/Ron Howard directed vehicle, Far and Away, combined with the fact that 35 mm digital stereo sound had arrived and minimized the multi-channel sound advantage the 70 mm format had, meant that a hoped-for renaissance in 65/70 mm film production never really took off.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} obtaining {{polarized}} photographs of the solar corona during total eclipse is described. The required equipment is a <b>reflex</b> <b>viewing</b> type camera with a lens of adequate focal length to give {{an image of the}} corona a few millimeters in diameter at the focal plane. A sheet of linear polarizing filter material is placed {{directly in front of the}} lens. The filter is mounted in such a way so as to permit a set of four exposures of equal length to be taken after totality begins. Since the light of the corona is highly polarized, the resultant set of photographs will show marked differences in the shape of the corona...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} study, was to {{investigate}} the jaw-opening reflexes in TMD patients and bruxists {{in order to get a}} better understanding of these disorders. At the beginning, it was decided to study the reflexes evoked in the masseter muscle by electrical stimulation across the lip in healthy subjects. The aim was to find the threshold at which each of the significant responses occurred and {{to investigate}} the effect of reversing the polarity of the stimulus electrode on the pattern of reflexes. A sequence of inhibitor, excitatory, inhibitory and excitatory responses could be produced in the muscle by both polarities of stimuli. It was found that stimulation of nerves supplying the skin outside the mouth evokes predominantly long-latency jaw reflexes whereas short-latency responses can be evoked by stimulating nerves supplying oral mucosa. Furthermore, long-latency excitatory reflexes seem to be the most easily evoked by stimulation of the lip. Another aim of the study was to investigate whether difference could be observed between bruxists and non-bruxists in response to electrical stimulation of the lip. In both groups, there were significant differences in the thresholds of the different responses. Also, there were differences between the two groups in the presence of the short-latency excitation and the long-latency inhibitory responses. These findings suggest that long-latency inhibitory responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the lip are weaker in bruxists than in non-bruxists. Finally, jaw reflexes in TMD patients were investigated to determine whether differences could be detected in electrically-evoked inhibitory and excitatory responses. Moreover, the occlusal splint is one of the most universally accepted forms of therapy in TMD patients and it was possible that these splints might have an effect on the pattern of jaw <b>reflexes</b> in <b>view</b> of their therapeutic effect...|$|R
25|$|The {{shell is}} dextral, not decollate, light corneous, fragile, glossy and rather translucent. It is very slender, with a nearly cylindrical, narrow, upper third and a {{spindle-shaped}} lower part. The shell has 12-15 moderately convex whorls separated by an indented, relatively deep suture. Protoconch is glossy, teleoconch whorls are with obtuse growth-lines, {{which are more}} rib-like on the more narrowly sculptured, cervical part of the last whorl. Peristome is double; inner lip recognizable as a narrow ridge, contacting the body whorl and closing the umbilicus (visible in not fully grown specimens); outer lip very strongly thickened, with some prominent growth-ridges, tube-like protruding. Neck is with {{a more or less}} clearly developed basal crest. Aperture is obliquely pear-shaped to narrowed elliptical, with a sinulus bordered by the lamella parietalis and a knob on the peristome, whitish inside. Peristome is continuous, white, broadly <b>reflexed.</b> In frontal <b>view,</b> the prominent lamella parietalis (= superior), and the more inconspicuous lamella columellaris (= inferior) and plica principalis are seen, whereas the frontal end of the lamella subcolumellaris is usually discernible as a blunt denticle. The lamella parietalis is connected with the spiralis, which reaches as far as the lamella subcolumellaris inside, i.e. hardly further than the columellaris; there is no lamella inserta. Ventro-laterally, next to the plica principalis, there are four short, nearly parallel plicae palatales. Clausilial blade is rather broad, curvature of its outer border dictated by the position of the short palatal plicae.|$|R
40|$|Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is {{a disease}} of later life that is {{currently}} regarded {{as a form of}} neurodegenerative tauopathy. Disturbance of gaze is a cardinal clinical feature of PSP that often helps clinicians to establish the diagnosis. Since the neurobiology of gaze control is now well understood, it is possible to use eye movements as investigational tools to understand aspects of the pathogenesis of PSP. In this review, we summarize each disorder of gaze control that occurs in PSP, drawing on our studies of 50 patients, and on reports from other laboratories that have measured the disturbances of eye movements. When these gaze disorders are approached by considering each functional class of eye movements and its neurobiological basis, a distinct pattern of eye movement deficits emerges that provides insight into the pathogenesis of PSP. Although some aspects of all forms of eye movements are affected in PSP, the predominant defects concern vertical saccades (slow and hypometric, both up and down), impaired vergence, and inability to modulate the linear vestibulo-ocular <b>reflex</b> appropriately for <b>viewing</b> distance. These vertical and vergence eye movements habitually work in concert to enable visuomotor skills that are important during locomotion with the hands free. Taken with the prominent early feature of falls, these findings suggest that PSP tauopathy impairs a recently evolved neural system concerned with bipedal locomotion in an erect posture and frequent gaze shifts between the distant environment and proximate hands. This approach provides a conceptual framework {{that can be used to}} address the nosological challenge posed by overlapping clinical and neuropathological features of neurodegenerative tauopathies...|$|R

40|$|Our study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} extroversive disorders during childhood and later delinquent behavior in adulthood. In this context, the ascertainment of autonomous and psycho-physiological parameters is of great significance. Diminished willingness to respond in CD children with and without ADHD {{as well as in}} antisocial adults produces reliable and in part similar findings. Psychometric self and third-party assessment tests using standard forms were additionally drawn upon. Our results showed a diminished skin conductance reaction and a lack of startle <b>reflex</b> potentiation when <b>viewing</b> negative and/or positive pictures. Precisely the weakened skin conductance reaction to all emotional stimuli points unavoidably to a condition of being unemotionally cold, e. g. lack of anxiety or lack of empathy, as in CD children with or without ADHD. One study which confirms this fact is from Hare 1978 and Raine 1997. This proved that psychopaths, even in anticipation of danger, exhibited no deviation in their barely existent experience of anxiety, which is best seen in the electrodermal parameter (Arnett 1997). According to our results, a diminished sense of emotion represents a common characteristic in our CD children with and without ADHD and in psychopaths and can thus be seen as a valid risk factor in our clinical group for the development of delinquency in adulthood. In the psychometric tests, especially with the CBCL externalising scale, it was confirmed that an obviously increased aggressive behaviour emanates from CD children with and without ADHD. This result, however, is surely to be considered somewhat carefully, as one cannot say, from whom more aggressiveness emanates; from children with only CD or from the combination of DS with ADHD. All in all, tendencies are exhibited in the children we examined with a dysfunction in social behaviour with or without ADHD, which can be used valid risk factor indicators for the development of delinquency in adulthood. Biological or social factors (Venables 1987), which may not be ignored in our class society, could {{play a role in the}} incidence of dissociality. In contrast to earlier studies, a study by Löhrer from the year 2003 showed in a direct comparison between children with ADHD and ADHD+CD, that there was no indication of an increased risk for later delinquent behaviour in the ADHD group. The fact that, prior to Löhrer’s study, the combination of ADHD and CD had not been considered, could be an explanation for this discrepancy. This makes clear how important the unambiguous assignment to the differing extroversive dysfunctions during childhood and adolescence is, in order to be able to discuss a later dissociality...|$|R
