5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her.|$|E
25|$|Vainio's track {{season was}} <b>really</b> <b>strong.</b> In June 1984, he competed {{five times in}} 5000 metres, the weakest result being 13:30.40, and once in 10,000 metres with his all-time second best result 27:41.75. At the Bislett Games on 28 June, he broke Lasse Virén's Finnish record in 5000 metres and {{finished}} second after Fernando Mamede with the result 13:16.02. In July, he competed only three times; first two times in the Finnish Championships on July 6–8 in Kajaani, where he took the gold medals after solo runs in both 5000 metres (13:24.99) and 10,000 metres (28:06.85), and the third time when improving his 3000 metres record to 7:44.42 in Varkaus on 12 July. According to a Vainio interview in 2004, he took his next injection after the Rotterdam Marathon around 10 July, and was sure that this time period would be long enough to allow metabolism to take its effect and ensure a negative test at the Olympics.|$|E

500|$|Like {{producers}} before him, Dupri commended Carey's vocal abilities, [...] "she {{can pretty}} much do anything with her voice. She's <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> vocally." [...] Another musical craft the song featured was the inclusion of heavy background vocals of her lower registers, with Carey then belting and singing the higher notes over her background vocals and melody, creating a [...] "double voice effect." [...] When discussing the technique used in the background vocals, Carey said: ...|$|E

60|$|And this {{is really}} all {{that we can do}} when we fight {{something}} <b>really</b> <b>stronger</b> than ourselves; we can deal it its death-wound one moment; it deals us death in the end. It is something if we can shock and jar the unthinking impetus and enormous innocence of evil; just as a pebble on a railway can stagger the Scotch express. It is enough for the great martyrs and criminals of the French revolution, that they have surprised for all time the secret weakness of the strong. They have awakened and set leaping and quivering in his crypt for ever the coward in the hearts of kings.|$|R
500|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{documentary}} premiered on Channel 4 on December 14, 2005. I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was not released commercially {{and was only}} viewed on MTV and Channel 4.

'I have a <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> belief that any movement needs both radicals and liberals,' she explained. 'You always need women who can walk into the room in the right way, talk in the right tone of voice, {{who have access to}} power. But you also need a bottom line.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Amnesty International urged police not {{to dismiss}} {{alternative}} possible motives. Amnesty's Piers Bannister informed press that [...] "We {{do know that}} there's {{a high level of}} homophobia in Jamaica, so there was a possibility that it was a hate crime. Many hate crime victims are robbed afterward. We're not saying it wasn't a robbery; we just want a full investigation." [...] Schleifer publicly stated that it is [...] "really important to investigate [...] thoroughly.

500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and I think I understand the question as there's some <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> elements of drama." [...] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: [...] "Gilroy and I were laughing pretty much the whole movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Economic {{evidence}} indicates the crisis {{may have more}} to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March 2013: [...] "... the <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> relationship within the [...] is between interest spreads and current account deficits, which is in line with the conclusion many of us have reached, that the euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis, not a debt crisis".

500|$|Initially {{modeling}} {{his writing}} style on {{the songs of}} Woody Guthrie, the blues of Robert Johnson, and what he termed the [...] "architectural forms" [...] of Hank Williams songs, Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it [...] "with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry". Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: [...] " [...] early songs were very rich... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalist James Poniewozik of Time {{magazine}} commented of {{the episode}} [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "It {{was the kind of}} twist Glee can sell, partly {{because of the way the}} characters are established (in retrospect, you can see how a <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> woman who rejects him is a turn-on for Puck) and because of how well its cast (Ashley Fink has been killing it as Lauren, and sells her confidence and abrasiveness in a way that makes her a person, not an engineered positive-body-image model). And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on-the-nose song choices, [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] was just a perfect choice and performance—not just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding Madonna's {{influence}} on the record industry and younger artists, Debbie Gibson's then manager Doug Breitbart commented: [...] "Madonna has brought back a <b>really</b> <b>strong,</b> melodic component to pop music. She has a very youth-oriented, up, bubbly, fun sound." [...] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 60 on their list of [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] and stated that [...] "True Blue was the album on which it became readily apparent that Madonna {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan pop star." [...] They added, [...] "It's when she began manipulating her image—and her audience—with a real sense of clarity and purpose and made sure she had quality songs to back up her calculation and world-dominating ambition." ...|$|E

The track, entitled [...] "Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down", appeared on Keys' fourth studio album The Element of Freedom which was released in December 2009. The original version, entitled [...] "Empire State of Mind Part 2", included both Keys' vocals and a new rap verse from Jay-Z, but the final product did not include Jay-Z. Discussing the record, Keys claimed that it acts as a dichotomy of strength and vulnerability, commenting that [...] "The music is <b>really</b> <b>strong,</b> and the drums are really aggressive, but my voice is vulnerable and delicate".|$|E
500|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives {{was named}} {{as one of}} the best albums of 2001 by several publications, {{including}} Pitchfork, Ottawa Citizen and Rolling Stone. The Globe & Mail named it the seventh best album of the year, with Carl Wilson writing that [...] "of all the electronica-glich-IDM this year, [...] is the only one I go back to as if it were the Rolling Stones." [...] In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000-2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that [...] "Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> reaction from people- some that want to kill me, 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop or something, and I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was <b>really</b> <b>strong</b> out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
