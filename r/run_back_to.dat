5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

This enrages The Prepper, who orders the player to leave the safe house and vows to outlive the Ravens of Dee. After the player leaves, the Prepper (who has been using {{survivors}} to stock his food supplies) finds a new lackey to do his bidding in a cutscene. The player reaches Sondra and leaves London as the RAF (the prophecy's Black Angels) destroy the city.|$|E

25|$|Endurance Course. This is an {{individual}} test comprising a challenging 6 mile (9.65 kilometres (km)) course whilst carrying 21 lb (9.5 kilogrammes (kg)) ·fighting order and personal weapon. The first two miles consist of undulating woodland terrain featuring obstacles such as tunnels, pipes, wading pools and an underwater culvert. The latter four miles (6.43 km) remain an obstacle-free metalled road return <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> CTCRM. Candidates are to complete this in 73 minutes.

25|$|Verites is a {{contraction}} of Oliverites (Oliver Walford, School Usher 1838–55) and hence 'Verites' is pronounced {{as if the}} 'Ver' is from Oliver not as from 'very'. The records of the house <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the start of the}} last century, but previously it was just called 'Boarders House No.2'. Girdlestonites' first housemaster was Frederick Girdlestone, who was said to walk like a duck. Girdlestonites has therefore been unofficially known as 'Duckites' ever since, but since this was 'insulting' slang it was never written down or used officially. This latter restriction has now largely fallen by the wayside and even the school magazine uses Duckites in print occasionally.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{passengers}} survived the collision. Passengers {{who were able}} to see downstream became aware of the rapidly closing motions of the vessels, and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent. Fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty. Three others were briefly trapped under the George Prince. The last survivor had <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his vehicle, thinking he would be safer in his truck. After the collision, he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window. Only one survivor had a life jacket before going into the water, but had not had time to put it on. Two others found life jackets floating in the river, which they used for a short time, but neither man had time to properly don the life jackets.|$|E

25|$|When {{war broke}} out in September 1939, Monte Pascoal was in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Departing on 10 September without {{passengers}} and two of her crew having refused to sail, she made a successful <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Germany, arriving at Hamburg on 14 October 1939. On 11 January 1941, Monte Pascoal was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine. She {{was used as an}} accommodation ship at Wilhelmshaven. On 3 February 1944, the United States Eighth Air Force bombed Wilhelmshaven. Monte Pascoal was set afire and was scuttled. She was refloated on 12 May and beached. In May 1945, she was seized as a prize of war by the United Kingdom. On 5 August 1946 she departed from Wilhelmshaven for Hamburg. Monte Pascoal was scuttled in the Skaggerak on 31 December 1946 with a cargo of obsolete gas bombs on board.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1923, Duff {{learned of}} a new 24Hour race {{to be held at}} Le Mans. He was the first entrant. W. O. Bentley, the founder and then-owner of Bentley Motors, thought it was madness and that no car would finish. In the face of Duff’s determination, he agreed to have the car {{prepared}} at the factory and let his test driver, Frank Clement, partner Duff. The Duff/Clement Bentley was one of the fastest cars, Duff setting the fastest lap at 9 mins 39 sec for the 10.726 mile lap. Rough track conditions took their toll as a flying stone holed the fuel tank, forcing Duff to <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pits. As only the drivers could work on the cars, Clement had to bicycle back with a can of gas to power the car back to the pits. Despite the drama, Duff and Clement finished a strong fourth. More importantly, W.O. Bentley, who only went over at the last minute, became hooked on Le Mans, the race that would make his cars famous.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{before the}} raid, the German Navy {{believed}} that the British had a strong force in the North Sea, off Norway and another at Hoofden and off the south-east coast of England. The Germans intended to sneak out between the two forces to bombard the English coast and then attack whichever British force showed first. With luck, the German battlecruisers could engage the south-east force and after defeating it would <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the north-west, meeting the northern group {{in the area around}} Terschelling Bank. Here the battlecruisers would attack the second British group from the south and {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet would attack from the north. If successful, the High Seas Fleet would be able to destroy significant elements of the British fleet before the main body of the British Grand Fleet could assist, reducing or eliminating the Royal Navy′s numerical superiority. If the British did not take the bait, then merchant ships could be captured and British units off the coast of Belgium destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The Eagles {{failed to}} recover their ensuing onside kick attempt, with Christian Fauria {{catching}} the ball cleanly and sliding down to seal possession for New England. The Patriots then played it safe by running the ball 3 times and forcing Philadelphia {{to use all}} of its timeouts. New England punter Josh Miller then pinned the Eagles back at their own 4-yard line with just 46 {{seconds left in the}} game. Philadelphia then tried one last desperate drive to win or tie the game. But on first down, McNabb was pressured into making a rushed pass to Westbrook at the line of scrimmage. Instead of dropping the pass to stop the clock, Westbrook made the mistake of catching the ball and was immediately tackled for no gain, keeping the clock running and forcing the Eagles to <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the line of scrimmage for their next play with no huddle. On second down, McNabb threw an incomplete pass intended for Owens. Finally on third down, McNabb threw a pass that deflected off of the outstretched fingertips of Smith and into the arms of Harrison for an interception with nine seconds left. Tom Brady took a knee to run out the clock, clinching the 3rd Super Bowl title in 4 years for the Patriots, and {{in the eyes of many}} establishing themselves as a dynasty.|$|E

Polla tells Lupus that Felix is away at Rome, and Lupus <b>runs</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the grotto to free the children himself. When he communicates this, Pulchra confides shamefully that her mother has spells of mental illness, and her father rarely leaves the house for that reason. Lupus cuts the children free, but just as they are about to escape, the pirates find them and seize Flavia, threatening to kill her if they don’t stand still. Lupus manages to get away again, and <b>runs</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the villa, praying that Felix will be there.|$|R

Astronomer, capsule, and Selenite fall through space and land in an ocean on Earth, where they are rescued by a ship and towed ashore. The final sequence (missing from some prints of the film) depicts a celebratory parade {{in honor of the}} travelers' return, including a display of the captive Selenite and the unveiling of a commemorative statue bearing the motto [...] "Labor omnia vincit".|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} of NC State is the Krispy Kreme Challenge. In this race, students {{meet at the}} University's Memorial Bell Tower, then run to a Krispy Kreme shop [...] away (changed from [...] in 2012). Each student must eat twelve glazed doughnuts, then <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Bell Tower within one hour. The Challenge was listed {{as one of the}} [...] "102 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate" [...] by Sports Illustrated. Proceeds from the race go to the NC Children's Hospital. In 2014, 8,000 runners participated and the committee raised $200,000 bringing the cumulative total donated to the NC Children's Hospital to $758,000 since the race's inception.|$|E
2500|$|Java (November 27, 1966) – Two tube-like Muppets (which were {{designed}} by Frank Oz) dance to the Al Hirt song [...] "Java." [...] Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off a fire extinguisher. It {{should be noted that}} as the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the [...] "Java" [...] music through the speakers in the elevator so he knew exactly how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage {{just in time for the}} climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!).|$|E

2500|$|Leaving Masten, {{the trail}} crosses Hoghouse Run, {{one of many}} streams along the path. It follows parts of several old roads and grades, and modern hiking and {{cross-country}} skiing trails, including the Sharp Shinned Ski Trail. At just over [...] the trail reaches Rock Run, which has worn [...] a series of pools into the rock near a camping area. Another camping area used for the first night stop is at Doe Run, [...] along the trail. There are picturesque views of the McIntyre Wild Area of the Loyalsock State Forest across Rock Run. The Old Loggers Path next reaches Buck Run, then climbs Sullivan Mountain and reaches Pleasant Stream, a tributary of Lycoming Creek. The road along Pleasant Stream is the old Susquehanna and New York Railroad bed, and the trail crosses the stream at [...] - there is no bridge. Tom Thwaites writes of Sharp Top Vista, at : [...] "I {{find it hard to}} understand why this view isn't famous.

2500|$|The {{first group}} of {{anti-tank}} dogs arrived at the frontline {{at the end of}} the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by [...] "special departments" [...] (military counterintelligence). Out of the {{first group of}} 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers. Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Soviet Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.|$|E
2500|$|He then {{consulted}} with a distillation expert, James A. Moffett, who was operating the Camden {{branch of the}} Standard Oil Company of Parkersburg, Moffett was convinced that dye manufacturing could be profitable and invested money in Bloede & Rathbone. [...] Dye manufacturing was organized as a separate entity named the American Aniline Works. [...] The founders of the new company had little dye making experience so they read German texts on the subject. There was no money left for new equipment, {{so they had to}} rely on scrapped equipment they obtained from the Standard Oil junk pile. [...] Instead of a heavy cast iron nitrator, an old boiler shell with a capacity of 1,000 gallons (3785 Litres) was fitted with a central shaft of horizontal wrought iron paddles. [...] The valve regulating the flow of acid into the nitrator was operated by a wire several hundred feet away. The operator would periodically run close enough to the nitrator to read the thermometer and <b>run</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> safety. [...] Cooling was accomplished by running cold spring water over the top and sides of the nitrator, keeping the reaction within a range of five degrees Fahrenheit. This procedure resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 pounds (3175 – 3628kg) of nitrobenzene per batch. In 1883 he established himself in Baltimore as a chemist and manufacturer of chemical products; and decided that there was a wide field for improvement in the methods then in use in chemical factories. Applying his skills he made tremendous advances in the chemistry business, mainly in the methods of dyeing cotton fabrics; and between 1890 and 1895 he obtained 15 or 20 patents for his chemical processes, {{one of the most important}} patents being his process for the dyeing [...] "sun-fast", unfading shades.|$|E
