50|$|The {{number of}} one bits is checked by the {{receiver}} to tell if an error {{has occurred in the}} transmission of the character. There should be three ones in each character received. The return channel will include the <b>RQ</b> <b>signal</b> if an error is detected.|$|E
50|$|An extra symbol {{labelled}} α shows a start polarity, {{and another}} symbol labelled β indicates a steady stop polarity. So {{a stream of}} β characters will be sent if {{there is nothing else}} to send. The α and β symbols are called idle signals. The third symbol used is the <b>RQ</b> <b>signal</b> used to request a retransmit.|$|E
50|$|A seventh bit {{is added}} to the {{character}} to indicate parity. Odd parity is used so that the number of stop polarity elements (1) is always odd. The parity bit is checked by the receiver to tell if an error has occurred in the transmission of the character. The return channel will include the <b>RQ</b> <b>signal</b> if an error is detected.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier recovery arrangement (100) for recovering an input modulated signal (R(t)), down- converted {{by a local}} oscillator with a frequency different from the carrier frequency of the input modulated signal (R(t)) such that a distorted down-converted signal (RQ(t)) is provided. It comprises a delay means (14) for introducing a time delay into the distorted <b>signal</b> (<b>RQ</b> (t)), a mixer (4) adapted to multiply the received distorted signal (RQ(t)) with the delayed distorted signal and to provide an adjusted output signal, (Radj(t)), with a distortion term, a low pass filter (5) adapted to extract a signal comprising the second harmonic of the distortion term from the adjusted output signal (R adj (t)) related to twice the frequency difference (2 Δω) between the local oscillator and the carrier frequency of the input modulated signal (R(t)), and means for removing modulated data from said signal to provide a recovery signal free from modulated data {{that can be used}} to eliminate the distortion...|$|R
5000|$|The ARQ-M {{characters}} are remapped to a seven bit {{system so that}} there are always three bits on and four bits off. The ARQ code is a Moore code, which can detect the modification of any single bit. This alphabet is CCITT Telegraph Alphabet No. 3 aka TOR No. 3. This differs from the alphabet used in the ARQ-E single channel system. [...] Three additional control signals are added to the 32 from the Baudot set. Out of 128 seven bit characters there are 35 that have three one bits set, so allowing for the 32 Baudot and three control codes to just be accommodated. The extra control {{characters are}} RQ, meaning request repeat, α meaning constant space condition, which may indicate the end of a connection (break signal) or be used to signal information, such as a number to connect to, and the β character, meaning constant mark condition, used when there is nothing to send. The <b>RQ</b> <b>signal</b> is also called Signal Roman one and may be designated [...] "I".|$|E
