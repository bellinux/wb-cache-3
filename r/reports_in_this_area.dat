As proof-of-concept, we applied our approach to the prediction of early mortality in patients initiating kidney dialysis. We found that molecular markers are not uniformly prognostic, but instead vary in their value depending on a combination of clinical variables. This may explain why <b>reports</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> aiming to identify prognostic markers, without taking into account clinical variables, are either conflicting or show that markers have marginal prognostic value.

In 10 % FBS, the migration of confluent BAEC and BPEC into the denuded area was not affected by HGrav or MGrav. However, in low FBS (0. 5 %), signficantly retarded migration under MGrav, and increased migration under HGrav was found. MGrav also decreased the migration of postconfluent BPEC while HGrav showed no difference. Both MGrav and HGrav strongly decreased the migration of postconfluent BAEC.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{formation}} of phytosterol oxidation products (POP) and to evaluate and optimize an analytical method for the determination of POP in food products. The cholesterol lowering effect of phytosterols (PS) and phytostanols {{has been known for}} more than half a century and many <b>reports</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> have been published. During the last decade the intake of PS has increased and products enriched with PS and phytostanols have been launched on the commercial market. Due to their chemical structure, PS are susceptible to oxidation at various sites in their structure. In the present study, oxidation products from the major phytosterols, sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, were generated through autoxidation at elevated temperature. POP from both the ring-structure and side-chain structure were separated by preparative TLC and characterized using GC, GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is less {{known as}} a disease causing pain syndromes, {{although}} pain is found in 40 - 80 % of PD patients, as described by the very few <b>reports</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> of research. Moreover, in some PD patients, pain is so severe and intractable that it overshadows the motor symptoms of the disorder. Still, pain in PD frequently goes under acknowledged and undertreated. Also, the studies regarding pain perception in the existing animal models of PD are very few. We experimentally induced the PD model in rats by injecting subcutaneously one dose of 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 20 mg/kg, while the control group received saline. The behavioral testing for pain included the hot-plate task and was performed 7 days after MPTP injection. In this way, our rat model resulted from the acute treatment with a low dose of MPTP, exhibited an increased sensitivity to pain perception, {{as demonstrated by the}} significant decrease in the values of the latency time in hot-plate for rats treated with MPTP, as compared to the controls.

40|$|Prior {{empirical}} {{studies suggest that}} cognitive impairment is the strongest predictor of capacity to consent to research among persons with schizophrenia. Yet, despite the fre-quency and importance of cognitive deficits and impaired decisional capacity in schizophrenia, the scope of neuropsy-chological testing in most published <b>reports</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> has been relatively narrow. In the present study of 70 people with schizophrenia aged 40 to 70 years we evaluated decisional capacity with the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research (MacCAT-CR). Participants were also evaluated with standardized rating scales of psychopathology and level of insight and with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery that per-mitted evaluation of 7 specific cognitive abilities. Results showed that the strongest correlates of capacity (particu-larly, {{understanding and appreciation of}} disclosed informa-tion) were cognitive test scores, but there was little evidence of differential relationships between individual cognitive abilities and specific dimensions of capacity. Understand-ing was also correlated with severity of negative symptoms and of general psychopathology, but not with age, educa-tion, severity of positive or depressive symptoms, or level of insight. Understanding improved over successive presenta-tions of consent-relevant information. The results suggest that age and diagnosis should not be viewed as determinants of decisional capacity; investigators should be alert to the presence of cognitive deficits, as well as negative symptoms. Also, an interactive dialogue between patient and investiga-tor with repeated presentation of information is likely to aid understanding of disclosed information among patients with schizophrenia.

40|$|Winter highway {{operation}} and maintenance in the northern periphery is a challenge, a broad and complex area. Understanding about this area {{and its effect on}} winter traffic performance is far from complete. During the last forty years since Swedish Transport Administration (former Swedish National Road Administration) began attempting of the use of Road Weather Information System - RWIS on the Swedish road network, the repair and maintenance methods of this assistive tool has dramatically changed. Changing of the methods have been due to the progress and development of the technology within this area i. e. from simple stations that could be connected via telephone network for icy road warning to a more sophisticated and modern internet based technology. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate and find the importance and effectiveness of using weather data collected from RWIS by road agencies as an assistive tool for effective performance of winter road maintenance, and how these tools are currently maintained without influencing the delay of winter road maintenance. The study also attempts to find possible interactions between technical and contractual issues that may affect winter road maintenance. The method of the study was partly based on a theoretical study by reviewing some internationally published articles and <b>reports</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> and furthermore a domestic questionnaire survey, an international benchmarking and a follow-up study within a selected region in Sweden. The results of the study reveal that even if the weather stations are normally placed on roads where the risk of icy roads is greatest, there are indirect factors which influence the planned maintenance of these tools which subsequenly cause delay of winter road maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Pentazocine {{is usually}} not {{recognised}} as a dependence producing drug, in spite of accumulation {{of a number of}} case reports on Pentazocine abuse and dependence in the world literature. The present paper briefly re-views earlier <b>reports</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> and describes eighteen cases with parenteral Pentazocine abuse seen in a general ho-spital of Delhi over a short period of time. These cases form a spectrum from isolated abuse in patients with chronic-pain to Pentazocine being just another drug in the setting of multiple addictions. Recommendat ion is made for more judicious use of Pentazocine in view of its high dependence potential. History of Medicine is replete with examples of substances which were in-troduced as harmless drugs, but later proved to have considerable abuse and de-pendence potential. Heroin and Pethidine are two well known drugs of this type. With the introduction {{of a large number of}} synthetic and semisynthetic opiate congen-ers the chances of such pharmaceutical mis-adventures have increased substantially. Fuller realization of the abuse potential of a drug frequently comes after it has been used for a number of years or even decades. Therefore, a constant monitoring for this unwanted and dangerous effect is needed, for all suspect drugs (W. H. O., 1975). A considerable number of reports have accumulated over the years on the abuse of Pentazocine, which is being used very wi-dely in the medical and surgical practice in the last decade.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: There is {{increasing}} {{debate about the}} ethics of using medical records for research. We aimed to characterize newspaper <b>reporting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area.</b> METHOD: We searched Lexis-Nexis to find newspaper reports {{about the use of}} medical records for research from 1 June 2005 to 30 November 2006. Following screening for relevance, we generated a coding scheme and classified articles using this, assisted by QSR N 6 software. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that much newspaper coverage portrays the use of medical records as uncontentious, but also presents ethical arguments for and against such research. Arguments in favour of access to medical records emphasize the public interest and patients' legitimate expectations that research will be carried out. Arguments against such use emphasize the importance of confidentiality and the violation of rights of privacy. Our findings highlight that there is no single dominant position on the rights and wrongs of access to medical records by researchers. Within newspaper <b>reporting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> patient voices are currently noticeable by their absence. CONCLUSIONS: Use of medical records for research raises important ethical questions, in particular regarding the balance between the rights and interests of the individual and the public interest benefits of the research. Understanding how these positions are represented within the mass media is important because the media can inform and influence the public's views and public policy.
