50|$|Air Canada Express, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Apple Vacations, Frontier Airlines, OneJet, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Vacation Express use Concourse A. Most of {{them had}} used Terminal 2 before it closed. Concourse A was built as an {{extension}} of Terminal C, and named Terminal D, when Delta Air Lines made Cincinnati its second largest hub. The concourse served Continental, Northwest, Atlantic Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines until 2010, when Delta Air Lines closed the concourse. Shortly thereafter, the concourse underwent an extensive renovation before re-opening on May 15, 2012. Concourse A is an island and is only reachable by an underground moving walkway or people mover. The concourse houses a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint, however has been closed since 2012. In total, the concourse has 23 jetway gates and 1 <b>remote</b> <b>gate</b> (A1-23 and R27), of which 22 are open as of July 2017 (A1-19, A21-22, R27).|$|E
5000|$|The {{whole process}} is {{outlined}} in Figure 6. The process happens in different steps here too. In the first phase, the pn junction between the MT1 terminal and the gate becomes forward-biased (step 1). As forward-biasing implies the injection of minority carriers {{in the two}} layers joining the junction, electrons are injected in the p-layer under the gate. Some of these electrons do not recombine and escape to the underlying n-region (step 2). This in turn lowers {{the potential of the}} n-region, acting as the base of a pnp transistor which switches on (turning the transistor on without directly lowering the base potential is called <b>remote</b> <b>gate</b> control). The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: actually, this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated. Therefore, the red arrow labeled with a [...] "3" [...] in Figure 6 shows the final conduction path of the current.|$|E
5000|$|Triggering in this {{quadrant}} {{is similar}} to triggering in quadrant III. The process uses a <b>remote</b> <b>gate</b> control and is illustrated in Figure 7. As current flows from the p-layer under the gate into the n-layer under MT1, minority carriers {{in the form of}} free electrons are injected into the p-region {{and some of them are}} collected by the underlying n-p junction and pass into the adjoining n-region without recombining. As in the case of a triggering in quadrant III, this lowers the potential of the n-layer and turns on the PNP transistor formed by the n-layer and the two p-layers next to it. The lower p-layer works as the collector of this PNP transistor and has its voltage heightened: actually, this p-layer also acts as the base of an NPN transistor made up by the last three layers just over the MT2 terminal, which, in turn, gets activated. Therefore, the red arrow labeled with a [...] "3" [...] in Figure 6 shows the final conduction path of the current.|$|E

40|$|Single qubit {{rotation}} {{gate and}} the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate constitute {{a complete set}} of gates for universal quantum computation. In general the CNOT gate are only for two nearby qubits. For two qubits which are remote from each other, we need a series of swap gates to transfer these two qubits to the nearest neighboring sites, and then after the CNOT gate we should transfer them to their original sites again. However, a series of swap gates are resource for quantum information processing. One economy way which does not consume so much resource is to implement CNOT <b>gate</b> remotely.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} decades, the {{increase}} of civil air-traffic and the corresponding growth of airports have highlighted {{the importance of the}} gate scheduling as a key activity in airport operations. To solve this problem, different mathematical models for flights assignment to gates can often be found in technical literature. In this work we propose a method based on the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) to find an optimal flight gate assignment for a given schedule. This metaheuristic represents an interesting methodology in the field of Swarm Intelligence for its capability to solve high level combinatorial problems with fast convergence performances. The proposed methodology includes a multicriteria analysis considering two main objectives: minimization of passenger total walking distance and <b>remote</b> <b>gate</b> usage.

30|$|While {{the above}} few {{experimental}} observations reveal quite fascinating {{aspects of the}} graphene–electrolyte interaction, theoretical modeling of this system seems to be lagging behind the experiment. It is therefore desirable and tempting to discuss doping of a single layer of graphene by a <b>remote</b> <b>gate</b> electrode immersed in {{a thick layer of}} electrolyte by using two simple models: one describing graphene’s π electron band structure in the linear energy dispersion approximation [12], and the other describing the distribution of ions in the electrolyte by a one-dimensional (1 D) Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) model, which takes advantage of the planar symmetry of the problem [13]. However, it should be emphasized that the experiments involving electrolytic top gating of both CNTs [7, 8] and graphene [6, 10] use rather high voltages, on the order of 1 – 2 V, which can cause significant crowding of counter-ions at the electrolyte–graphene interface. It is therefore necessary to go beyond the standard PB model by taking into account the steric effects, i.e., the effects of finite size of ions in the solution. To that aim, we shall use the modified Poisson–Boltzmann (mPB) model developed by Borukhov et al. [22, 23], which retains analytical tractability of the original 1 D-PB model. In addition, applied voltages beyond 1 V also require taking into account non-linearity of graphene’s band energy dispersion, giving small but noticeable corrections to the linear approximation.|$|E
