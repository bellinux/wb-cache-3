The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking ice sheets to recolonize the northern part of North America.

We evaluated the role of {{sexual selection}} in a naturally promiscuous species, Drosophila melanogaster. In two replicate populations, sexual selection was removed through enforced monogamous <b>mating</b> with <b>random</b> <b>mate</b> assignment or retained in promiscuous controls.

The mating treatments were maintained for 47 generations, and evolution was allowed to proceed naturally within {{the parameters of the}} design. In the monogamous populations, males evolved to be less harmful to their mates, and females evolved to be less resistant to male-induced harm.

Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances.

50|$|It was {{developed}} in the 1980s by Kermit Ritland, {{as an alternative to the}} simplistic mixed mating model. The mixed mating model assumes that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or outcrossing with a completely <b>random</b> <b>mate.</b> That is, it assumes that inbreeding is caused solely by self-fertilisation. This assumption is often violated in wild plant populations, where inbreeding may be due to outcrossing between closely related plants. For example, in dense stands, mating often occurs between plants in close proximity; and in plants with short seed dispersal distances, plants are often closely related to their nearest neighbours. When both these criteria are met, plants will tend to be closely related to the near neighbours with which they mate, resulting in significant inbreeding. In such a scenario, the mixed mating model will attribute all inbreeding to self-fertilisation, and therefore overestimate the extent of self-fertilisation occurring. The effective selfing model takes into account the potential for inbreeding to occur as a result of outcrossing between closely related plants, by considering the extent of kinship between mates.|$|R

40|$|The magnitude, direction, {{and pattern}} of {{inbreeding}} effects on trait expression in selfing generations {{have a direct}} bearing on single-plant and progeny-based selection efficiency. In the present study on a pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.

Inbreeding had no significant effect on Fe and Zn concentrations in one composite and showed significant though marginal increase of both micronutrients in two composites. This finding, not unexpected, was in conformity with the earlier reports of predominantly additive gene effects and marginal partial dominance of genes determining low concentrations of these micronutrients observed in a low frequency of hybrids. The patterns of genetic changes in Fe concentration due to inbreeding were highly significantly and positively correlated with those in Zn concentration in all three composites.

40|$|The {{effect of}} female philopatry on the {{apportionment}} of gene diversity within {{a population is}} evaluated. Even with <b>random</b> <b>mate</b> selection, the apportionment of gene diversity within and among social lineages (groups of related females) is inherently different than in classically defined demic groups. Considerable excess heterozygosity occurs within lineages without substantial changes in total or population heterozygosity. The proportion of genetic variance among lineages within the population was dependent on the lineage size {{and the number of}} male breeders per lineage. The greatest genetic differentiation among lineages was evident when there was one polygynous male breeding within a lineage of philopatric females, a common breeding tactic in mammalian social systems. The fixation indices depicting the genetic structure of the population were found to attain constant values after the first few generations despite the continuous loss of gene diversity within the population by genetic drift. Additionally, the change of gene correlations within individuals relative to the change within the population attains a state of dynamic equilibrium, as do the changes of gene correlations within lineages relative to the total and within individuals relative to within lineages. Comparisons of coancestries and fixation indices for philopatric versus randomly dispersing females indicate that philopatry and polygyny have probably not evolved independently and that promotion of gene correlations among adults rather than offspring has been of primary importance...|$|R
