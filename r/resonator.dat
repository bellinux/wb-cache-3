5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional <b>resonator</b> is formed which {{can be incorporated into}} the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical <b>resonator</b> would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.|$|E
5|$|Another kind of {{piezoelectric}} transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually into the <b>resonator</b> itself. This kind {{is good for}} torsional vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>resonator</b> {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental {{complete}} filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the <b>resonator</b> elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on magnetic-LC (MLC) <b>resonators,</b> namely, slotted <b>resonators</b> that can be {{considered}} the complementary counterparts of the so-called electric-LC (ELC) <b>resonators.</b> Both <b>resonators</b> exhibit two symmetry planes (i. e., they are bisymmetric), one of them being an electric wall {{and the other a}} magnetic wall at the fundamental resonance. Therefore, compared to other electrically small <b>resonators</b> such as folded stepped impedance <b>resonators</b> (SIRs), split ring <b>resonators</b> (SRRs), and their complementary counterparts, MLC and ELC <b>resonators</b> exhibit a very rich phenomenology. In this paper, single-ended microstrip lines and differential microstrip lines loaded with MLC <b>resonators</b> are studied, and potential applications are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Microcoil <b>resonators</b> are {{a radical}} new {{geometry}} for high Q <b>resonators</b> with unique linear features.

40|$|The design, {{fabrication}} {{and test}} results of {{surface acoustic wave}} <b>resonators</b> in the GHz range are described. The two different modes of SAW <b>resonators</b> were investigated. They are the Rayleigh mode type <b>resonators</b> and surface transverse wave (STW) mode type <b>resonators.</b> Their frequency behavior with temperature were compared. At the end the applications of the STW <b>resonators</b> in oscillators were studied...|$|R
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a <b>resonator.</b> Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC <b>resonator.</b> Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Early {{designs in}} the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a <b>resonator</b> material. This {{has given way}} to {{nickel-iron}} alloys, primarily to maximise the Q since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or <b>resonator.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} recent advancements {{in the design of}} compact ring and ring looking microstrip <b>resonators</b> for compact RF bandpass filters. After a brief review of past research on ring <b>resonators,</b> recent developments in compact dual-mode ring <b>resonators</b> and the suppression of their harmonics is discussed. Next triple-, quadruple- and quintuple- mode <b>resonators</b> are considered. Some of these <b>resonators</b> also have suppressed harmonics. Finally, the importance of harmonic suppression for designing ultra-wideband filters is pointed out...|$|R
5|$|A helical <b>resonator</b> {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it {{requires}} a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the <b>resonator</b> expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of <b>resonator</b> are all {{particularly}} suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract— our {{aim is to}} {{estimate}} the potential of LGT <b>resonators</b> to built oscillators of good stability {{in the short term}} domain. This objective needs two conditions: 1) The manufacturing of high Q-factor <b>resonators</b> with a process similar to that used for high stability quartz crystal <b>resonators.</b> 2) The realization of a scheme of an oven controlled oscillator specifically designed for these <b>resonators.</b> A batch of langatate (LGT) crystal <b>resonators</b> has been manufactured in our laboratory. A satisfying machining and polishing process is now ready. These <b>resonators</b> are optimized in terms of curvature radius and electrode diameter.

40|$|Abstract: Novel compact {{interdigital}} bandpass filters (BPFs) {{which used}} multilayer stepped impedance <b>resonators</b> (SIRs) /folded quarter–wavelength <b>resonators</b> were presented.

40|$|Computed {{properties}} of high-Q factor sapphire, YAG, SrLaAlO₄, LaAlO₃, rutile, and quartz dielectric <b>resonators</b> (DR) operating on whispering-gallery TE₀₁₁ and TE₀₁δ modes {{are presented in}} this paper. <b>Resonators</b> with a superconducting metal or partly superconducting partly metal shield are considered. For whispering-gallery-mode <b>resonators,</b> dielectric losses determine the upper limit for their Q factors, while for TE₀₁₁-mode <b>resonators,</b> their Q factors are usually limited by conductor losses. Single-crystal TE₀₁δ-mode <b>resonators</b> would have Q factors determined by both dielectric and conductor losses, and dominant loss mechanism depends on crystal losses and shield geometry.

5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a <b>resonator.</b> Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate <b>resonator</b> box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled <b>resonator</b> filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
