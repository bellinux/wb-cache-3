5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E

500|$|Chief Justice Yong {{also held}} that the orders were not irrational or disproportionate. He {{accepted}} the Minister's view that the Jehovah's Witnesses' <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> national service was prejudicial to national security. The activities of the Jehovah's Witnesses had been properly restricted {{on the basis that}} they were against [...] "public order", and the prohibition on their publications was a natural consequence in view of the [...] "public interest".|$|E
500|$|Chief Justice Yong {{held that}} any {{religious}} belief and practice which offended the [...] "sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore" [...] must be restrained. While {{there was no}} dispute that Jehovah's Witnesses were law-abiding citizens and their religious activities held no political agendas, their <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> national service was, in the Minister's view, contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. In this regard, Chief Justice Yong considered {{the concerns of the}} Assistant Director of Manpower of the Ministry of Defence – if the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses were recognized, a select group of people would enjoy the social and economic benefits of their country without having to share the responsibility of defending the community's social and political institutions.|$|E
500|$|Gauthier {{travelled}} to Paris in 1920 at {{the behest}} of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert. She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception being a <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg. Through this, Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States. She also included American music in all of her concerts. Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922, and again in 1923. She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics.|$|E

The group's first album, Third World Child, broke international sales records in several European countries, including France. The band went on to record several more albums, including Heat, Dust and Dreams, which received a Grammy Award nomination. Johnny Clegg and Savuka played {{both at home and}} abroad, even though Clegg's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>performing</b> in apartheid-era South Africa created tensions with the international anti-apartheid movement and led to his expulsion from the British Musicians' Union.

In 1993, the band dissolved after Dudu Zulu was shot and killed while attempting to mediate a taxi war.|$|R

Krusty picks Homer to accompany him to Oslo for the awards ceremony, and Homer decides to take Bart with him. Their plane lands in The Hague, and it is revealed that the Peace Prize announcement was a ruse to bring Krusty there so he could be tried by the International Court of Justice for his deplorable public behavior over the years, such as dropping a monkey from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and stealing the act from a local clown in The Hague. Homer and Bart search desperately for any evidence to show that Krusty has made a genuine contribution to humanity, and eventually argue that his <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> at Sun City because he wanted potato chips led directly to the South African government's decision to [...] from prison.

2500|$|Coercive {{behaviour}} of men {{towards the}} opposite sex can be argued to {{be a result of}} male sexual entitlement. Gender stereotypes view men and boys as being the more typically aggressive sex. Subsequently, they may act aggressively towards women and girls in order to increase their chances of submission from them. This is known as male sexual entitlement – the belief that women and girls owe men sex due to society viewing their sexual gratification as more important. This can result in men being more likely than women to view pressuring a woman or girl into sex as acceptable behavior. Examples of Western men’s sexual entitlement include harassing women with thick breasts and their <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> oral sex on women. Non-consensual condom removal has been described as [...] "a threat to [...] bodily agency and as a dignitary harm", and men who do this [...] " [...] justify their actions as a natural male instinct".|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case study}} of pragmatic which investigates the types of <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> invitations and their {{semantic}} formulas, and the ways of the Javanese college learners of EFL perform the refusal types and their semantic formulas. For this study, 60 Javanese college learners of EFL (30 male and 30 females) are asked to respond in English for ten various situations of invitations in which they carry out the speech act of refusal. 			 The data, collected from Discourse Completion Task (DCT), are analyzed in terms of refusal types, semantic formulas, and the ways of the refusal types and semantic formulas performed by the respondents. The analyzed data basically uses the taxonomy of refusals by Beebe,et. al. (1990), but in this current study the writer uses the modification of taxonomy of refusals from Yamagashira (2001), Wannaruk (2005), and Al Eryani (2007) are chosen. The result of investigation is 600 responses of <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> invitations. Then, the English performance of the male and female respondents is compared to know the differences and similarities in <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> invitations. 						 The difference of performing the refusal utterances between the male and the females particularly happen in the frequency of using the refusal utterance not in the forms of refusal utterance, and generally the difference is not significant. The slight difference also happens in the ways of using the <b>refusal</b> utterances <b>to</b> invitations. These facts affirm that language used by the males and the female are different. 						 The <b>refusal</b> utterances <b>to</b> invitations <b>performed</b> by the male and female respondents in the current study are also compared <b>to</b> the <b>refusal</b> utterances <b>to</b> invitations used by American native speakers in the previous studies of Wannaruk (2005) and Al Eryani (2007). From those comparisons between the respondents as non native speakers, and the Americans as native speakers can be revealed that the cultural issues or values underlie the differences, and it causes a pragmatic transfer. 						 The findings advocate implications for EFL teaching methodology, including material and curriculum development, it also confirms that language and culture is inseparable. Furthermore, this study is helpful to understand speech acts and or oral communication across culture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study is}} aimed at {{investigating}} strategies of follow-up responses <b>to</b> <b>refusals</b> <b>performed</b> by Indonesians learning English as a foreign language. Having known that his/her desire or want is refused by his/her hearer, a speaker may provide a follow-up response <b>to</b> the <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> maintain the flow of a talk exchange. This act may also mitigate the tension {{and is able to}} prevent the speaker from being considered impolite or non-cooperative. The study involves 20 students of the English Education Department of Indonesia University of Education. The data were collected through Discourse Completion Tests (DCTs). The collected data were then analyzed by using the framework proposed by Searle (1969), Blum-Kulka et al. (1989), and Aziz (2000). It is found that the respondents manifest the follow-up responses in a number of ways, which can be categorized as request, acceptance, apology, promise, refusal, and passive comment. These responses contain some strategies. While the category of request and refusal are manifested in six and two strategies respectively, the categories of acceptance, apology, promise, and passive comment are not further divided into finer categories because they only consist of illocutionary force indicating devices (IFIDs). This study concludes that an act of providing a follow-up response cannot be separated from the speaker’s attempt to maintain harmony in communication...|$|R

A recording of the third symphony of the latter was used in a dramatisation by the BBC of Beethoven's writing of that symphony. Gardiner has served as chief conductor of the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra and has appeared as guest conductor with such major orchestras as the Berlin Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Philharmonia, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic.

2500|$|Compulsory {{military}} service for all men aged between 18 and 45 {{was introduced by}} Hitler in March 1935. No exemptions were provided for religious or conscientious reasons and Witnesses who refused to serve or take the oath of allegiance to Hitler were sent to prison or concentration camp, generally for terms {{of one or two}} years. At the outbreak of war in August 1939, more serious punishments were applied. A decree was enacted that greatly increased penal regulations during periods of war and states of emergency and included in the decree was an offense of [...] "demoralization of the armed forces"; any <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> {{military service}} or public inducement to this effect would be punishable by death.

5000|$|In Case E-5/15, Matja Kumba, the {{national}} court asked, firstly, whether an average weekly working time of 84 hours (7-7 rotation) in a cohabitant care arrangement constitutes {{a breach of}} Article 6 of the Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC); secondly, whether a national provision, under which an employee’s consent to working more than 60 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement cannot be revoked, {{is compatible with the}} rights that employees have under the Directive; and thirdly, whether a dismissal following a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment” within the meaning of the Directive. With regard to the first question, the Court noted that it is for {{the national}} court to assess the amount of working time in the case at hand, taking into account the factors clarified by the Court. Working time amounting to an average of 84 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement is compatible with Article 6 of the Directive, in circumstances governed by Article 22(1)(a), provided that the worker has explicitly, freely and individually agreed <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> such work, and the general principles of the protection of the safety and health of the worker are observed. With regard to the second question, the Court noted that the Directive does not contain a provision concerning revocation of consent. It is for national law to determine whether such revocation of consent is possible. However, a complete inability to revoke consent, even in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, may prove incompatible with the Directive, since the possibility for a worker to consent to exceeding the maximum weekly working time is expressly conditional on the EEA State respecting the general principles of the protection of {{the health and safety of}} workers, cf. Article 22(1)(a) of the Directive. With regard to the third question, the Court noted that, typically, a dismissal due to a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment”. However, a notice of dismissal and offer of re-engagement on new terms, following a refusal by a worker to agree to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period, is not to be considered a “detriment” if the termination of the employment is based upon reasons that are fully independent of the worker’s <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> agree <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> such additional work.|$|R
