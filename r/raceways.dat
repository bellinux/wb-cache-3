25|$|Farming in {{freshwater}} for {{king salmon}} uses net cages placed in rivers, using techniques {{similar to those}} used for sea-farmed salmon. Freshwater <b>raceways</b> are located in several Canterbury rivers such as the Clutha and Waimakariri Rivers. In the 1990s, a unique form of freshwater salmon farming was developed in hydroelectric canals in the Mackenzie Basin. Young salmon are enclosed in pens in the Ohau and Tekapo canals. The Tekapo site, fed by fast cold waters from the Southern Alps, is the highest salmon farm in the world, 677 metres above sea level.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{technical}} problems, such as harvesting, {{are being}} addressed successfully by the industry, the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities {{is seen by}} many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology. Only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available, and must often rely on the little data (often only engineering estimates) available in the public domain. Dmitrov examined the GreenFuel's photobioreactor and estimated that algae oil would only be competitive at an oil price of $800 per barrel. A study by Alabi et al. examined <b>raceways,</b> photobioreactors and anaerobic fermenters to make biofuels from algae and found that photobioreactors are too expensive to make biofuels. <b>Raceways</b> might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs, and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements. The group found that capital cost, labor cost and operational costs (fertilizer, electricity, etc.) by themselves are too high for algae biofuels to be cost-competitive with conventional fuels. Similar results were found by others, suggesting that unless new, cheaper ways of harnessing algae for biofuels production are found, their great technical potential may never become economically accessible. Recently, Rodrigo E. Teixeira demonstrated a new reaction and proposed a process for harvesting and extracting raw materials for biofuel and chemical production that requires a fraction of the energy of current methods, while extracting all cell constituents.|$|E
25|$|With current {{technology}} available, it {{is estimated}} that the cost of producing microalgal biomass is $2.95/kg for photobioreactors and $3.80/kg for open-ponds. These estimates assume that carbon dioxide is available at no cost. If the annual biomass production capacity is increased to 10,000 tonnes, the cost of production per kilogram reduces to roughly $0.47 and $0.60, respectively. Assuming that the biomass contains 30% oil by weight, the cost of biomass for providing a liter of oil would be approximately $1.40 ($5.30/gal) and $1.81 ($6.85/gal) for photobioreactors and <b>raceways,</b> respectively. Oil recovered from the lower cost biomass produced in photobioreactors is estimated to cost $2.80/L, assuming the recovery process contributes 50% to the cost of the final recovered oil. If existing algae projects can achieve biodiesel production price targets of less than $1 per gallon, the United States may realize its goal of replacing up to 20% of transport fuels by 2020 by using environmentally and economically sustainable fuels from algae production.|$|E

40|$|Prediction of <b>raceway</b> {{shape and}} size {{has always been a}} {{challenging}} task. Based on the previous finding that <b>raceway</b> boundary is an iso-stress boundary, its {{shape and size}} has been predicted using a continuum approach.

Predicted <b>raceway</b> boundary is compared with the experimental <b>raceway</b> boundary/shape and size along with the comparison of theoretical and experimental pressure distribution. A reasonable agreement between the theoretical and experimental <b>raceway</b> shape and size is found. Extension of the work in real blast furnace case is also discussed...|$|R
500|$|Commonly called [...] "Canucks", {{the fastest}} {{members of the}} breed came from Quebec near the St. Lawrence River. Racing began in this area during the long, severe winters, when Sunday races after {{attending}} church for Mass became common.

They instead moved to local rivers, whose smooth, frozen surfaces provided useful <b>raceways,</b> and the resulting contests {{drew attention to the}} pacers from Quebec.|$|E
500|$|Fargo then built a {{pumping plant}} {{employing}} seven electric powered rotary pumps, to move river water up a [...] pipeline to a bluff about [...] above the Muskegon River. A diameter reduction to [...] increased {{the pressure to}} about 80 PSI, and the water was fed into nozzles via flexible rubber hoses. The high pressure streams of water carried away a soil water mix into iron troughs which routed the material about [...] at a slight downgrade back to the dam site.

During this phase, the river was allowed to run through the powerhouse <b>raceways</b> and out the spillway.|$|E
500|$|Some {{strains of}} fish are more {{resistant}} than others, even within species; using resistant strains may {{help reduce the}} incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture. [...] There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time. [...] Additionally, aquaculturists may avoid M. cerebralis infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and {{makes it easier to}} eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment. To minimise tubificid populations, techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds, and the rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen-free water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic-lined <b>raceways</b> that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease.|$|E

500|$|For {{nearly a}} half-century, {{alligator}} gar were considered [...] "trash fish", or a [...] "nuisance species" [...] detrimental to sport fisheries; therefore, were targeted for elimination {{by state and}} federal authorities in the United States.

[...] They are also protected under the Lacey Act which makes it illegal to transport certain species of fish in interstate commerce when in violation of state law or regulation. [...] Several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild, and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public.

500|$|The {{impact of}} M. cerebralis in Europe is {{somewhat}} lessened because {{the species is}} endemic to this region, giving native fish stocks a degree of immunity. Rainbow trout, the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing feral populations are rare, so few wild rainbow trout are {{young enough to be}} susceptible to infection. [...] On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking sport-fishing waters and for aquaculture, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the [...] "ossification" [...] stage in tanks or <b>raceways.</b> These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges. Fry are moved to earthen ponds only once they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.|$|E

500|$|About {{three-quarters of}} U.S. {{production}} comes from Idaho, particularly the Snake River area, {{due in part}} to the quality and temperature of the water available there. California and Washington also produce significant amounts of farmed trout. [...] In the east, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and West Virginia have farming operations. Rainbow trout farming is one of the largest finfish aquaculture industries in the U.S. They are raised inland in facilities where <b>raceways</b> or ponds have continuously flowing water with little pollution and a low risk of escape. The U.S. industry is noted for using best management practices. Imports constitute only about 15percent of farmed rainbows sold in the U.S., and nearly all domestic production is consumed within the country; very little is exported. The U.S. produces about 7percent of the world's farmed trout. Rainbow trout, especially those raised in farms and hatcheries, are susceptible to enteric redmouth disease. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on redmouth disease, given its serious implications for rainbow trout farming. The disease does not infect humans.|$|E
