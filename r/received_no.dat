5|$|Fighter pilots <b>received</b> <b>no</b> {{instrument}} training {{until very}} {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots more quickly to replace losses.

5|$|While {{a celebrated}} {{cause for the}} Australian left—{{particular}}ly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement—the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was marshalled by B.A. Santamaria on an anti-communist basis, rather than a pro-Nationalist basis. Equally, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they <b>received</b> <b>no</b> public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government <b>received</b> <b>no</b> reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least 14 were killed.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{sent letters}} to the Holy See, {{describing}} his cousin as an immoral tyrant. He wanted to replace Sigismund with Stephen {{with the assistance of}} the pope, England and Poland, but they <b>received</b> <b>no</b> support. Pope Clement VIII invited him to Rome, but he refused. At the pope's request, Sigismund Báthory allowed Andrew's mother and Stephen's wife, along with their children, to move to Poland. Zamoyski, who strongly opposed Sigismund Báthory's anti-Ottoman policy, supported Andrew and Stephen.|$|E

5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she <b>received</b> <b>no</b> grant of arms.

5|$|Breckinridge's {{personal}} turmoil did not hinder {{his political}} accomplishments. He was appointed superintendent {{of public education}} by Governor William Owsley. He was the sixth person to hold the office since its creation in the 1830s. The task was daunting. Only one of every ten school-age children in Kentucky ever attended school, and at least thirty Kentucky counties had <b>received</b> <b>no</b> state educational funds since 1840.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states <b>received</b> <b>no</b> candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E
