5|$|After a brief tour of Sweden, they {{returned}} to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd.

5|$|Once in Vanilla Studios, {{the group}} began {{performing}} cover songs {{from a variety}} of genres, such as rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> confidence without worrying about the reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band's punk rock musical style.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E

5|$|Their efforts {{resulted}} in a scheme where grain crops grown in the RSK-held part of Sector West were milled in the Croatian-controlled areas, and the supply of potable water to Pakrac was exchanged for electricity supplied from Croatia to the southern portion of Sector West. Fischer also obtained approval for the limited return of refugees from local authorities. The scheme involved up to 2,500 refugees who {{would be allowed to}} <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> homes, funded by the Austrian government. The funds, in the amount of 1.3million dollars, were obtained through Michael Platzer, Special Assistant to the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front.

German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
5|$|Atrus {{writes a}} new Age called Releeshahn for the D'ni {{survivors}} to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> civilization {{as he and}} Catherine settle back on Earth, raising a daughter named Yeesha. As Atrus prepares to take the Stranger to Releeshahn, a mysterious man named Saavedro appears and steals the Releeshahn Descriptive Book. The Stranger follows Saavedro through several Ages (which were used to train Sirrus and Achenar {{in the art of}} writing Ages), before finally recovering the book. Ten years later, Atrus asks for the Stranger's help in determining if his sons have repented after their lengthy imprisonment; the Stranger saves Yeesha from Sirrus' machinations, but Sirrus and a repentant Achenar are killed. D'ni is not fully restored until the creatures the D'ni enslaved, known as the Bahro, are freed.|$|E

Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able {{to return to their homes}} after a few days after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E
5|$|Sentinel {{uses the}} Pillars to {{transport}} hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Gould, who is {{revealed to be}} in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by Megatron's second-in-command, Starscream, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade Chicago as their agents place Pillars around the world. Gould reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld of Cybertron to the Solar System, then to enslave humanity and use Earth's resources to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> world. Sam teams up with former USAF Chief Robert Epps and ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The 1967 war {{severely}} depleted Egypt's military strength, as most {{of their}} air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt's inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt's interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> air defenses. The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.|$|E
5|$|The Protoss {{return in}} Episode IV of , the {{expansion}} to StarCraft. Following immediately {{on from the}} conclusion of StarCraft, Zeratul and a ranking templar Artanis evacuate the surviving Khalai Protoss from Aiur to the Dark Templar world of Shakuras. After the Zerg follow them to Shakuras, Zeratul and Artanis harness the energy of a resident Xel'Naga temple, scouring the planet of all the Zerg. The Protoss attempt to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> lives on Shakuras, but are interrupted by a Zerg raid commanded by Sarah Kerrigan that kidnaps the dark templar leader Raszagal. Using Raszagal as leverage, Kerrigan coerces Zeratul into killing a new Overmind in incubation. Zeratul complies, but later kills Raszagal after it is revealed she has been brainwashed by the Zerg. Zeratul disappears while Artanis takes leadership and tries to reconstruct his people's civilization.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 had {{resulted}} in a Russian withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of Corfu. The Treaty of Schönbrunn with the Austrian Empire in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the Illyrian Provinces on the Eastern shore. To protect these gains, the French and Italian governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in Venice and other Italian ports {{in an effort to}} <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> Mediterranean fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the French Navy had in manning and equipping their ships. As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.|$|E

5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} a crowd that {{included}} members of the Webfoots' 1919 conference championship team, which had won the title over California, Oregon took a one-point halftime lead on a late 30-foot shot by Johansen. The team switched its defense from zone to man-to-man {{for the second half}} and went on an early second half run to open up a 14-point lead with 12 minutes left. The Golden Bears made multiple comeback bids as the half progressed, but the Webfoots held on to win 54–49 and move ahead in the series. More than half of Oregon's points were scored by Gale and Wintermute, who had 18 and 11 respectively. The second game of the series was closely contested in the first half, but Oregon opened a 25–23 lead at halftime and extended their advantage to eight points before a run of three baskets by California. A stretch featuring three scores by Dick helped the Webfoots <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> lead later in the second half, and they clinched a two-game sweep with a 53–47 victory. Dick and Wintermute contributed 16 points apiece. It was Oregon's first PCC championship in 20 seasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 313, as Licinius {{advanced}} against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in his dealings with his own citizens, and his Christians in particular. In May 313, Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration {{and the means to}} effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided. Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating fault with local judges and enforcers instead. He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all ambiguity and extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians to <b>rebuild</b> <b>their</b> churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution. The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313; the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313. On June 13, Licinius published the Edict of Milan in Nicomedia.|$|E
