A magnetorheological (MR) damper exhibits a variable damping coefficient depending on the strength of an accompanying magnetic field. A high magnetic field creates a nearly unyielding damper filled with a semi-solid fluid while no magnetic field produces an ordinary viscous damper. Presently, these dampers are being used {{in a variety of ways}} by supplying power to an electromagnet that causes stiffening of the <b>damper.</b> <b>Reversing</b> these power requirements allows development of new and innovative applications for MR dampers. For example, ephemeral deformation of critical truss members may be controlled through a <b>reverse</b> MR <b>damper.</b> The goal is to provide protection to truss structures during severe loading events. Implementation of a <b>reverse</b> <b>damper</b> for an application such as this presents two major tasks: (1) development of a control algorithm and (2) design of an MR <b>damper</b> with <b>reverse</b> power requirements. A control algorithm for dynamic response that uses fuzzy logic and neural networks is presented. A potential design for a <b>reverse</b> MR <b>damper</b> utilizing a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets is also presented. It is further shown that design for MR dampers with reverse power requirements will be governed by minimization of detrimental effects due to creep of the damper under sustained static loading...|$|R

Pilot controlled proportional valve is designed and analyzed to get small pressure change rate after blow-off, {{and to get}} a fast response of the <b>damper,</b> a <b>reverse</b> <b>damping</b> mechanism is adapted. The <b>reverse</b> continuous variable <b>damper</b> is designed as a HS-SH damper which offers good body control with reduced transferred input force from the tire, compared with any other type of suspension system. The damper structure is designed, so that rebound and compression damping forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the fixed orifice size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the fixed orifice size. Damping forces are measured with the change of the solenoid current at the different piston velocities to confirm the maximum hysteresis of 20 N, linearity, and variance of damping force. The damping force variance is wide and continuous, and is controlled by the spool opening, of which scheme is usually adapted in proportional valves. The <b>reverse</b> continuous variable <b>damper</b> developed in this study is expected to be utilized in the semi-active suspension systems in passenger cars after its performance and simplicity of the design is confirmed through a real car test.

40|$|In a multiplanet system, tides {{acting on}} the inner planet can {{significantly}} affect the orbital evolution of the entire system. While tides usually damp eccentricities, a novel mechanism identified by Correia et al. (2012) tends to raise eccentricities {{as a result of}} the tides' effect on the inner planet's rotation. Our analytical description of this spin-driven tidal (SDT) effect shows that, while the inner planet's eccentricity undergoes pumping, the process is more completely described by an exchange of strength between the two eigenmodes of the dynamical system. Our analysis allows derivation of criteria for two-planet coplanar systems where the SDT effect can <b>reverse</b> tidal <b>damping,</b> and may preclude the effect's being significant for realistic systems. For the specific case quantified by Correia et al., the effect is strong because of the large adopted tidal time lag, which may not be appropriate for the assumed Saturn-like inner planet. On the other hand, the effective Q for any given planet in exotic circumstances is very uncertain, so the SDT effect could play a role in planetary evolution.

The morning light playing amongst our plants and {{laughing}} on our walls, caught an added lustre from M. Paul's all-benignant salute. Like a true Frenchman (though I don't know why I should say so, for he was of strain neither French nor Labassecourien), he had dressed for the [...] "situation" [...] and the occasion. Not by the vague folds, sinister and conspirator-like, of his soot-dark paletôt were the outlines of his person obscured; on the contrary, his figure (such as it was, I don't boast of it) was well set off by a civilized coat and a silken vest quite pretty to behold. The defiant and pagan bonnet-grec had vanished: bare-headed, he came upon us, carrying a Christian hat in his gloved hand. The little man looked well, very well; there was a clearness of amity in his blue eye, and a glow of good feeling on his dark complexion, which passed perfectly in the place of beauty: one really did not care to observe that his nose, though far from small, was of no particular shape, his cheek thin, his brow marked and square, his mouth no rose-bud: one accepted him as he was, and felt his presence the <b>reverse</b> of <b>damping</b> or insignificant.|$|R

Woollen moquette fabric, a durable, vandal-resistant material first used in the OSCAR trains, Hunter Railcars, and later adopted in the refurbishments of both the Tangara and Endeavour railcars, is used to cover the train's seats.

40|$|Both {{bacteriophage}} T 4 {{and human}} type I DNA ligases {{in the presence}} of a mixture of ATP, AMP and PPi altered the topological properties of a supercoiled substrate by a step-wise reaction eventually leading to a population of fully relaxed, covalently closed products. In the presence of only AMP and PPi DNA products containing nicks with 3 'OH/ 5 'P termini accumulated {{in the presence of}} bacteriophage T 4 DNA ligase, suggesting reversal of the entire joining reaction, but not in the presence of human DNA ligase I. Both DNA ligases became deoxyadenylylated in the presence of dATP, but the joining reaction did not proceed to completion. However, with both enzymes the full relaxing reaction took place in the presence of dAMP alone and {{in the presence of a}} mixture of dATP, dAMP and PPi. In no case could the joining reaction be <b>reversed</b> by <b>dAMP</b> and PPi. Related experiments with modified derivatives of deoxyribonucleoside 5 '-triphosphates and PPi gave results in accord with these observations. The AMP dependent DNA relaxation catalysed by DNA ligases was insensitive to the presence of exonuclease III. These results indicate that controlled relaxation of the substrate by both DNA ligases occurs as a separate reaction rather than by simple reversal of the joining reaction. These findings support the hypothesis that in vivo the DNA topoisomerising ligases relax their substrate at the replication fork both during and separately from ligation of a pre-existing nick...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a motion-aligned auto-regressive (MAAR) {{model is}} {{proposed}} for frame rate up conversion, where each pixel is interpolated {{as the average}} of the results generated by one forward MAAR (Fw-MAAR) model and one backward MAAR (Bw-MAAR) model. In the Fw-MAAR model, each pixel in the to-be-interpolated frame is generated as a linear weighted summation of the pixels within a motion-aligned square neighbor-hood in the previous frame. To derive more accurate interpolation weights, the aligned actual pixels in the following frame are also estimated as a linear weighted summation of the newly interpolated pixels in the to-be-interpolated frame by the same weights. Consequently, the backward-aligned actual pixels in the following frame can be estimated as a weighted summation of the corresponding pixels within an enlarged square neighborhood in the previous frame. The Bw-MAAR is performed likewise except that it is operated in the <b>reverse</b> direction. A <b>damping</b> Newton algorithm is then proposed to compute the adaptive interpolation weights for the Fw-MAAR and Bw-MAAR models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAAR model is able to achieve superior performance than the traditional frame interpolation methods such as MCI, OBMC, and AOBMC, and it is even better than STAR model for the most test sequences with moderate or large motions.
