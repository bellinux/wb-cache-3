5|$|Tippett {{resolved}} {{that his}} work would be an oratorio <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> opera. He chose the title from Ein Kind unserer Zeit, a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer, Ödön von Horváth.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> intellectual level.|$|E
25|$|Claims {{continue}} that Cassinga was <b>a</b> refugee camp, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> military camp, and that consequently the raid was a massacre of civilians <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> highly successful military operation.|$|R

50|$|As Pilling was {{an ancient}} parochial chapelry {{in the parish}} of Garstang, the {{building}} was called <b>a</b> chapel <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> church. Its minister was <b>a</b> perpetual curate <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> vicar.|$|R
5|$|Originally, plantar {{fasciitis}} {{was believed}} to be an inflammatory condition of the plantar fascia. However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> inflammatory process.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{traditional}} biblical {{date for the}} narrative of Joseph’s life and death places him in Egypt {{in the middle of}} the Twelfth Dynasty, roughly comparable to the Hyksos invasion of Egypt, contemporary scholarship no longer accepts such a remote dating. The figure of Joseph itself is often taken to be a ‘personification of a tribe’, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> historic person.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5000|$|By contrast, Balad {{draws upon}} liberal values in its aim to {{eliminate}} discrimination against Arab citizens and redefine Israel {{as a state}} for all its citizens <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Jewish and democratic state", but it is <b>a</b> secular party <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> liberal one.|$|R
5000|$|Prentice {{has become}} a {{prominent}} activist for local eating, although she takes <b>a</b> pragmatic <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> doctrinaire view, seeing it as an educational exercise in [...] "consciousness raising" [...] <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> necessary or sufficient solution to problems of modern food production and consumption.|$|R
50|$|Exhibits {{explain that}} {{extinction}} of dinosaurs {{was caused by}} the Great Flood <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> comet. Noah carried dinosaurs aboard his ark. A Tyrannosaurus alongside Adam and Eve are described as living in peace with each other therefore Tyrannosaurus was <b>a</b> herbivore <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> carnivore.|$|R
5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening. This {{has been estimated}} at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the Court {{held that}} the section 30's {{allocation}} of peremptory challenges controlled, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> 1840 statute that required federal jury selection to generally follow state law (and, thus, the prosecutor was given no peremptory challenges in such cases). Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory challenges unchanged.|$|E
5|$|It {{took four}} months for reports of Heber's death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an {{appropriate}} memorial; this idea {{was taken over}} by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul's Cathedral, London. More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} of Ashley's private life today. He is known to prefer casual dress of shirt and chinos or <b>a</b> track suit <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> suit, and often carries his {{essential}} business tool of a mobile phone in a plastic carrier bag <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> briefcase.|$|R

5|$|Official scorers {{are only}} {{occasionally}} terminated, {{but there have}} been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed a petition to have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 the management of the Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer not be allowed to score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost a no-hitter on a close play in right field that was ruled a hit <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> error.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E
5000|$|John M. Munro edited a {{selection}} of Marzials's poems and had them published in 1974. He referred to him as [...] "interesting <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> significant, <b>a</b> literary curiosity, perhaps, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> neglected genius." ...|$|R

5|$|The Quwatlis were {{a family}} of merchants, who became wealthy from trading with Arabia, and moved to Damascus from Baghdad in the 18th-century. The family {{established}} itself {{in the district of}} al-Shaghour in Damascus, and by 1860, some of the family's wealth was invested in buying large tracts of land in the Ghouta farms surrounding Damascus. The family's notable status was owed to their wealth, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> aristocratic or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
5|$|The exact line {{of descent}} between {{domestic}} sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear. The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is descended from the Asiatic (O. orientalis) species of mouflon. It has been proposed that the European mouflon (O. musimon) is an ancient breed of domestic sheep turned feral <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> ancestor, despite its commonly being cited as ancestor in past literature. A few breeds of sheep, such as the Castlemilk Moorit from Scotland, were formed through crossbreeding with wild European mouflon.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} {{two months after}} full development began. Due to its Japanese setting and aesthetic, its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> English dub. Reception of the game was generally positive; many praised the battle system, reactions to the story were mixed to positive, and other elements such as dungeon designs {{and a lack of}} Fire Emblem-related elements were criticized along with technical problems. The game was later chosen by journalists {{as one of the best}} games for the console.|$|E

5|$|The {{layout of}} the complex, however, differs {{significantly}} from that of earlier complexes. Indeed, it is organized on a north–south axis <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> east–west one: the high temple is located south of the main pyramid and its structures are turned away from it. Furthermore, a small offering chapel is adjoining the eastern base of the pyramid, a configuration otherwise unattested since offering chapels usually occupy the inner sanctum of the mortuary temple. Finally, immediately {{to the south of}} Userkaf's funerary enclosure is a second smaller pyramid complex attributed to his wife, queen Neferhetepes.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} been built single track throughout, with the only {{run-around}} loop provided at Amlwch, meaning that trains could not pass each other. To ensure safe working, the Staff and Ticket system was used in three sections: Gaerwen-Llangefni, Llangefni-Llanerchymedd, and Llanerchymedd-Amlwch, using A and B configured staffs alternately. No turntable was built, as the intended Fairlie engines would not require one. When the LNWR provided engines, they used tank engines where possible, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> engine with a tender.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{described}} by its creators as a sequel to the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> adaptation of it, with the Robert Louis Stevenson tale serving as a backstory within the series. It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll, who has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman also appears as Claire, Tom's wife.|$|E
50|$|The VR6 {{engine is}} also {{smoother}} than most V6s without balance shafts. It uses a firing order of 1,5,3,6,2,4 similar to <b>a</b> straight-6 <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> more typical V6 firing order like 1,2,3,4,5,6. In terms {{of balance and}} smoothness the VR6 acts more like <b>a</b> staggered-cylinder straight-6 <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> conventional V6.|$|R
50|$|The Rutherford engine uses pumps {{that are}} uniquely powered by {{battery-powered}} electric motors <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> gas generator, expander, or preburner.
