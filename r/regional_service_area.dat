5|$|Public {{transportation}} in Marysville and Snohomish County {{is provided by}} Community Transit. The agency operates all-day local bus service in Marysville on four routes, connecting to Smokey Point, the Tulalip Indian Reservation, Lake Stevens, Everett and Lynnwood. Community Transit also operates five commuter express routes during peak hours from park and ride facilities in Marysville to the Boeing Everett Factory, Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus. Marysville {{is one of the}} largest cities in the metro area excluded from the Sound Transit <b>regional</b> <b>service</b> <b>area,</b> but expressed interest in joining the regional transit authority in the 1990s. The city plans to receive Swift Bus Rapid Transit service from Community Transit by 2028, and has been listed as a candidate for future Sounder commuter rail and Link light rail service.|$|E
5000|$|Tuition for in-state {{undergraduate}} students is $7,712, $7,922 for {{undergraduate students}} in YSU's [...] "Affordable Tuition Advantage" [...] coming from western Pennsylvania (Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Crawford, Erie, Lawrence, Mercer, Venango, PA), $9,891 for undergraduate {{students from the}} <b>regional</b> <b>service</b> <b>area</b> (Chautauqua, NY; Armstrong, Clarion, Fayette, Forest, Greene, Indiana, Jefferson, Warren, Washington, and Westmoreland, PA; Brooke, Hancock, Marshall, and Ohio, WV), and $13,669 for all other out-of-state undergraduate students, including international students. Graduate tuition is $7,337/academic year for Ohio residents, while all other graduate students (including international students) pay just $150 per academic year ($8.34 per credit hour) {{in addition to the}} in-state tuition. Room and board cost an additional $7,600. YSU will often note that these tuitions are the lowest of any public university in Ohio.YSU is primarily a commuter school, with most students living at home or in residence off campus, but approximately 1,000 students live in residence halls on campus. Another 400 live in the University Courtyard apartment complexes just off campus. About 1.5% of the student body are international students from approximately 45 countries.|$|E
40|$|Science in a {{regional}} context: Sociology and economy at the University of Groningen. The relation between a university and its <b>regional</b> <b>service</b> <b>area</b> is two-sided. A university {{depends on the}} <b>regional</b> <b>service</b> <b>area,</b> for example for supplying students and research topics. On the other hand a service area can profit from the university by applying {{the results of the}} research conducted. In this article we explore this relationship {{in the case of the}} University of Groningen, the Netherlands. The focus is on research by two scientists: the work of the sociologist C. D. Saal from the 1950 s and the work of the economist Jan Oosterhaven from the 1970 s. The research of both men was strongly grounded in {{a regional}} discussion about social-economic development and was conducted through methods that could be considered as innovative for that time. Although the direct relevance of their work is modest, especially for Saal’s work, their work directly influenced the debate about economic development. It helped regional politicians to find legitimation for their policy proposals. Both men contributed to the transfer of knowledge to practice by participating in the ongoing debates about rural and regional development. Therefore, we can conclude that their research illustrates the productive relationship between scientists and the regional context in which research is conducted. </p...|$|E
50|$|The new {{numbering}} plan divided the North American continent into <b>regional</b> <b>service</b> <b>areas,</b> called Numbering Plan Areas (NPA), primarily {{based on the}} jurisdictional boundaries of US states and Canadian provinces.

50|$|The Deroche {{water system}} <b>service</b> <b>area</b> was {{established}} in 1992 by the Dewdney-Alouette Regional District, and later became a Fraser Valley <b>Regional</b> District <b>service</b> <b>area</b> after reorganization of regional district boundaries. The water system serves the community of Deroche, which is in Electoral Area G of the regional district. The system was originally operated as a private water system under a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, and {{was taken over by}} DARD in 1993. At that time, Deroche Creek was used as the source, but several debris flow incidents within the watershed severely affected the creek, causing interruptions of supply as well as several water quality challenges for the system. As a result, in 1999-2000 several upgrades to the system were carried out. The system was changed over to a groundwater well source, dramatically improving water quality and supply reliability.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Managing {{electrical}} energy supply is a complex task. The {{most important part of}} electric utility resource planning is forecasting of the future load demand in the <b>regional</b> or national <b>service</b> <b>area.</b> This is usually achieved by constructing models on relative information, such as climate and previous load demand data. In this paper, a genetic programming approach is proposed to forecast long term electrical power consumption in the area covered by a utility situated in the southeast of Turkey. The empirical results demonstrate successful load forecast with a low error rate. Key Words- genetic programming, load forecasting, symbolic regression 1...|$|R

40|$|With the {{objective}} of choosing a practical and valid method to delimit health <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> of <b>regional</b> health <b>service</b> centres to build a <b>regional</b> basic health <b>service</b> network, we first drew lessons from traditional geographic methods of delimiting trade areas and then applied two methods to delimit health <b>service</b> <b>areas,</b> i. e. the proximal method and the gravity method. We verified {{the effectiveness of these}} methods by an index of similarity with the aid of real in-patient data. Calculation of the similarity indices shows that health <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> delimited by the proximal method has an 87. 3 % similarity to the real health <b>service</b> <b>area,</b> while the gravity method gives 88. 6 %. Our conclusion is that both methods are suitable for delimiting health <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> at <b>regional</b> health <b>service</b> centres, but find that the proximal method is more practicable in operational terms for delimiting health <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> in region health planning...|$|R
