5|$|Grey's Anatomy {{was among}} the ten highest-rated shows in the United States from the show's first through fourth season. The show's episodes have won a number of awards, {{including}} a Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series, a People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Drama, and multiple NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. Since its premiere, Buena Vista Home Entertainment has distributed all seasons on DVD. There have been several special episodes <b>recapping</b> events from previous episodes, and two series of webisodes.|$|E
5|$|On the April 11, 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, Edge gave an {{emotional}} speech about {{his career and}} the realities of wrestling. He said he took further tests to his basic-strength tests, and an MRI result forced him to retire. Leading up to this announcement, he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and felt numbness in his arms. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} <b>recapping</b> his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than it being too late.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{provided}} five-and-a-half {{hours of}} coverage in total, and no live coverage. Pay TV channel NBC Sports Network aired one-hour highlight shows on 4, 5, 6 and 11 September while NBC broadcast a special <b>recapping</b> the Games on 16 September – a week following their conclusion. The United States Olympic Committee provided additional coverage through its own digital outlets. Critics and American athletes expressed disappointment at NBC for its {{decision not to}} broadcast any {{live coverage of the}} Games, continuing the broadcaster's trend of providing minimal coverage for the Paralympics. In Canada, rights were held by Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium; TSN (English) and RDS (French) produced daily hour-long highlight programs (some of which were aired by CTV Television), while tape-delayed airings of the opening ceremony were carried by Sportsnet One, TSN2, RDS, and RDS2. The coverage was simulcast with open audio descriptions by AMI-tv, a network which broadcasts programming with accommodations for those who are visually or hearing impaired. AMI-tv also broadcast supplemental programming, such as a daily news program from London and a documentary series focusing on Canadian athletes at the Paralympics.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Recaps</b> {{are also}} used for several soap operas, most notably in Australia. The Australian prison soap opera Prisoner (commonly known as Prisoner: Cell Block H) used a <b>recap</b> {{sequence}} throughout its eight-season run. In the early years it only showed the final scene of the previous episode before the opening credits. However, in later years it began to show several select cuts from the previous episode during the <b>recap</b> sequence, often, a new scene would directly follow the <b>recap</b> before the opening credits. In {{the early years of}} Australian soaps Home and Away, Neighbours and Sons and Daughters a <b>recap</b> showed directly after the opening credits, which may have been confusing for viewers who would have started watching them, not realizing they were viewing a <b>recap</b> sequence and not a new opening scene. The layout was changed in later years as <b>recaps</b> for Home and Away and Neighbours started before the credits, but currently they again show after the credits in such a way not to confuse the viewer. British soap operas, apart from Hollyoaks, do not use a <b>recap</b> sequence, however, they may be relevant.|$|R
5|$|Season five began airing on January 21, 2009, {{and ended}} on May 13, 2009, {{featuring}} seventeen episodes. A clip show <b>recapping</b> {{the first four}} seasons preceded the premiere. Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island, where the remaining survivors begin to erratically jump forward and backward through time, following the island being moved in both space and time by Ben, and focuses on the events that lead up to Locke stopping the time jumps and leaving the Island. The second takes place off the island following Locke's death and deals with Jack and Ben's attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six {{and return to the}} island with Locke's dead body. The second part of the season starts after the time jumps end and the Oceanic Six return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316. The show continues to follow two time lines, both of which take place on the island. The first takes place in 1977 when the survivors who had been left behind are stranded after jumping around in time. It is also where some of the Oceanic Six are transported during the return flight to the island. The second takes place in late 2007 after Flight 316 is forced to crash land on the island.|$|E

40|$|Clinical trials showed renal {{protective}} effects of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) {{in patients with}} sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). Subsequently, a human recombinant chimeric AP (<b>recAP)</b> was developed as a pharmaceutically acceptable alternative. Here, we investigated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK) of <b>recAP</b> and developed a translational population PK model. Biodistribution was studied during LPS-induced AKI in rats. Iodine- 125 -labeled <b>recAP</b> was primarily taken up by liver, spleen, adrenals, heart, lungs and kidneys followed by the gastro-intestinal tract and thyroid. Tissue distribution was not critically affected by endotoxemia. PK parameters were determined in rats and minipigs during IV bolus injections of <b>recAP,</b> administered once, or once daily during seven consecutive days. Plasma concentrations of <b>recAP</b> increased with increasing dose and disappeared in a biphasic manner. Exposure to <b>recAP,</b> estimated by AUC and Cmax, was similar on days 1 and 7. Subsequently, population approach nonlinear mixed effects modeling was performed with <b>recAP</b> rat and minipig and biAP phase I PK data. Concentration versus time data was accurately described in all species by a two-compartmental model with allometric scaling based on body weight. This model provides a solid foundation for determining the optimal dose and duration of first-in-man <b>recAP</b> studies...|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{began its}} take-off from Los Angeles International Airport at approximately 9:25am. During that take-off roll, the <b>recapping</b> tread of the No. 2 tire {{on the left}} main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though <b>recapping</b> a movie. He was known to push this idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E
25|$|The cast had {{continued}} to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ATWT then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break {{would be the last}} anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy {{had been shot in the}} head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and <b>recapping</b> the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.|$|E

40|$|Sepsis-{{associated}} acute kidney injury (AKI) {{is associated}} with high morbidity and mortality. Excessive platelet activation contributes to AKI through the formation of microthrombi and amplification of systemic inflammation. Two phase II trials demonstrated that bovine-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) improved renal function in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated AKI. In this study, we characterised the platelet-inhibiting effects of a human recombinant AP. Whole blood and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of healthy volunteers (n= 6) was pre-treated ex vivo with <b>recAP,</b> whereafter platelet reactivity to ADP, collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL) and Pam 3 CSK 4 was determined by flow cytometry. <b>RecAP</b> (40 U/ml) reduced the platelet reactivity to ADP (inhibition with a median of 47 %, interquartile range 43 - 49 %; p< 0. 001) and tended to reduce platelet reactivity to CRP-XL (9 %, 2 - 25 %; p= 0. 08) in whole blood. The platelet-inhibiting effects of <b>recAP</b> were more pronounced in PRP both for ADP- (64 %, 54 - 68 %; p= 0. 002) and CRP-XL-stimulated samples (60 %, 46 - 71 %; p= 0. 002). <b>RecAP</b> rapidly converted ADP into adenosine, whereas antagonism of the A 2 A adenosine receptor partially reversed the platelet inhibitory effects of <b>recAP.</b> Platelets of septic shock patients (n= 5) showed a 31 % (22 - 34 %; p= 0. 03) more pronounced reactivity compared to healthy volunteers, and this was completely reversed by <b>recAP</b> treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that <b>recAP</b> inhibits ex vivo human platelet activation through dephosphorylation of ADP and formation of adenosine as its turnover product. <b>RecAP</b> is able to reverse the platelet hyperreactivity present in septic shock patients. These effects {{may contribute to the}} beneficial effects of <b>recAP</b> as a new therapeutic candidate for sepsis-associated AKI...|$|R

5000|$|... 60second <b>Recap</b> {{was created}} by Peter Osterlund, a former {{journalist}} who, {{while working as a}} Hollywood screenwriter, began exploring media formats suitable for smartphones and other handheld devices.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, two phase-II trials {{demonstrated}} improved renal {{function in}} critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury {{treated with the}} enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Here, we elucidated the dual active effect on renal protection by alkaline phosphatase presumably related to dephosphorylation, thereby detoxifying lipopolysaccharide (LPS). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of human recombinant alkaline phosphatase (<b>recAP)</b> on LPS-induced renal injury was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. Renal function was assessed by transcutaneous measurement of FITC-sinistrin elimination in freely moving, awake rats. The mechanism of action of <b>recAP</b> was further investigated in vitro using conditionally immortalized human proximal tubular epithelial cells (ciPTEC). KEY RESULTS: In vivo, LPS administration significantly prolonged FITC-sinistrin half-life and increased fractional urea excretion, which was prevented by <b>recAP</b> co-administration. Moreover, <b>recAP</b> prevented LPS-induced increase in proximal tubule injury marker, kidney injury molecule- 1 expression and excretion. In vitro, LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8 was significantly attenuated by <b>recAP.</b> This effect was linked to dephosphorylation, as enzymatically inactive <b>recAP</b> {{had no effect on}} LPS-induced cytokine production. RecAP-mediated protection resulted in increased adenosine levels through dephosphorylation of LPS-induced extracellular adenosine di- and triphosphate and attenuated LPS-induced increased expression of adenosine A 2 A receptor. The A 2 A receptor antagonist ZM- 241385 did not diminish the effects of <b>recAP.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that the ability of <b>recAP</b> to reduce renal inflammation may account for the beneficial effect observed in septic acute kidney injury patients, and that dephosphorylation of adenosine triphosphate and LPS are responsible for this protective effect.
