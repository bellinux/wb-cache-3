However, he said that they didn't rule out the possibility of mainstream exposure. After the album was complete, guitarist Brad Avery left the band.|$|E

5000|$|Sarpi {{at the end}} of {{his life}} wrote to Daniel Heinsius that he favored the Calvinist Contra-Remonstrants' side at the Synod of Dort. Yet, {{although}} Sarpi corresponded with James I of England and admired the English Book of Common Prayer, in the 18th century Catholic theologian Le Courayer wrote that Sarpi was no a Protestant, terming him, [...] "Catholique en gros et quelque fois Protestant en détail" [...] ("Catholic overall and at times Protestant detail"). In the twentieth century William James Bouwsma found Sarpi to have been a philo-Protestant “whose religious ideas were nevertheless “consistent with Catholic orthodoxy”, and Eric Cochrane described him deeply religious in the typical spirit of the Counter-Reformation. Corrado Vivanti saw Sarpi was a religious reformer who aspired toward an ecumenical church, and historian Diarmaid MacCulloch describes Sarpi as having moved away from dogmatic Christianity. On the other hand, in 1983 David Wootton made a startling case for Sarpi as a scientific materialist and thus as likely a [...] "veiled" [...] atheist who was [...] "hostile to Christianity itself" [...] and whose politics looked forward to a secular society unrealizable in his own time, a thesis that has won some acceptance. Jaska Kainulainen, on the other hand, asserts that the thesis that Sarpi was an atheist contradicts the historical <b>record,</b> <b>pointing</b> out that neither Sarpi's pronounced skepticism nor his pessimistic view of capabilities are incompatible with religious faith.Sarpi’s writings do not support the claim that he was an atheist In fact, from an atheistic point of view systematic skepticism can be seen as providing support of religious belief, because atheists’ position postulates certain knowledge of God’s inexistence[...] [...] In his case the fundamental question was not the existence of God, but whether knowledge of God was obtainable by reason or by faith. His response was unequivocal: he was convinced that knowledge of divine matters was attained sola fide and he explicitly claimed that in religious matters one could not make judgments based on reason, but instead, they had to be based on affection or feeling Kainulainen identifies Sarpi as a fideist, neo-Stoic, and Christian mortalist, who, although critical of the Church of Rome, admired the purity of the early church.|$|E
