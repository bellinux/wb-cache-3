5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to <b>reprimand</b> a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the <b>reprimand</b> function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the <b>reprimand</b> function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the Securities and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly <b>reprimand</b> a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to <b>reprimand</b> Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its <b>reprimand</b> to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies {{was to examine the}} effects of <b>reprimands,</b> a mild {{disciplinary}} procedure, and work observation and pay loss, a severe disciplinary procedure on the maintenance of high-quality work among mild developmentally disabled individuals employed as housekeepers. In general, participants were more responsive to <b>reprimands</b> after work observation and pay loss was applied. In addition, the increased sensitivity to <b>reprimands</b> appeared to generalize to other work settings for one participant. While participants 2 ̆ 7 work quality varied across conditions, their work rate was relatively stable. These results are discussed in terms of other research that examined the use of <b>reprimands</b> in work settings...|$|R
5|$|Brown's {{comments}} at Duke {{and subsequent}} <b>reprimand</b> by President Gerald Ford were {{reported on the}} front page of The Washington Post on 13 and 14 November 1974. There was speculation that Brown would be asked to resign, or at least not be nominated for a second two-year term; but he was renominated and went on to serve under the new president, Jimmy Carter.|$|E

5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and {{a capital gains tax}} cut in 1997. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a <b>reprimand</b> from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and {{pressure}} from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 to 2008, 325 police {{officers}} were disciplined on substantiation of the complaints against them. Of these, 292 were given advice, 12 given warnings, 12 cautioned, two <b>reprimanded,</b> six severely <b>reprimanded</b> and one dismissed subsequent to criminal conviction.|$|R

40|$|Seven adults {{participated in}} {{simulated}} teaching sessions with an experimenter who role played {{as a student}} with developmental disabilities. The experimenter engaged in problem behavior and either (a) terminated problem behavior contingent on participant <b>reprimands</b> (negative reinforcement) or (b) did not terminate problem behavior contingent on <b>reprimands</b> (extinction). Results suggested that <b>reprimands</b> were sensitive to negative reinforcement {{in the form of}} the immediate cessation of problem behavior. These preliminary findings support role play as a potentially viable laboratory model for analyzing behaviors of typical adults...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} there were {{conflicting}} reports {{that she had not}} and allegations that she had warned a nearby convoy of the presence of a U-boat. The British nationality of her captain became an issue in the Irish general election of June 1943, there were diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Ireland, and questions raised in the British House of Commons. In Germany, the U-boat's captain received a mild <b>reprimand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh <b>reprimand</b> to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|For {{his last}} lap {{collision}} with teammate Jolyon Palmer, Kevin Magnussen received a ten-second time penalty, dropping him {{one place to}} 15th. He also received two penalty points to his licence. Carlos Sainz received a <b>reprimand</b> from the stewards for leaving the pit lane one minute before it was allowed. He escaped a more severe penalty because he stopped shortly afterwards, thereby not gaining an advantage. Upon his return to Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat recorded the first fastest lap of his career, and the first for the Italian team in their 190th Grand Prix.|$|E
40|$|This {{intervention}} study examined teachers' use of verbal praise and <b>reprimands</b> as specific components of teacher behavior management that can promote children's development in schools. The impact of teacher praise and <b>reprimands</b> on children's development was {{examined in the}} context of a teacher-mediated, classroom intervention. The sample involved 570 children and 30 teachers from 2 nd grade classrooms in 15 primary schools. The Good Behavior Game was implemented in half of the classrooms based on random assignment within schools. Teacher behavior management (praise for appropriate behavior and <b>reprimands</b> for inappropriate behavior) was observed during regular classroom lessons. Hyperactive, Disruptive, and Withdrawn child behavior were assessed using teacher and peer reports, Global self-concept and Emotional engagement were assessed using child self-reports. All variables were assessed at the beginning (pre-test) and at the end (post-test) of the school year. Multilevel regression models accounted for the nested structure of the data. The results suggested positive effects of fewer <b>reprimands</b> and more praise on child outcomes (except Emotional school engagement), although the results differed by informant. We also found indirect effects of the GBG on child outcomes via teacher praise and <b>reprimands.</b> Overall, the study suggests that teachers' use of praise and <b>reprimands</b> is a malleable classroom factor that influences children's behavioral and socio-emotional development. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|In 1931, Butler {{violated}} diplomatic norms by publicly recounting {{gossip about}} Benito Mussolini {{in which the}} dictator allegedly struck and killed a child with his speeding automobile in a hit-and-run accident. The Italian government protested and President Hoover, who strongly disliked Butler, forced Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III to court-martial him. Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a <b>reprimand.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Hitler's <b>reprimand,</b> Goebbels {{launched a campaign}} to promote the antisemitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. Hitler preferred films such as Der ewige Jude which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straight-forward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal <b>reprimand</b> for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E

5|$|Of the 252 {{officers}} tried, 76 {{per cent}} were found guilty, {{the most common}} offence (52 per cent of cases) being drunkenness. Although three officers were executed, an officer was most likely to receive a severe <b>reprimand</b> (60 per cent of cases– a severe blow to his career) or be cashiered (30 per cent of cases– stripped of his commission, which brought total social disgrace and barred him from any employment under the Crown, even working for the local council– but a cashiered officer could still be conscripted as a private to a different unit).|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall. The {{takeover}} was precipitated by increasing racial tension at {{the university and the}} students' frustration with the administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a <b>reprimand</b> of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.|$|E

5|$|As the frontrunners {{set their}} first timed laps in Q3, Hamilton {{made a mistake}} and ran wide at the last corner, leaving him behind Rosberg and both Ferrari drivers. Hülkenberg, both Williams drivers and Ricciardo were {{eliminated}} without setting another time, while the four fastest cars came out again. Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, who was just 0.077 seconds slower. Half a second behind, Vettel grabbed third place on the grid ahead of teammate Räikkönen. After qualifying, Hamilton's pole was put under threat after the FIA started an investigation after Hamilton reversed in the pit lane to park up. Hamilton was given a <b>reprimand</b> and his pole position stood.|$|E
