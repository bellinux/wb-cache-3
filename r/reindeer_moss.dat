25|$|The Fiery Gizzard Trail offers hikers {{views of}} 636 types of {{vascular}} plants including mountain laurel, hemlock trees, beefsteak fungus, violets, Solomon's seals, Hepatica, trillium, dwarf crested iris, <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss,</b> and galax.|$|E
25|$|The {{reindeer}} largely {{rely on the}} lichen and <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> {{that grow}} together with heather and hardy grass on the quite arid and nutrient-poor stony plateaus. The lichen provide food for the reindeer, but also fertilize the earth, {{making it possible for}} less hardy plants to grow, and mice and lemmings to feed. One of the flower species to survive very well is the Glacier Crowfoot, found up to 1700 metres (5580ft).|$|E
500|$|Lichens are abundant, with [...] 37% of European species {{represented}} in just 0.75% of the European land area. Most rock surfaces, except those in very exposed places, or that are kept constantly wet by sea or fresh water, become grown with lichens. <b>Reindeer</b> <b>Moss</b> (Cladonia rangiferina) {{is a common}} species. The trunks and branches of large trees are an important lichen habitat, Tree Lungwort being particularly conspicuous. In the past lichens were widely used for dyeing clothing.|$|E
30|$|The {{trees are}} {{comparatively}} small, {{and when they}} do not stand closely together their branches grow {{all the way to the}} ground. The open spaces, no matter how rocky, are covered with <b>reindeer</b> <b>mosses,</b> which, in the summer time, are as dry and flammable as tinder, while the deep carpeting of the yellow mosses among the trees themselves is equally dry and helps to give body to the flames.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{reindeer}} {{in southwestern}} Greenland have no naturally occurring non-human predators, harvesting quotas are established to help regulate {{the number of}} reindeer in an area and prevent overgrazing and death from starvation. During the winter, the great effort of pawing down (known as [...] "cratering") through the snow to their favorite food, a lichen known as <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss,</b> can cost them too many calories in expended energy, causing them to lose strength and die. Without human monitoring and regulation, mass starvation of reindeer would be a recurring problem.|$|E
2500|$|The cedar glades of Cedars of Lebanon State Forest {{are home}} to 350 plant species, 29 of which are endemic to the cedar glades. [...] Flowering [...] plant species living in the glades include the {{formerly}} endangered Tennessee Coneflower (Echinacea tennesseensis), the Prickly Pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa), Limestone flame flower (Phemeranthus calcaricus), Gattinger's Prairie Clover (Dalea gattingeri), Glade Phlox (Phlox bifida), and Nashville Breadroot (Pediomelum subacaule). [...] Nonflowering plants include <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> and glade moss. [...] Along with the red cedar, trees in the surrounding forest include white oak and shagbark hickory. [...] Wildlife chiefly consists of rodents and birds.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of a couple of hours the sledges drew near to the island, which proved to be a large but {{comparatively}} low one, rising not more than a hundred feet in any part. It was barren and ragged, with patches of <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> growing in some parts, and dwarf willows in others. Myriads of sea-birds made it their home, and these received the invaders with clamorous cries, as if they knew that white men were a dangerous novelty, and objected to the innovation.|$|E
60|$|Everywhere, {{except in}} the river gorges, the country {{displayed}} the low hummocky lines and tarn-like pools of intensely glaciated land; everywhere it was carpeted with <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> growing upon peat and variegated by bushes of flowering, sweet-smelling Labrador tea. In places this was starred with little harebells and diversified by tussocks of heather and rough grass, and over the rocks trailed delicate dwarf shrubs and a very pretty and fragrant pink-flowered plant of which neither she nor Trafford knew the name. There was an astonishing amount of wild fruit, raspberries, cranberries, and a white kind of strawberry that was very delightful. The weather, after its first outbreak, remained brightly serene....|$|E
60|$|Marjorie made no answer, but {{her eyes}} went from the <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> and scrub and {{thickets}} of the foreground to the low rocky ridges that bounded the view north and east of them. The scattered boulders, the tangles of wood, the barren upper slopes, the dust-soiled survivals of the winter's snowfall, all contributed to an effect at once carelessly desert and hopelessly untidy. She looked westward, and her memory was full of interminable streaming rapids, wastes of ice-striated rocks, tiresome struggles through woods and wild, wide stretches of tundra and tarn, trackless and treeless, infinitely desolate. It {{seemed to her that}} the sea coast was but a step from London and ten thousand miles away from her.|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the first}} day was spent in packing and lugging first the cargoes and then the canoes up through {{thickets}} and over boulders and across stretches of <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> {{for the better part of}} two miles to a camping ground about half-way up the rapids. Marjorie and Trafford tried to help with the carrying, but this evidently shocked and distressed the men too much, so they desisted and set to work cutting wood and gathering moss for the fires and bedding for the camp. When the iron stove was brought up the man who had carried it showed them how to put it up on stakes and start a fire in it, and then Trafford went to the river to get water, and Marjorie made a kind of flour cake in the frying-pan in the manner an American woman from the wilderness had once shown her, and boiled water for tea. The twilight had deepened to night while the men were still stumbling up the trail with the last two canoes.|$|E

50|$|Østerdalen {{is quite}} wide in most places. Østerdalen is {{characterized}} by tranquil landscapes and rounded mountains. The valley is mostly covered by pine forests. Typical of Østerdalen is that {{large parts of the}} forest floor are covered with <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss,</b> a variety of lichen.|$|E
50|$|The Cladoniaceae are {{a family}} of lichenized fungi in the order Lecanorales. The <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> and cup lichens (Cladonia) belong to this family. The latter genus, which {{comprises}} about 400 species, forms {{a major part of}} the diet of large mammals in taiga and tundra ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Other {{common names}} include <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> and caribou moss, but these names may be {{misleading}} {{since it is}} not a moss. As the common names suggest, reindeer lichen is an important food for reindeer (caribou), and has economic importance as a result. Synonyms include Cladina rangiferina and Lichen rangiferinus.|$|E
50|$|The park's Sand Pine (Pinus clausa) forest has large, mature Sand Pines {{towering over}} other scrub vegetation, such as Florida Rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), <b>Reindeer</b> <b>Moss</b> (Cladonia spp.), and scrub oaks: sand live oak (Quercus geminata), sandhill oak (Quercus inopina), myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), and Chapman’s oak (Quercus chapmanii).|$|E
5000|$|Upon the Canadian Shield and in {{the coolest}} weather, are subarctic lichen woodland. [...] The black spruce (Picea Mariana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and white spruce (Picea glauca) are {{commonly}} occurring trees. This area is interspersed with peatlands, bogs, fens, permafrost areas, and areas of arctic tundra. [...] Yellow and Grey <b>Reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> (Cladonia mitis) provide ground cover. The Subarctic Woodland corresponds to Canada's hardiness zone 0a.|$|E
50|$|Buffalo {{meat and}} pork are eaten by many janajati (indigenous nationalities with customs departing from Hindu norms). More traditionally, Magars ate pork but not water buffalo while the superficially similar Gurung did the opposite. Further east, Tamang, Rai and Limbu have unique ethnic foods {{including}} kinema (fermented soybeans), yangben (<b>Reindeer</b> <b>Moss),</b> preparations of bamboo shoots, bread made from millet or buckwheat, and traditional Limbu drink tongba (millet beer).|$|E
5000|$|An {{artificial}} bog {{has been}} created to demonstrate a mossy, peat-covered wetland. Plants such as the Pitcher plant, can be witnessed growing {{in this area of}} the HIBG. Plants that thrive in bogs are adapted to nutrient poor, acidic soil. [...] "Other plants include bog laurel, leatherleaf, white-fringed orchid, rose pogonia, grass-pink, bog huckleberry, dragon’s-mouth, as well as bunchberry, goldthread, starflowers, <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss,</b> beak-rush, liverwort, bulrush, lichens, chokecherry, sedges and cottongrass".|$|E

5000|$|Reindeer hooves {{adapt to}} the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing {{the rim of the}} hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an {{activity}} known as [...] "cratering") through the snow to their favorite food, a lichen known as <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the seaweed and glycogen carbohydrates mentioned above, the Inuit can access many plant sources. The stomach contents of caribou contain a large quantity of partially digested lichens and plants, which the Inuit once considered a delicacy. They also harvested <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> and other lichens directly. The extended daylight of the arctic summer led to a profusion of plant life, and they harvested plant parts including berries, roots and stems, as well as mushrooms. They preserved some gathered plant life to eat winter, often by dipping it in seal fat.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the river}} is flanked by thick forests. For its first 20 mi the river cuts through low marshy lands. The river {{broadens}} and the banks increase in height as it flows southward. Jack pine forest has all but replaced the virgin white and red pine forests on the sandy plains of northern Wadena County, Minnesota. Hazel, blueberries, sweet fern, bearberry, wintergreen, bracken and <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> provide lush ground cover. The Crow Wing's lower reaches are flanked by a river bottom forest of elm, ash, cottonwood, box elder, oak, basswood, maple, willow and aspen. Grasslands, bogs and swamps are scattered throughout the river corridor.|$|E
50|$|These spruce-edged {{sphagnum}} bogs {{are found}} in the upper sections of Red Creek and its tributaries, often in association with thickets of speckled alder. There are similar areas throughout the High Alleghenies, most famously the Cranberry Glades. The largest one at Dolly Sods is about a mile long and half a mile wide. The thick carpet of sphagnum moss and the polytrichum moss hummocks also sustain cotton grass, round leaf sundew and the lichen known as <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss.</b> In addition to the spruce, the bog margins are frequented by ferns, sedges and the occasional balsam fir. The three-toothed cinquefoil (Sibbaldiopsis tridentata) is often abundant and orchids — for example the pink lady's slipper — are sometimes seen.|$|E

In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing {{the rim of the}} hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an {{activity}} known as [...] "cratering"). [...] "In the winter, the fleshy pads on these toes grow longer and form a tough, hornlike rim. Caribou use these large, sharp-edged hooves to dig through the snow and uncover the lichens that sustain them in winter months. Biologists call this activity [...] "cratering" [...] because of the crater-like cavity the caribou’s hooves leave in the snow."

5000|$|The dunes {{are covered}} with heath, purple heather and other plants, both {{indigenous}} and cultivated. The dune pansy is a native flower with colors ranging from white to blue-violet. Creeping willow curls {{in the shape of}} a rose called the [...] "Skagen rose". Not a flower, it is dried and used to decorate souvenirs. The dune plantation was established in 1888 to the south of Skagen, and developed on both sides of the road that runs between Frederikshavn and Skagen, in order to stop the sand dunes from moving. It also facilitated better fishing catches. To the south, plantations (some even 100 years old) feature trees, including pines (mountain pine, Austrian pine, Scots pine and contorta), spruce, oak, birch in patches, as well as <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss.</b> These cultivated forests are also recreational areas, with well laid-out walkways. Here, the forest floor is spread with anemones, corydalis, scented honeysuckle and moss.|$|E
40|$|Thanks for turkey. Lady Banks {{recently}} {{called on}} him "as fat, as talkative, & as laughing as ever", concludes that ladies do not affect to mourn {{as long as}} they used to; recalls a young Carlisle widow who married a former sweetheart the day after lamenting the loss of her "dear mate". Bemoans the political jobbery being exhibited in Parliament, "who can deny but that all men have their price". Received a plant of 'Neottia speciosa' from the Bishop of Durham [Shute Barrington] but unsure if he can keep it alive. The Bishop has been advised to stop riding; Goodenough often sees him being driven in Regent's Park looking as young as he did thirty years ago. Their Linnean dining club now has between thirty and forty members. His granddaughter's bad back continues. [William] Bullock [(c 1780 - 1849), naturalist and antiquary] has brought to London two native Laplanders and a herd of reindeer which he hopes to naturalise; he says that Bagshot Heath has enough <b>reindeer</b> <b>moss</b> to support a herd of 100, 000...|$|E
