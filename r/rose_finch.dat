40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{expressions}} in Swedish and other languages, which describe the songs of different birds, e. g. the <b>rose</b> <b>finch</b> imitated as saying "Pleased to see you". These folk rhymes seem to both imitate the birds ' songs and to describe some content connected to the bird. Swedish folk rhymes for the songs of different birds were analyzed in terms of sound structure and content. Imitation of the bird songs is reflected in both vowels and consonants of the folk rhymes, e. g. in speech sounds with energy on low frequencies, such as [m], [u], [o], or speech sounds with energy on high frequencies, such as [s], [t], [i]. Vibrant sounds are often transformed into [r]. Imitation also conserves the number of "syllables", i. e. the rhythmic structure of the bird songs. Intonation variation is also transformed into words like "falling", "down", "up". A special case of transformation of intonation variation is seen when the melody of the bird is interpreted as emotional or attitudinal, and transferred into words like "snälla " (please) and "fy " (shame on you). The creation of folk rhymes could be seen as a type of folk etymology. In folk etymologies an incomprehensible series of sounds is heard and interpreted in terms of already existing words that fit the context, in the language one knows. Folk etymologies {{can be seen as a}} productive force in language development. A non-arbitrary connection between sound and content can aid memory and facilitate language learning...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of the {{long-term}} investigation, carried out in the Russian Far East (Primorye and Khabarovsk Territories, Amur and Sakhalin regions), and published data about bird ecology, the actual material about the birds feeding seeds and berries of the Amur cork-tree, Phellodendron amurense Rupr. and Sakhalin cork-tree, Ph. sachalinensis (Fr. Schmidt) Sarg., is given in the article. It has been found 43 carpophagous bird species from 15 families and 5 orders. The cork-tree berries, small roundish juicy fruits with little stones, are eaten by the birds of 40 species from 13 families; basically by Grey-headed Woodpecker – Picus canus, Azure-winged Magpies – Cyanopica cyanus, Bohemian and Japanaese Waxwings – Bombycilla garrulus and B. japonica, Thrushes: Pale Thrush – Turdus pallidus, Eyebrowed Thrush – Turdus obscurus, Grey-backed Thrush – T. hortulorum, Naumann’s Thrush – T. naumanni, and Dusky Thrush – T. eunomus, Eurasian Nuthatch – Sitta europaea, Pallas’s <b>Rose</b> <b>Finch</b> – Carpodacus roseus. The secondary birds – 16 species. On the Sakhalin isl. the Sakhalin cork-tree, Ph. sachalinensis berries are eaten by the birds of 33 species from 12 families, on the South Kuriles (Kunashir isl.) – by the birds of 28 species from 11 families. On Sakhalin the berries are eaten basically by the Waxwings (2 species), Dusky and Brown-headed – Turdus chrysolaus – Thrushes, Eurasian Nuthatch, Pallas’s Rose Finch; and secondary birds – 12 species. There are 5 species of the primary birds and 8 species of the secondary birds on the Kunashir isl. A participation of the birds in the dissemination of the cork-tree, Phellodendron Rupr., during seasonal migrations in winter and autumn has been considered. The active birds in the seed distribution are Grey-headed Woodpecker, Azure-winged Magpies, Waxwings, Thrushes and others; while they are eating the berries, the seeds are not damaged in the gastrointestinal tract and pushed with the excrements outside. In addition, Eurasian Nuthatches and Tits actively distribute the seeds, making stocks under the tree bark and in the semihollows. The passive agents of dissemination are Hazel Grouse – Tetrastes bonasia, Common Pheasant – Phasianus colchicus, Great Spotted Woodpeckers – Dendrocopos major, Oriental Tutle Doves – Streptopelia orientalis, Pallas’s Rose Finches, Hawfinches – Coccothraustes coccothraustes and some others, who can crack hard seed peel by the peckers, but some part of the seed peels retain undamaged in the gastrointestinal tract and is pushed outside. The main role in the cork-tree dissemination belongs to the migrants and wintering birds – woodpeckers, azure-winged magpies, thrushes and waxwings, distributing seeds on the feeding places and transferring them on the different distances from the areas of the plant growing...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. <b>Finch</b> <b>rose</b> {{from his}} seat, {{with the air}} of a man whose just anticipations have not been realized--whose {{innocent}} confidence has been scandalously betrayed. Here was a prospect! Another person in perpetual want of money, going to settle under the shadow of the rectory! Another man likely to borrow of Oscar--and that man his brother! ...|$|R
50|$|Finch {{was born}} in Monticello, New York, in 1872. He became a clerk in the United States Department of Justice, where he worked {{off and on for}} almost 40 years. <b>Finch</b> <b>rose</b> from the {{position}} of clerk to that of chief examiner between 1893 and 1908. It was only while working in the Justice Department that Finch earned his LL.B degree (1908), followed by an LL.M degree (1909) from what is now The George Washington University Law School. The Washington, DC bar association admitted him to practice in 1911.|$|R
60|$|He spoke {{without any}} of his usual hesitation; he took up his hat without looking either at Mr. Finch or at me. I felt more and more {{convinced}} that the influence which Nugent's vile breach of confidence had exerted over Oscar's mind, was an influence which had made a dangerous man of him. Resolved {{to prevent him from}} leaving us, I insisted on his returning to his chair, and hearing what I had to say. At the same moment, Mr. <b>Finch</b> <b>rose,</b> and placed himself between Oscar and the door. Seeing this, I thought it might be wise if I kept my interference in reserve, and allowed the rector to speak first.|$|R
2500|$|His hard hitting made Australian {{selectors}} to give Finch {{his first}} international appearance in T20 International against England on 12 January 2011. After two years, Finch {{made his first}} ODI appearance on 11 January 2013 against Sri Lanka. On 29 August 2013, Finch set a new record for Twenty20 international cricket for the highest ever T20I individual score, when he scored 156 runs off 63 balls for Australia against England at the <b>Rose</b> Bowl, Southampton. <b>Finch's</b> innings included 14 sixes (also a record) and 11 fours. The previous record was 123 runs, scored by Brendon McCullum of New Zealand. Finch received [...] "Man of the Match" [...] award in a Twenty 20 game against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 January 2011. He scored 122 runs.|$|R
6000|$|Reverend <b>Finch</b> <b>rose,</b> and said--he {{objected to}} everything. To {{receiving}} {{a message on}} a card instead of a proper note. To being expected to present himself at Browndown at a moment's notice. To being the last person informed (instead of the first) of Mr. Nugent Dubourg's exaggerated and absurd view of the case of his afflicted child. To the German surgeon, as being certainly a foreigner and a stranger, and possibly a quack. To the slur implied on British Surgery by bringing the foreigner to Dimchurch. To the expense involved in the same proceeding. Finally to the whole scope and object of Mr. Nugent Dubourg's proposal, which had for its origin rebellion against the decrees of an all-wise Providence, and for its result the disturbance of his daughter's mind--"under My influence, sir, a mind {{in a state of}} Christian resignation: under Your influence, a mind in a state of infidel revolt." [...] With those concluding remarks, the reverend gentleman sat down--and paused for a reply.|$|R
5000|$|Bielaski {{was born}} in Montgomery County, Maryland to the son of Methodist {{minister}} Alexander Bielaski. He received {{a law degree from}} The George Washington University Law School in 1904 where he was a founding father of the Gamma Eta chapter of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. That same year he joined the Department of Justice. Like his predecessor Stanley Finch, Bielaski worked his way up through the Justice Department. He served as a special examiner in Oklahoma where he [...] "straightened out the court records" [...] and aided in the reorganization of Oklahoma's court system when the Oklahoma Territory became a state. Returning to Washington, Bielaski entered the Bureau of Investigation and <b>rose</b> to become <b>Finch's</b> assistant. In this position {{he was in charge of}} administrative matters for the Bureau. At the end of April 1912, Attorney General George W. Wickersham appointed Bielaski to replace Finch. As Chief, Bielaski oversaw a steady increase in the resources and responsibilities assigned to the Bureau.|$|R
