25|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} the 802.11 channels that overlap into an amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> under the FCC in the United States. Note that the 5 cm amateur band extends from 5650 to 5925MHz, so that there are many frequencies outside the Part 15 ISM/UNII block used for 802.11a. Many commercial grade 802.11a access points can also operate in between the normal channels by using 5MHz channel spacing instead of the standard 20MHz channel spacing. 802.11a channels 132, 136 and 140 are only available for unlicensed use in ETSI regions.|$|E

There are also local stations such as Cork's 96FM, Cork's Red FM, C103, CUH 102.0FM, UCC 98.3FM (formerly Cork Campus Radio 97.4fm) and Christian radio station Life 93.1FM. Cork also has a temporary licensed citywide community station 'Cork FM Community Radio' on 100.5FM, which is currently on-air on Saturdays and Sundays only. Cork has also been home to pirate radio stations, including South Coast Radio and ERI in the 1980s. Today some small pirates stations remain. A number of neighbouring counties radio stations {{can be heard in}} parts of Cork City including Radio Kerry at 97.0 and WLR FM on 95.1.|$|E

2500|$|The 802.11a amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> {{consists}} of twelve non-overlapping channels in the 5.650–5.925GHz (5cm) band. The 802.11a standard uses OFDM or [...] "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing" [...] to transmit data and therefore is not classified as spread-spectrum. Because of this 802.11a hardware {{is not subject}} to the power rules in FCC [...] and the maximum allowable output power is 1500 watts (W) PEP.|$|E

2500|$|AM {{radio station}} WRIZ {{constructed}} radio towers in Stiltsville in 1967, {{on the south}} side of the Biscayne Channel. [...] It became radio station WRHC in 1985, and used the Stiltsville towers for daytime broadcasting at 10,000 watts on 1550kHz, until the site was decommissioned in approximately 1990. [...] Because salt water is highly conductive, it makes an excellent ground plane for signals in the mediumwave <b>radio</b> <b>band,</b> which allowed the station a greater broadcast range on the same power.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{professional}} or modified hardware {{it is possible}} to operate on 802.11a channels that are outside the FCC authorized Part 15 bands but still inside the 5.8GHz (5cm) or 2.4GHz (13cm) amateur radio bands. Transverters or [...] "frequency converters" [...] {{can also be used to}} move HSMM 802.11b/g/n operations from the 2.4GHz (13cm) band to the 3.4GHz (9cm) amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band.</b> Such relocation provides a measure of security by operating outside the channels available to unlicensed (Part 15) 802.11 devices.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{professional}} grade hardware {{or modified}} consumer grade hardware {{it is possible}} to operate on 802.11a channels 116–140 (5.57–5.71GHz) and channels above 165 (> 5.835GHz). These frequencies are outside of the FCC allocated Part 15 unlicensed band, but still inside of the 5.8GHz (5cm) amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band.</b> Modifying consumer hardware to operate on these expanded channels often involves installing after-market firmware and/or changing the [...] "country code" [...] setting of the wireless card. When buying professional grade hardware, many companies will authorize the use of these expanded frequencies for a small additional fee.|$|E

2500|$|Using amateur-only {{frequencies}} {{provide better}} security and interference characteristics to amateur radio operators. In the past {{it used to}} be easy to use modified consumer grade hardware to operate 802.11 on channels that are outside of the normal FCC allocated frequencies for unlicensed users but still inside an amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band.</b> However, regulatory concerns with the non-authorized use of licensed band frequencies is making it harder. The newer Linux drivers implement [...] that prevents a casual user to operate outside of the country specific operating bands. This requires the use of radio transceivers based on the use of Transverter (or frequency converter) technology.|$|E
2500|$|A contest {{score is}} {{computed}} {{based on a}} formula defined for that contest. [...] A typical formula assigns some number of points for each contact, and a [...] "multiplier" [...] based on {{some aspect of the}} exchanged information. [...] The rules for most contests held on the VHF amateur radio bands in North America assign a new multiplier for each new Maidenhead grid locator in the log, rewarding the competitors that make contacts with other stations in the most locations. [...] Many HF contests reward stations with a new multiplier for contacts with stations in each country - often based on the [...] "entities" [...] listed on the DXCC country list maintained by the American Radio Relay League ("ARRL"). [...] Depending on the rules for a particular contest, each multiplier may count once on each <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> or only once during the contest, regardless of the <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> on which the multiplier was first earned. [...] The points earned for each contact can be a fixed amount per contact, or can vary based on a geographical relationship such as whether or not the communications crossed a continental or political boundary. [...] Some contests, such as the Stew Perry Top Band Distance Challenge, award points are scaled to the distance separating the two stations. [...] Most contests held in Europe on the VHF and microwave bands award 1 point per kilometre of distance between the stations making each contact.|$|E
2500|$|Powell's {{style was}} rooted in the stride style that was the direct {{precursor}} to swing piano. One composition from his Goodman years, The Earl, is perhaps his best-known from that time. It is notable that the song—dedicated to Earl [...] "Fatha" [...] Hines, one of Powell's piano heroes—was recorded without a drummer. After nearly two years with Goodman, Powell played briefly with the CBS <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> under director Raymond Scott before Uncle Sam came calling. With World War II at its height, Powell was drafted into the U.S. Army, but fought his battles from a piano stool, having been assigned to Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Band from 1943 to 1945.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939 Scott, seeking greater {{challenges}} {{during the}} swing era, folded his Quintette {{into a big}} band, including bass player Chubby Jackson. They were both a recording and touring success. When Scott was appointed music director of CBS radio in 1942, he made history by breaking the color barrier, organizing the first racially integrated <b>radio</b> <b>band.</b> Over the next two years, he hired some of the hottest black jazz heavyweights of the day, such as saxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Charlie Shavers, bassist Billy Taylor, trumpeter Emmett Berry, trombonist Benny Morton, and drummer Cozy Cole. In 1942, Scott—who once told an interviewer he wouldn't hire himself to play piano in his own bands—relinquished his keyboard duties with his bands, so he could focus more closely on hiring, composing, arranging and conducting. (He later returned to the keyboard {{with some of his}} bands.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Quartz crystal {{resonators}} {{are many}} {{orders of magnitude}} more stable than LC circuits and when used to control {{the frequency of the}} local oscillator [...] offer adequate stability to keep a receiver in tune. [...] However the resonant frequency of a crystal is determined by its dimensions and cannot be varied to tune the receiver to different frequencies. [...] One solution is to employ many crystals, one for each frequency desired, and switch the correct one into the circuit. [...] This [...] "brute force" [...] technique is practical when only a handful of frequencies are required, but quickly becomes costly and impractical in many applications. For example, the FM <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> in many countries supports 100 individual channel frequencies from about 88 MHz to 108MHz; the ability to tune in each channel would require 100 crystals. [...] Cable television can support even more frequencies or channels over a much wider band. A large number of crystals increases cost and requires greater space.|$|E
2500|$|All {{contests}} use {{one or more}} amateur radio bands {{on which}} competing stations may make two-way contacts. [...] HF contests use {{one or more of}} the 160 meter, 80 Meter, 40 Meter, 20 Meter, 15 Meter, and 10 Meter bands. [...] VHF contests use all the amateur radio bands above 50 MHz. [...] Some contests permit activity on all HF or all VHF bands, and may offer points for contacts and multipliers on each band. [...] Other contests may permit activity on all bands but restrict stations to making only one contact with each other station, regardless of band, or may limit multipliers to once per contest instead of once per band. [...] Most VHF contests in North America are similar to the ARRL June VHF QSO Party, and allow contacts on all the amateur radio bands 50MHz or higher in frequency. [...] Most VHF contests in the United Kingdom, however, are restricted to one amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band</b> at a time. [...] An HF contest with worldwide participation that restricts all contest activity to just one band is the ARRL 10 Meter Contest.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} eight, Paul {{began playing}} the harmonica. After trying to learn the piano, he {{switched}} to the guitar. It was during this time that he invented a neck-worn harmonica holder, which allowed him to play {{both sides of the}} harmonica hands-free while accompanying himself on the guitar. It is still manufactured using his basic design. By age thirteen, Paul was performing semi-professionally as a country-music singer, guitarist, and harmonica player. While playing at the Waukesha area drive-ins and roadhouses, Paul began his first experiment with sound. [...] Wanting to make himself heard by more people at the local venues, he wired a phonograph needle to his guitar and connected it to a radio speaker, using that to amplify his acoustic guitar. As a teen Paul created his first solid body electric guitar using a 2-foot piece of rail from a nearby train line. At age seventeen, Paul played with Rube Tronson's Texas Cowboys, and soon after he {{dropped out of high school}} to team up with Sunny Joe Wolverton's <b>Radio</b> <b>Band</b> in St. Louis, Missouri, on KMOX.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{contests}} {{draw upon}} the heritage of DX communications, traffic handling, and communications readiness. [...] Since 1928, the number and variety of competitive amateur radio operating events have increased. [...] In 1934, contests were sponsored by radio societies in Australia, Canada, Poland, and Spain, and the ARRL sponsored a new contest specifically for the ten meter amateur <b>radio</b> <b>band.</b> [...] By the end of 1937, contests were also being sponsored in Brazil, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand. [...] The first VHF contest was the ARRL VHF Sweepstakes held in 1948, and the first RTTY contest {{was sponsored by the}} RTTY Society of Southern California in 1957. [...] The first publication dedicated exclusively to the sport, the National Contest Journal, began circulation in the United States in 1973. [...] The IARU HF World Championship, a worldwide contest sponsored by the International Amateur Radio Union, was known as the IARU Radiosport Championship from its inception in 1977 until the name of the contest changed in 1986. Recognizing the vitality and maturity of the sport, CQ Amateur Radio magazine established the Contest Hall of Fame in 1986.
