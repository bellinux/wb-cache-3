5000|$|<b>Remittance</b> <b>advice</b> is {{a letter}} sent by a {{customer}} to a supplier, to inform the supplier that their invoice has been paid. If the customer is paying by cheque, the <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> often accompanies the cheque. The advice may consist of a literal letter (e.g., [...] "Gentlemen: Your shipment of the 10th inst was received in good order; accompanying is our remittance of $52.47 per invoice No 83046") or of a voucher attached to the side or top of the cheque.|$|R

50|$|Increasing {{adoption}} of {{electronic funds transfer}} (EFT) and electronic <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> (ERA) enrollment continues to challenge healthcare organizations. To simplify this process, CAQH launched EnrollHub in 2013 to offer providers a single enrollment process for EFT and ERA with multiple payers. Providers complete the standardized, electronic enrollment form and select the health plans with which they do business. CAQH notifies the health plans of the enrollment, and the health plan then accesses the provider’s banking information.|$|R

50|$|After {{the claims}} {{adjudication}} process is complete, {{the insurance company}} often sends {{a letter to the}} person filing the claim describing the outcome. The letter, which is sometimes referred to as <b>remittance</b> <b>advice,</b> includes a statement as to whether the claim was denied or approved. If the company denied the claim, it has to provide an explanation for the reason why under regional laws. The company also often sends an explanation of benefits that includes detailed information about how each service included in the claim was settled. Insurance companies will then send out payments to the providers if the claims are approved or to the provider’s billing service.|$|R
50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>remittance</b> <b>advice</b> (ERA) is {{an electronic}} data interchange (EDI) version of a medical insurance payment explanation. It provides details about providers' claims payment, and if the claims are denied, it would then contain the required explanations. The explanations include the denial codes and the descriptions, which present {{at the bottom of}} ERA. ERA are provided by plans to Providers. In the United States the industry standard ERA is HIPAA X12N 835 (HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; X12N = insurance subcommittees of ASC X12; 835 is the specific code number for ERA), which is sent from insurer to provider either directly or via a bank.|$|R
50|$|The {{insurance}} company (payer) processes the claims usually by medical claims examiners or medical claims adjusters. For higher dollar amount claims, the {{insurance company}} has medical directors review the claims and evaluate their validity for payment using rubrics (procedure) for patient eligibility, provider credentials, and medical necessity. Approved claims are reimbursed for {{a certain percentage of}} the billed services. These rates are pre-negotiated between the health care provider and {{the insurance company}}. Failed claims are denied or rejected and notice is sent to provider. Most commonly, denied or rejected claims are returned to providers in the form of Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic <b>Remittance</b> <b>Advice.</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on the Goal-Plans-Action model (Dillard, 1990, 2004), this {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} interaction goals, thoughts, and cognitive effort influence <b>advice</b> <b>message</b> production in an upward influence context. Study I (N= 140) investigates upward influence goal structure and cognitive responses that employees generate when {{they attempt to}} advise their supervisor {{on how to improve}} work. Building on the findings of Study I, Study II (N= 212) distinguishes relatively low and high thoughtfulness in message production and tests whether the amount of cognitive elaboration affects <b>advice</b> <b>message</b> qualities. Results from both studies show that heightened degree of primary goal importance (problem-comprehension and/or problem-solving goals) is associated with a greater number of anticipatory thoughts (caution thoughts), greater cognitive effort in deciding how to give advice to one 2 ̆ 7 s boss, and <b>advice</b> <b>messages</b> that contain a larger number and more diverse set of reasons. Cognitive effort and caution thoughts also mediate the impact of primary goals on the degree of reasoning present in <b>advice</b> <b>messages.</b> In addition, results from Study II also provide initial evidence of how a message production process may vary depending on people 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive elaboration. It is found that when people have less motivation to elaborate (i. e., engage in issue relevant thinking about information in a hypothetical advice scenario), they rely only on a few salient goals or thoughts in generating messages. In contrast, when people are in a high elaboration state of mind, they activate an array of thoughts and goals with each of these factors playing a distinct role in predicting message features. Having said this, the basic set of causal relations, outlined in the GPA model, including the mediating role of cognitive effort and caution thoughts, appear to operate similarly in both high and low elaboration conditions. Theoretical implications for extending the GPA model and practical implications for improving upward influence practice are discussed. ...|$|R
5000|$|Providers {{typically}} {{charge more}} for services than {{what has been}} negotiated by the physician and the insurance company, so the expected payment from the insurance company for services is reduced. The amount that is paid by the insurance is known as an allowable amount. [...] For example, although a psychiatrist may charge $80.00 for a medication management session, the insurance may only allow $50.00, and so a $30.00 reduction (known as a [...] "provider write off" [...] or [...] "contractual adjustment") would be assessed. After payment has been made, a provider will typically receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or Electronic <b>Remittance</b> <b>Advice</b> (ERA) along with the payment from the insurance company that outlines these transactions.|$|R
5000|$|Advice (also called exhortation) {{is a form}} of {{relating}} personal or institutional opinions, belief systems, values, recommendations or guidance about certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or party often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct.

This study presents a model of advice interactions that accounts for the impact of advice-giver goals on recipient evaluations of <b>advice</b> <b>messages,</b> and these recipient evaluations on recipient perceptions of the overall message quality. The giver goals of change and novelty are shown to have the most impact on recipient evaluations of efficacy/feasibility, absence of limitations, confirmation, negative facework, fellowship facework, competence facework, and perceptions of message quality. Recipient evaluations influence recipient perceptions of message quality in ways that are generally consistent with prior findings.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{evaluation}} of advice given in comments on Facebook status updates. To date, most research on advice has focused on dyadic, face-to-face interactions. The masspersonal channel of Facebook introduces a public into advice exchanges, including not only an audience but multiple advisors. The current study extends advice response theory by examining how advice recipients are affected by perceived consensus and tailoring in <b>advice</b> <b>messages,</b> and by the trait of conformity or the desire to conform to others 2 ̆ 7 opinions. Participants (N = 269) completed questionnaires about past status updates on Facebook in which they disclosed a problem and received advice in comments from friends. Hierarchical multiple regression and mediation analyses were {{used to test the}} effects of consensus, tailoring, and conformity, along with message content and advisor characteristics. Message content was the strongest predictor of intention to implement advice, and mediated the influence of advisor characteristics. Consensus was a significant independent predictor. The effect of tailoring was mediated by message content and advisor characteristics. Finally, problem seriousness had a direct effect on intention to implement advice, moderated by tailoring. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, along with directions for future research. ...|$|R
