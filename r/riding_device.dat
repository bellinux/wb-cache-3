40|$|In {{the seal}} {{literature}} {{you can find}} many attempts by various researchers to adapt film riding seals to the gas turbine engine. None have been successful, potential distortion of the sealing faces is the primary reason. There is a film <b>riding</b> <b>device</b> that does accommodate distortion and is in service in aircraft applications, namely the foil bearing. More specifically a foil thrust bearing. These are {{not intended to be}} seals, and they do not accommodate large axial movement between shaft & static structure. By combining the 2 a unique type of face seal has been created. It functions like a normal face seal. The foil thrust bearing replaces the normal primary sealing surface. The compliance of the foil bearing allows the foils to track distortion of the mating seal ring. The foil seal has several perceived advantages over existing hydrodynamic designs, enumerated in the chart. Materials and design methodology needed for this application already exist. Also the load capacity requirements for the foil bearing are low since it only needs to support itself and overcome friction forces at the antirotation keys...|$|E

50|$|The unique binding {{alignment}} {{coupled with}} the use of free-heel bindings on the teleboard allows the rider to face forward and have complete freedom over weight distribution. The rider can focus their weight down on the center of the board to flex it and carve tightly, or distribute weight over the length to keep the board straighter. Also, weight can be shifted vertically, by standing tall or kneeling. This extension and flexion {{is an essential part of}} carved turns, and the extent of them that the teleboard allows lends itself to deep or extreme carving.The extremely close angle of the bindings, along with the long length and narrow width of the board make the Teleboard extremely easy to use for quick edge changes, rendering the board ideal for riding bumps, carving tight turns, and reacting to unexpected obstacles. Also, the edge radius of Teleboards tends to be very small, comparable to slalom skis, which is unusual for skiing or <b>riding</b> <b>devices</b> as long as a teleboard.Because the bindings are mounted almost in-line with the direction of the board, it is possible for the rider to use poles, which can aid the rider in learning the sport.|$|R
50|$|In Hunt seat style English <b>riding,</b> these <b>devices</b> {{originally}} {{developed as a}} two-rein bitting system. One set of reins is an ordinary direct snaffle rein, {{and the other is}} the running or draw rein. The rider holds these reins {{in a manner similar to}} a double bridle, usually with the snaffle rein below the fourth finger and the running or draw rein between the third and fourth fingers, although there are variations on this. When riding in this fashion, the rider should ride predominantly on the snaffle rein. However, riders and trainers may often be observed using only the running or draw rein, in many cases with the snaffle rein completely absent from the bridle. Riding with draw reins alone is a controversial practice among English riders.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical hackamores {{lack the}} sophistication of bits or a bosal, cannot turn a horse easily with direct reining, and are {{primarily}} used for their considerable stopping power. [...] Horses <b>ridden</b> in these <b>devices</b> quite often develop a bad habit of head-tossing. The longer the shanks, the more severe the action. Similarly, a thinner noseband is also more severe. Occasionally it is used for a horse that has learned to ignore bit pressure on the mouth, or for horses with an injured mouth.|$|R
5000|$|A {{submarine}} pipeline may be laid {{inside a}} trench {{as a means}} of safeguarding it against fishing gear (e.g. anchors) and trawling activity. This may also be required in shore approaches to protect the pipeline against currents and wave action (as it crosses the surf zone). Trenching can be done prior to pipeline lay (pre-trenching), or afterward by seabed removal from below the pipeline (post-trenching). In the latter case, the trenching <b>device</b> <b>rides</b> on top of, or straddles, the pipeline. Several systems are used to dig trenches in the seabed for submarine pipelines: ...|$|R
50|$|A wet sub {{is a type}} of {{underwater}} vehicle (submarine) that does not provide a dry environment for its occupants. Usually, wetsuited scuba divers will <b>ride</b> upon the <b>device</b> (as one would ride a motorcycle or with an opening as in an Olympic bobsled), although it can be designed to fully enclose its occupant(s) to provide lower drag. An enclosed vehicle may provide a dry viewing chamber for the occupant(s). The motive force is an electric motor and usually the power source is an electric battery. The depth and duration at depth is typically limited by the requirements of a scuba diver.|$|R
30|$|Other long-reach {{systems with}} a small {{diameter}} are those used for the inspection and maintenance of piping networks. The body of these systems is essentially a passive elastic hose, flexible enough {{to adapt to the}} continuous change of direction present in pipings, and its propulsion source is located at the tip. This propulsion is based on water-jet which generates enough thrusting force to pull the whole system inside the network. The movement of these devices is limited since their propulsion is only forward; some special passive tools are used to assist in adapting to changing directions [17]. In case the pipe is big enough and path selection is necessary, robotic mechanisms can be employed [18]. Despite the fact that these systems have a fixed diameter along their body and capable of self-propulsion. They lack control for open areas, which is necessary when the system is inside the PCV. There exist other devices that use water-jet as their propulsion source and it is possible to control them in open areas. These devices are developed for amusement activities. Their size is considerably large and their control is completely manual. Furthermore, the user requires highly trained skills, as well as <b>ride</b> the <b>device</b> to control it through his/her body movements [19, 20].|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to analyze the effects {{of different types of}} treatment on excess post exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), flexibility, free radical and antioxidants in women using a horseback <b>riding</b> therapeutic <b>device.</b> Subjects were trained in regular horseback riding exercises for 12 weeks (3 times/wk). The effects of this exercise were examined by means of a single session of horseback riding that lasted for 30 min. 21 women were recruited from a public health center and divided into 3 groups (passive recovery group, passive+massage recovery group, and dynamic recov-ery group). 3 types of recovery patterns were determined after a single trial of horseback riding exercise. Their flexibility were determined pre-and post-training by Paired T test, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data. The results were as follows: Among the 3 groups, the dynamic recovery group showed the highest levels of EPOC compared to the other groups, and also showed higher lev-els of anti-oxidants, as did the passive+massage recovery group compared to the passive recovery group. Moreover, horseback riding exercise greatly increased flexibility in the women. In conclusion, regular horseback riding training is recommended to enhance the flexibility of women and dynamic recovery is recommended to enhance EPOC and anti-oxidants after a single bout of exercise.

40|$|The {{dream of}} every surfer is an {{extremely}} steep wave propagating at the highest speed possible. The best waves for this would be shock waves, but are very hard to surf. In the nanoscopic world the same is true: the surfers in this case are electrons <b>riding</b> through nanomechanical <b>devices</b> on acoustic waves [1]. Naturally, this has {{a broad range of}} applications in sensor technology and for communication electronics for which the combination of an electronic and a mechanical degree of freedom is essential. But this is also of interest for fundamental aspects of nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), when it comes to quantum limited displacement detection [2] and the control of phonon number states [3]. Here, we study the formation of shock waves in a NEMS resonator with an embedded two-dimensional electron gas using surface acoustic waves. The mechanical displacement of the nano-resonator is read out via the induced acoustoelectric current. Applying acoustical standing waves we are able to determine the anomalous acoustocurrent. This current is only found in the regime of shock wave formation. We ontain very good agreement with model calculations. Comment: 14 Pages including 4 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The woman {{now wants}} the invention's creator's {{assurance}} that the machine is safe; when the clone-scientist assures her {{that he is the}} creator, she denies it, insisting to his frustration that he is but a copy and that the original scientist has long since ceased to exist; his producing identifying documents (and a believing mother!) are of no avail. The lady then recommends that the scientist <b>ride</b> the <b>device</b> but with having delayed, for five minutes, the destruction of the original; he agrees and again enters the machine. The original and his twin step out at once and quite enjoy each other's company until the lady asks which of the two is the original: naturally, neither wishes to be destroyed, and so both deny being the one who stepped into the first booth. At the lady's suggestion, a game of chess is to decide which of the two must die: one of the scientists wins and orders his double into the first booth, but the narratress counters that the original would more likely be able to defeat his duplicate; thereupon, the lady and the loser force the winner of the game into the booth to face his doom, his panicked right arm still sticking out of the shut door. We hear the same short burst as before. Lady and inventor are overcome with guilt and the latter, exiting in tears, no longer asks his questioner to ride the machine. Somber music plays and the narratress sings about her misguided jest; she enters the first booth and begins the process. Out of the second booth steps her likeness; the same burst is heard at the first. Her voice narrates: [...] "I was now a guiltless copy!" [...] As the relieved lady trips merrily away, we hear her hymn to her innocence: [...] "...Bluebird sitting on my head,/Aren't you glad my old one's dead?/Hello, brook! Good morning, tree!/I've just begun to be!" [...] &c.|$|R
