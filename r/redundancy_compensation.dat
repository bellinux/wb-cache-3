40|$|AbstractGap {{junctions}} are intercellular conduits {{for small}} molecules {{made up by}} protein subunits called connexins. A large number of connexin genes were found in mouse and man, and most cell types express several connexins, lending support {{to the view that}} <b>redundancy</b> and <b>compensation</b> among family members exist. This review gives an overview of the current knowledge on <b>redundancy</b> and functional <b>compensation</b> — or lack thereof. It takes into account the different properties of connexin subunits which comprise gap junctional intercellular channels, but also the compatibility of connexins in gap junctions. Most insight has been gained by the investigation of mice deficient for one or more connexins and transgenic mice with functional replacement of one connexin gene by another. Most single deficient mice show phenotypical alterations limited to critical developmental time points or to specific organs and tissues, while mice doubly deficient for connexins expressed in the same cell type usually show more severe phenotypical alterations. Replacement of a connexin by another connexin in some cases gave rise to rescue of phenotypical alterations of connexin deficiencies, which were restricted to specific tissues. In many tissues, connexin substitution did not restore phenotypical alterations of connexin deficiencies, indicating that connexins are specialized in function. In some cases, fatal consequences arose from the replacement. The current consensus gained from such studies is that <b>redundancy</b> and <b>compensation</b> among connexins exists at least to a limited extent.

40|$|Some gene deletions or {{mutations}} {{have little}} effect on metabolism and metabolic adaptation because of <b>redundancy</b> and/or <b>compensation</b> in metabolic pathways. The mechanisms for <b>redundancy</b> and/or <b>compensation</b> in metabolic adaptation in mammalian cells are unidentified. Here, we show that in mouse muscle and myogenic cells, compensatory regulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC 5) transcriptional repressor maintains metabolic integrity. HDAC 5 phosphorylation regulated the expression of diverse metabolic genes and glucose metabolism in mouse C 2 C 12 myogenic cells. However, loss of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a HDAC 5 kinase, in muscle did not affect HDAC 5 phosphorylation in mouse skeletal muscle during exercise, but resulted in a compensatory increase (32. 6 %) in the activation of protein kinase D (PKD), an alternate HDAC 5 kinase. Constitutive PKD activation in mouse C 2 C 12 myogenic cells regulated metabolic genes and glucose metabolism. Although aspects of this response were HDAC 5 phosphorylation dependent, blocking HDAC 5 phosphorylation when PKD was active engaged an alternative compensatory adaptive mechanism, which involved post-transcriptional reductions in HDAC 5 mRNA (− 93. 1 %) and protein. This enhanced {{the expression of a}} specific subset of metabolic genes and mitochondrial metabolism. These data show that compensatory regulation of HDAC 5 maintains metabolic integrity in mammalian cells and reinforces the importance of preserving the cellular metabolic adaptive response. —McGee, S.

The number of unemployed in Spain stood at 5,273,600; the number of households in which all their active members was unemployed stood at 1,575,000; the unemployment rate was 22.85%, double the average EU rate; the youth unemployment rate was closer to 50%; 1.2 million jobs had been lost since the fourth quarter of 2007; the percentage of the work force regarded as temporary workers was at 25%, one of the highest in the EU.On Friday 10 February 2012, she launched the first labour reform of the PP government. This measure gainedthe support of the European Commission, the Bank of Spain and the OCDE, but it couldn't get the approval of the trade unions. Although Báñez was open to dialogue, she confirmed that the basic lines of the reform would remain unchanged. The most criticized point was that of making dismissal less costly, because the compensation for unfair dismissal for indefinite duration contracts was reduced from 45 to 33 days per year worked, while the compensation in the case of objective dismissals, was set at 20 days per year worked. <b>Redundancy</b> <b>compensation</b> for workers in Spain was traditionally the highest in Europe.

5000|$|In (French speaking) Belgium {{the term}} Procédure Renault {{has become a}} synonym for the {{consultation}} process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s. When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which {{is also known as}} severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The <b>redundancy</b> <b>compensation</b> payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave. If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction. [...] A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in (South African English). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy. [...] Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between leaving the company of one's own free will, in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal redeployment.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{official}} report. Research by the Centre for Global Sourcing and Services at Loughborough University has highlighted an emerging skills {{gap between the}} entry-level of those professional careers that form the bedrock of business support services within organisations and the ‘talent pipeline’ to senior roles such as business partner. The reconfiguration, re-engineering and relocation of many back and middle-office roles through business process outsourcing (BPO) and shared service centres (SSC) is causing a serious career entry problem, because the training 'nurseries', where the skills, knowledge and behaviours of a life-long professional career, are forged. At present this trend is largely under the media radar because the SSC operates within company boundaries and migration to offshore locations is generally both piecemeal and phased. Economic effects are also masked by a 'honeymoon' effect of lower costs for organisations but little resistance from displaced workers as they retire, receive <b>redundancy</b> <b>compensation</b> or leave through natural wastage when migration is phased. However, portents of the future are already manifesting: Indeed, typical student debt has now risen to around £ 50, 000, graduate entry jobs are now falling (Association of Graduate Recruiters, 2016) {{and at the same}} time there is evidence emerging that the 'talent pipeline' into mid-level career roles such as business partners and data analysis experts is drying up. More positively, our report suggests that it should be attractive for organisations to employ undergraduates in ‘middle-office’ work on an Earn-to-Learn basis throughout the course of their degree programmes. The idea is to enable students to access quality work-based learning which will allow them to improve their work-readiness and graduate with lower debt, and perhaps near to debt-free especially where schemes are able to access graduate apprenticeship funding. There are significant advantages for a range of stakeholders. Universities have an opportunity to widen access by encouraging those potential students who may be put off by high graduation debt and thus, improve employability rates. Organisations will have access to a new, intelligent, flexible workforce, at an attractive cost relative to many offshore destinations, especially with the lower Sterling exchange rate. Moreover, there is the opportunity to rebuild the talent pipeline and contribute to Corporate Social Responsibility by helping young people to get a career start. For government and regional economies there is a chance to stem the outflow of good quality service work and build capability in new knowledge work by designing programmes for data analytics and robotic process automation solutions.

40|$|This study {{establishes}} {{a context for}} Haydns practice of recomposing his recapitulations. While previous studies on altered recapitulations have {{tended to focus on}} Haydns oeuvre in isolation, in particular on his string quartets, the present study includes a comparatively high number of supposedly minor composers in order to examine whether Haydns practice was as exceptional as is generally assumed. The first part addresses important conceptual issues: Chapter 1 considers the methodological foundations for a scientifically oriented Formenlehre, arguing that the current form-analytical practice is characterized both by a lack of historical contextualization and a disregard for empirical methods. I argue further that analytical statements concerning causal dependencies between formal options are in reality often covert intentional explanations, a fact, however, that is rarely reflected upon explicitly. Based on this observation, I outline ways in which the concept of rational (or intentional) explanation can be fruitfully applied to the domain of formal analysis. Chapter 2 presents a rational reconstruction of the concept of recapitulation, exploring four essential recapitulatory principles (the principle of the double return, the sonata principle, the principles of maintaining momentum and of avoiding redundancy) and potential conflicts between them. As I demonstrate in the second, empirical part (Chapters 3 - 7), the theoretical expectations derived from these principles are largely anachronistic in nature: Haydn and his contemporaries often did not avoid what by modern standards may be viewed as a redundant situation in the recapitulation (Chapter 3 - 4). Likewise, they did not see any reason to recompose an off-tonic beginning of the main theme when it returns in the reprise, even though this undermines the dramatic impact commonly associated with the moment of double return (Chapter 5). Contrary to modern expectations, also a composers choice to launch the recapitulation in an off-tonic (wrong) key did not give rise to the need to compensate for this alleged deficiency at some later point in the recapitulation (Chapter 6). Chapter 7 finally illustrates some of the difficulties involved with the teleological model of sonata form when dealing with Haydns (and other composers) more circular formal conceptions in which developmental and recapitulatory procedures are strongly intermingled. These findings suggest that current Formenlehre is ill-advised in continuing to assess eighteenth-century music by modern standards of thematic <b>redundancy,</b> <b>compensation,</b> and (dramatic) goal-directedness. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true" <w:lsdexception locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false" <w:lsdexception locked="false" priority=" 9 "

To gain further insight into the possible physiological significance of GALR 2, we created mutant mice that were deficient in GALR 2 and compared their phenotype to that of wild-type (WT) littermate or age-matched controls, with respect to basic motor and sensory function, feeding behavior, reproduction, mood, learning and memory, and seizure susceptibility. Phenotypic analysis revealed that animals bearing a deletion of GALR 2 did not differ significantly from their WT controls in any of the measured variables. We conclude that either GALR 2 plays no role in these physiological functions or through <b>redundancy</b> or <b>compensation</b> these mutant animals can adapt to the congenital absence of GALR 2.

Here, {{we report}} {{the contributions of}} other intrinsic and extrinsic pathway signals to these processes. Sympathetic neurons expressed all antiapoptotic BCL- 2 proteins examined, yet expressed only certain BH 3 -only and multidomain proapoptotic BCL- 2 family members. All coexpressed proapoptotic proteins did not, however, exhibit functional redundancy or compensatory expression, {{at least in the}} Bax−/−, Bak−/−, Bim−/−, Bid−/−, and Bad−/− neurons examined. Although the subcellular distribution or posttranslational modification of certain BCL- 2 proteins changed with TFD, neither transcriptional nor posttranslational mechanisms regulated the expression or subcellular localization of BID, BAD, or BAK in this paradigm. Despite modest induction of Fas and FasL expression, Fas-mediated signaling did not contribute to TFD-induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons. Similar findings were obtained with K+ withdrawal–induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons, a model for activity-dependent neuronal survival in the CNS. Thus, expression alone does not guarantee functional <b>redundancy</b> (or <b>compensation)</b> among BCL- 2 family members, and, at least in some cells, extrinsic pathway signaling and certain BH 3 -only proteins (i. e., BID and BAD) do not contribute to BAX-dependent cyt c release or apoptosis caused by TFD...|$|R
40|$|Quorum sensing is a {{mechanism}} of cell-to-cell communication that allows bacteria to coordinately regulate gene expression {{in response to}} changes in cell-population density. At {{the core of the}} Vibrio cholerae quorum-sensing signal transduction pathway reside four homologous small RNAs (sRNAs), named the quorum regulatory RNAs 1 – 4 (Qrr 1 – 4). The four Qrr sRNAs are functionally redundant. That is, expression of any one of them is sufficient for wild-type quorum-sensing behaviour. Here, we show that the combined action of two feedback loops, one involving the sRNA-activator LuxO and one involving the sRNA-target HapR, promotes gene dosage compensation between the four qrr genes. Gene dosage compensation adjusts the total Qrr 1 – 4 sRNA pool and provides the molecular mechanism underlying sRNA <b>redundancy.</b> The dosage <b>compensation</b> mechanism is exquisitely sensitive to small perturbations in Qrr levels. Precisely maintained Qrr levels are required to direct the proper timing and correct patterns of expression of quorum-sensing-regulated target genes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The S. cerevisiae MAPKKK Ste 11 p, a {{homologue}} of mammalian MEKK 1, regulates three MAPK cascades for mating, invasive {{growth and}} osmotic stress and provides functions that are additive with the cell wall integrity pathway. Cell wall integrity requires the FKS 2 gene that encodes a stress-induced alternative subunit of beta- 1, 3 glucan synthase {{that is the}} target of echinocandin 1, 3 - beta glucan synthase inhibitors. The major signal transduction pathways that activate transcription of the FKS 2 gene include the cell wall integrity and calcineurin pathways, and the Ste 11 p pathway. Results Here it is shown that catalytically active Ste 11 p regulates FKS 2 -lacZ reporter genes through Ste 12, calcineurin/Crz 1 p- and PKC pathways and the high osmolarity pathway. Ste 11 p stimulated the cell wall integrity MAPK Mpk 1 p (Erk 5 homologue) and FKS 2 independently of the mating pathway. Ste 11 p regulated FKS 2 through all known and putative substrates: Pbs 2 p MAPKK, Ste 7 MAPKK, Cmk 2 p calmodulin dependent kinase and Ptk 2 p kinase. Ste 11 p increased the expression level of Cmk 2 p through transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Conclusions The data suggest Ste 11 p regulates the FKS 2 gene through all its known and putative downstream kinase substrates (Pbs 2 p, Ste 7 p, Cmk 2 p, and Ptk 2 p) and separately through Mpk 1 p MAPK. The patterns of control by Ste 11 p targets revealed novel functional linkages, cross-regulation, <b>redundancy</b> and <b>compensation.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Image {{compression}} {{refers to}} the process of reducing the quantity of data used to represent digital images, and is a combination of spatial image compression and temporal motion compensation. Spatial image compression is done by exploiting the spatial <b>redundancy.</b> Temporal motion <b>compensation</b> is done by exploiting the correlation of the pixels in the nearby frame. Images require substantial storage and transmission resources, thus image compression is advantageous to reduce these requirements. The report covers some background of wavelet analysis, data compression and how wavelets have been and can be used for image compression and some of the block matching techniques for motion estimation. In this thesis, investigations have been made to understand the actual mechanism of compression of still images and applying the principle to the video frames. Initially image compression is analyzed using wavelet transform and then it is implemented. In later stages motion estimation techniques are analyzed so as to achieve compression by exploiting the temporal redundancy.

40|$|A central {{challenge}} in genetics {{is to understand}} when and why mutations alter the phenotype of an organism. The consequences of gene inhibition have been systematically studied and can be predicted reasonably well across a genome. However, many sequence variants important for disease and evolution may alter gene regulation rather than gene function. The consequences of altering a regulatory interaction (or "edge") rather than a gene (or "node") in a network have not been as extensively studied. Here we use an integrative analysis and evolutionary conservation to identify features that predict when {{the loss of a}} regulatory interaction is detrimental in the extensively mapped transcription network of budding yeast. Properties such as the strength of an interaction, location and context in a promoter, regulator and target gene importance, and the potential for <b>compensation</b> (<b>redundancy)</b> associate to some extent with interaction importance. Combined, however, these features predict quite well whether the loss of a regulatory interaction is detrimental across many promoters and for many different transcription factors. Thus, despite the potential for regulatory diversity, common principles can be used to understand and predict when changes in regulation are most harmful to an organism. status: publishe...|$|R

We show that in the developing mouse cerebellar cortex, members of the Eph receptor gene family are expressed in mediolaterally alternating Purkinje cell segments. Since members of the Eph receptors family {{have been shown to}} play a role in hindbrain segmentation and boundary formation (Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B: Biol. Sci. 355 (2000) 993), we analyzed the effect of a null mutation of the EphA 4 gene on Purkinje cell compartmentation. Using well characterized markers of Purkinje cell compartmentation in both the developing and the adult cerebellum, we observed no significant alteration in the banding pattern of these markers between the EphA 4 knockout mice and their wild type controls. The ribboned pattern of migrating granule cells in the developing cerebellum also appears unaltered. The expression of other members of this gene family, including ephrin-B 2, EphA 2. and ephrin-A 1, in a compartmentalized pattern within the Purkinje cell layer suggests a possible <b>redundancy</b> and/or a <b>compensation</b> of EphA 4 function in the segmental patterning of cerebellar Purkinje cells.

40|$|Impaired balance {{may limit}} {{mobility}} and daily activities, and {{plays a key}} role in the elderly falling. Maintaining balance requires a concerted action of the sensory, nervous and motor systems, whereby cause and effect mutually affect each other within a closed loop. Aforementioned systems and their connecting pathways are prone to chronological age and disease-related deterioration. System <b>redundancy</b> allows for <b>compensation</b> strategies, e. g. sensory reweighting, to maintain standing balance in spite of the deterioration of underlying systems. Once those strategies fail, impaired balance and possible falls may occur. Targeted interventions to prevent falling require knowledge of the quality of the underlying systems and the compensation strategies used. As current clinical balance tests only measure the ability to maintain standing balance and cannot distinguish between cause and effect in a closed loop, there is a clear clinical need for new techniques to assess standing balance. A way to disentangle cause-and-effect relations to identify primary defects and compensation strategies is based on the application of external disturbances and system identification techniques, applicable in clinical practice. This paper outlines the multiple deteriorations of the underlying systems that may be involved in standing balance, which have to be detected early to prevent impaired standing balance. An overview of clinically used balance tests shows that early detection of impaired standing balance and identification of causal mechanisms is difficult with current tests, thereby hindering the development of well-timed and target-oriented interventions as described next. Finally, a new approach to assess standing balance and to detect the underlying deteriorations is proposed. © 2014 IBRO...|$|R
40|$|Palmitoylation is a {{reversible}} {{post-translational modification}} of proteins which involves {{the addition of}} the C 16 saturated fatty acid palmitic acid to sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues, forming a thioester linkage. The addition of palmitate allows proteins to associate with different cellular membranes and membrane subdomains. Palmitoylation is catalysed by the DHHC family of palmitoyl-acyl transferases (PATs), named for their characteristic DHHC motif in a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Reversibility is conferred by palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (PPTs), which cleave the thioester linkage. The study of palmitoylation has recently gathered pace with the development of methods which allow proteome-scale identification of candidate palmitoyl-proteins. Despite the importance of model organisms in several key studies in the field, palmitoylation has barely been studied in the simple eukaryote Caenorhabditis elegans, the nematode worm. This study commenced {{with the use of the}} C. elegans genome data to identify its PATs and PPTs, using the DHHC-CRD and homology respectively. The 15 DHHC PATs were officially named using a dhhc-x system and the two previously known PPTs were confirmed as the only ones with homology to other known PPTs. The current knowledge on palmitoylation enzymes and substrates was collated and analysed to predict possible phenotypes resulting from mutation or knockdown of the enzymes and potential substrates. All available C. elegans strains containing a mutation in an individual PAT or PPT were obtained, covering about half of the PATs and both PPTs, and assayed for various gross phenotypes. In addition a complete library of bacteria able to express double-stranded RNA against PAT or PPT genes was sourced and used to perform similar assays using feeding RNA interference (RNAi). A number of small but significant differences were seen both with mutant and RNAi-treated strains, especially in lifespan assays. To test for possible <b>redundancy</b> and <b>compensation</b> amongst the enzymes, double RNAi was performed against selected closely related PATs and both PPTs. This resulted in the largest phenotype seen: a reduction in lifespan after simultaneous knockdown of both ppt- 1 and ath- 1. As there are no known palmitoyl-proteins in C. elegans, the proteomic approaches acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) and acyl-resin-assisted capture (acyl-RAC) were employed to provide a list of candidates. These were first optimised using rat brain material and the results compared with previous proteomic studies to find that two-thirds of the hits had been previously found. With this validation, both methods were applied to wild-type C. elegans lysates to give 91 hits as putative palmitoyl-proteins. Mutants for the PPT ath- 1 were also profiled by ABE, showing 33 hits which were not present in the wild-type profile. These are potential ATH- 1 substrates whose lack of depalmitoylation in the mutant leads to their enrichment relative to wild-type. However, further repeats of these analyses are required for rigorous statistical testing. Taken together, this study shows the first characterisation of palmitoylation in C. elegans, encompassing all of the DHHC PAT and PPT enzymes, putative palmitoyl-proteins and potential substrates of the PPT enzyme ATH- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} {{at which}} organisms interact {{is affected by}} abiotic conditions. Ocean warming and acidification alter the metabolic demands of organisms and the strength at which they interact with each other. The metabolic costs of changing abiotic conditions vary between interacting pairs of species, and as such, their strength of influence on one another may change with changing climate. Ocean warming and acidification are anticipated to alter competitive dominance among primary producers such as perennial kelp and ephemeral turf algae, increasing the potential for ecosystems to undergo phase shifts, e. g. from kelp-dominated to persistent turf-dominated states. However, {{in order to meet}} greater metabolic demands imposed by elevated temperature, herbivorous invertebrates need to increase feeding rates and may counter turf productivity as a result. Whilst strong top-down control of primary productivity is supported by metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), it assumes that consumption rates of herbivores keep pace with metabolism and mirror increased growth of producers. At moderate warming, both metabolic rates and feeding of herbivorous gastropods were elevated, yet as temperature increased further consumption rates peaked earlier than turf growth rates. Imposed costs to resource allocation where consumption does not meet metabolic demands may result in reduced fitness and survivorship. These results suggest that future strength of top-down control is dependent on whether consumer-producer responses are synchronous, with mismatches between interacting pairs producing outcomes not predicted by metabolic theory. Further, moderate increases of temperature and CO₂ lead to reduced herbivore ingestion efficiency, ultimately resulting in reduced growth. Elevated metabolism generally requires increased foraging to meet energetic demands; however, foraging may also need to be mediated by predator avoidance. This thesis identified that the need for greater foraging activity imposed by future warming and ocean acidification was opposed by elevated predation risk. Avoidance may be heightened in calcifying herbivores such as gastropods as a way to mitigate increased costs of inducible defences like shell building. Nevertheless, reduced foraging rates may compound energetic deficiencies and lead to reduced fitness. Compensatory responses of gastropod and amphipod herbivores that buffered the accelerated effects of ocean warming and acidification on turf productivity may indicate the potential for this kelp-turf system to resist abiotic change. Moreover, this role was filled by more than one species, such that the one species could compensate for the effects of climate {{in the absence of the}} other, but not over compensate when together. Such functional <b>redundancy</b> of trophic <b>compensation</b> was underpinned by individual and population level responses to altered conditions, and offers an account for why some systems may be able to withstand both short- and long-term disturbances. Species interactions are mediated by the abiotic environment, and the strength of interactions may be altered through the influence of abiotic change on physiological demands. This thesis contributes new knowledge to recognising idiosyncratic and predictable responses of interacting species to future conditions and their ensuing consequences for ecological communities. Finally, it expands on the theory of compensatory dynamics by exploring adjustability in strength of buffering responses of consumers to the effects of altered environments on productivity.

40|$|Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is {{the most}} common {{endocrine}} malignancy. Mutually exclusive and activating alterations of the MAPK pathway (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases) are identified in 70 % of cases. Common mutations found in PTCs are point mutation of the B-RAF (50 %) and RAS genes (10 %) as well as RET/PTC chromosomal rearrangements (10 %). The hot spot B-RAFV 600 E mutation {{is the most}} frequently alteration identified and is connected with agressive clinical characteristics (high stage at diagnosis, high recurrence risk and death). These molecular events lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, resulting in MEK (Mitogen-activated Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase) and ERK (Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase) phosphorylation. ERK is negatively regulated by phosphatases and among them, Dual Specificity Phosphatases (DUSPs), ubiquitary expressed, in particular two ERK-specific phosphatases DUSP 5 (nuclear) and DUSP 6 (cytosolic). We hypothesized that these phosphatases could have tumor supressor properties (i. e. their loss would be associated with an increase in MAPK pathway activation) or may serve as a surrogate marker of MAPK pathway activation {{in the context of a}} negative feedback loop. We analysed regulation and expression of both phosphatases in 3 models: three PCCL 3 cell lines (rat thyroid cells) expressing one of the most common oncogene identified in PTCs (RET/PTC 3 or H-RASV 12 or B-RAFV 600 E) under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, human PTC-derived cell lines and human PTC. We demonstrated that MAPK pathway activation was correlated with induction of DUSP 5 and DUSP 6. These phosphatases are involved in a negative feedback loop that contributes to a tight regulation of phospho-ERK levels. DUSP 5 and DUSP 6 mRNA are overexpressed in human PTCs, especially in B-RAF mutated tumors suggesting a higher MAPK signaling output in these agressive PTCs. Silencing of DUSP 5 and/or DUSP 6 by small interfering RNA does not affect proliferation of human B-RAFV 600 E thyroid carcinoma-derived cell lines, suggesting the lack of tumor suppressor gene role. Compensatory changes in expression of DUSPs when a specific one is inactivated may explain this lack of effect. On the opposite, a DUSP 6 pharmacological inhibitor induced a concentration dependent decrease in proliferation of human B-RAFV 600 E cells, suggesting « off-target » effect of this inhibitor. In a second part, we analysed the regulation of DUSP 5 expression, which is a target of the MAPK pathway activation. We demonstrated, using pharmacological inhibitors, that DUSP 5 is an early response gene, regulated mostly by the MAPK pathway, at the transcriptional level. Two contiguous CArG boxes that bind serum response factor (SRF) were found in a 1 Kb promoter region, as well as several E twenty-six transcription factor family binding sites (EBS). These sites potentially bind Elk- 1, a transcription factor activated by ERK 1 / 2. Using wild type or mutated DUSP 5 promoter reporters, we demonstrated that SRF plays a crucial role in serum induction of DUSP 5 promoter activity, the proximal CArG box being important for SRF binding in vitro and in living cells. Moreover Elk- 1 was bound in vitro to a promoter region containing the proximal CArG box and a putative EBS. Its specific binding to SRF was necessary to elicit promoter response to dominant positive Elk-VP 16 and to enhance the response to serum stimulation. Altogether our results suggest that the MAPK pathway is more active in B-RAFV 600 E PTC than in PTC with other genetic alteration and could explain their clinical agressivity. DUSP 5 and DUSP 6, as well as phosphorylated MEK, are markers of activation of the MAPK pathway. Neither phosphatase has tumor suppressor properties in our thyroid cancer cell models. Our results suggest <b>redundancy</b> and functional <b>compensation</b> among DUSPs. ( [...] .) Le cancer papillaire de la thyroïde (CPT) est la tumeur endocrine la plus fréquente. Des anomalies moléculaires activant la voie des MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases) sont identifiées, de façon mutuellement exclusive, dans environ 70 % des cas. Il s’agit de réarrangements chromosomiques, le plus souvent de type RET/PTC (10 %), de mutations ponctuelles activatrices des trois isoformes de l’oncogène RAS (H, N et K-RAS) (10 %), ou de l’oncogène B-RAF (50 %). La mutation « hot spot » B-RAFV 600 E est la plus fréquemment identifiée, elle est associée à une plus grande agressivité clinique (diagnostic à un stade tardif, risque de récidives et de décès accru). Ces évènements moléculaires ont pour conséquence commune l’activation de la voie des MAPK, se traduisant en aval par la phosphorylation de MEK (Mitogen-activated Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase) puis de ERK (Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase). Cette dernière est régulée négativement par des phosphatases, appartenant à la famille des Dual Specificity Phosphatases (DUSPs), d’expression ubiquitaire, et en particulier de deux phosphatases spécifiques de ERK, l’une cytoplasmique (DUSP 6) et l’autre nucléaire (DUSP 5). Nous avons fait l’hypothèse que ces phosphatases pouvaient être soit des gènes suppresseurs de tumeurs (leur perte d’expression conduisant à une augmentation de phosphorylation de ERK et une prolifération accrue), soit des marqueurs du degré d’activation de la voie MAPK dans le cadre d’une boucle de rétrocontrôle négatif.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Biologia do Desenvolvimento), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2015 The pollen tube is a {{remarkable}} cell, playing {{a fundamental role in}} the life cycle of higher plants. Some of its characteristics have made it a preferred choice as a model plant system to study apical cell growth and polarization. Apical cell growth and polarization are entangled in pollen tube, and this {{has been shown to be}} linked to many extracellular fluxes and internal gradients. Over the years, evidence linking each of these ions, either by their extracellular fluxes or by internal gradients to the polarization and apical growth processes have highlighted their importance and how closely related these phenomena are. Disrupting any of these ionic fluxes invariably leads to pollen tube growth arrest, burst or failure to fertilize the ovules. Still, despite the wealth of knowledge acquired, there is still a large gap in identifying all the genes involved in the ion transport in pollen plasma membrane. A number of channels and pumps have been positively identified over the years, including several cation channels and a number of pumps as well. However, all attempts to identify the molecules responsible for the anion transport have been, so far, unsuccessful. Transcriptomic studies have identified several candidate anionic channels genes that are presented in pollen. Some of them, as the case of the CLC-c, that is highly expressed in pollen, were checked but failed to provide any conclusive result, leaving open the question as to which genes mediate the observed anionic fluxes and gradients. Some of the other candidate genes include promising genes, as the SLAC 1 homologues, responsible for the anion fluxes in the guard cell. Another promising candidate is the recently identified TMEM 16 A homologue, a Ca 2 +-activated Cl- channel (CaCC) with only one copy in the Arabidopsis genome. Of particular interest is the electrophysiological profile of this channel, that mimic most of the properties that had been previously observed in plant pollen anion currents by means of patch clamp experiments. The question remains about the molecular nature of the anionic transporters in pollen plasma membrane. To answer this, a T-DNA insertion mutant for this particular gene was genotyped and extensively characterized in this thesis. Previous work done in our lab had identified anionic currents in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Lilium longiflorum pollen protoplasts, and linked them to [Ca 2 +]in regulation. Still, a number of differences from some of the expected values on those currents led to the idea that some other ion could be transported alongside anions under the experimental conditions. The hypothesis is that the observed discrepancies in expected behavior would be caused by pH and H+. To address this and extend our understanding on the nature of the anionic currents, an extensive characterization of the anionic currents was performed. Preliminary results obtained with Lilium longiflorum supported this hypothesis, evidencing a strong regulation by extracellular pH. Focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana pollen to take advantage of the mutant lines available, a strong regulatory effect of extracellular pH was also observed, although with different properties then in Lilium. Under increasing extracellular pH the anionic currents increased dramatically, their conductances changed, the strong outward rectification that characterized them was lost and the current reversal potentials moves toward the expected values for Cl- and H+. These results strongly support the hypothesis that H+ are also being transported along with Cl-, explaining the previously observed discrepancies of the anionic currents, and suggesting the presence of a co-transport system transporting H+ and Cl-. While performing the same experiences in the cacc mutant line {{a remarkable}} difference was observed. In the cacc, there is no response to external pH: currents were not largely affected, conductances had slight changes but rectification was unaffected, and the reversal potential did not follow the changing H+ gradient. These results point out to the fact that the CaCC gene is not only a transporter responsible for anion transport in pollen plasma membrane, but specifically an anion/H+ co-transporter. This result is, to our knowledge, the first positive molecular identification of an anion transporter in the plasma membrane of pollen. Even so, the fact remains, that this mutant line shows no obvious phenotypes in terms of reproduction, and most of the differences found were linked to pH. One notable exception is the impact of this mutation on the rundown of the currents. In the mutant the length of rundown is extended, compared to wild type, despite both having a similar percentual loss in current amplitude. This is an indication that the CaCC is also competing for whatever molecule or process is regulating the rundown of the currents. When the anionic concentration was modified both wild type and mutant line evidenced similar behaviors, suggesting that the overall population of anionic channel still conducted anions in a similar way, even in the absence of the CaCC co-transporter. This is not unexpected, given the tight control these processes are subject to, a certain level of <b>redundancy</b> and <b>compensation</b> to overcome the lack of just one transporter is expected. This is perhaps the main reason why it has been so challenging to identify them in the first place. Still, these experiments further validated the fact that Cl- is not the only ion being transported under our experimental conditions, as evidenced by the reversal potential shifts with changing external [Cl-]. Taken together these results with the reversal shifts when pH was changed, we can propose a stoichiometry of 2 : 1 for the CaCC co-transporter. Furthermore, by substituting the extracellular bath solution [Cl-] for [NO 3 -] another important result emerged. In wild type, there is no difference, confirming what had been published before, that the anionic channels in the plasma membrane of pollen are equally permeable to Cl- and NO 3 -, while in the cacc mutant there is a clear difference between the anionic currents under high [Cl-] or high [NO 3 -]. These results suggest that the CaCC gene should be highly selective for Cl-, and not for NO 3 -. This would make the CaCC a specific Cl-/H+ co-transporter. These results would make the CaCC present in Arabidopsis pollen to function rather differently than its orthologues in animals. This would not be entirely novel, as many other putative anion channels in plants have recently been show to function not as anion channels, but as co-transporters instead. In fact, our knowledge of anion channels structure and function is still evolving, as many discoveries have highlighted that anion channels to be substantially different from the better studied cation channels, possessing unique properties and behaviors. To further compliment these results the internal pH was also changed, to a more acidic pH, similar to what would be found in the tip of the growing pollen tube. These experiments evidenced quite a few interesting results, revealing a complex regulation by internal pH on the anionic channels and a lack of response in the cacc mutant comparable to that of wild type. With the identification and electrophysiological characterization of an anionic transporter in pollen plasma membrane, we tried to find further evidences of the role of this gene in plant development. A competition assay was performed and while the results indicated a potentially seed set phenotype for the cacc mutant when selfed or reciprocally crossed for the antibiotic resistance, the sample size so far analyzed did not show statistically significant differences. Still, the expected role of the CaCC gene in the overall pollen tube development appears to be limited in scope, as its impact may be masked and compensated by other channels or transporters in circumstances to be determined. As a proof of principle approach, we integrated another electrophysiological technique, the vibrating probe, with the power of the patch clamp technique. This approach would allow us in the future to have a more overarching scope on the characterization of potential new channels. For this, a de novo characterization of the probes dynamic efficiency was made, and a novel species was used to test it. Nicotiana tabacum ionic fluxes were characterized and compared to the well studied Lilium longiflorum. They both evidenced the same spatial pattern in terms of each ion flux spatial distribution across the pollen tube plasma membrane, but with altered amplitudes and temporal patterns. Furthermore, using an altered protocol for data acquisition it was possible to determine that the temporal components of the oscillations observed at the tip also have a spatial distribution that could be used to fine tune the precise location or role of specific genes in future approach. Overall, the anionic currents of Arabidopsis thaliana were extensively characterized. This allowed us to characterize the regulatory effect of pH in these currents, to identify one gene, as an anion/H+ co-transporter, and extensively characterize its mutant and its absence of pH response. This was the first time a gene was positively identified as a plasma membrane anion transporter in pollen...|$|R
