40|$|Abstract — A {{new type}} {{residual}} current protector is designed in this paper. Using residual magnetic flux and the resonance voltage as leakage current signal in iron core, {{when there are}} residual current in power suply system, the device can automatically take relevant actions according to the real-time residual current value that is detected by detection circuit. The protector {{can be used to}} against electric shock and protect a ground fault. When the protection is occurred, the <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> (RCD) possesses the inverse time lag function, ideal time delay and the automatic reclosing function. It also transmits the fault information to control center by the inter-integrated circuit (I 2 C) bus. Resonant circuit can avoid live parts injury, which limit the current value through contact resistance, and does not interrupt the work of electrical equipment. So the RCD can be used in all kinds of low voltage single-phase system that will snsure the safety and the reliability of the power supply...|$|E

40|$|The common {{electrical}} equipment as laptops, printers, refrigerators, table lights, televisions, etc., are supplied by electrical power cables, flexible cords and extension cords, generally of low cross section, constituted by stranded bare conductors. Flexible cords and extension cords {{are exposed to}} mechanical damages and other insulation stresses and so can be involved in overheating, arcing and burning. Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can degrade locally the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions and/or electric shock hazard. The circuit <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. A series of simulating tests have confirmed how some fire ignitions of nearby flammable materials result caused from these types of faults. It appears necessary wiring the cords and extension cords with a grounding protection conductor also supplying Class II equipment. In fact involving the ground in every faults allows in AC systems a fast protection by <b>residual</b> <b>current</b> <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (RCDs or GFPDs). At this aim the use of special cables, Ground-Fault-Forced Cables (GFFCs), is recommended, particularly for cords and extension cords...|$|R

For example, the standard rating for overload protected power strips is 2400W in Australia, so exceeding that amount of power will make the circuit breaker trip.

The fuse confines a mercury column in an insulated channel and returns the mercury to the channel after firing. Ratings 5 to 50 A at 600 peak volts are possible with a life of hundreds of cycles. Compared to conventional fuses, much less fault current energy fires the fuse by heating the mercury to boiling temperature. Next an arc discharge develops while explosive forces expel the liquid mercury from the channel.

40|$|Isolation of a faulted segment, {{from either}} side of a fault, in a radial feeder that has several {{converter}} interfaced DGs is a challenging task when <b>current</b> sensing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> are employed. The <b>protective</b> <b>device,</b> even if it senses a downstream fault, may not operate if fault current level is low due to the current limiting operation of converters. In this paper, a new inverse type relay is introduced based on line admittance measurement to protect a distribution network, which has several converter interfaced DGs. The basic operation of this relay, its grading and reach settings are explained. Moreover a method is proposed to compensate the fault resistance such that the relay operation under this condition is reliable. Then designed relay performances are evaluated in a radial distribution network. The results are validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and MATLAB calculations...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report details the background to surge arresters and surge <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> components, viz., spark gaps, gas discharge tubes and metal oxide varistors. <b>Current</b> surge <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> technologies are detailed for several of the larger surge <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers worldwide. Tests were performed using both 8 / 20 μs and 10 / 350 μs current impulses to verify the voltage and current response of gas discharge tubes with or without series MOVs and triggering circuits. Measurements obtained from the test setup were compared against each other, sharing a total impulse current of 35. 8 kA peak using an 8 / 20 μs waveform and 10. 2 kA peak using a 10 / 350 μs current impulse waveform. In the work presented, it is shown that series varistors dampened any voltage and current oscillatory behaviour superimposed from the current impulse generator due to their voltage clamping properties, which similarly do not allow any follow current to flow after a surge has subsided. No effect was seen by using a single varistor or a many parallel mounted varistors in series with a gas discharge tube. By using three electrode gas discharge tubes with a triggering circuit, the clamping voltage was reduced, as the gas tubes reacted faster than an equivalent circuit without a triggering module, which {{has the advantage of}} reducing the protection level for the protected equipment...|$|R

Also when the surges is injected from the load side, a lot of the surge currents is split into the SPD, but a half of test specimens causes nuisance trip. Coordination between SPD and RCD is not valid. When installing SPD, it is important to select SPD after due consideration of the protection voltage level of metal oxide varistor embedded in RCD.

The <b>current</b> circumaural hearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (CAHPD) employed by flight deck crewmen are inadequate for the level of protection required for these extreme levels of noise. Fiber-reinforced thermoset polymer composite (FRPC) materials such as aramid fibers used in body armor, have high theoretical values of acoustic impedance due to a fundamentally high modulus of elasticity and may offer a superior level of hearing protection over original equipment (OE) thermoplastic CAHPDs.

40|$|Distributed {{generator}} (DG) {{connection to}} power systems has attained special attention {{in recent years}} because it provides a number of operational and economic benefits for both utilities and customers. On the downside, the connection of many deregulated power generation units introduces new challenges to utility sectors. One {{of the most critical}} drawbacks of DG installations in power systems can be observed during a fault, when the additional DG fault current violates the original settings of protection systems. <b>Protective</b> <b>devices</b> installed in the system are designed based on the fault current analysis performed for the original system without DGs. When DGs are added, the <b>current</b> seen by <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> will be different from the values originally specified. The change in the level of fault currents may alter the operation time of <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> and disturb the coordination between primary and secondary <b>protective</b> <b>devices.</b> Consequently, serious protection problems may occur in the presence of DGs. On the other hand, many types of DGs that produce a dc voltage or a variable ac voltage require power electronic (PE) interfaces in order to connect to the power system. While these PE interfaces are used to control the active and reactive power injected to the system during normal operation, they are usually left idle during fault condition. The novel idea of this work is to employ the idle PE interface of inverter based distributed generators (IBDG) to manage the fault current flows through the power system. The scheme is based on utilizing the available current and voltage phasor information from smart meters and applying the necessary control actions to operate the IBDGs as fault current management (FCM) units. This FCM operation eases the distribution and protection system constraints on new DGs connections. From short circuit point of view, DGs with larger capacity can be connected to any location in the system without affecting the fault current magnitude. This operation also eliminates the need to disconnect DGs during each temporary fault. Moreover, the need to upgrade <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> is reduced. From the two controllable parameters of IBDGs current, the current magnitude and current phase angle, the current phase angle is employed to manage the contribution of DGs to the total fault current without deactivating them. Three zones of FCM operation are defined for IBDGs by changing their current phase angle: zones A, B, and C. The reference current phase angle that enables the FCM operation is calculated for zone B operation when only IBDGs exist in the system. The FCM operation and the reference current phase angle are then extended for zone C operation in order to manage the contribution of other types of DGs, such as synchronous DGs, to the fault current. In another part of this work, two power flow based fault analysis techniques are developed to explore the behavior of IBDGs during fault conditions. In both, the buses with IBDGs are modeled either as PQ buses or constant current (I) buses, based on their contribution to the fault current. The backward-forward sweep algorithm is used to solve the load flow problem for radial systems during fault conditions. On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson (NR) power flow algorithm is modi ed for fault analysis of loop systems with IBDGs. In the modified NR algorithm, current formulations rather than conventional power formulations are developed for nodes with constant current IBDGs, thus permitting mismatches in the real and imaginary components of the current to be obtained in addition to the conventional active and reactive power mismatches The last part of this work introduces an algorithm for constructing protection zones with FCM capability in loop systems. The algorithm is developed in three steps, and deals with both synchronous DGs and IBDGs in the system. The method used for calculating the reference phase angle that enables the FCM operation is modified for the case of system buses with multiple lines connected to them. Further phasor calculations and illustrations are developed to show how the FCM can be applied for loop systems. Different test systems, including the IEEE 33 -bus system and IEEE 30 -bus system, are used to validate the proposed FCM operation and the models for fault analysis. The simulations are performed with PSCAD software, OpenDSS, and MATLAB. The results show the effectiveness of the novel FCM technique in managing the fault <b>current</b> seen by <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> in power systems, and the capability of the proposed power flow based methods to analyze the behavior of IBDGs during fault conditions. 4 month...|$|R
