25|$|Scientists are {{now turning}} to {{nanotechnology}} {{in an attempt}} to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes. Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine catalyst in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a <b>reduction</b> <b>catalyst</b> is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water. Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts. Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of oxygen <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> for application in H 2 /O 2 fuel cells has attracted considerable recent interest [1].

H 2 /O 2 fuel cells are currently used in buses and various other public transportation vehicles in several cities around the world [2]. Efforts are being made to extend their utility to automobiles.

40|$|This {{project for}} the {{discovery}} of new lean <b>reduction</b> NOx <b>catalysts</b> was initiated on August 16 th, 2002 and is now into its fourth year. Several materials have already been identified as NOx <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> for possible future application. NOx <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> are a critical need in the North American vehicle market since these catalysts are needed to enable both diesels and lean gasoline engines to meet the 2007 - 2010 emission standards. Hydrocarbon selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a preferred technology since it requires no infrastructure changes (as may be expected for urea SCR) and most likely has the simplest engine control strategy of the three proposed NOx reduction approaches. The use of fast throughput techniques and informatics greatly enhances the possibility of discovering new NOx <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts.</b> Using fast throughput techniques this project has already screened over 3000 new materials and evaluates hundreds of new materials a month. Evaluating such {{a high number of}} new materials puts this approach into a very different paradigm than previous discovery approaches for new NOx <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts.</b> With so much data on materials it is necessary to use statistical techniques to identify the potential catalysts and these statistical techniques are needed to optimize compositions of the multi-component materials that are identified under the program as possible new lean NOx catalysts. Several new materials have conversions in excess of 80 % at temperatures above 300 C. That is more than twice the activity of previous HC SCR materials. These materials are candidates for emission control on heavy-duty systems (i. e.; over 8500 pounds gross weight). Tests of one of the downselected materials on an engine dynamometer show NOx reductions greater than 80 % under some conditions even though the net NOx reductions on the HWFET and the US 06 cycles were relatively low. The program is scheduled to continue {{until the end of the}} 2006 calendar year. Work in the final year will focus on continued discovery and identity of candidate materials, and also on refining the engine operating strategies to increase NOx reduction over a full engine cycle...|$|R

50|$|Most newer {{vehicles}} have electronic {{fuel injection}} systems, and do not require air injection systems in their exhausts. Instead, they provide a precisely controlled air-fuel mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich combustion. Oxygen sensors are used to monitor the exhaust oxygen content {{before and after the}} catalytic converter, and this information is used by the Electronic Control Unit to adjust the fuel injection so as to prevent the first (NOx <b>reduction)</b> <b>catalyst</b> from becoming oxygen-loaded, while simultaneously ensuring the second (HC and CO oxidation) catalyst is sufficiently oxygen-saturated.|$|E
50|$|A major {{research}} activity in his Department is {{the reduction of}} NOx emissions in the oxidizing exhaust emissions of diesel engines. This reduction may be conducted by use of selective Catalytic <b>reduction</b> <b>catalyst</b> (SCR) which required feed of ammonia precursor or by use of Lean NOx Trap (LNT) which contains expensive precious metals. Another option is the use a reactor with LNT catalyst followed by one with SCR to avoid the need to inject ammonia precursors.

The <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> include mixtures of zinc dust and acetic acid, of lithium aluminium hydride with titanium trichloride (the reducing agent is actually titanium dichloride, formed by the reaction between LiAlH4 and TiCl3) and of iron(III) chloride with butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the preparation procedure {{on the performance of}} NOx storage and <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> was investigated by means of flow reactor experiments. Three catalysts were examined; one Pt/Al and two Pt/Ba/Al samples. One of the Pt/Ba/Al samples was prepared with Pt impregnated on Al/Ba and one with Ba impregnated on Al/Pt. The results clearly show that the preparation procedure influences the behavior of NOx storage and <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> both during lean and rich conditions. The order of the impregnation steps is crucial especially at higher temperatures; a higher storage capacity is obtained when impregnating Al/Pt with Ba than when impregnating Al/Ba with Pt. The storage increased with as much as 54 % when adding Ba in the last step. The N 2 O and NH 3 formation is also affected by the preparation procedure; there is a clear dependency on the order of impregnation steps. Moreover, N 2 O is not only formed during rich conditions but also {{in the beginning of the}} lean period over the Pt/Al and Al/Pt/Ba samples...|$|R

Cerium, iron, manganese and nickel are also used, although each has limitations.

5000|$|The {{catalyst}} {{enables the}} pyrolysis of carbon and subsequent growth of VANTA. Catalysts are typically metals that have high carbon solubility at high temperatures and that exhibit a high carbon diffusion rate, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Other transition metals such as copper (Cu), gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), and palladium (Pd) are also reported to catalyze CNT growth from various hydrocarbons but have lower carbon solubility and consequently lower growth rates. Solid organometallocenes such as ferrocene, cobaltocene, nickelocene are also common catalysts. It is {{found that the}} temperature and time of the thermal and <b>reduction</b> <b>catalyst</b> pre-treatment steps are crucial variables for optimized nanoparticle distribution with different average diameters, depending on the initial film thickness. [...] For CNT growth by CVD, a sputtered thin film of catalyst (e.g. 1 nm of Fe) is applied. During heating, the film de-wets, creating islands of iron that then nucleate nanotubes. As the iron is mobile, islands can merge if left too long {{at the growth temperature}} before initiating nanotube growth. Annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density #/mm2 and increases the diameter of the nanotubes. As the nanotubes grow from the catalyst islands, the crowding effects and van der Waals forces between other CNTs leave them no choice to grow in any direction but vertically to the substrate.|$|E

40|$|Herein, we {{show that}} group 11 CO[subscript 2] <b>reduction</b> <b>catalysts</b> are rapidly {{poisoned}} by progressive deposition of trace metal ion impurities present in high purity electrolytes. Metal impurity deposition was characterized by XPS and in situ stripping voltammetry and is coincident with loss of catalytic activity and selectivity for CO[subscript 2] reduction, favoring hydrogen evolution on poisoned surfaces. Metal deposition can be suppressed by complexing trace metal ion impurities with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or solid-supported iminodiacetate resins. Metal ion complexation allows for reproducible, sustained catalytic activity and selectivity for CO[subscript 2] reduction on Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes.
