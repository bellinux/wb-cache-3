5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> its center.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes the flash of a cannon <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E

50|$|A pulse will <b>reflect</b> <b>off</b> a {{fixed end}} and return with the {{opposite}} direction of displacement. In this case, the pulse is said to have inverted. That is, a pulse with an upward displacement will <b>reflect</b> <b>off</b> the end and return with a downward displacement.|$|R

25|$|Noise is {{generally}} most intense when a rocket {{is close to}} the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the ground. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.|$|E
25|$|For decades, NASA and NOAA {{satellites}} have {{continuously monitored}} vegetation from space.

25|$|During operation, {{light from}} a laser source travels through an optical fiber to {{illuminate}} {{the surface of a}} reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|E

25|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors {{have grown}} {{to be the most}} popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing situations for both the front of house and monitor engineers. Audio feedback is greatly reduced and there is less sound <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the back wall of the stage out into the audience, which affects the clarity of the mix the front of house engineer is attempting to create.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit {{windshield}} of {{the first}} 247s was angled forward, instead of the conventional aft sweep. This was the design solution (similar to that adopted by other contemporary aircraft that used a forward-raked windscreen) {{to the problem of}} lighted control panel instruments <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the windshield at night, but {{it turned out that the}} forward-sloping windshield would reflect ground lights instead, especially during landings and it also increased drag slightly. By the introduction of the 247D, the windshield was sloped aft in the usual way, and the night-glare problem was resolved by installing an extension (the glarescreen) over the control panel.|$|E
25|$|Low-level {{development}} {{began in}} 1939 but was greatly sped after {{the introduction of}} the cavity magnetron in early 1940. This operated at 9.1cm wavelength (3GHz), much shorter than the 1.5m wavelength of the earlier AI Mk. IV. Shorter wavelengths allowed it to use smaller and much more directional antennas. This provided the important advantage of allowing the radar to avoid ground reflections simply by pointing the antenna upward. The Mk. IV's semi-directional antennas were blinded by noise from the signal <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the ground while flying at low altitude, while the Mk. VIII could see anything above the fighter's altitude.|$|E

40|$|Light beams <b>{{reflected}}</b> <b>off</b> {{a mirror}} surface produce reflected light beams, {{as shown in}} Figure 1. This is called specular reflection.

In 1950, while walking alone along the Coney Island shore, Bettie met NYPD Officer Jerry Tibbs, who was an avid photographer, and he gave Bettie his card. He suggested she'd make a good pin-up model, and in exchange for allowing him to photograph her, he'd help make up her first pin-up portfolio, free of charge.

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} disaster was identified as the Turbo train passing signal SN109 (located on an overhead gantry—gantry 8—with four other signals serving other tracks) at which {{it should have been}} held. It was established that the signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the Thames Turbo driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, {{it was not possible to}} establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective, whilst the signalling in the Paddington area was known to have caused problems – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> yellow aspects. Poor signal placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect. Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol HST drivers were re-routed as not to pass this signal.|$|E

The 5th Division was closely followed by the 2nd and 16th Divisions. The 2nd Division, coming from Johnson's Jolly, advanced diagonally across the 4th Battalion's front, and the 4th Battalion engaged them in their flank with rifle and machine-gun fire.

500|$|Titan {{is likely}} {{differentiated}} into several layers with a [...] rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice. Its interior {{may still be}} hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a [...] "magma" [...] composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high-pressure forms of ice. The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as [...] (for eutectic mixture with water). [...] The Cassini probe discovered the evidence for the layered structure {{in the form of}} natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan's atmosphere. Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely-low-frequency radio waves, so they may instead be <b>reflecting</b> <b>off</b> the liquid–ice boundary of a subsurface ocean. Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to [...] between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer. [...] Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn. Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid.|$|E
