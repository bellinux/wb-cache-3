5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with <b>rural</b> <b>health</b> centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the past}} three years, the Government of China {{initiated}} <b>health</b> reform with <b>rural</b> public <b>health</b> system construction to achieve equal access to public <b>health</b> services for <b>rural</b> residents. The study assessed trends of public health services accessibility in rural China from 2008 to 2010, {{as well as the}} current situation about the China’s <b>rural</b> public <b>health</b> system performance. Methods: The data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2011, which used a multistage stratified random sampling method to select 12 counties and 118 villages from China. Three sets of indicators were chosen to measure the trends in access to coverage, equality and effectiveness of <b>rural</b> public <b>health</b> services. Data were disaggregated by provinces and by participants: hypertension patients, children, elderly and women. We examined the changes in equality across and within region. Results: China’s <b>rural</b> public <b>health</b> system did well in safe drinking water, children vaccinations and women hospital delivery. But more hypertension patients with low income could not receive regular healthcare from primary health institutions than those with middle and high income. In 2010, hypertension treatment rate of Qinghai in Western China was just 53. 22 % which was much lower than that of Zhejiang in Eastern China (97. 27 %). Meanwhile, low performance was showed in effectiveness of <b>rural</b> public <b>health</b> services. The rate of effective treatment for controlling their blood pressur...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Rural</b> {{and remote}} <b>health</b> {{research}} has highlighted the many problems {{experienced in the}} bush. While attention to problems has raised awareness {{of the needs of}} <b>rural</b> and remote <b>health,</b> embedding a deficit perspective in research has stereotyped <b>rural</b> and remote <b>health</b> as poor environments to work in and as inherently problematic. The objectives of this paper are to challenge this thinking and suggest that a more balanced approach, acknowledging strengths, is beneficial. DESIGN: This discussion identifies why the deficit approach is problematic, proposes a strengths-based approach and identifies some key strengths of <b>rural</b> and remote <b>health.</b> RESULTS: This study suggests alternative ways of thinking about rural and remote practice, including the rewards of rural and remote practice, that rural and remote communities can act as change agents, that these disciplines actively address the social determinants of <b>health,</b> that <b>rural</b> and remote areas have many innovative primary health care services and activities and that rural and remote contexts provide opportunities for evaluation and research. It is proposed that <b>rural</b> and remote <b>health</b> can be viewed as problem-solving, thus dynamic and improving rather than as inherently problematic. CONCLUSION: Critical of a deficit approach to <b>rural</b> and remote <b>health,</b> this paper provides alternatives ways of thinking about these disciplines and recommends a problem-solving perspective of <b>rural</b> and remote <b>health...</b>|$|R
