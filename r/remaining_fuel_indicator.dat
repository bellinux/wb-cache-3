50|$|On 6 August 2005, Tuninter Flight 1153, a Tuninter ATR-72 {{en route}} from Bari to Djerba, Tunisia, ditched into the Mediterranean Sea about 18 miles {{from the city of}} Palermo. 16 of the 39 people on board died. The {{accident}} resulted from engine fuel starvation that resulted from the installation of the wrong <b>fuel</b> quantity <b>indicator.</b> The <b>fuel</b> quantity <b>indicator</b> installed had been calibrated for the smaller ATR-42 aircraft and showed significantly more fuel than was actually in the tank of the larger ATR 72. When the aircraft ran out of <b>fuel,</b> the <b>indicator</b> still showed 1800 kilograms of <b>fuel</b> <b>remaining</b> thus confusing the crew for several minutes. Both engines stopped and the crew was forced to ditch the airliner in the sea.|$|R

It collects half of the <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> at each dump on the way out, which fills its tank. After leaving the farthest fuel dump it travels 1/2 a unit further into the desert and then returns to the farthest fuel dump.

5000|$|... 1981 was {{the first}} year {{electronic}} [...] "digital" [...] instrumentation was an available option. In addition to the digital electronic climate control that was standard on all Eldorados, the standard analog speedometer and fuel gauges could be replaced with digital displays with features displaying gallons of <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> and approximate range.|$|R
2500|$|On 28 March, revised {{estimates}} of the radar track and the aircraft's <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> led to a move of the search [...] north-east of the previous area, to a new search area of 319,000 square kilometres (123,000 sq mi), roughly [...] west of Perth. This search area had more hospitable weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the {{government}} sold off Tank Island and other anchorages in Key West in an auction to developer Pritam Singh from New England. In 1988, the tanks were dismantled while the <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> lines served as conduits for water, sewage, and utilities. Power cables were later laid alongside the existing fuel pipes.|$|R
50|$|On 28 March, revised {{estimates}} of the radar track and the aircraft's <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> led to a move of the search 1100 km north-east of the previous area, to a new search area of 319,000 square kilometres (123,000 sq mi), roughly 1850 km west of Perth. This search area had more hospitable weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|The reactor {{fuel rods}} are {{occasionally}} replaced by removing {{them from the}} top of the containment vessel. A typical fuel cycle lasts 18-24 months, with about one third of fuel assemblies being replaced during a refueling outage. The <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> assemblies are shuffled to new core locations to maximize the efficiency and power produced in the next fuel cycle.|$|R
50|$|They powered {{down the}} spacecraft's {{maneuvering}} system, intending to drift {{for the next}} two-and-a-half days to conserve the <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel.</b> They also intended to sleep alternate four-hour periods, but {{this turned out to}} be extremely difficult with the constant radio communications and the small cabin, about the size of the front seats of a compact car.|$|R
50|$|They {{photograph}} {{the lunar surface}} as they begin {{to land on the}} Moon, but more fuel is wasted when they try to avoid a large, deep canyon on their final landing approach. The spaceship lands out of direct line-of-sight of the Earth, so they are unable to report back via radio. The estimates of their <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> supply indicates they lack enough fuel to return home safely. Admiral Bowles takes the view their safe return is irrelevant. All that matters now is that they claim the Moon {{in the name of the}} United States of America and make radio contact with Earth to report this fact. He suggests using their <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> to make a brief flight into direct sight of Earth to report their claim, sacrificing themselves in the process for the greater good. The other crew members, however, prefer to try to return home, if at all possible.|$|R
50|$|Chehalis was {{carrying}} a cargo of ammunition and petroleum when it sank. After evidence of significant leakage of fuel from the wrecked ship, environmental risk assessments indicated that the <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> aboard needed to be removed. The fuel was removed by April 2010, but no steps were taken to remove the ammunition aboard the wreck as it was {{not considered to be}} necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Commander Christopher [...] "Kit" [...] Draper, USN (Paul Mantee) and Colonel Dan McReady, USAF (Adam West) {{reach the}} Red Planet in their spaceship, Mars Gravity Probe 1.

5000|$|On October 10, 1991, the 180 m high dry cooling tower, {{which at}} one time was the highest cooling tower in the world, was explosively {{dismantled}} and from October 22, 1993 to April 1995 the <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> was unloaded and transported to the intermediate storage in Ahaus. The remaining facility was [...] "safely enclosed". Dismantling {{is not expected to}} start before 2027.|$|R

50|$|Landsat 5 was an {{identical}} clone of L4, {{it was a}} backup satellite, but it went on to outlive Landsat 4, and was operated for nearly 30 years of active operation in space. In {{the end it was}} intentionally terminated by using its <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> to lower its orbit and its transmitter turned off. It was survived by the still-functioning Landsat 7 and recently launched Landsat 8.|$|R
50|$|Spock {{suddenly}} gets an {{idea and}} decides to dump and ignite all the <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> from the shuttle's engines, although this will shorten the time the shuttle can survive. The giant flare he produces is easily spotted by the sensors of the Enterprise. Kirk turns the ship around once again, and transports the survivors out just moments before the shuttle is destroyed on re-entry.|$|R

5000|$|The RSV Tuono {{uses the}} Austrian built BRP-Rotax V990 60° V-Twin engine {{which can also}} be found in {{numerous}} other Aprilia models. It sports dual overhead cams, double balance shafts, 4 valves per cylinder, electronic fuel injection, twin spark ignition and the same two-into-one exhaust as used on the RSV Mille. In the RSV Tuono, the V990 delivers [...] @ 9500 rpm and [...] @ 7250 rpm. Its fuel tank will hold 18 L (4.8 gal) and has a maximum range of 280 km (175 mi) on the highway before the low <b>fuel</b> <b>indicator</b> turns on. <b>Fuel</b> consumption increases significantly with aggressive throttle use.|$|R
2500|$|Capitan Heinz Saalfeld {{began his}} final descent, but {{commenced}} a go-around maneuver at an approximate height of [...] above the ground. A few moments later, at 6:51 pm, the 21.5-ton aircraft spun {{to the left}} and crashed into a field [...] beyond the end of the runway. The <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel</b> (approximately [...] ) ignited, causing a ground fire that was extinguished by the airport's Fire and Rescue only after 40 minutes.|$|R
50|$|On March 24, 2011, Stardust {{conducted}} a burn to consume its <b>remaining</b> <b>fuel.</b> The spacecraft had little fuel left and scientists hoped {{the data collected}} would help {{in the development of}} a more accurate system for estimating fuel levels on spacecraft. After the data had been collected, no further antenna aiming was possible and the transmitter was switched off. The spacecraft sent an acknowledgement from approximately 312000000 km away in space.|$|R
