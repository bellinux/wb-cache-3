30|$|The {{presence}} of an E-Verify law last year or this year {{does not affect the}} number of in-migrants from other states, as panel B <b>reports.</b> <b>Panel</b> C reproduces the results for new immigrants as those are the number of in-migrants from abroad. The {{presence of}} an E-Verify law this year reduces the number of in-migrants from abroad. The number of non-recent likely unauthorized immigrants who left a state is lower if a state had an E-Verify law last year; this result is the opposite of the expected effect if E-Verify laws cause unauthorized immigrants to leave. However, a relatively low share of non-recent immigrants is unauthorized compared with the two other time-since-migration groups we examine here. More of the non-recent group is presumably made up of documented immigrants, who may benefit from E-Verify laws that reduce competition in the labor market.|$|E
40|$|International {{economic}} sanctions are a recurring feature of political interactions. This paper provides, through a gravity model approach, an {{estimation of the}} impact of sanctions on international trade. The study <b>reports</b> <b>panel</b> estimates between the US and 49 target countries over the period 1960 - 2000, inclusive. The results show that extensive sanctions have a large negative impact on bilateral trade, while {{this is not the case}} for limited and moderate sanctions. A second estimation focuses on the impact of unilateral US sanctions on bilateral trade between target countries and the other G- 7 countries. The results show that unilateral extensive sanctions have also a large negative impact, while limited ones induce a slight positive effect on other G- 7 countries trade. In the first case the hypothesis of negative ¿network effects¿ is confirmed, while in the latter the sanctions-busting argument should be defended...|$|E
40|$|This paper <b>reports</b> <b>panel</b> gravity {{estimates}} of aggregate bilateral trade for 130 countries {{over the period}} 1962 - 96 in which the coe±cient of distance is allowed to change over time. In a standard speci¯cation in which transport costs are proxied by distance only, it is found para-doxically that the absolute value of the elasticity of bilateral trade to distance has been signi¯cantly increasing. The result is attributed to a relatively larger decline in costs independent of distance (such as handling) than in distance-related costs (e. g. oil price). An extended version of the model that controls for these two factors eliminates this positive trend without reversing it. However, when the sample is split into two groups (`rich-rich ' and `poor-poor'), the paradox is maintained for the `poor-poor ' group. While not conclusive, these re-sults {{are consistent with the}} view that poor countries may have been marginalized by the current wave of globalization...|$|E

40|$|International {{economic}} sanctions {{appear to be}} a common and recurring feature of political interactions between states. In particular, the United States is the country which has most frequently applied negative {{economic sanctions}} after World War II. In a parallel way, several measures, imposed by a multilateral organisation like the United Nations have taken place in recent years. This paper provides, through a gravity model approach, an estimation of the impact of economic negative sanctions on international trade. First, the study <b>reports</b> <b>panel</b> gravity estimates of bilateral trade between the U. S. and 49 target countries over the period 1960 - 2000, inclusive. The results show that extensive and comprehensive sanctions have a large negative impact on bilateral trade, while {{this is not the case}} for limited and moderate sanctions. A second estimation focuses on the impact of unilateral U. S. sanctions on bilateral trade volume between target countries and the other G- 7 countries over the same period. The results show that unilateral extensive sanctions have a large negative impact, while limited and moderate ones induce a slight positive effect on other G- 7 countries bilateral trade. Thus, in the first case the hypothesis of negative ‘network effects’ is confirmed, while in the latter the sanctions- busting argument should be defended. In both estimations, however, multilateral sanctions demonstrate a large negative impact on trade flows. International negative sanctions, international trade, gravity model...|$|E
40|$|Executive pay {{and company}} {{performance}} has received much attention and debate after the recent credit crisis. Policy makers {{and the public}} have since demanded for the executive pay to be regulated and to be more tightly aligned to the company performance. Scholars and economists however, {{have argued that the}} existing pay structure is not the cause of the recent credit crisis and thus need not to be over regulated. This paper thus aims to provide deeper understanding on the link between pay and performance by investigating the relation between pay and performance across five different countries, namely Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines in the region of South East Asia. This paper also aims to identify a set of corporate governance and public governance mechanisms which are associated with higher pay level in the region. The scope of this paper is set to focus only in the region of South East Asia as it is found that the region is lagging behind with only a few empirical researches that review on the pay and performance relation in the region as compared to other regions in the world. Data was collected from public listed companies in the five countries using Thomson Reuters Datastream and individual annual <b>reports.</b> <b>Panel</b> data analysis was used to analyze the collected data. The results indicate that the pay and performance link in the region is either insignificant or weak. Firm size is the only variable found to be significantly related to the pay level in all of the countries observed. Other variables such as transparency level and board ratio (the ratio of independent directors over the total number of directors) are found to be significantly related to pay level only in certain countries while board size and external auditors are found to have insignificant relation to pay level in either of the country. Public governance indexes such as the integrity index released through Global Integrity Report and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) released by Transparency International were used to further explain the pay and performance relation in the region...|$|E

50|$|In September 1984, the Rock Albums chart was {{discontinued}} and Top Tracks {{was renamed}} Top Rock Tracks. It reduced from a 60-song tally to 50 songs on October 20, 1984, following a major revamp to the magazine. Coinciding {{with an increase}} in its <b>reporting</b> <b>panel</b> of album rock stations, the name of the chart was changed again with the issue dated April 12, 1986, to Album Rock Tracks. In November 1991, instead of <b>reporting</b> <b>panels,</b> Billboard changed its methodology of measuring airplay by using monitored airplay as provided by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems to compile many of its charts. As a result, this data showed that many songs could spend months to over a year on the Album Rock Tracks chart. Billboard decided to drop to a 40-position chart (still its current format), and songs that fell out of the top 20 and after spending 20 weeks on the chart were moved to a new 10-position recurrent chart. The recurrent chart was scrapped two years later, but not the methodology.|$|R
50|$|On January 6, 2003, {{just ten}} years after its debut, Billboard renamed the {{publication}} Billboard Radio Monitor. The change was to reflect to growing landscape of the radio industry as it began to incorporate more articles involving programmers, markets, formats and artists into the magazine. They also expanded the number of format airplay panels as well and in 2004 became the first music trade to include satellite and audio networks in its <b>reporting</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} in 2012, the station saw its fortunes starting to slide {{and began to}} move further away from Adult Top 40 to a more Mainstream CHR/Top 40 approach, putting it in direct competition with Z100.

To capitalize on this, the station shortened its slogan to [...] "Today's Modern Mix", and then eventually [...] "Portland's #1 Hit Music Station." ...|$|R
50|$|With the {{purchase}} of R&R it was announced on July 12, 2006 that their operations were integrated into R&R after the transition was completed, since both BRM and R&Rs charts and radio <b>reporting</b> <b>panels</b> were identical to each other, thus resulting in Billboard Radio Monitor ceasing publication with its July 14 issue. However they continued issuing weekly charts and report on radio industry news online during the turnover, as R&R started integrating their articles and columns into the Billboard Information Group.|$|R

By September 2009, the channel was removed from Mediabase's <b>reporting</b> <b>panel,</b> and aired music mostly sourced from Sirius XM Hits 1; however, the channel's programming was still different from Sirius XM Hits 1.|$|R
5000|$|... "Adorn" [...] by Miguel is {{the only}} song {{to spend at least}} 20 weeks atop the chart.
