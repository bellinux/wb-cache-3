50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>marks</b> {{are made}} by an object that was forced to roll down {{the bottom of a}} stream. The marks made in this case are continuous, long, {{generally}} linear, and run parallel to the paleoflow. The width dimensions of <b>roll</b> <b>marks</b> vary based upon the size of the object. <b>Roll</b> <b>marks</b> are a sign of water that has enough energy to cause motion but not enough turbidity and energy to separate the object from the bottom of a muddy bed.|$|E

50|$|Tool marks are {{a type of}} sole marking {{formed by}} grooves left in a bed by things like sticks being dragged along by a current. The average {{direction}} of these can be assumed to be the flow direction, though it is bimodal, {{so it could be}} either way along the mark. Tool marks also have a more specific breakdown. There are grooves and striations, skip or prod marks, and <b>roll</b> <b>marks.</b> Groove or striation marks result from the continuous contact with the muddy bed. Skip or prod marks come from objects that bounce along the surface of the muddy bed. And <b>roll</b> <b>marks</b> result from objects rolling along the muddy bed.|$|E

All classrooms on the QAHS campus have data projectors as well as whiteboards, allowing teachers to conduct their classes more efficiently, and engage their students in different ways compared to traditional schools. Many classrooms also have access to videoconferencing equipment so that students can interact with industry professionals and other high-profile figures from around the world. The school features smart-card access to most exterior main doors as well as the interior doors inside the science laboratories for higher security. The smart-cards also offer electronic <b>roll</b> <b>marking</b> at any smart-card terminal, replacing traditional teacher <b>roll</b> <b>marking.</b> The entire campus also features wireless Internet access and audio loops.|$|R
40|$|A novel method {{based on}} {{three-dimensional}} profilometry data and Matlab analysis software is described to identify surface features on cold-rolled stainless steel strip. The {{aim of the}} method is to detect automatically pits and <b>roll</b> <b>marks</b> that {{can be observed in}} optical or SEM micrographs. Pits are identified by locating regions which are significantly deeper than the immediately adjacent surface. Deep or steep features which extend a significant distance in the direction of rolling are identified as <b>roll</b> <b>marks.</b> Results for typical cold-rolled stainless steel sheet show that the algorithms are effective in identifying the more obvious pits and <b>roll</b> <b>marks.</b> By suitable adjustment of the tolerances used in the analysis, the method can be tailored to detect less severe features. Application of the method, either for research purposes or routine industrial inspection, will require tuning of these tolerances to detect pits of the severity relevant to the end use of the strip. The methodology has been applied to a series of rolled strip samples to track the evolution of pits and <b>roll</b> <b>marks</b> during a schedule. Results show how the initially large area of deep pits is rapidly eliminated and transformed into shallow pits. The pit identification method is used to estimate the effect of trapped oil on lubrication. Results suggest that this expelled oil will contribute significantly to the lubrication of the surrounding area. Finally, a good correlation is demonstrated between strip surface reflectance measurements and the estimated pi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The C, Mn and Si impart high {{strength}} to steels through solid solution strengthening. On hardening and tempering, these elements further increase the strength substantially by exploiting hardenability potentials. With {{this point in}} view, a microalloyed C-Mn-Si steel was designed to have elements {{in the range of}} C: 0. 24 - 0. 28, Mn: 1. 30 - 1. 50, Si: 1. 30 - 1. 50, Cr. 0. 10 - 0. 20, Ni: 0. 20 - 0. 40, Mo: 0. 15 - 0. 25, P: 0. 015 max, S: 0. 010 max and H: 2 ppm max. Aiming at this range of chemistry, steel was made in an electric arc furnace, refined in VAD and continuous cast to 170 mm x 1160 mm slabs. Prior to hot rolling of the slabs, hot deformation and dilatation studies were carried out in a Gleeble- 3500 C system for simulating hot rolling and heat treatment schedules. Employing the designed parameters, the slabs were hot rolled to 5 mm x 1135 mm x 4600 mm plates, which were subsequently hardened and tempered to obtain hardness levels> 460 BHN, YS> 1300 MPa, UTS> 1500 MPa, elongation> 8 % and reduction in area> 25 % in the material. The plates contained> 95 % martensite in the microstructure and observed to have adequately smooth surfaces free from defects such as holes, <b>roll</b> <b>marks,</b> scabs and rolled-in scale, etc...|$|E
40|$|DE 102009057765 A 1 UPAB: 20110705 NOVELTY - The device has a {{base body}} (2), and {{electrically}} conducting pins (1 a- 1 c) that extend from a front side (3) {{of the base}} body to a rear side (4) of the base body, where the device is arranged in a deformation tool between a shaping area of the tool and an outer side of the tool. The base body is electrically insulated by an insulation layer and made from ceramic or plastic, where the insulation layer is designed as a microscopically thin insulation layer. The insulation layer is formed by a foil and/or casing, where the pins {{are attached to the}} base body in a fixed manner. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for manufacturing a signal guiding device (2) a method for deforming a component. USE - Signal guiding device for manufacturing electrical contact with a sensor in a deformation tool (all claimed). Uses include {{but are not limited to}} a free mold, forging die, roller and punching tool. ADVANTAGE - The electrically conducting pins extend from the front side of the base body to the rear side of the base body, where the device is arranged in the deformation tool between the shaping area of the tool and the outer side of the tool, thus producing electrical contact between the pin and the sensor even from outer side, without producing <b>roll</b> <b>marks</b> in a component to be deformed...|$|E

5000|$|The Px4 is {{available}} in [...]45 ACP designated as the Px4 Storm SD (Special Duty). Notable differences between the standard [...]45 ACP and the Special Duty are the desert tan frame color, PVD coated magazines and internal firing control assembly, double recoil spring, specially <b>roll</b> <b>marked</b> slide and a longer barrel to facilitate {{the use of a}} suppressor. The PVD coated magazines (one 9- and two 10-round magazines come with the package) are not scheduled to be imported and there will only be one production run of the Px4SD. Supplies are limited. Initial photos show the barrel with a silver proprietary coating but the production models have a black finished barrel. Also, pistol tags indicate that superluminova sight paint is standard but Beretta USA discontinued use of the paint in 2009 so the Px4SD will have standard white 3-dot sights.
