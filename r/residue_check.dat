40|$|Side-channel {{attacks are}} {{nowadays}} a serious concern when implementing cryptographic algorithms. Powerful ways for gaining {{information about the}} secret key as well as various counter-measures against such attacks have been recently developed. Although {{it is well known}} that such attacks can exploit information leaked from different sources, most prior works have only addressed the problem of protecting a cryptographic device against a single type of attack. Consequently, there is very little knowledge on how a scheme for protecting a device against one type of side-channel attack may affect its vulnerability to other types of side-channel attacks. In this paper we focus on devices that include protection against fault injection attacks (using different error detection schemes) and explore whether the presence of such fault detection circuits affects the resistance against attacks based on power analysis. Using the AES S-Box as an example, we performed attacks on the unprotected implementation as well as modified implementations with parity check circuits or <b>residue</b> <b>check</b> circuits (mod 3 and mod 7). In particular, we focus on the question whether the knowledge of the presence of error detection circuitry in the cryptographic device can help an attacker who attempts to mount a power attack on the device. Our results show that the presence of error detection circuitry helps the attacker even if he is unaware of this circuitry, and that the benefit to the attacker increases with the number of check bits used for the purpose of error detection...|$|E

40|$|Crop residue {{management}} through {{conservation tillage}} {{is one of}} the best and most efficient methods farmers have to control soil erosion. Each year about 140 million tons of topsoil are eroded from Nebraska farmlands. Recent research shows that farmers can greatly reduce this loss by maintaining a residue cover of at least 20 to 30 percent after all tillage and planting operations. Leaving this amount of residue can reduce water caused erosion by 50 percent of what it would be from a cleanly tilled field, while leaving more residue will reduce soil losses even further. Conservation tillage and residue management can save soil, labor, fuel, and money- all of which are important to both individual producers and the farm economy. Conservation tillage is best defined by the amount of residue cover remaining after planting, rather than by the tillage implement or operations used. For example, two disking operations in dryland corn residue will usually leave about a 20 percent residue cover and could be classified as a conservation tillage system. However, just one disking in soybean residue cannot be classified as conservation tillage because too much of the fragile residue is destroyed. In addition to being the least expensive method of erosion control, conservation tillage is also the most efficient means because evenly distributed residue limits soil loss over the entire field. Rainfall, while essential for crop growth, dislodges soil particles upon impact and allows them to be washed away. Uniformly distributed crop residue shields the soil surface from raindrop impact, reducing soil particle detachment and eventual erosion. Residue also creates small dams which slow the rate of runoff, allowing more time for water to infiltrate into the soil. The slower runoff rate and reduced volume of runoff mean less soil will be removed from the field. Residue also helps trap snow to retain more moisture after spring thaws. All of these can help reduce irrigation requirements or 2 ̆ 2 save 2 ̆ 2 a dryland crop in a year having lower rainfall amounts. Residue can also protect the soil from the erosive forces of wind. However, standing residue may be more effective than flattened residue in reducing wind erosion. Thus, mass of residue in addition to percent cover may be needed to evaluate wind erosion control potential. Estimating Residue Cover Residue cover estimates can be useful in planning field operations to maintain erosion control. Measurements of residue cover may also be required to determine whether adequate residue remains to qualify for federal, state, or local conservation programs. Three methods can be used to estimate the percent of residue cover. Two of these are easily accomplished with field observations. The third is less accurate and requires generalizations and calculations that are helpful, but provide only approximations. The Line- Transect Method The line-transect method is an easy, reliable way to determine percent cover. This method involves stretching a 50 - or 100 -foot tape diagonally across the crop rows, and then checking at every foot mark to see if that point touches a piece of residue. When using a 100 -foot tape, the percentage of residue cover is the number of times residue touches the points checked. If a 50 -foot tape is used, double the figure to arrive at the proper percentage of <b>residue</b> cover. While <b>checking,</b> a good question to consider is: 2 ̆ 2 If a raindrop falls at this point, will it hit residue or bare soil? 2 ̆ 2 Care must be taken to avoid overestimating. Look straight down at the tape and take all readings on the same side of the tape. If there is any doubt whether residue touches the point, do not count it. Take at least three measurements at sites typical of that particular field, and average them to obtain the estimate of residue in the field. Do not take measurements in turn row areas...|$|R
40|$|Research work {{performed}} during {{this study was}} aimed to elucidate the role of virulence factor in breeding resistance to Ascochyta rabiei. During this study nine isolates of A. rabiei which is a causative agent of blight of chickpea, were screened {{for the presence of}} phytotoxic activity. Optimum conditions like medium, pH, temperature etc. were investigated for the growth of A. rabiei. Biotoxicity of fungus free culture filtrate of A. rabiei was confirmed by cells, nodes/internodes, detached leaves and root growth inhibition bioassays. Further investigations indicated the presence of phytotoxic compounds associated with fungal pathogenesis in chickpea blight. It was observed that the synthesis of phytotoxic metabolite(s) was induced in the presence of unknown endogenous factors present in the aqueous extract of chickpea seeds. In order to detect the phytotoxic compound(s) during growth of A. rabiei in Czapek Dox medium supplemented with chickpea seed extract, the toxins were isolated from the culture filtrate by organic extraction, solid phase extraction and HPLC and identified as solanapyrones A and C. Further studies were carried out to establish a pattern of production of these phytotoxin(s) in 12 -day old fungus free culture filtrates of nine different fungal isolates. They were grown in still culture on Czapek Dox liquid medium supplemented with aqueous extracts of the chickpea seeds of one of two cultivars, a desi (6153) or a kabuli (Cypressa). Toxicity of the culture filtrates from both media were assayed with the cells isolated from the leaves of both cultivars and concentrations of the phytotoxins, solanapyrone A and solanapyrone C, in the filtrates were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For eight of the fungal isolates, toxicity and solanapyrone concentration were correlated; the value of r varies from 0. 383 to 0. 859 according to the cultivar used in the medium and assays. But in the culture filtrate of one isolate, there was no detectable level of solanapyrones but was showing 15 to 20 times more toxicity as compared to other isolates. The compound was isolated and found to be cytochalasin D by mass spectrometry and NMR. Solanapyrone C and cytochalasin D were also detected from the naturally infected chickpea plants. To find out the role of isolated phytotoxic compounds in blight of chickpea, the content of phytotoxic compounds in artificially infected chickpea plants with different fungal isolates of A. rabiei has been determined. The severity of disease was recorded using a scale ranging from 1 to 9 (Grawel, 1981) having five defined categories of severity after 12 days. Infected plant materials were also processed through minicolumn for the quantification of phytotoxic compounds by HPLC during pathogenesis. The studies indicate that considerable variability exists with isolates of A. rabiei for pathogenicity and virulence. The lowest grade of disease severity on 1 - 9 was 3 and the highest 9. Thus no cultivar showed complete resistance. Maximum phytotoxic compounds were detected on the 12 th day of infection, Toxin production varied in both cultivars of chickpea infected with different isolates of A. rabiei varying in virulence. Cytochalasin D was recovered in high levels followed by solanapyrones B + C and solanapyrone A. However, the correlation between the titers of solanapyrones A, B + C and cytochalasin D synthesized by the various fungal isolates upon plant infection and the severity of the disease as determined by the size of leaf and stem lesion was calculated as 0. 081, 0. 144 and 0. 718 respectively on disease susceptible chickpea cv. 6153 while it was 0. 055, 0. 25 and 0. 122 respectively on fungus resistant chickpea cv. C 44. The results seem to negate a causative role of isolated phytotoxic compounds in the onset of fungal blight in chickpea. For the determination of kinetics of phytotoxins production during in vitro growth of various isolates of A. rabiei varying in virulence, the culture filtrates were processed upto 24 days through minicolumn with the interval of 24 hours to resolve the contents of various phytotoxic compounds. Half of its volume was used for the quantification of phytotoxic compounds by HPLC and the other half was evaporated to <b>residue</b> to <b>check</b> the toxicityby cell bioassay. Solanapyrones, A, B + C and cytochalasin D production varied among the nine isolates of A. rabiei, whereas fungal growth as evidenced by fungal dry weight and sporulation as observed under microscope proceeded normally. Insignificantly low levels of phytotoxic compounds were detected in the culture filtrate of isolates CAMB 7 and 8. In CAMB 8, only solanapyrone B + C were detectable at 2 - 3 ug/mg of the fungus. Whereas in other isolates production of the varying levels of phytotoxic compounds was observed during in vitro growth and cytochalasin D was observed only in isolates CAMB 5 and CAMB 10. These results indicate CAMB 7 to be a Tox isolate at the present detection limits whereas CAMP 8 produces only solanapyrone B + C but not solanapyrone A. Analysis of genetic diversity by fingerprinting of A. rabiei isolates was one of the measurable objective of the programme. Nine isolates of A. rabiei were characterized by DNA fingerprinting with synthetic non radioactive labeled probes complimentary to simple repetitive sequences namely. (GATA) 4, (GACA) 4, (GTG) 5, (CAA) 5, (CA) 8, (GGAT) 4,Genome of A rabiei was studied and confirmed various isolates of A. rabiei (Previously categorized according to the disease severity and toxin production).
