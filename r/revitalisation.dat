In the mid-20th century she {{strongly}} influenced the <b>revitalisation</b> of home cookery {{in her native}} country and beyond with articles and books about European cuisines and traditional British dishes.|$|E
5|$|After having {{declined}} in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and <b>revitalisation</b> {{in the late}} Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britain; under Pompey, a large fleet {{was raised in the}} Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of <b>revitalisation,</b> being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori. Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca is {{undergoing}} a period of architectural <b>revitalisation</b> that is set to bring the manner of expansion to the vertical. A financial centre, containing a tower of 15 storeys, is slated for completion in 2010 on Ploiești Street. Two 35-storey twin towers are projected to be constructed in the Sigma area in Zorilor, while the Florești area will host a complex of three towers with 32 levels each.|$|E
5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a {{defamatory}} {{depiction of}} a character that referenced a specific politician, the current Minister for Government <b>Revitalisation</b> Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in the}} cancellation of its rerun on AT-X. Series supervisor Shinji Takamatsu explained that TV Tokyo cancelled the rerun on its own. Renhō's representative denied having objected to the episode although a report from the Mainichi Shimbun paper stated the affected party contacted TV Tokyo. When the story arc the episode belonged to was completed, Takamatsu expressed doubts about the arc's release in DVD format.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the <b>revitalisation</b> of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the {{official}} languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, {{with a common}} exception being the centralisation of the short i. The Māori language has undergone a process of <b>revitalisation</b> and is spoken by 3.7percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99percent and {{over half of the}} population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. As of the 2013 census, just under half the population identify as Christians, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40percent of the population does not have a religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health <b>Revitalisation</b> Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

25|$|The modern-day Cornish {{language}} is a successfully revived language {{with a number of}} speakers that is slowly increasing, and is becoming more visible in Cornwall as local government and business are encouraged {{to make use of the}} language as part of <b>revitalisation</b> efforts.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 19th century, {{a number of}} {{movements}} of <b>revitalisation</b> or innovation of traditional Sinism arose. They are characterised by an organised structure, a defined doctrine, and often a holy scripture. The most prominent among these sects are Bocheonism, Cheondoism, Daejongism, Daesun Jinrihoe, Jeungsanism and Suwunism.|$|E
25|$|The other two, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language), died {{in modern}} times with their presumed last native {{speakers}} in 1777 and 1974 respectively. For both these languages, however, <b>revitalisation</b> movements {{have led to the}} adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.|$|E
25|$|There was the {{possibility}} of a <b>revitalisation</b> of the Inner Circle in 1940, when the Ashworth Improvement Plan recommended a subway tunnel with five stations be built under the Melbourne CBD, from Flinders Street to the Inner Circle, with a proposed future subway from the first station to North Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} held by policy-makers regarding gentrification {{is often}} divided, with {{one side of}} the debate arguing that it is of benefit to the public economy and <b>revitalisation</b> of the built setting, whilst the other side argues that the huge social costs and displacement of people, especially the poor, outweigh all potential strengths of the process.|$|E
25|$|After the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the {{formation}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Ukraine fell under Polish administration, becoming part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The period immediately following the creation of the Commonwealth saw a huge <b>revitalisation</b> in colonisation efforts. Many new cities and villages were founded. Links between different Ukrainian regions, such as Galicia and Volyn were greatly extended.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the ongoing}} {{renewals}} {{are part of}} a wider urban <b>revitalisation</b> project of the larger Circular Quay area, involving a range of developments from the CBD and South East Light Rail project to new walkways and public domains along Sydney's various waterfronts.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the U of S {{launched}} a major <b>revitalisation</b> program, comprising new capital {{projects such as}} an expansion to the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, {{the building of a}} new parkade, and a revision of its internal road layout (which has already seen the East Road access being realigned). The Thorvaldson Building, which is home to the departments of chemistry and computer science, hosts a new expansion known as the Spinks addition. The College of Pharmacy and Nutrition has also had a number of renovations.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is above}} the river, and set away from the parks. Until the 1970s, it had many shops. However {{accidents}} occurred from increased traffic close to winding bends and narrow pavements. Since then the central streets have been pedestrianised or partly blocked off, leading {{to a decline in}} the number of pedestrians and shop closures in favour of out-of-town supermarkets. The construction of the Swan Centre and its supermarket, brought some <b>revitalisation.</b> In 2002, the high street was voted one of the worst in the United Kingdom in a BBC poll. Since 2002 council landscaping, has included trees and water features. Professional/property services have expanded in the town centre.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several efforts to enhance quality made by the government. The District Education <b>Revitalisation</b> Programme (DERP) was {{launched}} in 1994 with an aim to universalise primary education in India by reforming and vitalising the existing primary education system. 85% of the DERP {{was funded by the}} central government and the remaining 15% was funded by the states. The DERP, which had opened 1.6 lakh new schools including 84,000 alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately 35 lakh children, was also supported by UNICEF and other international programmes. In January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} <b>revitalisation</b> of Gaelic poetry, {{known as}} the Scottish Gaelic Renaissance was {{largely due to the}} work of Sorley Maclean (Somhairle MacGill-Eain, 1911–96). A native of Skye and a native Gaelic speaker, he abandoned the stylistic conventions of the tradition and opened up new possibilities for composition with his poem Dàin do Eimhir (Poems to Eimhir, 1943). His work inspired a new generation to take up nea bhardachd (the new poetry). These included George Campbell Hay (Deòrsa Mac Iain Dheòrsa, 1915–84), Lewis-born poets Derick Thomson (Ruaraidh MacThòmais, 1921–2012) and Iain Crichton Smith (Iain Mac a' Ghobhainn, 1928–98). They all focused on the issues of exile, the fate of the Gaelic language and bi-culturalism.|$|E
25|$|Liszt {{attempted}} in the symphonic poem {{to extend}} this <b>revitalisation</b> {{of the nature}} of musical discourse and add to it the Romantic ideal of reconciling classical formal principles to external literary concepts. To this end, he combined elements of overture and symphony with descriptive elements, approaching symphonic first movements in form and scale. While showing extremely creative amendments to sonata form, Liszt used compositional devices such as cyclic form, motifs and thematic transformation to lend these works added coherence. Their composition proved daunting, requiring a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a version where different parts of the musical form seemed balanced.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Icelandic {{music is}} {{strongly}} religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, {{due to the}} scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by harmoniums. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually a cappella, which {{can be traced back}} to skaldic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes. The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was Sigurður Breiðfjörð (1798–1846). A modern <b>revitalisation</b> of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.|$|E
25|$|The Tsang {{administration}} embattled {{with the}} conservation movement which reach {{its peak in}} the late 2000s, including the protests against the demolitions of the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier. In response to it, Tsang set up a Commissioner for Heritage Office and earmarked $1billion to revitalise historic buildings. He also proposed a series of <b>revitalisation</b> projects that would add {{a new dimension to}} Central. For instance, to reduce the development density of the Central Ferry Piers site and open up the public space along the waterfront for entertainment, recreational and cultural uses; to remove the Central Market from the Application List and hand it over to the Urban Renewal Authority for conservation and revitalisation; and to convert the Murray Building into a hotel through open tender etc.|$|E
25|$|The state's {{budget was}} {{released}} on 21 September 2006. It included 1,600 public service job axings despite an election pledge of only 400, however none of the redundancies will be forced. It also included increases in some fees and charges such as victims of crime levies and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) charges. There were increases in funding for health, schools, police and prisons, and the Department of Public Prosecutions. The 2007–2008 budget released on 13 June 2007 saw additional spending on Transport, Energy and Infrastructure, Health, Families and Communities, and Justice portfolios such as transport initiatives including <b>revitalisation</b> of the rail network, commencement of the $1.7 billion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital, funding for mental health reform including the delivery of health services, and funding for new commitments to law and order policies.|$|E
25|$|Māori {{language}} {{advocates have}} recognised radio broadcasting {{as having a}} small but significant role in bringing Māori language to New Zealand audiences {{for more than half}} a century, particularly since the establishment of radio stations under iwi control. Postcolonialists have also suggested the Iwi Radio Network is a form of decolonisation, a means of achieving decolonisation, and a way to assert cultural identity and challenge Pākeha cultural dominance. Massey University research in 2006 assessed five year qualitative and quantitative research, literature on the long term history of the Māori language, comparative studies between Māori and Irish radio, and Tūhoe's experiences setting up a radio station, and found the Iwi Radio Network had a positive impact on Māori language <b>revitalisation.</b> The stations have failed to counter a decline in the number of fluent Māori speakers in the 2010s, but continue to be part of the strategy to promote it.|$|E
25|$|Although Cappadocian Greek {{was once}} {{believed}} to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary “Last Words,” which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop {{went so far as to}} say that Janse’s speech “has lifted their shame.” The <b>revitalisation</b> process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population.|$|E
25|$|During the 1840s, {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} went into depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The <b>revitalisation</b> of the felt hat industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the felt hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} these reforms was a <b>revitalisation</b> of the Scottish {{university}} system, which expanded to 6,254 students {{by the end of}} the century and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow became highly distinguished under its second incumbent William John Macquorn Rankine (1820–72), who held the position from 1859 to 1872 and became the leading figure in heat engines and founder president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. Thomas Thomson (1773–1852) was the first Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow and in 1831 founded the Shuttle Street laboratories, perhaps the first of their kind in the world. His students founded practical chemistry at Aberdeen soon after. William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy at Glasgow aged only 22. His work included the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. By 1870Kelvin and Rankine had made Glasgow the leading centre of science and engineering education and investigation in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{passenger}} terminal remained an important transport hub {{in the decades}} subsequent to its completion, decline in cruise ship travel in the early 1980s meant that by 1983, the Overseas Passenger Terminal structure lay virtually empty and was derelict. As a result of this, the New South Wales Department of Public Works launched an ideas competition for the <b>revitalisation</b> and renovation of the terminal building. Eventually won by the conceptual work of Peter Tonkin (now of Tonkin Zulaikha Greer Architects), the project opened up the site to retail and restaurant opportunities, transforming {{the function of the}} terminal from purely infrastructure to a public place of meeting and entertainment. Introduction of these retail spaces, along with the opening of a new southern forecourt bounded by the bounding and surrounding heritage items were all part of a re-imagining and transformation of the Circular Quay West precinct from an infrastructural and commercial transport hub into a public waterfront promenade. These major renovations including the structural re-cladding and partial demolition were made by Tonkin in collaboration with prominent Australian architect Lawrence Nield and completed in 1988 for the Australian Bicentenary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{universities}} went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres {{at the forefront of}} Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had no entrance exams. Students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications. There was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum {{to meet the needs of}} the emerging middle classes and the professions. The result of these reforms was a <b>revitalisation</b> of the Scottish university system and growth in the number of students. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. After the Robbins Report of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish universities had doubled. In 1992 the distinction between universities and colleges was removed, creating a series of new universities.|$|E
