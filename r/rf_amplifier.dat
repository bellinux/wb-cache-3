5000|$|... "Gain compression" [...] in <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{is similar}} to soft clipping. However, in {{narrowband}} systems, the effect [...] "looks" [...] more like gain compression simply because the harmonics are filtered out after amplification. Many data sheets for <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers</b> list gain compression rather than distortion figures because it's easier to measure and {{is more important than}} distortion figures in nonlinear <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The S-band uplinks and downlinks usually (but not always) used phase {{modulation}} (PM). PM, like FM, has a constant amplitude (envelope) regardless of modulation.

50|$|Amplifiers {{designed}} to attach to a transmission line at input and output, especially <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> {{do not fit}} into this classification approach. Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match ratios of voltage to current. Many real <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers</b> come close to this ideal. Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{can be characterized as}} amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.|$|R
25|$|An <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier</b> amplifies {{signals in}} the radio {{frequency}} range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and {{is often used to}} increase the sensitivity of a receiver or the output power of a transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Control grid modulation: The {{operating}} bias and gain {{of the final}} <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid. This method requires little audio power, but {{care must be taken}} to reduce distortion.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier</b> filter of the superheterodyne receiver.|$|E

25|$|In a triode {{radio-frequency}} (<b>RF)</b> <b>amplifier,</b> if {{both the}} plate (anode) and grid {{are connected to}} resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency, stray capacitive coupling between the grid and the plate will cause the amplifier to go into oscillation if the stage gain {{is much more than}} unity. In early designs, dozens (in some cases over 100) low-gain triode stages had to be connected in cascade to make workable equipment, which drew enormous amounts of power in operation and required a team of maintenance engineers. The strategic value was so high, however, that the British Admiralty felt the high cost was justified.|$|E
25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>amplifier</b> design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E
2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier</b> must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier</b> may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{frequency}} ranges for audio <b>amplifiers</b> and <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers</b> overlap, {{the class of}} operation, method of output coupling and percent operational bandwidth will differ. Power valves are capable of high frequency response, up to at least 30 MHz. Indeed, many of the Directly Heated Single Ended Triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers use radio transmitting valves originally designed to operate as <b>RF</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in the high frequency range.|$|R

2500|$|... a Class C <b>RF</b> <b>{{amplifier}}</b> may {{be chosen}} {{because it can}} be very efficient—but is non-linear. Following such an amplifier with a so-called tank tuned circuit can reduce unwanted harmonics (distortion) sufficiently to make it useful in transmitters, or some desired harmonic may be selected by setting the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit to a higher frequency rather than fundamental frequency in frequency multiplier circuits.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Radiation Analyzer" [...] {{consisted of}} a chamber to hold a sample of material, a glass prism to refract the eloptic emanations coming from it, and a copper wire probe on a rotating armature to adjust the angle formed by the prism and the probe. Supposedly, eloptic emanations are refracted by the prism at different angles depending on the material. The detected eloptic signals were fed to a three-stage vacuum tube <b>RF</b> <b>amplifier</b> and conducted to a flat touch plate surrounded by a copper wire bifilar coil. By stroking the touch plate an operator could supposedly feel a sensation of [...] "tingling" [...] or [...] "stickiness" [...] when the eloptic energy was detected.

2500|$|To {{receive a}} radio signal, a {{suitable}} antenna is required. [...] The {{output of the}} antenna may be very small, often only a few microvolts. The signal from the antenna is tuned and may be amplified in a so-called radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>amplifier,</b> although this stage is often omitted. One or more tuned circuits at this stage block frequencies that are {{far removed from the}} intended reception frequency. In order to tune the receiver to a particular station, the frequency of the local oscillator is controlled by the tuning knob (for instance). Tuning of the local oscillator and the RF stage may use a variable capacitor, or varicap diode. The tuning of one (or more) tuned circuits in the RF stage must track the tuning of the local oscillator.|$|E
