5000|$|Enabling high {{performance}} optoelectronic modules using novel gas-conserving <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> system - Amada Miyachi America {{developed a new}} projection welding technique that dramatically reduces the amount of Xenon gas needed to backfill a package. Xenon has good thermal properties that aid in transporting reliability-reducing heat away from the electronic device. In addition, it is an inert gas, which does not enter into slow chemical reactions with other materials {{that can be a}} root cause of degraded performance and reliability. However, it is extremely expensive, about $150 a liter and many existing processes waste significant quantities of the costly gas during backfilling. The new cap welding technique uses an innovative electrode vacuum and gas backfill system that enables packages to be evacuated, and then filled with gas before being hermetically sealed using projection welding. This process consumes as little as 5 cubic centimeters of Xenon gas, costing only $0.75 per part.|$|E

30|$|Composite {{materials}} are engineered or naturally occurring materials made from {{two or more}} constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties which remain separate and distinct at the macroscopic or microscopic scale within the finished structure. W-Cu composites are made by mixing a refractory phase called tungsten, which possess high strength and low coefficient of thermal expansion, and a Cu-phase having high thermal and electrical conductivity [1]. The combination of these elements optimizes some properties such as ductility, strength, and corrosion and wear resistance. In the recent years, W-Cu composites have gained great importance in automotive, electrical, and military industry because of their high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansions, high wear resistance and excellent electrical conductivity. They are used as electrical contacts, <b>resistance</b> <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes,</b> heat sinks, electro-forging dies, packaging materials, and so on [2, 3].|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the broader}} {{utilization}} {{of a variety}} of aluminum alloys in the automotive industry for structural lightweight applications, the need for <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> (RSW) of dissimilar aluminum alloys is increasing. General Motors (GM) has developed a proprietary RSW process using a multi-ring, domed electrode geometry that significantly improves the performance of the aluminum <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welds.</b> In addition, to enhance structural performance, epoxy adhesivesare also often applied prior to RSW to obtain weld-bonded joints. As a contribution, the load-controlled fatigue behavior of dissimilar aluminum alloy spot welds made of 2 mm thick AA 5754 wrought sheet and 3 mm thick Aural 2 die casting sheet with and without the addition of adhesive prior to welding was studied. The same GM proprietary <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> and current schedule was applied to both welding conditions leading to a larger nugget size when using adhesive, but both weld configurations presented similar maximum load in tension-shear testing. X-ray computed tomography was used to detect internal welding discontinuities such as voids and also to follow the damage evolution and fatigue crack initiation and growth during interrupted fatigue testing of the spot welds. The results show that the main fatigue crack initiates {{at the edge of the}} nugget and penetrates through the Aural 2 die casting sheet in the thickness direction. Using the structural stress concept, it was also found that the structural stress-fatigue life curve for AA 5754 to Aural 2 aluminum spot welds with and without adhesive falls into a master curve indicating that the nugget size which corresponds to the tensile and bending strength dominates fatigue life...|$|R

40|$|Metallic {{coated steel}} sheet {{can be very}} {{aggressive}} towards copper alloy, <b>resistance</b> spot <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> These steels accelerate the electrode degradation process far in excess of that experienced when spot welding uncoated steels through an accumulation of the coating around the electrode tips, changing the geometry of the electrode and through an erosion process on the tip face {{in contact with the}} workpiece. The rate of electrode degradation is closely linked to the chemistry of the metallic coating and can be very severe, particularly when welding steels with coatings high in aluminium or when inappropriate welding conditions are used. High volume welding industries employing these steels are n o w faced with the need to more frequently monitor <b>weld</b> quality and <b>electrode</b> condition in order to sustain structural integrity of their product. Being very time consuming, the traditional shop floor, destructive techniques for assessing weld quality, are no longer considered appropriate. This has provided the impetus for researchers to develop new, non-destructive techniques which are easily implemented and which remove operator judgement as to the condition of electrodes. This work examines the feasibility of such a technique. The Adept (Advanced Grey Scale) Vision System has been assessed as to its ability to view and accurately measure the impression left by spot <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> on the surface of a zinc-iron rich metallic coated steel during a simulated production run and to equate these measurements to weld nugget size and tensile shear strength. The results of this work appear promising in that the vision system has identified electrode wear patterns and has successfully related these to both nugget size and tensile shear strength, these being paramount to engineers charged with design. The accuracy of the vision system has been thoroughly checked through the use of other techniques including carbon paper impression measurements of the degrading tips, profilometry on the impression left by the indenting electrode and ultrasonic and X-ray measurement of the weld prior to final destructive peel testing to measure actual weld nugget size. All techniques indicate trends that support the vision systems future capability as a new, non-destructive weld quality monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|Solid Metal Induced Embrittlement (SMIE) {{is caused}} by a {{specific}} combination of two solid metals in intimate contact. Cadmium, gold, silver and copper are known to cause SMIE in certain titanium alloys. Solid copper is used in <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> and fixtures in various manufacturing processes for titanium parts within the aerospace industry. In the case of <b>resistance</b> <b>welding,</b> titanium alloys are in intimate contact with solid copper, since the electrodes resistively heat the titanium part under pressure during the welding process. No previous published work that investigates the risk of using copper <b>electrodes</b> for <b>welding</b> of titanium alloys is available in the literature, but an initial study using U-bend testing indicates that solid copper in contact with Ti- 8 Al- 1 V- 1 Mo and Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo could lead to SMIE. Therefore, in the present study, <b>resistance</b> <b>welded</b> Ti- 8 Al- 1 V- 1 Mo and Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo have been evaluated to investigate the influence of copper electrodes on these alloys. Furthermore, <b>resistance</b> <b>welded</b> specimens sputtered with copper and gold to promote SMIE have also been evaluated. No SMIE was found in the <b>resistance</b> <b>welded</b> specimens, which may be explained by the short interaction time that the copper electrodes are in intimate contact with the titanium alloy, and/or the magnitude of residual stresses after welding, which may be too low to initiate SMIE.
