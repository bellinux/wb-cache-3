Ker-Gawl. ex Sprengel (Amaryllidaceae), were {{examined}} by LM (light microscope) and EM (electron microscope). At the meristematic {{area of the}} root tips, which was 1 mm in length, two types of cell were observed: meristematic cells and Ca-oxalate <b>raphide</b> <b>crystal</b> idioblasts. Ca-oxalate <b>raphide</b> <b>crystal</b> idioblasts were observed to lie in two lines between the inner and outer ground meristems. Some similarities and some differences were found between those cells in their ultrastructure. It was seen that the membrane thickness of crystal idioblasts and meristematic cells were the same. They were also found to be similar in cell content, both containing nuclei, cytoplasm, vacuoles, mitochondria and proplastids. However the organization of the cell contents, the numbers, the forms and sizes of vacuoles were different between these cell types. In some meristematic cells and idioblasts of certain roots, some degenerated changes were seen due to necrosis. Those changes were in the form of plasmolysis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, chromatin roughness, karyopyknosis and organelle loss...|$|E
40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) {{are typical}} compounds of plant secondary metabolism and {{are believed to}} be part of the plant's chemical defense. Within the monocotyledonous plants, PAs have been described in only a few genera, mainly orchids, including Phalaenopsis. Because phylogenetic analyses suggest an independent origin of PA biosynthesis within the monocot lineage, we have analyzed the developmentally regulated expression of homospermidine synthase (HSS), the first pathway-specific enzyme of PA biosynthesis, at the cell level. HSS is expressed in the tips of aerial roots exclusively in mitotically active cells. <b>Raphide</b> <b>crystal</b> idioblasts present within the root apical meristem do not show HSS expression. In addition, young flower buds, but not mature flowers, express HSS and have been shown by tracer feeding experiments to be able to catalyze PAs. This second site of PA biosynthesis ensures high concentrations of PAs in the reproductive structures of the Phalaenopsis flower, even after the flower opens. Thus, in spite of its identical function in PA biosynthesis, HSS shows in Phalaenopsis a completely different spatial and developmental expression pattern in comparison to other PA-producing species. These results show that the proverbial diversity of plant secondary metabolism is not just a matter of structural diversity, but is also multifaceted in terms of pathway regulation and expression...|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{aspects of}} crystal {{idioblast}}s were studied in roots of Vanilla planifolia L. and Yucca torreyi L. In Vanilla, root crystal idioblast initials are first recognized by intense fluorescence of cytoplasmic RNA with acridine orange; nuclear and nucleolar enlargement gradually ensue. Feulgen microspectrophotometry showed that all idioblast nuclei are endopolyploid. Frequency distribution of individual DNA content measurements and nuclear structures suggest endomitosis to the 8 C level and heterochromatin underreplication in higher endopolyploid nuclei. Many ultrastructural features of Vanilla idioblast development {{are common to}} differentiation of similar cells observed in other plants. Excised primary roots of Yucca torreyi were cultured in various media, and development of coritical <b>raphide</b> <b>crystal</b> idioblasts observed with CTEM and HVEM. Idioblasts were consistently produced, required 24 hours to fully differentiate from initials in isolated root cultures, and developed normally relative to those cells in intact roots. These isolated root cultures are {{shown to be a}} well-suited system for physiological investigations of oxalate metabolism and control of idioblast cytodifferentiation. Cytochemical localization of three peroxisomal enzymes, glycolate oxidase, urate oxidase, and catalase was performed on tissues from Psychotria punctata leaves and Yucca torreyi roots which contain developing idioblasts. Reaction product deposition attributable to glycolate oxidase activity was never observed in any developing idioblast in either plant; pathways involving glycolate or glyoxylate intermediates are probably not involved in oxalate synthesis for crystal production. A survey of callus cultures from nineteen higher plant species showed that structural differentiation of idioblasts in culture is media dependent, species specific, and influenced by types of growth regulators. Also, crystal shape is determined by the cell during its differentiation and under general genetic control. Media modifications which favor cytodifferentiation of idioblasts include use if IAA as culture auxin, deletion of ammonium nitrate, and high calcium supplement. This study concludes that crystal idioblasts probably have multiple functions which vary with tissue and species specificity; however, it is not likely that these cells ever serve as depositories for oxalate as a metabolic waste product...|$|E
40|$|The {{halophyte}} Mesembryanthemum crytallinum L. (ice plant) {{is marked}} by giant epidermal bladder cells (EBC). The differentiation of pavement cells into EBC occurs at an early developmental stage. EBC occupy most of the surface area in the aerial parts of salt-stressed mature ice plants. A large vacuolar reservoir for ion and water storage {{plays an important role}} in salinity adaptation. To monitor the acidity of the vacuole at different developmental stages of EBC, peels from the abaxial surface were stained with a pH-sensitive dye, neutral red (NR). Presence of both NR-stained (acidic) and NR-unstained (neutral) EBC were found at the juvenile stage in ice plants. Continuous exposure to illumination decreased the acidity of the NR-stained cells. The EBC protein profile illustrated the prominent co-existence of highly acidic and basic proteins in these specialised cells. Major proteins that accumulate in EBC are involved in photosynthesis, sodium compartmentalisation, and defence. Numerous <b>raphide</b> <b>crystals</b> were found in well fertilised ice plants.

Biomineralisation in the fleshy {{pericarp}} of berries of Vitis vinifera L. {{gives rise}} to crystals of two distinct forms, viz. raphides and druses, which are found in exocarp and endocarp cells respectively. Druses have generally been considered as crystalline aggregates of calcium oxalate.

40|$|The current {{practices}} of collection and processing of herbal materials by traditional practitioners (mostly Malays) in Perak, Malaysia, were reviewed {{in order to}} evaluate how these practices could possibly {{have an impact on}} the quality of the final products. The documentation was done through a structured interview survey conducted on 56 practitioners selected from each district of Perak. A majority of the selected practitioners were of the older generation. The method of gathering the plant materials combines collection from the wild, small scale cultivation as well as purchasing from grocery shops or other practitioners. The most commonly used plant parts are roots and leaves. The initial processing practices generally involve slicing of the raw materials into smaller pieces, drying under direct sunlight and grinding. The materials are commonly stored loosely packed, unprotected from light or pest. In total these practitioners use 184 types of plant according to their vernacular names. An analysis of the data showed that the plant known as Ajisamat corresponds to two different species from different families - Salacia macrophylla Blume (Celastraceae) and Prismatomeris glabra (Rubiaceae). Therefore pharmacognostical studies were undertaken to determine identity and quality criteria for these plants. Macromorphological inspection of the vegetative parts of the two plants reveals only a slight difference in the arrangement of the petioles.

40|$|No {{research}} on the fungal endophytes in the green New Zealand terrestrial orchids has been published. Identification of the endophyte resident in Nematoceras iridescens roots was accomplished by comparing hyphal septal ultra-structure and using TEM imaging of the hyphal septa, all of which indicated that the genus Tulasnella was involved. The Tulasnella species was identified using molecular techniques focused on sequencing of the ribosomal RNA locus on the ITS 1 – 5. 8 S–ITS 2 nuclear ribosomal gene. The endophytic fungi, resident in the host plant N. iridescens and the germinating seed of this species, were identified {{for the first time}} as strains of Tulasnella calospora. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light microscopy (LM) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) was used to investigate spatial distribution of the endophyte hyphae within the plant. The SEM results identified four morphological types of hyphae: initiating, divaricating, intercellular and necrotised, or undergoing lysis. Peloton formation only occurred in specific areas of the root; mainly within the sub-epidermal and mid cortex cells. No hyphal involvement within the stele or the immediately adjacent cortex cells occurred. This thesis, based on meteorological information, proposes that the centre of origin of Nematoceras is likely to be Papua New Guinea, with on-going dispersal being direct or from Australia to New Zealand. Wind vectors and Nematoceras adaptations to seed dispersal, both local and long distance, were investigated and tend to support this hypothesis. Germination of all known orchid seed requires an obligate mycoheterotroph, generally a member of the Basidiomyceteae. For the first time, CLSM has imaged the fungal endophyte within the seed embryo and this was identified by molecular techniques and found to be a unique strain of T. calospora. Three methods of orchid seed germination were trialled: symbiotic, asymbiotic and field envelopes. After a 12 -month period, only field envelopes produced germinating seeds of N. iridescens. In all other methods the seed failed to germinate. All Nematoceras spp. are solitary leafed and classified as moist mesophytes. Leaves were found to be hypostomatous. Being single leaved, protection is essential and a number of adaptations to counter herbivoury were found: <b>raphide</b> <b>crystals,</b> wax cuticle, winter maturity with summer–autumn aestivation all provide an antiherbivoury component. The relationship between the genera of Nematoceras plus Singularybas and the associated species, of the far more ancient Hepatophyte order of Metzgeriales, were investigated. The genus Aneura contains peloton like vesicles of various strains of T. calospora. The majority of the Hepatophytes have a parallel geographic-ecological requirement.

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of growth forms are present: shrubs are most common (e.g. Coffea, Psychotria), but {{members of the family}} can also be trees (e.g. Cinchona, Nauclea), lianas (e.g. Psychotria samoritourei), or herbs (e.g. Galium, Spermacoce). Some {{epiphytes}} are also present (e.g. Myrmecodia). The plants usually contain iridoids, various alkaloids, and <b>raphide</b> <b>crystals</b> are common. The leaves are simple, undivided, and entire; leaf blades are usually elliptical, with a cuneate base and an acute tip. In three genera (Pavetta, Psychotria, Sericanthe), bacterial leaf nodules can be observed as dark spots or lines on the leaves. The phyllotaxis is usually decussate, rarely whorled (e.g. Fadogia), or rarely alternate resulting from the suppression of one leaf at each node (e.g. Sabicea sthenula). Characteristic for the Rubiaceae is the presence of stipules that are mostly fused to an interpetiolar structure {{on either side of the}} stem between the opposite leaves. Their inside surface often bears glands called [...] "colleters", which produce mucilaginous compounds protecting the young shoot. The [...] "whorled" [...] leaves of the herbaceous Rubieae tribe have classically been interpreted as true leaves plus interpetiolar leaf-like stipules. The inflorescence is a cyme, rarely of solitary flowers (e.g. Rothmannia), and is either terminal or axillary and paired at the nodes. The flowers are usually bisexual and usually epigynous. The perianth is usually biseriate, although the calyx is absent in some taxa (e.g. Theligonum). The calyx has four or five sepals with basally fused lobes. The corolla is sympetalous with four or five lobes, mostly actinomorphic, usually tubular, mostly white or creamy but also yellow (e.g. Gardenia spp., Mycelia basiflora), and rarely blue (e.g. Faramea calyptrata) or red (e.g. Alberta magna, Ixora coccinea). They have four or five stamens, which are alternipetalous and epipetalous. Anthers are longitudinal in dehiscence, but some genera are poricidal (e.g. Rustia). The gynoecium is syncarpous with an inferior ovary (rarely secondarily superior, e.g. Gaertnera, Pagamea). Placentation is axial, rarely parietal (e.g. Gardenia); ovules are anatropous to hemitropous, unitegmic, with a funicular obturator, one to many per carpel. Nectaries are often present as a nectariferous disk atop the ovary. The fruit is a berry, capsule (e.g. Oldenlandia), drupe (e.g. Psychotria), or schizocarp (e.g. Cremocarpon). Red fruits are fairly dominant (e.g. Coffea arabica); yellow (e.g. Rosenbergiodendron formosum), orange (e.g. Vangueria infausta), or blackish fruits (e.g. Pavetta gardeniifolia) are equally common; blue fruits are rather exceptional save in the Psychotrieae and associated tribes. Most fruits are about 1.0 cm in diameter; very small fruits are relatively rare and occur in herbaceous tribes; very large fruits are rare and confined to the Gardenieae. The seeds are endospermous.|$|R
30|$|Although the shape, {{size and}} number of {{crystals}} show variations among taxa, they have been classified into five main groups based on their morphology: as prism, druses, styloids, <b>raphides</b> and <b>crystal</b> sand (Webb 1999). Various physical, chemical and biological parameters such as light, temperature, pH, ion concentration and herbivory may affect the location, size and other properties of crystals in plants (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Molano-Flores 2001; Kuo-Huang et al. 2007; Meriç 2009). However, many authors have stated that crystal formation within the cell is under genetic control (Ilarslan et al. 2001). Thus the shape and location of the crystals within a taxon are often very specific and may be represented as a taxonomic character (Genua and Hillson 1985; Prychid and Rudall 1999; Lersten and Horner 2000). Furthermore, {{the presence or absence}} of crystals may represent useful taxonomic characters and also be used for understanding the evolutionary relationships of plant species (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Prychid and Rudall 1999). For example, by considering both morphological and molecular characteristics and the distribution of calcium oxalate crystals in some taxa, Rudall and Chase (1996) have shown that the genera formerly included in Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato may belong to three different families: Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu stricto, Lomandraceae and Dasypogonaceae (Prychid and Rudall 1999).|$|R

The flowers are protogynous; the stigma is receptive before the pollen is shed. Anatomically, the spathe has a uniseriate upper and lower epidermis,one or two layers of hypodermal cells, and 10 to 12 layers of spongy parenchyma cells. Anthocyanin is localized in the hypodermal cells. The leaf blade {{is similar to the}} spathe, except for two layers of palisade parenchyma cells immediately below the upper epidermis. Venation is netted. Chloroplasts are dispersed throughout the mesophyll but are more concentrated in the palisade cells. The peduncle, petiole, and stem are typically monocotyledonous in structure. Epidermal cells cover the cortex, a layer of sclerified parenchyma cells, and the ground tissue. Vascular bundles are dispersed throughout the groundtissue. Roots are cylindrical, fleshy, epiphytic, and adventitious. The epidermis is developed as a velamen. <b>Raphide</b> and druse <b>crystals</b> are found throughout the plant. Above-ground parts have a thick, waxy cuticle...|$|R
40|$|Socratea exorrhiza (Mart.) H. Wendl. is a {{palm tree}} that occurs in {{significant}} abundance in lowland forests of the Amazon region due to its root system adapted to flooded environments. However, with the sheet the organ that more changes in response to environmental change is proposed in this study to characterize the leaf structure of S. exorrhiza, aimed at generating useful information {{to better understand the}} anatomical characteristics of this body, in the occurrence of natural conditions of species. For this, samples were submitted to the usual techniques in plant anatomy. The regions of the leaf have different structures. The sheath is presented dorsiventral with papillose epidermis, air spaces, canals with septa and <b>crystal</b> <b>raphides,</b> the petiole and rachis exhibit a peripheral region and other spinal cord, with vascular bundles surrounded by sheaths amiliferous. The pinna is amphistomatic, with waxy streaks on the walls of guard cells, trichomes in the form of T, filamentous and branched. In the mesophyll, three types of vascular bundles: primary, secondary and tertiary, the border along the pinna has tapered form, orthorhombic and revolute. From the results it is concluded that, in general, the leaves of S. exorrhiza have characteristics common to Arecaceae. However, striking feature have been observed that may be unique to the species.

40|$|Objective: To {{study in}} detail the macro and micro {{morphology}} including scanning electron microscopy, phyto and physicochemical analysis along with the trace elements determination (EDAX) of the leaves of Vitisvinifera L. family Vitaceae, which possesses various bioactive components and many traditional and pharmacologically validated uses {{in the treatment of}} many diseases including NTD. Methods: Macroscopy, microscopy including scanning electron microscopy, physicochemical analysis, preliminary phytochemical screening, Energy dispersive X-ray analysis to determine the various trace elements, and other WHO recommended parameters for standardizations were performed. Results: Vitisvinifera L. leaves are orbicular-cordate, 5 - 15 cm, more or less deeply, palmately- 3 -, 5 - or 7 -lobed, irregularly toothed, glabrescent above, often grey-tomentose beneath, thin membraneous; Microscopic evaluation revealed the presence of ranunculaceous type of stomata in lower epidermis and upper epidermis cell walls are straight polygonal in shape and apostomatic, secretory cells, druses of calcium oxalate <b>crystals,</b> <b>raphide,</b> pearl glands, unicellular trichomes, xylem vessels, phloem, fibres. Vein islet numbers, vein termination numbers, stomatal number, stomatal index and other physicochemical tests like ash values, loss on drying, extractive values were determined. Preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of sterols, tannins, proteins and amino acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, volatile oil, saponin, carbohydrates and absence of glycosides, alkaloids, fixed oil. Conclusion: The microscopic analysis using histological identification, microscopic constants and other physicochemical examinations of the leaves of Vitisvinifera L. {{can be used as a}} rapid, inexpensive botanical identification technique and is useful in standardization, hence would be of immens...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of calcium (Ca) oxalate crystals {{is considered to}} be a high-capacity mechanism for regulating Ca in many plants. Ca oxalate precipitation is not a stochastic process, suggesting the involvement of specific biochemical and cellular mechanisms. Microautoradiography of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) tissue exposed to 3 H-glutamate showed incorporation into developing crystals, indicating potential acidic proteins associated with the crystals. Dissolution of crystals leaves behind a crystal-shaped matrix “ghost” that is capable of precipitation of Ca oxalate in the original crystal morphology. To assess whether this matrix has a protein component, purified crystals were isolated and analyzed for internal protein. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of one major polypeptide of about 55 kD and two minor species of 60 and 63 kD. Amino acid analysis indicates the matrix protein is relatively high in acidic amino acids, a feature consistent with its solubility in formic acid but not at neutral pH. 45 Ca-binding assays demonstrated the matrix protein has a strong affinity for Ca. Immunocytochemical localization using antibody raised to the isolated protein showed that the matrix protein is specific to crystal-forming cells. Within the vacuole, the surface and internal structures of two morphologically distinct Ca oxalate <b>crystals,</b> <b>raphide</b> and druse, were labeled by the antimatrix protein serum, as were the surfaces of isolated crystals. These results demonstrate that a specific Ca-binding protein exists as an integral component of Ca oxalate crystals, which holds important implications with respect to regulation of crystal formation...|$|R
