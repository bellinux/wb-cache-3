5|$|About {{five months}} after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol, Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge {{was sentenced to death}} and {{returned}} to <b>Reading</b> <b>for</b> his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 – the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridge's hanging, Wilde later wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol.|$|E

He graduated Oxford BA with third-class honours in literae humaniores (1881) {{and entered the}} Inner Temple {{with a view to}} <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> the bar, but his health, always frail, temporarily broke down. In 1890 he considered becoming a sculptor and studied briefly under G. F. Watts. In 1893 he married Dorothy Margaret Chapman, daughter of Major Frederick Barclay Chapman of the 14th Hussars.|$|E

5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E
5|$|Mary Russell Mitford {{lived in}} <b>Reading</b> <b>for</b> {{a number of}} years and then spent {{the rest of her life}} just outside the town at Three Mile Cross and Swallowfield.

Described with topographical accuracy, it is still possible to follow the steps of the novel's characters in present-day Reading.|$|E
5|$|Essai remains Cantillon's only {{surviving}} {{contribution to}} economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, {{but was not}} published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, Essai was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{the year}} of Shaw's ninetieth birthday, he {{accepted}} the freedom of Dublin {{and became the first}} honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras, London. In the same year the government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit. He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions. It was widely praised; a reviewer in The American Journal of Public Health considered it essential <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> any student of the American criminal justice system.|$|E

McClair had been at United since 1987, and opted {{for a return to}} Motherwell in the Scottish Premier League; he had played at Fir Park in the early 1980s. Pallister agreed to return to Middlesbrough in a £2.5million deal, nine years after he had left them for a £2.3million transfer to Old Trafford.

5|$|On leaving Holloway, Davison {{became a}} live-in governess, and {{continued}} studying in the evenings. She saved {{enough money to}} enrol at St Hugh's College, Oxford, for one term to sit her finals; she achieved first-class honours in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women. She worked briefly at a church school in Edgbaston between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a private school in Worthing, where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in Northamptonshire.

On the Art of the Cinema also influenced South Korea's minjung-oriented People's Cinema (MR: minjung yŏnghwa) movement that was {{born out of}} the Gwangju Democratization Movement. The work's influence goes beyond Korea, too. Australian Anna Broinowski directed Aim High in Creation!, a movie about making a propaganda film abiding by Kim's instructions.

Its sequels, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind and Ender in Exile, follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts and novel Ender's Shadow take place {{during the same time}} period as the original.|$|E
5|$|Samantha Claire Taylor {{was born}} in Amersham, Buckinghamshire on 25 September 1975, {{as part of a}} {{sporting}} family: her father played rugby, and her mother played hockey. She attended Dolphin School in Hurst, Berkshire, where she initially played softball, participating as the only girl in the school team. Taylor did not play cricket until a summer camp at the age of 13, but thereafter improved to such a level that she captained the Dolphin School cricket team, playing alongside the boys. She subsequently moved to The Abbey School, <b>Reading</b> <b>for</b> a short time, and finally Kendrick School. Although she primarily played hockey as a teenager, at which she represented England at Under-17 and Under-19 as a forward, she began playing women's county cricket for Thames Valley, making her debut for the side in May 1993.|$|E

5|$|The festival's {{cultural}} program {{ranged from}} a string theory-themed dance performance choreographed by Karole Armitage to a storytelling event in cooperation with The Moth, which featured journalist and writer Lucy Hawking, physicist Jim Gates and writer Sam Shepard, among others. Alan Alda revisited his role as Richard Feynman in Peter Parnell's play QED in a staged reading at Columbia University's Miller Theatre, and the choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church joined Oliver Sacks in an exploration of music and science. The festival also saw the première of Dear Albert, a <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> the stage written by Alda based on the letters of Albert Einstein, and starring Anthony LaPaglia as Einstein.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary {{was founded in}} the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh {{sometime}} before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a school that was not purely a song school for the cathedral but was also to be available to provide an education in music and <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> some children of Elgin.|$|E

5|$|Whilst <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> a maths {{scholarship}} at the University of Marburg, Shaw Jeffrey {{was offered}} {{the chance to work}} at Trent College, unofficially, as first the headmaster's private secretary, and then as a teacher. Unfortunately, he was unable to win the Marburg scholarship in 1881, and, left unemployed after the death of the Headmaster the year after, he took up a post as a junior master at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, soon after its move to new premises. On 30 January 1884, he matriculated into the University of Oxford as a member of The Queen's College, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in 1887 and was granted his MA in 1890. He was disappointed to receive a degree with only third-class honours, however, and was advised to put any ambition of teaching on hold—advice which he did not follow.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Bill Williams {{stated that}} the book should be {{mandatory}} <b>reading</b> <b>for</b> {{high school and college}} students.

Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Chuck Leddy noted that the author helps readers understand the importance of freedom of speech in a democracy, especially during a period of military conflict when there is increased controversy over the appropriateness of dissent and open dialogue.|$|E
