500|$|Initially, {{knowledge}} of bootlegs {{and where to}} purchase them spread by word of mouth. The pioneering bootlegger Rubber Dubber sent copies of his bootleg recordings of live performances to magazines such as Rolling Stone {{in an attempt to}} get them reviewed. When Dylan's record company, Columbia Records objected, Rubber Dubber counteracted he was simply putting fans in touch with the music without the intermediary of a record company. Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap photocopies. The packaging became more sophisticated {{towards the end of the}} decade and continued into the 1980s. Punk <b>rock</b> <b>saw</b> a brief entry into the bootleg market in the 1970s, particularly the bootleg Spunk, a series of outtakes by The Sex Pistols. The album received a good review from Sounds' Chas de Whalley, who said it was [...] "an album that no self-respecting rock fan would turn his nose up at." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode, simply saying he [...] "loved this episode," [...] {{giving it a}} perfect 10 out of 10 score. Canning enjoyed Jack and Devon's back-and-forth, and wrote that Jenna and Tracy [...] "tormenting" [...] Liz in their separate ways were [...] "equally gratifying." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times opined, [...] "To all those haters who say 30 Rock is losing its touch, I say 'poppycock!' [...] was proof that the show is as zippy as ever." [...] She noted that Jack's plot [...] "didn't make {{a whole lot of}} sense", nonetheless [...] "anything that means more Will Arnett on 30 Rock is fine by me." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported it was great to see Jack and NBC [...] "still being affected by the economy, government bailouts, and Washington hearings". Sassone much preferred [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] than [...] "Season 4". New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 <b>Rock</b> <b>saw</b> the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. In his recap, TV Guides [...] Michael Anthony said that the Jack and Devon characters [...] "really [...] how to put a playful spin" [...] on the bail out and government money story.|$|E
2500|$|Hines' {{biggest hit}} was with Tom Snow's [...] "You", which reached number 2 in the singles charts in Australia in October 1977. It was an up-tempo dance song, later {{covered in the}} U.S. by Rita Coolidge. The song, however, nearly didn't make it to Marcia. Robie Porter had put the song into his [...] "don't use" [...] pile. Mark Kennedy, her backing band's drummer (ex-Spectrum, Doug Parkinson in Focus, Ayers <b>Rock),</b> <b>saw</b> the sheet music {{in the studio and}} began arguing the songs' worth to Porter. Porter {{subsequently}} changed his mind about the song.|$|E

500|$|The show's first {{studio was}} Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles, California, with the {{production}} moving to Desilu in 1957. Franklin Canyon Reservoir and Vasquez <b>Rocks</b> <b>saw</b> location shootings. During the Timmy seasons, episodes were filmed at the Grand Canyon and in the High Sierra, and, during the Forest Service seasons, the Forest Service and the [...] Department of the Interior offered Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Washington Monument and other sites for location shoots.|$|R
60|$|Eric {{slept for}} a day and a night. But at that same hour of the evening, when he had fallen asleep, Gudruda, {{watching}} him by the light of a taper that was set upon a <b>rock,</b> <b>saw</b> him smile in his dreams. Presently {{he opened his eyes and}} stared at the fire which glowed in the mouth of the cave, and the great shadows that fell upon the rocks.|$|E
60|$|The other man, who sprang {{down from}} his perch, handed him what {{appeared}} to be two thick sticks of yellow wax, and Gordon watched him as he carefully nipped a copper detonator down on a length of snaky fuse, and embedded it in the plastic material. Then he cautiously tamped the two yellow rolls down into the drilled-out hole. After that he lighted the fuse, and, clambering down the slope of <b>rock,</b> <b>saw</b> Gordon.|$|E

50|$|During this period, another {{test case}} {{had been brought}} against the company in 1879. Again, the issue {{concerned}} whether the undertaking was a mine or a quarry, but in this instance, which related to the assessment of profits, it was deemed to be a quarry. In 1882, the quarry employed over 500 men, and slates were produced in three mills, two of which were powered by water wheels and one by a steam engine. The mills contained around 50 <b>rock</b> <b>saws</b> and 50 dressing machines.|$|R
50|$|Later years <b>saw</b> <b>rock</b> acts, such as Alice Cooper.|$|R
50|$|Archived Cores {{have been}} slabbed, {{which means that}} it has been cut lengthwise, with a <b>rock</b> <b>saw,</b> which exposes a fresh flat surface to enhance the core viewing process. This also enables the cores to boxed and stored like books on a shelf, which allows for quick access to {{specific}} depth intervals.|$|E
5000|$|Sci-Fi on the <b>Rock</b> <b>saw</b> another amazing {{year with}} many great workshops. Space at the Sheraton Hotel is already {{becoming}} tight as some workshops and panels had long line-ups and filled to capacity. On Sunday attendees and committee alike {{were surprised by}} an unplanned visit to the convention by past guest Eugene Simon, who {{said that when he}} realized he had the time he didn't want to miss it.|$|E
50|$|Various older {{rock bands}} made a comeback, {{including}} The Beach Boys with “Kokomo”, The Kinks with Come Dancing and “Do It Again”, the Steve Miller Band with “Abracadabra”, and Steely Dan with “Hey Nineteen”. Bruce Springsteen released his blockbuster album Born In The U.S.A., while Stevie Ray Vaughan and George Thorogood sparked {{a revival of}} blues. However, Led Zeppelin disbanded after John Bonham's 1980 death, and country <b>rock</b> <b>saw</b> a decline after Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1977 plane crash.|$|E
50|$|Cubby House were an Australian rock'n'roll band {{aimed at}} 6 to 10 year olds. Their album <b>Rock</b> Cake <b>saw</b> them {{nominated}} for the 1999 ARIA Award for Best Children's Album.|$|R

40|$|The {{ornamental}} rock industry generates {{huge amounts}} of wastes {{during the process of}} extraction and <b>sawing</b> of <b>rock</b> blocks. The ornamental rock powder waste is a non-biodegradable material, which represents the increase in environmental problem. The waste was collected from a granitic <b>rock</b> <b>sawing</b> plant located in Santo Antônio de Pádua, Rio de Janeiro. The chemical-environmental characterization and classification of the waste were done according to ABNT standards. The results showed that the granitic rock powder waste should be classified as Class II A - "No Inert", because of its high concentrations of lead, chrome, iron and manganese...|$|R
50|$|Towncraft was a {{compilation}} LP documenting the punk scene of Little Rock, Arkansas and released by DIY record labels File Thirteen Records, Ahoalton Records, and Lower Case Records. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Little <b>Rock</b> <b>saw</b> an explosion of high school punk rock bands after the departures of locals Trusty in 1991 and Econochrist in 1989. A number of youth {{felt it necessary to}} document the scene. After several meetings at Denny's with an attendance of over 30 adolescents, Towncraft was born.|$|E

5000|$|Wilson's {{involvement}} in popular music stemmed from hosting Granada's culture and music programme [...] "So It Goes". Wilson, who intensely disliked the music {{scene of the}} mid-1970s which was dominated by such genres as progressive rock and arena <b>rock,</b> <b>saw</b> the Sex Pistols at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall, in June 1976, an experience which he described as [...] "nothing short of an epiphany". He booked them for the last episode of the first series, probably the first television showing of the then-revolutionary British strand of punk rock.|$|E
5000|$|In 1893, {{the island}} was sold for a dollar an acre by a banker named Keith, and was later bought in the late 1960s by a {{developer}} named Phil Matty. [...] "No utilities, no garbage trucks, no telephones, no fire stations, no policemen, no industry—just 32 acres of beautiful British Columbia. I escaped to that paradise {{for a few hours}} each week to move <b>rocks,</b> <b>saw</b> logs, watch the tide come in and go out—all in the name of therapeutic basket weaving. It was like having my own personal psychiatrist. I loved it. I loved it so much that I bought it." ...|$|R
60|$|George {{looked over}} the <b>rocks,</b> and <b>saw</b> them trying to lift the burly form of Tom into the saddle. After two or three ineffectual attempts, he reeled, and fell heavily to the ground.|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{ahead and}} there, around a {{bend of the}} <b>rocks,</b> all <b>saw</b> two figures moving around on horseback. One was {{the figure of a}} tall man, and the other that of a well-grown youth.|$|R
5000|$|The holotype was {{collected}} at Dinosaur Cove on the Victoria coast from [...] "a fine-grained lithic sandstone" [...] of the Otway Group. The rocks {{are thought to}} have formed from a river channel, and date from the Albian age of the Cretaceous period. Despite some damage from a <b>rock</b> <b>saw,</b> the specimen comprises most of an abdomen, including the telson and one uropod, and parts of four pereiopods. The somites of the abdomen overlap, and bear a few small spines. The entire abdomen is about 83 mm long, including the telson, implying a total length of around 170 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The holotype of Appianoporites is a lone {{fragment}} of fruiting body 7.0 mm by 2.5 mm and 3.3 mm deep, which was abraded by water transport before preservation in a calcareous nodule. The conk section has {{an average of}} six 130 to 163 μm diameter tubes per millimeter. The fungus is composed of monomitic hyphae. Due to the abraded nature of the specimen the basidia and basidiospores are both unknown at this time. [...] The specimen was studied by cutting the calcareous nodule into slices with a <b>rock</b> <b>saw</b> and using the cellulose acetate peel technique to create slides that were examined under stereo microscope.|$|E
50|$|The holotype of Margaretbarromyces is a lone ascoma like fruiting body 390 μm in {{diameter}} by 420 μm in height in bark of an unidentified seed plant, which was transported by water before preservation in a calcareous nodule. The ascoma {{is composed of}} high branching and complex anastomosed hyphae. The interior chamber of the ascoma, filled with calcite, preserves several asci {{and a number of}} ascospores. Though the asci are faint the groupings of ascospores are well preserved showing the placement of the asci to be basal. Each ascospore is between 55-90μm and dictyosporous. The specimen was studied by cutting the calcareous nodule into slices with a <b>rock</b> <b>saw</b> and using the cellulose acetate peel technique to create slides that were examined under stereo microscope.|$|E

50|$|Avid rock {{collectors}} {{often use}} their specimens {{to learn about}} petrology, mineralogy and geology as well as skills in the identification and classifying of specimen rocks, and preparing them for display. The hobby can lead naturally into lapidary projects, and also the cutting, polishing, and mounting of gemstones and minerals. The equipment needed to do this includes <b>rock</b> <b>saws</b> and polishers. Many beautiful crystal varieties are typically found in very small samples which requires a good microscope for working with and photographing the specimen. The hobby {{can be as simple}} as finding pretty rocks for a windowsill or develop into a detailed and comprehensive museum quality display.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come ahead," [...] said Phineas, as {{they reached}} the <b>rocks,</b> and <b>saw</b> in the mingled starlight and dawn, the traces of a rude but plainly marked foot-path leading up among them; [...] "this is one of our old hunting-dens. Come up!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi wanted Bill Pullman for {{the lead}} {{character}} of Harry. [...] "When we started casting, I knew right away that Bill was our man to play Harry ... He's an absolute natural for the part—intelligent, wry, and charmingly good looking." [...] Producer Kerry <b>Rock</b> <b>saw</b> Bill in more practical terms: [...] "Bill was {{the cornerstone of the}} casting process. We needed someone the right age, who was enough of a name, who could do the humor as well as being scary and believably violent at the tough spots of the story." [...] Co-star Bruno Kirby also found Bill to be the perfect match: [...] "The great thing about Bill is that he looks very straight, but if you look him in the eye, there's a real crazy sense of humor there." ...|$|E
50|$|Mord Roberts {{came to the}} Baring Cross area in 1893. He was {{a master}} {{mechanic}} for the Iron Mountain Railway Company, brought in {{to work at the}} maintenance shop in Baring Cross. Baring Cross was a small area west of the small city of Argenta and north of the Baring Cross Bridge, which is how the area got its name, and across the Arkansas River from Little Rock, Arkansas. It got started up as a Railroad town, most of its population working for the Iron Mountain Railway Company. In the early 1890s the leaders in Little <b>Rock</b> <b>saw</b> an opportunity to expand it influence and economic bases across the river and annexed the town of Argenta in 1890. With the fear of Little Rock also annexing them, forty-four residents petitioned for the area to be incorporated into a city. On April 8, 1896 the Arkansas Secretary of State approved the incorporation of the city.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2015, Wedding Cake <b>Rock</b> <b>saw</b> {{a sudden}} spike in popularity. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) {{reported}} {{the number of}} visitors per month on the Royal National Park Coast Track had sharply risen from the average of 2,000 per month to over 10,000. The social media photo sharing service Instagram has been cited as the cause for the growth in patronage, with users going to the landmark to take pictures on top of it, often while performing a stunt. The spike in popularity became concerning for the NPWS, whose regional manager, Gary Dunnett, questioned, [...] "whether having 30 or 40 people standing on that area has the potential to tip it one way or the other". The site was eventually closed off in May 2015, citing the aforementioned safety concerns, in addition to the rock being vandalised by visitors, who had covered the otherwise perfectly white formation with various writings and drawings in chalk.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{disappearance}} of state censorship after the Romanian Revolution, the Romanian <b>rock</b> scene <b>saw</b> a period of diversification and liberalization. Themes previously considered inappropriate by the authorities could now be explored, and numerous new bands and artists came to prominence.|$|R
