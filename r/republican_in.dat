5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E
5|$|Chuck Baldwin was {{initially}} a Democrat, but changed his party affiliation to <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1980. In the 1970s, he founded Crossroad Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida, which President Ronald Reagan recognized for its growth and influence. As a Republican, Baldwin headed the Florida branch of Moral Majority, which promoted social conservatism. He also hosted {{a radio show}} called Chuck Baldwin Live, which focused on conservative issues. It made its national radio debut on the Genesis Communications Network in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In September 1822, {{shortly before}} his second term as {{governor}} expired, Jennings became a candidate for Congress after William Hendricks resigned his seat to run for Indiana governor. A special election was held on August 5, 1822, to fill Hendricks's vacant seat in Congress. At the same time, the state's increased population gave Indiana three congressional seats. A regular congressional election was held {{on the same day}} to elect three Indiana congressmen. Jennings and Davis Floyd were the principal candidates in the special election, which Jennings won. In the regular election to fill the seat for Indiana's Second Congressional District, Jennings easily won, defeating James Scott by a wide margin. Jennings became a Democratic-Republican to the 17th Congress and Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon succeeded him as governor. Hendricks ran unopposed and was subsequently elected as governor to succeed Boon. Jennings won reelection to Congress and represented Indiana's Second District until in 1830. He became a Jacksonian <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the 18th Congress, but switched his allegiance, becoming an Adams <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the 19th and 20th Congresses, and then aligned with the Anti-Jacksonians in the 21st Congress.|$|E
5|$|In his {{decade in}} Congress, McEwen {{compiled}} a conservative voting record, usually scoring {{in the single}} digits in the annual Americans for Democratic Action ratings and 85% or higher in the American Conservative Union's similar polls, though McEwen was never {{one of the most}} conservative Republicans in the House nor the most conservative <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the Ohio delegation.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{routinely}} {{votes for}} the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations in the Boston metro area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County.

Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins of victory in both the 1980 and 1984 elections.|$|E

5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The {{rise of the}} Conservative Party impelled the Progressives and Historicals to unify—something {{they had}} not been able to achieve while in power. The Progressive-Historical {{coalition}} was rechristened as the Liberal Party (the third bloc bearing this name in Brazil's history). Its most radical wing would declare itself <b>republican</b> <b>in</b> 1870—an ominous signal to the monarchy.|$|E

This allowed them to levy tribute and exercise control over trade on the Missouri.|$|E

5|$|A <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a {{predominantly}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats in his canvasses for public office. His 1879 loss {{in an election}} for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate marked the first in a string of political defeats. He failed in bids to represent Kentucky's Fifth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, 1886, 1888, and 1892. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, 1888, 1892, 1904, 1908, and 1916. In 1897, {{he was a member of}} the executive committee at the national monetary conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he advocated a sound money position.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E
