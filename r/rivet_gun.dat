25|$|In the {{multiplayer}} modes 'Survival of the Fittest', 'Civil War', and 'Turf War', a Big Daddy suit will spawn at {{a random}} {{location in the}} level. The choice {{is given to the}} player who finds this suit to become the Big Daddy, which will give the player greater strength and endurance but prohibits the use of plasmids and hacking, as well as expelling any previously held damage bonuses against other players. The Big Daddy can stomp, shoot a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun,</b> melee attack, and throw proximity mines. All damage dealt to the Big Daddy is permanent, and cannot be replenished. Once the Big Daddy is defeated, the suit disappears and spawns in another location on the map two minutes later. In 'Capture the Sister' one member of the defending team is chosen at random to be the Big Daddy; after the player's death, the Big Daddy suit disappears {{for the rest of the}} round.|$|E
2500|$|BioShock 2 is {{presented}} as a first-person shooter, with the player taking on the role of Subject Delta, a prototype for the Big Daddies 8 years after the events of the first game. As in BioShock, the player explores Rapture and fights off splicers, the remaining psychotic human population of the undersea city, using a combination of the environment, weapons, plasmids, and tonics. Plasmids and tonics are special genetic-reencoding liquids that grant the user active or passive abilities, respectively, and include many of those introduced in BioShock as well as new ones. For example, plasmids can give the player the ability to use telekinesis or to invoke fire, while tonics can improve the player's movement speed, attack damage, or damage resistance. Several of the weapons in BioShock 2 were previously seen carried by Big Daddies in the first game, including a powerful drill and a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun.</b> The player can use each weapon in a close-range melee attack, unlike in the first game, and is able to equip a weapon and a plasmid at the same time, which they can use in quick succession to destroy enemies. For example, the player might freeze a foe using a plasmid then shatter it using a spear gun. If the player is killed, they are revived in the nearest [...] "vita-chamber." ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>rivet</b> <b>gun,</b> {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive rivets. The <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> is used on the manufactured head side of the rivet and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the rivet. The energy from the hammer in the <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> drives the work and the rivet against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the rivet is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the rivet head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all rivet guns are pneumatically powered. Those rivet guns used to drive rivets in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|E

5000|$|Mechanic is a dim-witted, childish brute who employs various {{mechanical}} tools as weaponsnail or <b>rivet</b> <b>guns,</b> throwing circular saw blades, using a large wrench as a bludgeon. Despite his short temper, {{he has a}} soft spot for animals and an engrossing fondness for (in-universe) children's television cartoons. He was voiced by Frank Welker.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rivet</b> <b>guns</b> vary in {{size and}} shape and {{have a variety of}} handles and grips. Pneumatic <b>rivet</b> <b>guns</b> {{typically}} have a regulator which adjusts the amount of air entering the tool. Regulated air entering passes through the throttle valve which is typically controlled by a trigger in the hand grip. When the trigger is squeezed, the throttle valve opens, allowing the pressurized air to flow into the piston. As the piston moves, a port opens allowing the air pressure to escape. The piston strikes against the rivet set. The force on the rivet set pushes the rivet into the work and against the buck. The buck deforms the tail of the rivet. The piston is returned to the original position by a spring or the shifting of a valve allowing air to drive the piston back to the starting position.|$|R
5000|$|Other recent {{cultural}} references {{include a}} Big Daddy enemy type called [...] "Rosie" [...] {{in the video}} game BioShock, armed with a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun.</b> There is a DC Comics character called Rosie The Riveter, who wields a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> as a weapon (first appearing in Green Lantern vol. 2 No. 176 (May 1984)). In the video game Fallout 3 there are billboards featuring [...] "Rosies" [...] assembling atom bombs while drinking Nuka-Cola.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s, two {{pneumatic}} {{devices were}} invented that would permanently {{change the way}} metal and stone were hammered. The pneumatic <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> was originally developed to set hot rivets on girder bridges and high steel buildings. This tool was later scaled down for sheet metal, as the 1930s saw the advent of monocoque aluminum aircraft. The other new device, hitting at twice or three times {{the speed of the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>gun,</b> was the stone carver's hammer - a great blessing for smooth and rapid dressing of granite and marble.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{gunpowder}} or {{smokeless powder}} {{was used in}} <b>rivet</b> <b>guns,</b> stun guns for animals, cable splicers and other industrial construction tools. The [...] "stud gun" [...] drove nails or screws into solid concrete, a function not possible with hydraulic tools. See powder-actuated tool. Shotguns {{have been used to}} eliminate persistent material rings in operating rotary kilns (such as those for cement, lime, phosphate, etc.) and clinker in operating furnaces, and commercial tools make the method more reliable.|$|R
50|$|This gun is {{different}} from the above <b>rivet</b> <b>guns</b> in that the air pressure is used to provide a squeezing action that compresses the rivet from both sides rather than distinct blows. The squeeze riveter can only be used close to the edge because of the limited depth of the anvil. Once properly adjusted, the squeeze riveter will produce very uniform rivet bucks. The stationary (fixed) jaw is placed against the head and the buck is compressed by the action of the gun.|$|R
50|$|The corner riveter is {{a compact}} <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> {{that can be}} used in close spaces. The rivet is driven at right-angles to handle by a very short barreled driver.|$|E
50|$|Rivets {{small enough}} and soft enough are often bucked. In this process the {{installer}} places a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> against the factory head and holds a bucking bar against the tail or a hard working surface. The bucking bar is a specially shaped solid block of metal. The <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> provides {{a series of}} high-impulse forces that upsets and work hardens {{the tail of the}} rivet between the work and the inertia of the bucking bar. Rivets that are large or hard may be more easily installed by squeezing instead. In this process a tool in contact with each end of the rivet clinches to deform the rivet.|$|E
50|$|By World War II, rivet {{guns were}} used widely in U.S. {{aircraft}} factories both for riveting aluminum sheets, and for flow forming, {{the process of}} working aluminum sheet into and over wooden forms by {{the application of the}} pneumatic <b>rivet</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E

5000|$|John Henry Irons has {{appeared}} in Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by Michael Dorn. John Henry Irons is a designer for LexCorp who works to create a prototype suit of powered armor for the Metropolis SCU, but the suit's neural interface system had adverse psychological effects on its user Sgt. Corey Mills. Encouraged by Superman, Irons worked to perfect the suit {{with the help of}} his niece Natasha, becoming the superhero Steel just in time to help Superman in a battle against Metallo. The animated Steel is missing the cape he adapted from Superman after he saved John's life in Superman: The Man of Steel #19, and lacks his 'S' shield (although he does wear a jersey with a 5 on the front, a possible homage). In his premiere episode [...] "Heavy Metal", his <b>rivet</b> <b>guns</b> were replaced with forearm-mounted lasers.|$|R
5000|$|The skills {{women had}} {{acquired}} through their daily chores {{proved to be}} very useful in helping them acquire new skill sets towards the war effort. Since men that usually did certain jobs were out at war, women tried to replace them. For example, the pop culture phenomenon of [...] "Rosie the Riveter" [...] made riveting {{one of the most}} widely known jobs. Experts speculate women were so successful at riveting because it so closely resembled sewing (assembling and seaming together a garment). However, riveting was only one of many jobs that women were learning and mastering as the aviation industry was developing. As Glenn Martin, a co-founder of Martin Marietta, told a reporter: “we have women helping design our planes in the Engineering Departments, building them on the production line, and operating almost every conceivable type of machinery, from <b>rivet</b> <b>guns</b> to giant stamp presses”.|$|R
50|$|The slow-hitting gun strikes {{multiple}} blows {{as long as}} {{the trigger}} is held down. The repetition rate is about 2,500 blows-per-minute (bpm). It is easier to control than a one-hit gun. This is probably {{the most common type of}} <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> in use.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{claims that}} the {{aircraft}} kit can be assembled using [...] "normal hand tools consisting of hacksaw, hand drill, file, pop <b>rivet</b> <b>gun,</b> wrenches, and hand nico press tool.

5000|$|Two {{versions}} of the Big Daddy are present in BioShock: the 'Rosie' and the 'Bouncer'. Initial drafts of the Rosie model featured it encased in a light atmospheric diving suit with a singular hole for viewing through the helmet, as well as missing its left forearm and hand, replaced with a hook and pulley supported by cables attached to the stump. Later designs restored the arm, adding a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun,</b> heavy oxygen tanks mounted on both shoulders and a squid-like tentacle extending from each shoulder. The completed design remained similar, removing the tentacles and reducing the oxygen tanks to a singular one positioned on its back, angled towards its right shoulder. The Rosie's <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> itself went through progressive design improvements, {{with the intent of}} making it [...] "more fleshed out and threatening".|$|E
40|$|Riveting {{tasks in}} {{aircraft}} manufacturing results in exposure to vibration from both <b>rivet</b> <b>guns</b> and bucking bars. Long term exposure to vibration {{has been associated}} with symptoms of vibration white finger and musculoskeletal disorders. Four different bucking bars of the same shape but different material and mass characteristics (90 % tungsten,> 90 % tungsten, cold rolled and stainless steel) were investigated for vibration and grip muscle activity during a riveting task. The> 90 % and 90 % tungsten bars (3. 4 m/s 2 and 3. 6 m/s 2, respectively) resulted in significantly less mean resultant weighted acceleration when compared to the cold rolled and stainless steel (5. 3 m/s 2 and 5. 6 m/s 2, respectively), whereas {{there was no difference in}} mean hand grip flexor or extensor muscle activity. These results suggest that for bucking tasks that allow access for the bucking bar size investigated, use of heavier but same sized tungsten bucking bars can reduce vibration transmission to the hand...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge is}} held {{together}} by six million Australian-made hand-driven rivets supplied by the McPherson company of Melbourne, the last being driven through the deck on 21 January 1932. The rivets were heated red-hot and inserted into the plates; the headless end was immediately rounded over with a large pneumatic <b>rivet</b> <b>gun.</b> The largest of the rivets used weighed 3.5 kg and was 39.5 cm long. The practice of riveting large steel structures, rather than welding, was, at the time, a proven and understood construction technique, whilst structural welding had not at that stage been adequately developed for use on the bridge.|$|E
50|$|Torbjörn, {{full name}} Torbjörn Lindholm, is a dwarfish Swedish {{engineer}} and weapons designer, and {{a founding member}} of Overwatch. His armor comes equipped with a mobile forge, and he carries a <b>Rivet</b> <b>Gun</b> that shoots molten slag and a Forge Hammer for construction and melee attacks. He can Build Turrets that can be upgraded, and also provides Armor Packs to his teammates to give a boost to their health. His ultimate ability is Molten Core, which overheats his personal forge, upgrading his turret, granting a speed bonus to turret construction and repair, as well as a damage and defense bonus.|$|E
50|$|Solid rivets {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Solid rivets consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or <b>rivet</b> <b>gun.</b> A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of rivet. This tool is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A rivet compression tool does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid rivets.|$|E

5000|$|The Bench weapon upgrade {{system from}} Dead Space and Dead Space 2 has been {{redesigned}} {{as a new}} upgrading system called the [...] "Weapon Bench". Here, players are able to construct new weapons from parts gathered throughout the game. The bench provides two main frames to start with—a light one-hand frame and a heavy two-hand frame—and players can build new weapons and put two weapons together (for example, a plasma cutter and a flamethrower). Examples of weapon functions include an electric <b>rivet</b> <b>gun</b> and an incendiary buzzsaw launcher. If a player {{does not want to}} build a weapon from scratch, they can choose from ready-made blueprints, including classic Dead Space and Dead Space 2 weapons. Built weapons can also be shared in co-op mode.|$|E
50|$|A Big Daddy is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BioShock series of video games. Big Daddies are heavily spliced (genetically mutated and altered with ADAM) human beings who have had their bodies directly grafted into heavily armored, steampunk-inspired atmospheric diving suits. They are armed with a <b>rivet</b> <b>gun,</b> heavy drill, rocket launcher, or ion laser. Alpha series Big Daddies are equipped with any of several other weapons as well. Though they make low-pitched groaning noises similar to whales, Big Daddies have no voice actor attributed to them. Designed by Irrational Games (then {{under the supervision of}} 2K Boston/2K Australia), they first appeared in BioShock and were promoted heavily. A six-inch Big Daddy action figure was included in the limited edition version of the title. In its sequel, BioShock 2, the player controls a prototype Big Daddy.|$|E
5000|$|The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review {{described}} the Big Daddy as [...] "a freight train of a man-turned-monster", noting the moral dilemma {{of attempting to}} fight it or not.
