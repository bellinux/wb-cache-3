3000|$|In general, {{people tend}} to imagine {{positive}} outcomes for their plans, overwhelmingly ignoring possible negative scenarios in favor of wishful thinking (Newby-Clark et al. 2000). In a project planning context, this tendency implies that project managers mostly work {{under the assumption that}} all their projects will succeed (Raz et al. 2002), with the apparent belief that project <b>risks</b> will not <b>occur</b> or will have little impact on the project’s success. An overconfident project manager is overly certain that his or her predictions are correct (Moore and Healy 2008) and thus will consider it unlikely that reality will deviate from her or his plans. Overconfident decision makers underestimate the variance of the result they are trying to predict (Moore and Healy 2008). Therefore, an overconfident individual will likely only generate a single or a very limited number of scenarios when assessing uncertain future developments and will typically focus on how objectives will be accomplished successfully (Newby-Clark et al. 2000). This implies that scenarios which contain the occurrence of risks will not be readily available in project managers’ minds. Van Zant and Moore (2013) refer to such low availability when they state that overconfidence can blind people {{to the size of the}} risks they are taking. According to the availability heuristic (Schwarz et al. 1991; Tversky and Kahneman 1973), a low availability of incidents in which <b>risks</b> <b>occurred</b> will lead <b>to</b> lower estimated risk occurrence probabilities (Sjöberg and Engelberg 2010) and may cause risks to be perceived as less threatening (Pachur et al. 2012). We propose that overconfidence is linked to low availability of incidents in which <b>risks</b> <b>occur,</b> leading <b>to</b> lower <b>risk</b> awareness.

The route of exposure was selected to be ingestion (drinking) of river water by local villagers who live downstream of the Mae Chang River from the plant to where the River meets the Wang River. The assessment processes consisted of data collection, data evaluation, exposure assessment, toxicity assessment, and risk characterization. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (GFAAS) {{was used to measure}} the concentrations of total inorganic arsenic in water samples. lnternational standards, databases, and procedures established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) were applied, together with local parameters. The result of the human health risk assessment associated with arsenic in fly ash showed that all estimated risks were within acceptable ranges, however it is noted that the maximum cancer risk and the maximum non-cancer <b>risk</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> the same group of the population, namely, Hua Sua village babies, age 0 - l, who daily consumed relatively large amounts of water. To lower such risks, either arsenic concentration in water has to be lowered by better plant's treatment, or the consumption rate has to be reduced by drinking from alternative sources ofwater, or both. One factor, influencing the overall risks, which can be obtained from the results of the study, was the distance along the Mae Chang River away from the plant; the greater the distance, the lower the arsenic concentration, and thus lower exposure and lesser risks...|$|R

The identification of these high risk individuals helps in the clinical management in the follow up of this illness. It is now certain that some patients with ulcerative colitis are more liable to develop a large bowel cancer than a normal person. It is therefore import-ant to establish in which patients the <b>risk</b> <b>occurs</b> and <b>to</b> try and determine its magnitude. When large numbers of colitics with disease of varying extent and widely different duration of symptoms are consider-ed the development of cancer is uncommon. In three big series the incidence lay between 3 and 4 % (Slaney and Brooke; 1959, Nefzger and Acheson, 1963; Edwards and Truelove, 1964). It has been calculated by comparing death rates that in large series the cancer incidence is between seven and eleven times that to be expected in a matched general population (Goldgraber, Humphreys, Kirs-ner, and Palmer, 1958; de Dombal, Watts, Watkin-son, and Goligher, 1966).

40|$|A {{total of}} 58, 885 spring-born calves {{entering}} a large commercial feedlot in southwestern Alberta were studied {{to examine the}} associations between shipping fever mortality and the pattern of calf sales at the auction markets, time of year, and weather. The observational study followed calves purchased from 42 auction markets in the 4 western provinces between September 1 and December 31 {{in each of the}} years from 1985 to 1988. Calf sales at the auction markets consistently peaked during the last week of October and the first week of November. Calves entering the feedlot in November had a risk of fatal shipping fever 2 to 8 times greater than calves entering in September or December. The pattern was the same for all 4 years, with maximum <b>risk</b> <b>occurring</b> 2 <b>to</b> 4 weeks after the peak time for calf sales at the markets. A number of factors could have contributed to this pattern, including changes in transport truck availability, changes in the density of calves at the markets, changes in population dynamics at the feedlot that affected feedlot crew efficiency, and weather. The finding that the risk of fatal shipping fever appears to increase significantly as the feedlot fills with calves in the fall deserves the attention of feedlot owners, so they can design their treatment strategies appropriately, and of researchers, who may gain useful knowledge about the natural history of the disease by investigating why this change in <b>risk</b> <b>occurs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most risk {{analysis}} tools and techniques require {{the user to}} enter {{a good deal of}} information before they can provide useful diagnoses. In this paper, we describe an approach to enable the user to obtain a COTS glue code integration {{risk analysis}} with no inputs other than the set of glue code cost drivers the user submits to get a glue code integration effort estimate with the COnstructive COTS integration cost estimation (COCOTS) tool. The risk assessment approach is built on a knowledge base with 24 risk identification rules and a 3 -level risk probability weighting scheme obtained from an expert Delphi analysis. Each risk rule is defined as one critical combination of two COCOTS cost drivers that may cause certain undesired outcome if they are both rated at their worst case ratings. The 3 -level nonlinear risk weighting scheme represents the relative probability of <b>risk</b> <b>occurring</b> with respect <b>to</b> the individual cost driver ratings from the input. Further, to determine the relative risk impact, we use the productivity range of each cost driver in the risky combination to reflect the cost consequence of <b>risk</b> <b>occurring.</b> We also develop a prototype called COCOTS Risk Analyzer to automate our risk assessment method. The evaluation of our approach shows that it has done an effective job of estimating the relative risk levels of both small USC eservices and large industry COTS-based applications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrently, flood risk can be {{considered}} as the most serious threat, mainly in areas and countries where hardly any other natural <b>risks</b> <b>occur.</b> In order <b>to</b> analyze this kind of natural disaster, it is necessary to examine the long-term development of its occurrence around the world as well as its financial and other consequences. The main objective of the research was to apply Poisson regression on flood occurrence as the dependent variable. The set of explanatory variables under consideration was tested and subsequently the final model was determined. Poisson regression model, which is a generalized linear model, was chosen as a computing model. Using it guarantees consistent results when working with variables with non-normal data distribution (skewed and discrete). Thus OLS estimator cannot work and is replaced by MLE estimator. Consequently, confidence intervals of estimated parameters and all model results can be received. The research resulted in selecting the Poisson regression model with an estimated and significant parameter.

Method: qualitative research with theoretical saturation through analysis of the ninth nondirected interview of elderly who underwent such experience.

Results: three categories emerged (sub-processes) : evaluating signs and symptoms of fracture after the fall; feeling sad and insecure with the new condition; and finding oneself susceptible to fractures. From realignment of these categories (sub-processes) we could abstract the central category (process), recognizing oneself as vulnerable to falls in the concreteness of the fracture. Conclusion: the theoretical model considering the Symbolic Interactionism signals the implementation of continued program for fall prevention, with teaching strategies that encourage the elderly to reflect on the concreteness of contexts in which there is <b>risk</b> of <b>occurring</b> injury <b>to</b> their health...|$|R
