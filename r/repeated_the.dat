5|$|While in prison, George Orsborne lent {{his name}} to a ghost-written account of the Girl Pat adventure, which <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> claim that the vessel had been sent out inadequately {{equipped}} and provisioned. Marstrand's successfully sued the publishers, Hutchinsons, and two newspapers which had <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> details. On his release, Orsborne planned to make a single-handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat, but the trip was delayed, and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939. Likewise, nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon.|$|E

5|$|At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, {{football}} {{became an}} official competition.

Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.|$|E
5|$|In 1868–1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stübel {{were the}} first to attempt to climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and Augusto Gansser-Biaggi made the first {{successful}} ascent, partly by ski; they <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> ascent in 1939.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} behind SBMA {{is caused}} by expansion of a CAG <b>repeat</b> in <b>the</b> first exon of the androgen receptor gene (trinucleotide <b>repeats).</b> <b>The</b> CAG <b>repeat</b> encodes a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein. The greater the expansion of <b>the</b> CAG <b>repeat,</b> <b>the</b> earlier the disease onset and more severe the disease manifestations. <b>The</b> <b>repeat</b> expansion likely causes a toxic gain of function in the receptor protein, since loss of receptor function in androgen insensitivity syndrome does not cause motor neuron degeneration.|$|R

5|$|Returning {{once again}} to Scotland in 1909, Ross was {{recalled}} to the Scottish XV, playing against Wales on 6 February, and against Ireland on 27 February.

5|$|The Dubna team <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> {{experiment}} in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced {{after some time}} when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.|$|E
5|$|The European Cup was an {{association}} football competition contested from 1956 to 1992.

English clubs and managers dominated the competition in the late 1970s and early 1980s, winning every tournament from 1977 to 1982. Despite this, Italian managers {{have been the most}} successful, winning eleven of the tournaments since 1956.|$|E
