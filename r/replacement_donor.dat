40|$|Replacement {{donors are}} more likely than {{volunteer}} donors to have positive or abnormal tests for transfusion-transmissible disease. In an effort to increase the donor pool, workers sought to identify a safer replacement-donor subgroup that may be acceptable for routine donations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a retrospective review and cohort study, the replacement-donor effect was separated from the new-donor effect. The relative effect the <b>replacement</b> <b>donor</b> has on the risk of transfusion-transmissible diseases, donor retention, and frequency of returning donations was then quantified by comparison against the effect of repeat volunteer donors. RESULTS: The <b>replacement</b> <b>donor</b> had 3. 1 times the risk and 0. 72 times the donor retention rate and made 0. 81 times as many returning donations as the repeat volunteer donor. The figures for the new-donor effect were similar. The two risks were additive, making a new <b>replacement</b> <b>donor</b> particularly hazardous. If replacement donations only from repeat replacement donors were considered, the donor risk and the number of donations per returning donor were made comparable to those for the general (combined) volunteer donor. CONCLUSION: The negative effect of the <b>replacement</b> <b>donor</b> is similar in magnitude to that of the new volunteer donor. A replacement-donation program targeting repeat replacement donors has an acceptable risk profile and may be a valuable adjunct to the collection of blood from general volunteer donors...|$|E

To examine potential strategies to improve HBV blood safety, 404 <b>replacement</b> <b>donor</b> samples previously screened for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) were tested for antibody to HBV core (anti-HBc), anti-surface antigen (anti-HBs), and HBV DNA. Of 145 anti-HBc-containing samples (36 %) identified, 16 retested were HBsAg positive (11 %). Anti-HBs was detected in 43 / 77 (56 %) anti-HBc-reactive samples. Six samples were HBsAg−/anti-HBc+/anti-HBs+ and contained HBV DNA, meeting the definition of occult HBV infection (OBI). OBIs had low HBV DNA loads (< 10 IU/ml) and were genotype B (n = 1) or genotype D (n = 5).

40|$|Background : Safe {{blood is}} a {{critical}} component in improving health care and in preventing the spread of infectious disease. But the quality and {{safety of blood transfusion}} is still a concern for health-care personnel’s. We analyzed the sero-prevalence and changing trends of transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) among blood donors in a tertiary care hospital. Objectives : This retrospective study aimed to analyze the percentage of voluntary and replacement blood donors and to know the sero-prevalence and changing trends of TTIs among blood donors in a tertiary care hospital. Methods : Blood donations collected over a 6 -year period were studied for the type of donation (voluntary or replacement), number of seroreactive cases. Samples were screened for anti HIV 1 & 2, HBsAg, anti HCV, syphilis and malaria. All reactive samples were retested before being labeled as seropositive. Results : Of the 187575 donors, 134391 (71. 6 %) were replacement and 53184 (28. 4 %) voluntary donors. Of all the blood donors there were 8577 (4. 57 %) seroreactive cases which included 492 (0. 26 %) of anti HIV 1 & 2, 1937 (1. 03 %) of HBsAg, 2867 (1. 53 %) of anti HCV, 3270 (1. 74 %) of syphilis and 11 (0. 006 %) of malaria.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the {{trends in the}} profile of blood donors from 1995 through 2001 at a large blood center {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Brazil, particularly following the initiation in 1998 of marketing strategies aimed at substituting <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> with altruistic repeat donors. METHODS: Using an information system that had been established at the Pro-Blood Foundation/Blood Center of São Paulo (Fundação Pró-Sangue/Hemocentro de São Paulo) in 1994, we collected information on sex, age, and type of donation for the years 1995 - 2001. We classified blood <b>donors</b> as either <b>replacement</b> blood <b>donors</b> (if they stated that the reason for donating was that they had a friend or relative in the hospital) or as altruistic donors. First-time blood donors were those who had not donated in our institution since the establishment of the information system. RESULTS: The percentage of repeat altruistic blood donors increased over time as first-time <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> declined for both genders. The proportion of altruistic donors climbed from 20 % of all blood donors in 1995 to 57 % in 2001. In 2001, first-time blood donors represented only 52 % of all donors, as contrasted to 88 % in 1995. Female donors increased from 20 % to 37 % of the donors over the period studied.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundBlood safety {{remains an}} issue of major concern in {{transfusion}} medicine in sub-Saharan Africa. Blood-borne agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Treponema pallidum are among the greatest threats to blood safety for the recipient. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors of HIV, HCV, HBV, and syphilis infections among first-time blood donors at the new hospital-based blood bank in Edéa, Cameroon. MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of blood donor data recorded between December 2011 and May 2012 at the blood bank of the Edéa Regional Hospital. Antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were screened with the Determine and ImmunoComb tests. Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to HCV were detected using DIASpot test strips. Syphilis was diagnosed using the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA). ResultsA total of 543 blood donors were included, among whom 349 (64. 3 %) were family <b>replacement</b> <b>donors.</b> One hundred and fifteen donors (21. 2 %) were infected {{with at least one}} pathogen. The overall seroprevalence rates of HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis were 4. 1 %, 10. 1 %, 4. 8 %, and 5. 7 %, respectively. We found a total of 26 dual infections. The most common combinations were HBV–HCV and HBV–HIV. There was a significant association between HIV and HBV infections (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3. 46, 95 % CI 1. 29 – 9. 39; p= 0. 014), and between HBV and HCV infections (aOR 2. 81, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 10. 12; p= 0. 036). Compared to voluntary <b>donors,</b> family <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> were significantly more infected by at least one screened pathogen (aOR 1. 81, 95 % CI 1. 14 – 2. 88; p= 0. 013), and more infected specifically by HIV (aOR 3. 66, 95 % CI 1. 07 – 12. 55; p= 0. 039) and syphilis (aOR 2. 81, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 7. 46; p= 0. 039). ConclusionsOur findings indicate that blood safety remains a major problem in Cameroon where hospital-based blood banks and family <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> are predominant. There is an urgent need for a national blood transfusion program in Cameroon that will establish a nationally coordinated blood transfusion service based on the principles of voluntary regular non-remunerated blood donation...|$|R
40|$|Context: One of {{the major}} adverse effects of blood {{transfusion}} is transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs). Serological testing can help to reduce, but not eliminate occurrences of TTIs. Study of TTIs in different blood donor groups help to find safe blood for patients. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence and trends in TTIs in voluntary and <b>replacement</b> blood <b>donors.</b> Settings and Design: Voluntary and <b>replacement</b> blood <b>donors</b> were studied for TTIs over the duration of 7 years. TTIs were documented with particulates like gender and type of donation (voluntary or replacement). Materials and Methods: Blood donation taken after predonation examination. Tests for TTIs carried out from donated blood and results were documented. Statistical Analysis Used: Data entered into Microsoft Excel sheets and studied for prevalence, trend, and odds ratio. Results: Total blood units taken during the period from 2007 to 2013 were 15, 368. 93. 1 % were male donors and 6. 9 % were female donors. Prevalence of TTIs was 0. 72 %. Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, and syphilis were detected in 0. 14 %, 0. 38 %, 0. 06 %, and 0. 14 % of donors, respectively. No female donors had TTI. TTIs in voluntary <b>donors</b> (VDs) and <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> were 0. 64 % and 1. 15 %. Conclusions: Outcome of the study shows increasing trend for total blood donation, voluntary donations, and female blood donors. All TTIs were reducing except syphilis. To provide safe blood to patients, blood donation from VDs and female donors should be encouraged...|$|R
40|$|Donations in Greece are {{insufficient}} {{to cover the}} high transfusion needs arising from large numbers of thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia patients and the implementation of new surgical techniques. Efforts to achieve self-sufficiency, and to render blood supplies safer and manageable must focus on recruiting and retaining more volunteer donors and on converting the large pool of <b>replacement</b> <b>donors.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to gain insight into public perception regarding the risks of donation and transfusion and to identify the factors that would motivate more people in Greece to regularly donate blood. Questionnaires were distributed to 1600 donors at the blood bank and visitors to hospitals at 11 locations across the country. Data on demographics, donation behaviour, incentives, risk perception and attitudes towards donation and transfusion were analysed separately for volunteer and <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> and non-donors. The results showed that women and young people donate the least in Greece. Also, many donors do not donate because they are not reminded to. A small percentage of donors confessed to having concealed part of the truth to background questions. Overall, incentives to donate were considered important and included future availability of blood for self or family, paid leave from work and free blood tests. Recruitment and retention efforts should include better communication with current donors, and raising awareness among eligible donors. Staff should be educated in soliciting information from potential donors, and incentives should be better aligned to avoid conflict with ethical values and ensure honesty in the prescreening process...|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{percentage}} of HIV cases attributable to blood transfusion has decreased {{significantly in the}} last decade. The newer 4 th generation Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{has been shown to}} have increased sensitivity compared to 3 rd generation ELISA. Objectives : To estimate the seroprevalence of HIV among blood donors using 4 th generation ELISA assay and to compare it with the 3 rd generation ELISA. Materials and Methods : This prospective study involved 10, 200 blood donors- 6, 800 were voluntary donors (3400 -students and 3400 -non students) and 3400 were <b>replacement</b> <b>donors.</b> All blood units were tested with 3 rd as well as 4 th generation ELISA. All samples found reactive or in grey zone with either 3 rd or 4 th generation ELISA were retested by Western blot (WB). Results : The seroprevalence of HIV was estimated to be 1. 37 / 1000 donations (0. 14 %) with 3 rd generation ELISA compared to 3. 62 / 1000 donations (0. 36 %) with 4 th generation ELISA (p> 0. 05). The seroprevalence of HIV among voluntary donors was estimated to be 1. 32 / 1000 donations (0. 13 %) with 3 rd generation ELISA and 3. 67 / 1000 donations (0. 36 %) with 4 th generation ELISA. The prevalence of HIV among <b>replacement</b> <b>donors</b> was 1. 47 / 1000 donations (0. 15 %) with 3 rd generation ELISA and 3. 52 / 1000 donations (0. 35 %) with 4 th generation ELISA. Conclusion : 4 th generation HIV ELISA detects a higher number of seroreactive donors compared to 3 rd generation ELISA. However, larger studies are required with confirmatory tests for both 3 rd and 4 th generation ELISA for making any policy changes...|$|R

40|$|Background Iron {{deficiency}} {{represents a}} risk to donor health and the blood supply. Efficacy trials indicate that post-donation iron-replacement improves iron stores {{but they do not}} account for complexities of implementation in the routine collection context. We therefore conducted two prospective feasibility studies in Australian donor centers. Study Design and Methods In both studies we recruited female donors between 18 and 45 who had made at least one donation in the previous 12 months. In READ (<b>REplacement</b> ADvice), female <b>donors</b> were given a recommendation to self-procure post-donation iron. In DIRECT (<b>Donor</b> Iron <b>REplaCemenT),</b> <b>donors</b> were provided with a course of iron supplements. Donors could return to donate at their discretion and were surveyed following the recruitment visit and again {{towards the end of the}} 13 -month follow-up. Donor uptake, adverse effects, effectiveness in maintaining iron stores and workflow impact were assessed. Results We recruited 1404 (70. 9 % of invited) donors to READ and 768 (53. 2 % of invited) to DIRECT. READ and DIRECT extended pre-donation interviews by 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Among participants, 44 % and 88 % took iron in READ and DIRECT respectively. Adverse effects were common but usually mild. READ failed to maintain iron stores in the population, but was effective in donors who consumed > 75 % of the recommended dose. DIRECT was effective in preventing declines in ferritin concentration. Conclusion Trade-offs between cost, complexity, uptake and effectiveness must be considered in the implementation of post-donation iron supplementation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Blood {{mobilization}} {{and collection}} agencies worldwide are challenged with blood donor recruitment and retention. When {{the demand for}} blood exceeds collection, there is inadequacy of supply and safety of the blood is also compromised. This challenge varies in severity between developed and developing countries. The median blood donation rates per 1000 population are 36. 4 in high-income countries, 11. 6 in middle-income countries and 2. 8 in low-income countries. The World Health organization (WHO) African Regional Strategy, adopted in 2001, focuses on recruitment of low risk regular voluntary donors. But, even though blood from Voluntary Non-Remunerated Blood Donors (VNRBD) is safer than Family <b>Replacement</b> <b>Donors</b> (FRD), {{there is evidence that}} blood from first time VNRBD is not safer than FRD, and that only repeat donations provide improved blood safety. Therefore in developing models to increase repeat blood donations from existing donors, {{it is important to understand}} what will encourage the first time donor, whether VNRBD or FRD, to donate again, and the repeat donor to continue donating...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In Brazil {{little is}} known about adverse {{reactions}} during donation and the donor characteristics that may be associated with such events. Donors are offered snacks and fluids before donating and are required to consume a light meal after donation. For these reasons the frequency of reactions may be different than those observed in other countries. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of eligible whole blood donors at three large blood centers located in Brazil between July 2007 and December 2009. Vasovagal reactions (VVRs) along with donor demographic and biometric data were collected. Reactions were defined as any presyncopal or syncopal event during the donation process. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of VVRs. RESULTS: Of 724, 861 donor presentations, 16, 129 (2. 2 %) VVRs were recorded. Rates varied substantially between the three centers: 53, 290, and 381 per 10, 000 donations in Recife, Sao Paulo, and Belo Horizonte, respectively. Although the reaction rates varied, the donor characteristics associated with VVRs were similar (younger age [18 - 29 years], <b>replacement</b> <b>donors,</b> first-time donors, low estimated blood volume [EBV]). In multivariable analysis controlling for differences between the donor populations in each city younger age, first-time donor status, and lower EBV were the factors most associated with reactions. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with VVRs in other locations are also evident in Brazil. The difference in VVR rates between the three centers might be due to different procedures for identifying and reporting the reactions. Potential interventions {{to reduce the risk of}} reactions in Brazil should be considered...|$|R
