50|$|On one {{occasion}} he Frampton made a match with Sir William Strickland, a Yorkshire baronet. Frampton managed {{to arrange a}} private trial, and covertly put 7 lbs. overweight on his horse for it; which was just beaten. In the race itself Frampton's horse was again beaten. Frampton's own losses must have been large; but wider interest was excited by the match, which was looked upon as a struggle {{between the north and}} south of England. Several estates changed hands after the event, and many gentlemen were ruined. James Christie Whyte's History of British Turf attributes to the scale of these losses the passing of the Act of Parliament forbidding the legal <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> any <b>sum</b> <b>due</b> for bets above £10.|$|R

(2) In view of the experience of closing the operational programmes and Cohesion Fund projects of the 2000 - 2006 programming period, the guidelines should propose simplified procedures aiming to avoid the bottlenecks identified during the closure of the previous period. (3) The purpose of the guidelines is to facilitate the closure process by providing the methodological framework under which the closure exercise should take place for the financial settlement of outstanding Union's budgetary commitments through payment of the final balance, <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>sums</b> unduly paid and/or decommitment of any final balance.

However, on two occasions in August 1876 the Contractor on their own account carried passengers informally on the incomplete line; this action scandalised the Company and the Contractor was warned not to repeat the arrangement. Early in 1877 it emerged that a further £19,000 was required to complete the line and to settle claims from Budd & Holt; the Company planned to go to Parliament for supplementary powers to raise the money, but were persuaded to obtain the funding by local loans instead. Nonetheless Budd & Holt must have decided to have done with the scheme and {{made it clear that}} they would only continue work on new terms. At a special shareholders' meeting on 25 April 1877 the majority of shareholders agreed to sell their shares at a loss to the GWR, on the basis that the larger company would then complete the work. A minority of shareholders refused, preventing an outright sale, but the GWR now had the controlling majority. Budd & Holt's contract was terminated by mutual consent in June 1877 and the GWR proceeded to complete the line. The remaining work was chiefly ballasting and a contract was let to George Drew of Chalford.|$|R
