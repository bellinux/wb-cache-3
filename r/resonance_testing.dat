The maximum vibration amplitude at each vibration mode shape is a clue to find the resonance frequencies. The dynamic elastic constant of test material can be easily estimated from vibration of a beam equation using the measured resonance frequencies.

The amount of test time required to obtain the system's frequency response characteristics is reduced by subjecting the structure to an entire range of frequencies within one test pattern, or "sweep", instead of repeating individual tests at a number of different frequencies. The "sweep-rate" is defined as {{the rate at which the}} frequency increases or decreases during the frequency sweep.

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{analysis is}} the study of the behaviour and dynamic properties of mechanical structures under actuation by harmonic vibration forces. The aim of <b>resonance</b> <b>tests</b> of the structures is the experimental delimitation of frequencies and the modes of resonance vibrations. Vibration analysis, or more precisely experimental vibration analysis, is the field of measuring and analyzing the dynamic response of mechanical structures when excited by a mechanical input. The broadly applied method of research relies on the harmonic actuation of vibrations and the measurement of respective parameters. Examples would include measuring the vibration of an aircraft load bearing structure when it is attached to an electromagnetic force actuator. Current vibration testing systems are composed of actuators set with their control and powering circuits, the vibration measurement transducers (typically accelerometers), an analog-to-digital converter to digitize analog instrumentation signals) and a system host computer to analyze the data and view it.
