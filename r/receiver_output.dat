50|$|A reed's {{resonant}} frequency is a mid-range audible frequency of perhaps 300 Hz. The solenoid {{is driven by}} the output of the radio control receiver, which is an audio tone or tones. If the <b>receiver</b> <b>output</b> contains the appropriate tone for the {{resonant frequency}} of a reed, that reed would be made to vibrate. As the reed vibrates, it touches a contact screw above its free end. These contacts form the output of the decoder. Decoder outputs are generally fed to small relays. These allow a high current load to be controlled, such as the model's propulsion motor. Using a relay also adds a damping time constant to the output, so that the intermittent contact with the reed contact (which is vibrating at the transmitter audible tone frequency) becomes a continuous output signal.|$|E

50|$|When chaos {{synchronization}} is used, a {{basic scheme}} of a communications device (Cuomo and Oppenheim 1993) {{is made by}} two identical chaotic oscillators. One of them is used as the transmitter, and the other as the receiver. They are connected in a configuration where the transmitter drives the receiver {{in such a way}} that identical synchronization of chaos between the two oscillators is achieved. For the purpose of transmission of information, at the transmitter, a message is added as a small perturbation to the chaotic signal that drives the receiver. In this way, the message transmitted is masked by the chaotic signal. When the receiver synchronizes to the transmitter, the message is decoded by a subtraction between the signal sent by transmitter and its copy generated at the receiver by means of the synchronization of chaos mechanism. This works because, whilst the transmitter output contains the chaotic carrier plus the message, the <b>receiver</b> <b>output</b> is made only by a copy of the chaotic carrier without the message.|$|E
50|$|To equip US Army Air Corps planes, the US Army {{adopted in}} 1941 a reduced set of radios from the ARA/ATA range.

Initially, it did not acquire the 3.0 to 4.0 MHz transmitter, nor the 0.52 to 1.5 MHz receiver, but the need to communicate on the common civil airfield frequency of 3.105 MHz plus the anticipated USAAF use of the AN/ARR-1 homing adapter (see below) compelled adding these units to the SCR-274-N. Early Army units were made by Aircraft Radio Corporation, but the vast majority was made by Western Electric, plus a few by Colonial Radio and others.|$|E

In fact, without some a priori knowledge, {{it is not possible to}} uniquely estimate the original source signals. However, one can usually estimate them up to certain indeterminacies.
