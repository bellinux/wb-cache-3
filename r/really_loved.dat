5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You <b>Really</b> <b>Loved</b> Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You <b>Really</b> <b>Loved</b> Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E

As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett returns to their home in Atlanta; realizing that Ashley only ever truly loved Melanie, Scarlett dashes after Rhett to find him preparing to leave for good. She pleads with him, telling him she realizes now that she has loved him all along and that she never <b>really</b> <b>loved</b> Ashley, but Rhett says that with Bonnie's death went any chance of reconciliation. Scarlett begs him to stay but Rhett rebuffs her and walks {{out the door and}} into the early morning fog, leaving her weeping on the staircase and vowing to one day win back his love.|$|E

25|$|In 1819-1820, Droste spent a {{year with}} the Haxthausens at Bökerhof, {{interrupted}} only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped {{to find a cure}} for her health problems. Here she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her step-uncle August. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that some members of the Haxthausen family, led by Annette's step-aunt Anna (who was in fact four years her junior), disapproved of the relationship because Straube was a middle-class Protestant, and they devised a scheme {{to put an end to}} it. While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, they persuaded another young man with literary ambitions, August von Arnswaldt, who came from an upper-class Protestant family, to pretend to pay court to Annette. At first flattered by Arnswaldt's attentions, she gave some indications she was in love with him, before telling him she <b>really</b> <b>loved</b> Straube. By this time it was too late, however, as Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He travelled to Göttingen and told Straube of Annette's behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. She never saw either man again. A few years later, Arnswaldt married Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Droste's hair was found among his possessions. The affair was a catastrophe for Droste and damaged her future marriage prospects. Shocked by the role the Haxthausens had played in the intrigue, she refused to visit Bökerhof for the next 18 years.|$|E

500|$|... "Amy's Choice" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Nye, {{who is known for}} writing the sitcom Men Behaving Badly.

Nye admitted to restraining himself in the change from comedy to science fiction, but said it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "hugely liberating". Showrunner Steven Moffat originally gave Nye the premise of the episode for it to fit in the series arc, which was to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship. Nye states that Rory's [...] "death" [...] scene is essentially where Amy realises her feelings for Rory. Nye wanted to prove that Amy <b>really</b> <b>loved</b> Rory, and he was [...] "not just a cypher boyfriend or fiancé".|$|E

[...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous.

500|$|Musically, Stripped is a pop and R album which {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} many different genres, including soul, metal, hip hop, rock, rock and roll, gospel and Latin. The album broke her teen pop root in the self-titled debut album in 1999. According to Aguilera, {{she wanted to be}} [...] "real" [...] in her next records because she was [...] "overworked" [...] at the time she was [...] "a part of the big craze pop phenomenon". Multiple critics criticized its musical style, calling it a lack of musical concentration. On Stripped, Aguilera became the writer of most of the songs. She also revealed that Perry's songwriting on Pink's album Missundaztood (2001) inspired Aguilera a lot. She further commented, [...] "I wasn't a big fan of the Dallas Austin songs, but I really, <b>really</b> <b>loved</b> the Linda Perry song".|$|E

Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I might add that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa".

Wendy Richard commented, [...] "It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man.
