40|$|Modern {{high-end}} machines feature multiple processor packages, each {{of which}} contains multiple independent cores and integrated memory controllers connected directly to dedicated physical RAM. These packages are connected via a shared bus, creating a system with a heterogeneous memory hierarchy. Since this shared bus has less bandwidth {{than the sum of}} the links to memory, aggregate memory bandwidth is higher when parallel threads all access memory local to their processor package than when they access memory attached to a <b>remote</b> <b>package.</b> But, the impact of this heterogeneous memory architecture is not easily understood from vendor benchmarks. Even where these measurements are available, they provide only best-case memory throughput.

40|$|In climate science, teleconnection {{analysis}} {{has a long}} standing history {{as a means for}} describing regions that exhibit above average capability of explaining variance over time within a certain spatial domain (e. g., global). The most prominent example of a global coupled ocean-atmosphere teleconnection is the El Nin ?o Southern Oscillation. There are numerous signal decomposition methods for identifying such regions, the most widely used of which are (rotated) empirical orthogonal functions. First introduced by van den Dool, Saha, and Johansson (2000), empirical orthogonal teleconnections (EOT) denote a regression based approach that allows for straight-forward interpretation of the extracted modes. In this paper we present the R implementation of the original algorithm in the <b>remote</b> <b>package.</b> To highlight its usefulness, we provide three examples of potential use- case scenarios for the method including the replication of one of the original examples from van den Dool et al. (2000). Furthermore, we highlight the algorithms use for cross- correlations between two different geographic fields (identifying sea surface temperature drivers for precipitation), as well as statistical downscaling from coarse to fine grids (using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index fields) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} a framework to execute R functions on remote {{resources from the}} desktop using Bosco. The R language is attractive to researchers because of its high level programming constructs which lower the barrier of entry for use. As {{the use of the}} R programming language in HPC and High Throughput Computing (HTC) has grown, so too has the need for parallel libraries in order to utilize computing resources. Bosco is middleware that uses common protocols to manage job submissions to a variety of remote computational platforms and resources. The researcher is able to control and monitor remote submission from their interactive R IDE, such as RStudio. Bosco is capable of managing many concurrent tasks submitted to remote resources while providing feedback to the interactive R environment. We will also show how this framework can be used to access national infrastructure such as the Open Science Grid. Through interviews with R users, and their feedback after using BoscoR, we learned how R users work and designed BoscoR to fit their needs. We incorporated their feedback to improve BoscoR by adding much needed features, such as <b>remote</b> <b>package</b> management. A key design goal was to have a flat learning curve in using BoscoR for any R user. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This study {{demonstrates}} how {{the insertion of}} a thin silicone layer into a dual-layer remote phosphor structure enhances light extraction in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). In the experiment, a dual-layer phosphor structure yielded a higher intensity of blue and yellow components than a conven-tional structure. Moreover, the lumen flux was 5 % higher than a conventional <b>remote</b> phosphor <b>package</b> at the same correlated color temperature (CCT). Using a TFCalc 32 simulation, the electric field intensity was calculated for different thicknesses of the dual-layer remote phosphor structures, and the enhanced use of blue rays was verified. Additionally, the dual-layer structure reduces chromaticity deviations as the driving current increases.

40|$|JUICE, the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer, is a European Space Agency L-class mission {{destined for}} the Jovian system. Due for launch in 2022, it will begin a science phase after its transit to Jupiter that will include {{detailed}} investigations {{of three of the}} Galilean moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. JUICE will carry payloads to characterise the Jovian environments, divided into in situ, geophysical and <b>remote</b> sensing <b>packages.</b> A key instrument in the <b>remote</b> sensing <b>package</b> is JANUS, an optical camera operating over a wavelength range of 350 nm to 1064 nm. JANUS will be used to study the external layers of Jupiter’s atmosphere, the ring system and the planetary bodies. To achieve the science goals, resolutions of better than 5 m per pixel are required for the highest resolution observations during the 200 km altitude orbit of Ganymede, whilst the system is operated with a signal to noise ratio of better than 100. Jupiter’s magnetic field is a dominant object in the solar system, trapping electrons and other charged particles leading to the radiation environment around Jupiter being very hostile, especially in the regions closest to Jupiter in the Ganymede orbit. The radiation tolerance of the focal plane detector in JANUS is therefore a major concern and radiation testing is vital to confirm its expected performance after irradiation will meet requirements set by the science goals. JANUS will be using a detector from e 2 v technologies plc, the CMOS Imaging Sensor 115 (CIS 115), which is a device manufactured using 0. 18 μm Imaging CMOS Process with a 2000 by 1504 pixel array each 7 μm square.
