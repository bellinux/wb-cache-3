40|$|Economic {{indicators}} are very often revised {{and the size}} of revisions, computed comparing subsequent estimates and previous ones, allow to assess their reliability. The importance of this quality dimension is confirmed by the growing interest in <b>revision</b> <b>analysis</b> from international organizations (Eurostat, OECD) and National Statistics Institutes (NSIs) as well as their efforts towards transparency providing information about past revisions, scheduling future revisions due to changes in methods and definitions, creating real-time data bases. Most of these efforts are users-oriented because users see with a certain criticism the fact of revising economic statistics. However, in some cases, <b>revision</b> <b>analysis</b> could help detecting possible “weakness ” in the estimation procedures and to suggest suitable measures to counteract them. This document is aimed at proving some examples of this kind of tools, using an application to the Italian Index of Industrial Production (IIP) monthly released by ISTAT...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the QCD {{interactions}} which do not conserve the chirality of quarks. These non-perturbative forces are responsible for the violation of the U_A(1) charge conservation and for the breaking of chiral symmetry. From a systematic analysis we argue that the leading dynamical sources chirality flips are the interactions mediated by topological vacuum field fluctuations. We study in detail the contribution of instantons and derive a simple model-independent semi-classical prediction. This result can be used to check on the lattice if instantons are the dynamical mechanism responsible both for chiral symmetry breaking and for the anomalous violation of the U_A(1) charge conservation.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the development of}} new texts by fluent non-native speakers of Chinuk Wawa, an endangered indigenous contact language of the Pacific Northwest United States. The texts were developed as part of the language and culture program of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon for use in university-sponsored language classes. The collaborative process of developing 12 texts was explored through detailed <b>revision</b> <b>analysis</b> and interviews with the materials developers and other stakeholders. Fluent non-native speakers relied on collaboration, historical documentation, reference materials, grammatical models, and their own intuitions and cultural sensibilities to develop texts that would be both faithful to the speech of previous generations and effective for instruction. The texts studied were stories and cultural information developed through research-based composition, translation from interlinear and narrative English in ethnographic sources, and editing of transcribed oral narrative. The <b>revision</b> <b>analysis</b> identified points of discussion in the lexical development and grammatical standardization of the language. The preferred strategy for developing new vocabulary was use of language-internal resources such as compounding although borrowing and loan translation from other local Native languages were also sometimes considered appropriate. The multifunctionality of the lexicon and evidence of dialectal and idiolectal usage problematicized the description of an “ideal” language for pedagogical purposes. Concerns were also expressed about detailed grammatical modeling due to potential influence on non-native speaker intuitions and the non-utility of such models for revitalization goals. Decisions made {{in the process of developing}} texts contributed to the development of a written form of Chinuk Wawa that would honor and perpetuate the oral language while adapting it for the requirements of inscription. The repeated inclusion of discourse markers and the frequent removal of nominal reference brought final versions of texts closer to oral style, while inclusion of background information and the avoidance of shortened pronouns and auxiliaries customized the presentation for a reading audience. The results of this study comprise a sketch of one aspect of the daily work of language revitalization, in which non-native speakers shoulder responsibility for the growth of a language and its transfer to new generations of speakers...|$|E

30|$|Finally, the <b>revision</b> <b>analysis</b> {{based on}} {{quantitative}} {{measures such as}} total number of revisions, location, level, aspects and action was useful to some extent. As reported in previous studies, differences were observed between the high-scoring and low-scoring writers’ revision patterns in terms of these measures. However, as argued by Steverinson Eklundh & Kollberg (2003), Ben’s local elementary revisions on accuracy and form during writing did not necessarily reflect the writer’s overall composing strategies. In other words, analysis of revisions relying merely on these measures might not tell us {{a lot about the}} writers’ reading-into-writing processes. In this study, we further analysed writers’ revisions with a close examination of the keystroke logs. This provides a new insight that some of the writers’ discourse synthesis processes (i.e. selecting, organising and connecting ideas from sources) might be combined with their revising processes. Given its virtual role in the reading-into-writing literature, discourse synthesis was mostly examined separately from other processes. Nevertheless, the results indicate the importance of interpreting how writers transform ideas from sources in relation to other sub-processes.|$|E

Furthermore, regarding the (un) predictability of revisions, we suggest an alternative testing approach. The key feature of this approach is that it takes into account both in-sample and out-of-sample performances. We also discuss the impact of revisions on forecasting, focusing on short-term forecasting of first releases. Even though not accounting for data revision implications can lead to suboptimal results, our findings reinforce the need for a case by case analysis. ...|$|R

The interest focuses on the behavior of the quasi-two-dimensional fluid seen when looking at the system from above or below. In the first part, a collisional model for the effective two-dimensional dynamics is analyzed. Although it is able to describe quite well the homogeneous evolution observed in the experiments, it is shown that it fails to predict the existence of non-equilibrium phase transitions, and in particular, the bimodal regime exhibited by the real system. A critical <b>revision</b> <b>analysis</b> of the model is presented, and as a starting point to get a more accurate description, the Boltzmann equation for the quasi-two-dimensional gas has been derived.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the fifteenth-century Kingis Quair and the text which it cites as its inspiration, Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, finding analogues for the poet's response to this authoritative material in vernacular literature. The Quair is perhaps best known for its association with James I of Scotland, and an analysis of the connection between the king and the poem is employed as a means of demonstrating the extent to which his identity shapes the meaning of the work and is, in turn, reformulated within it. The Quair's treatment of the Consolation is a vital part of this transformation, as the poem establishes a parallel between James and Boethius, articulating the sense that his experience repeats that of the auctor. The medieval craft of memory is considered as a precedent for this treatment of literature and personal history as texts which are subject to <b>revision.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of several texts illuminates the tradition of Boethian adaptation which informs the Quair. The popularity of the Consolation made the image of Boethius as an exemplary politician a commonplace of medieval literary culture, and through association with his experience, exile and imprisonment become trials which confer philosophical wisdom upon their subjects. Against this background, the Quair emerges as a sophisticated engagement with the medieval reception history of the Consolation, which reimagines James I as the model of the perfect prince...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} current period performance of the OECD composite leading indicators (CLIs) for 21 OECD Member countries and three zone aggregates for which CLIs are available for a longer time period. The main aim of the current analysis on CLIs is to further evaluate {{the quality of the}} indicator in order to identify areas where their reliability could be improved. The results show that first estimates of CLIs are revised frequently but the size of revisions is rather small for most countries and almost neglectable for zone aggregates and {{there is no evidence of}} bias. The OECD CLI is, however, designed to provide early signals of turning points (peaks and troughs) between expansions and slowdowns of economic activity. Forecasting turning points is one of the main objectives of the leading indicator technique, because predicting the timing of cyclical turning points is one of the least reliable activities in economic forecasting. The results provide evidence that first and second estimates of year-on-year growth rates give reliable signals of approaching cyclical turning points. Finally, the importance of smoothness of components in the calculation of first and second estimates of the CLI and the overall smoothness of the CLI itself is noted in the findings. The results support the argument that it is not enough to have timely components they also need to be smooth to guarantee small revisions. Overall, this study has shown that whilst it could be dangerous to draw conclusions on the directions up or down in growth rates from one or two months figures for several countries, the first and second estimates of the CLIs give early signals of approaching turning points which in most cases are not revised later. <b>Revision</b> <b>analysis,</b> Leading indicators, Turning points, Smoothness...|$|E

To keep up with this trend, the undergraduate computer science curriculum has undergone many <b>revisions,</b> <b>analysis,</b> and discussion.

To remedy this, we present the blueprint and execution of a graduate level course in programming, designed specifically to cater to the needs of graduate students with a diverse background both in CS and other fields. To this end, the course is divided into two halves. In the first half, students are introduced to different programming concepts, such as multi-paradigm programming, data structures, concurrency, and security to bring them up to speed and provide a level playing field. In the second half, all of these concepts are employed as building blocks to solve real-world problems from data mining, natural language processing, computer vision, and other fields. In addition, the paper also discusses in detail the evaluation instruments employed for the course. Moreover, we also share anecdotal information around student feedback, course design, and grading that may be useful for others who wish to replicate our curriculum or sketch a similar course...|$|R
