5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially {{thought to be a}} certain winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> is directed below the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Only the radial {{component}} of the velocity is relevant. When the reflector is moving at right angle to the <b>radar</b> <b>beam,</b> it has no relative velocity. Vehicles and weather moving parallel to the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> produce the maximum Doppler frequency shift.|$|E
50|$|A <b>radar</b> <b>beam's</b> {{reflectivity}} {{depends on}} {{the diameter of the}} target and its capacity to reflect. Snowflakes are large but weakly reflective while rain drops are small but highly reflective.|$|R
50|$|After World War II the {{military}} became increasingly {{concerned with the}} effects of nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP), lightning strike, and even high-powered <b>radar</b> <b>beams,</b> on vehicle and mobile equipment of all kinds, and especially aircraft electrical systems.|$|R
50|$|Research {{is going}} on to achieve {{scanning}} of laser beams through phased arrays. This method is used to scan <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> without moving parts. With the use of Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSELs), {{it might be possible}} to realize fast laser scanners in the foreseeable future.|$|R
25|$|A radar gun or speed gun {{is a small}} Doppler radar used {{to detect}} the speed of objects. It relies on the Doppler Effect applied to a <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> to measure the speed of objects at which it is pointed. Radar guns may be {{hand-held}} or vehicle-mounted. Bryce K. Brown invented the radar gun in March 1954.|$|E
25|$|The Doppler {{effect is}} used in some types of radar, to measure the {{velocity}} of detected objects. A <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> is fired at a moving target — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> {{would follow}} a linear path in vacuum, {{but it really}} follows a {{somewhat}} curved path in the atmosphere because of the variation of the refractive index of air, that is called the radar horizon. Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, it will rise above it as the Earth curvature sinks below the horizon. Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium it crosses, and the beam disperses.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of radar in the mid-1930s proved a great advance in air-to-ground communication. Radar {{could be used}} to track planes in the air and determine distance, direction, speed and even type of aircraft. This allowed for better air traffic control as well as navigation aides for pilots. Radar also proved to be a valuable tool in targeting for bombers. Radar stations on the coast of Britain could aim two <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> from separate locations on the coast towards Germany. By aligning the two <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> to intersect over the desired target, a town or factory for example, an aircraft could then follow one radar signal until it intersected with the other where it would then know to drop bombs.|$|R
50|$|Droplets {{of falling}} liquid water {{tend to have}} a larger {{horizontal}} axis due to the drag coefficient of air while falling (water droplets). This causes the water molecule dipole to be oriented in that direction; so, <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> are, generally, polarized horizontally in order to receive the maximal signal reflection.|$|R
50|$|His early {{research}} into meter-wave propagation and <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> necessitated additional names for newly discovered {{levels of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and Plendl is generally credited with coining the term ionosphere. In the early 1930s, Plendl worked on developing the radio communications used in flights by civilian aircraft and the Hindenburg Zeppelin.|$|R
25|$|Although <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> riding {{guidance}} {{was planned}} to solve this, the subsonic {{speed of the}} weapon was also considered to be insufficient to avoid obsolescence; accordingly, the AAM-A-1's production program was terminated late in 1949, the Hughes Falcon being selected for development as the Air Force's standard intercept missile instead. The test program {{was considered to be}} successful despite this, as a considerable amount of knowledge was gained that benefited later programs.|$|E
25|$|According to Lovell {{this did}} not {{represent}} {{as much of a}} disruption as Dee believed; to some extent, the klystron work at Birmingham had been instigated by the Army for GL purposes, so it was not entirely fair to complain. Lovell's primary task during this period was developing a conical scanning system that improved the accuracy of the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> many times, enough to allow it to be used directly to lay the guns (that is, about the same accuracy as optical instruments). This did not really require much effort, and would be useful for any centimetric radar, including AIS.|$|E
25|$|As the AIS team {{once again}} {{returned}} their attention full-time to the airborne interception task, they had {{by this time}} produced what was a complete radar system. However, the system could only {{be used in the}} manner of a flashlight, pointed in the direction of its target. This was fine for Gun Laying, but in order to be useful in the interception role, the system had to be able to find the target anywhere in front of the fighter. The team began to consider different ways to scan the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> to produce a search function.|$|E
50|$|As {{demonstrated}} at {{the start}} of the article, <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> have a physical dimension and data are sampled at discrete angles, not continuously, along each angle of elevation. This results in an averaging of the values of the returns for reflectivity, velocities and polarization data on the resolution volume scanned.|$|R
30|$|The {{main idea}} of our {{technique}} is {{to fit the}} TID analytical model to minimum slant range variations observed on different <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> (Oinats et al. 2013). The steps of data processing and analysis are almost the same as described in Oinats et al. (2015). Here, we list them briefly and emphasize the differences between present and previous techniques.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{simple method}} is described, based on {{standard}} VHF wind-pro®ler data, where imbalances of echo power between four o€-vertical <b>radar</b> <b>beams,</b> caused by mountain waves, {{can be used}} to calculate the orientation of the wave pattern. It is shown that the mountain wave azimuth (direction of the horizontal component of the wavevector), is given by the vecto...|$|R
25|$|The AEW.7 version {{would have}} seen the ventral radome {{containing}} the AN/APS-20 radar removed and replaced with a dorsal rotating dome or 'rotodome', similar to that used on the US Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, carrying a newly developed FMICW radar system. To accommodate a new installation {{of the size of the}} rotodome, together with its position right at the rear of the aircraft, the intention was to rebuild the rear fuselage with the single tailfin being substituted by a twin tail arrangement, as well as the wingspan being increased to 60ft (18.3m). The rotodome was designed to be moveable on its installation, able to tip backwards to allow the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> to operate clear of interference from the Gannet's propellers, negating the need to replace the Double Mamba with a turbofan engine assembly. In the end, this proposal was not proceeded with.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{realised}} that the spiral-scan did provide angle-off information, through simple geometry and timing. Since the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> had a finite width, about five degrees, it would see some return {{even when the}} target was not centred in the beam. A target far from the centreline would only be illuminated when the dish was pointed in that direction while rotating rapidly away from it. The result as a short arc on the display about 10 degrees long. A target closer to the centre, say five degrees to port, would be illuminated strongly when the dish was pointed to the left, but still receive a small signal {{even when it was}} pointed to the right. That meant it produced a varying return almost through the entire rotation, creating a much longer arc, or a complete circle if the target was dead ahead.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD, and satellite images, do not detect tornadoes or hail, only indications that the storm has the potential. Radar and satellite data interpretation will usually give a warning before there is any visual evidence of such events, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine it is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what these remote sensing devices cannot is especially important as distance from a radar site increases, because the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, due to curvature of Earth {{and the spread of}} the beam with distance. Therefore, when far from a radar, only precipitations and velocities high in the storm are observed. The important areas might not then be sampled or the resolution of the data might be poor. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.|$|E

Azimuth sweeping created a [...] "Lower Fan" [...] centered at 3.5° elevation and [...] "Upper Fan" [...] at 7° (both illustrated much higher) with [...] "revisit time of 2 sec" [...] for ICBM detection.|$|R
40|$|In {{the search}} for natural orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) effects, {{some of the first}} incoherent scatter experiments with twisted <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> during aurora were conducted at Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR), Alaska, USA, in October 2012. Experimental data of scatter from beam configurations with opposite twists were investigated. By the use of hypothesis tests in combination with Monte Carlo simulations together with traditional estimations of the mean and confidence interval, asymmetries between scatter of <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> with opposite twists were identified for an integration time of at least 30 minutes. Asymmetries were detected in the internal radar noise too, but not necessarily with the same signs as for the asymmetries from the ionospheric signals. The asymmetries identified could be due to amplified noise for signals coming from intense aurora or perhaps the rectangular-shaped antenna array used at PFISR. These two possible causes need to be ruled out before suggesting that the asymmetries identified are an outcome of OAM effects present in the ionosphere...|$|R

25|$|CVR {{transcript}} contains {{details of}} extensive discussion amongst {{the crew members}} about the weather en route and over Kinshasa. First indication of Crew's realization {{of the presence of}} bad weather en route to Kinshasa was evident at 12:37, when the aircraft was between position GURUT and UDRID, over 100 NMs from Kinshasa. The crew got this indication through their on-board weather radar. At 12:38, the crew again discussed the weather when the Captain said that the (<b>radar)</b> <b>beam</b> was clearly showing the clouds. extended communication amongst the crew of extreme bad weather being present at and around Kinshasa and the way to avoid it, is heard on the CVR. The co-pilot exclaimed at 12:45 that the weather return being picked up on their radar was very big. Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> has a {{width of}} about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as the scanner rotated, causing a short arc about 10 degrees wide to show on the display. A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the radar scan. Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it no matter where the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when the scanner is pointed five degrees to the left. In this case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring on the display instead of a short arc. Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring on the display will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle on the display.|$|E

50|$|Regarding the {{different}} cloud radars operating wavelengths, {{it must be}} taken into account that longer wavelengths are less attenuated by drizzle and rain, while shorter wavelengths are more sensitive to smaller particles. Accordingly, radar signals are less attenuated in Ka-band than in W-band, while W-band radars are able to detect smaller particles. Even though, the cloud <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> are much less attenuated by cloud or precipitation particles than the lidar beam.|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{a replica}} bomb belt {{concealed}} on a mannequin at 4 m standoff range is achieved using a 670 GHz imaging radar. At a somewhat larger standoff range of 4. 6 m, the <b>radar's</b> <b>beam</b> width increases substantially, but the through-shirt image quality remains good. This {{suggests that a}} relatively modest increase in aperture size over the current design will be sufficient to detect person-borne concealed weapons at ranges exceeding 25 meters...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>beams</b> are cone-shaped, {{spreading}} {{out from the}} diameter of the antenna at a characteristic angle that {{is a function of the}} size of the antenna and its wavelength. This means that as one moves away from the radar, its accuracy continues to degrade while the signal grows weaker. This makes it difficult to use the radar signal itself as the guidance signal, a system known as beam riding, except for very short-range engagements.|$|R
2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the radar is completely automatic, controlled by four computers. [...] The software divides the beam time between [...] "surveillance" [...] and [...] "tracking" [...] functions, switching the beam back and forth rapidly between different tasks. [...] In the surveillance mode, which normally consumes about 11% of the duty cycle, the radar repeatedly scans the horizon across its full 240° azimuth in a pattern between 3° and 10° elevation, creating a [...] "surveillance fence" [...] to immediately detect missiles as they rise above the horizon into the radar's field of view. In the tracking mode, which normally consumes the other 7% of the 18% duty cycle, the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> follows already-detected objects to determine their trajectory, calculating their launch and target points.|$|E
50|$|Only the radial {{component}} of the velocity is relevant. When the reflector is moving at right angle to the <b>radar</b> <b>beam,</b> it has no relative velocity. Vehicles and weather moving parallel to the <b>radar</b> <b>beam</b> produce the maximum Doppler frequency shift.|$|E

50|$|According to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, even a very {{flat plate}} would still reflect radar waves, though {{much less than}} when a signal is {{bouncing}} at a right angle. Additional reduction in its radar signature was achieved {{by the use of}} various radar-absorbent materials (RAM) to absorb and neutralize <b>radar</b> <b>beams.</b> The majority of the B-2 is made out of a carbon-graphite composite material that is stronger than steel, lighter than aluminum, and absorbs a significant amount of radar energy.|$|R
50|$|The {{time delay}} effect was first {{observed}} in 1964, by Irwin Shapiro. Shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction: bounce <b>radar</b> <b>beams</b> {{off the surface}} of Venus and Mercury, and measure the round trip travel time. When the Earth, Sun, and Venus are most favorably aligned, Shapiro showed that the expected time delay, due {{to the presence of}} the Sun, of a radar signal traveling from the Earth to Venus and back, would be about 200 microseconds, well within the limitations of 1960s era technology.|$|R
