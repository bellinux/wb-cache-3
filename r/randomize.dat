5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which <b>randomize</b> lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
5|$|The single-player {{adventure}} {{begins by}} personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. While the algorithm stays the same, the player can <b>randomize</b> repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player {{begins with a}} sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see his immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning bolts, and turning the undead, as well as health regeneration and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned by trial and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} {{may not always}} be successful; the player may intentionally switch from his favoured spot after witnessing the goalkeeper obtaining knowledge of his kicks.

25|$|An {{orthogonal}} {{array of}} strength 2 {{can be used}} to design a factorial experiment. The columns represent the various factors and the entries are the levels that the factors can be applied at (assuming that all factors can be applied at the same number of levels). An experimental run is a row of the orthogonal array, that is, apply the corresponding factors at the levels which appear in the row. When using one of these designs, the treatment units and trial order should be randomized as much as the design allows. For example, one recommendation is that an appropriately sized orthogonal array be randomly selected from those available, then <b>randomize</b> the run order.|$|E
25|$|The lottery is {{conducted}} with witnesses (from {{the accounting firm}} Ernst & Young) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once as they are placed in the lottery machine.

NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine {{the second and third}} picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. When the first three teams have been determined, the remaining picks are given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assures each team that it can drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.|$|E
25|$|There are {{variations}} {{that feature}} specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit {{or at least}} its numbers 2–8 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series. Joker tiles are used in some versions. Some variations use counting sticks while others use chips, and some use pencils and paper for score keeping. Wind indicators come in various formats such as cubes, discs, or cylinders. All varieties of mahjong use two or three dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a bonus. Mahjong tables are square and small enough to be within arms-length of all equipment. The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. More expensive tables, like those found in tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and <b>randomize</b> dice.|$|E

500|$|Jonasson's game {{design was}} {{inspired}} by real-time strategy game Command & Conquer, where he enjoyed managing his home base but not attacking the enemy. He designed the game to last 45 minutes, which he felt to be a proper length, whereupon the difficulty ramps up to require station defense over base construction. He {{felt that it was}} reasonable to reach all four monoliths within that time to be ready for the endgame sequence, and that the limit made players expand outwards rather than keeping the station small and easy to defend. The sole map is hand-balanced, which made him reluctant to fulfill player requests to <b>randomize</b> it. He also considered adding a [...] "zen" [...] mode, which would pressure the player less.

It was also inspired by interactive fiction Adventure. While {{looking for a way}} to <b>randomize</b> the experience of Adventure, they came across Ken Arnold's curses library that enabled them to better manipulate characters on the terminal screen, prompting Toy and Wichman to create a graphical-like randomized adventure game. They created the story of the game by having the player seek out the [...] "Amulet of Yendor", [...] "Yendor" [...] being [...] "Rodney" [...] spelled backwards, the name of the wizard they envisioned had created the dungeon. Rogue was originally executed on a VAX-11/780 computer; its limited memory forced them to use a simple text-based interface for the game. Toy eventually dropped out of school but got a job at the computing labs at University of California, Berkeley, where he met with Arnold. Arnold helped to optimize the curses code and implement more features into the game.|$|E

[...] This allows the game to <b>randomize</b> the order of the game's battle themes and avoid looping the music in a predictable order. [...] Initially, the game was to exclusively feature big band music.

2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in analytical chemistry have enabled high-precision measurements of multiply substituted isotopologues (or 'clumped isotopologues') like 13CH3D. This {{emerge as a}} novel tool for studying methane formation. This proxy {{is based on the}} abundance of clumped isotopologues of methane, which should be enriched compared to the stochastic distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium because the reduced zero-point energy for heavy-heavy isotope bonding is more than twice the reduced zero-point energy of heavy-light isotope bonding. The extent of enrichment decreases with increasing temperature, as higher entropy tends to <b>randomize</b> isotope distribution. [...] Stolper et al. established this temperature calibration using laboratory equilibrated methane and field methane from known formation temperature, and applied this to several gas reservoirs to study natural gas formation and mixing. Wang et al. also reported strong non-equilibrium isotope effect in methane clumped isotopes from lab-cultured methanogens and field samples. These methane samples have relatively low abundance of clumped isotopologues, sometimes even lower than the stochastic distribution. This indicates that there are irreversible steps in enzymatic reactions during methanogenesis that fractionation against clumped isotopologues to create the depleted signal. Isotope clumping in methane has proven a robust proxy, and scientists are now moving towards higher-order alkane molecules like ethane for further work.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Randomized</b> {{clinical}} trials that enroll patients in critical or emergency care (acute care) setting are challenging because of narrow time windows for recruitment {{and the inability}} of many patients to provide informed consent. To assess the extent that recruitment challenges lead to <b>randomized</b> clinical trial discontinuation, we compared the discontinuation of acute care and nonacute care <b>randomized</b> {{clinical trials}}. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of 894 <b>randomized</b> clinical trials approved by six institutional review boards in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada between 2000 and 2003. SETTING: <b>Randomized</b> clinical trials involving patients in an acute or nonacute care setting. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We recorded trial characteristics, self-reported trial discontinuation, and self-reported reasons for discontinuation from protocols, corresponding publications, institutional review board files, and a survey of investigators. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 894 <b>randomized</b> clinical trials, 64 (7 %) were acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials (29 critical care and 35 emergency care). Compared with the 830 nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials, acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials were more frequently discontinued (28 of 64, 44 % vs 221 of 830, 27 %; p = 0. 004). Slow recruitment was the most frequent reason for discontinuation, both in acute care (13 of 64, 20 %) and in nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials (7 of 64, 11 %). Logistic regression analyses suggested the acute care setting as an independent risk factor for <b>randomized</b> clinical trial discontinuation specifically {{as a result of}} slow recruitment (odds ratio, 4. 00; 95 % CI, 1. 72 - 9. 31) after adjusting for other established risk factors, including nonindustry sponsorship and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials are more vulnerable to premature discontinuation than nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials and have an approximately four-fold higher risk of discontinuation due to slow recruitment. These results highlight the need for strategies to reliably prevent and resolve slow patient recruitment in <b>randomized</b> clinical trials conducted in the critical and emergency care setting...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: The use of <b>randomized</b> consent designs {{has been}} subject of methodologic and ethical controversy.

The purpose of the study is to assess to what extent a <b>randomized</b> consent design and a modification of this design is accepted by research ethics committees, in terms of ethics, health law, and methodology. Methods: A postal survey was conducted among members of research ethics committees in the United Kingdom, and in The Netherlands, with professional competence in ethics, (health) law, methodology, or clinical practice. Results: In both the UK and in The Netherlands, the modified <b>randomized</b> consent design appears to be statistically significantly more acceptable than the <b>randomized</b> consent design, with respect to ethical and judicial aspects. The overall rejection rate of the <b>randomized</b> consent design was 66 % in the UK and 59 % in The Netherlands. However, the modified <b>randomized</b> consent design was rejected by 47 and 41 % in the two countries, respectively.
