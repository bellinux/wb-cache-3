5000|$|Through 1920-1930s {{several new}} duck calls were {{produced}} using different styles or techniques to produce {{different kinds of}} sounds. Mid-1920s a man named Charles Ditto produced a duck call called the Eureka Model. It was made of two parts and contained a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>insert</b> and brass reed. [...] Mid-1930 through the 1950s, father and son Clarence and Dudley Faulk produced {{some of the first}} plastic duck calls as well as several wooden ones. In 1935 using live ducks was outlawed, in the United States and the demand for duck calls increased incredibly.|$|E

50|$|Most Protectors were {{nickel-plated}} {{to prevent}} corrosion from being carried {{in close contact}} with the owner. These guns were shipped with hard <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> for additional protection. Some varieties came with pearl inlays and a small percentage were blued.|$|R
50|$|Hummer H1s {{have other}} unusual features, such as inboard brakes and portal gears {{that allow the}} drivetrain's half shafts a higher placement, for greater ground clearance. The {{radiator}} is up high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood. The air intake is high-mount, enabling the H1 to ford waist-level water. Rather than using simple runflat tires, magnesium-aluminum alloy or <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> are an optional feature for runflat ability.|$|R
50|$|Harmonic Balancer - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 {{models were}} {{equipped}} with a harmonic balancer pulley which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the <b>rubber</b> <b>insert</b> of the harmonic balancer pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the timing chain cover and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003 which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost. The part number on the harmonic balancer pulley {{can be compared to}} those given to Mercedes-Benz dealers in the Service Campaign notice to determine if the part is a faulty original or has been replaced with the updated part. Replacement of the faulty part with the updated part should be a permanent solution to this problem.|$|E
5000|$|For 1973, 300 changes {{included}} new {{exterior and}} interior colors and new standard interior trim. Front and rear nameplate scripts [...] "Chevrolet Vega 2300" [...] were changed to [...] "Vega by Chevrolet". To meet the 1973 5 mph front bumper standards the front bumper, on stronger brackets, was extended 3 in, with a steel body-color filler panel. US-built Saginaw manual transmissions and a new shift linkage replaced the Opel units. The RPO L11 engine had a new Holley 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. New options included BR70-13 white-stripe steel-belted radial tires, full wheel covers, and body side molding with black <b>rubber</b> <b>insert.</b> Two new models were introduced mid-year: the estate wagon with DI-NOC wood grain sides and rear trim, and the LX notchback with vinyl roof finish. On May 17, 1973, the millionth Vega left the Lordstown Assembly plant - an orange GT hatchback with white sport stripes, power steering and neutral custom vinyl interior including exclusive vinyl door panels. A limited-edition [...] "Millionth Vega" [...] was introduced replicating the milestone car, with orange carpeting and Millionth Vega door handle accents. Sixty-five hundred were built from May 1 to July 1.|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{a rubber}} bushing can be {{replaced}} or repaired depends upon the propeller; some cannot. Some can, but need special equipment to insert the oversized bushing for an interference fit. Others {{can be replaced}} easily. The [...] "special equipment" [...] usually consists of a funnel, a press and rubber lubricant (soap). If {{one does not have}} access to a lathe, an improvised funnel can be made from steel tube and car body filler; as the filler is only subject to compressive forces it is able to do a good job. Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod. A more serious problem with this type of propeller is a [...] "frozen-on" [...] spline bushing, which makes propeller removal impossible. In such cases the propeller must be heated in order to deliberately destroy the <b>rubber</b> <b>insert.</b> Once the propeller is removed, the splined tube can be cut away with a grinder and a new spline bushing is then required. To prevent a recurrence of the problem, the splines can be coated with anti-seize anti-corrosion compound.|$|E
50|$|The 4D Fusion Wheel {{replaces the}} {{standard}} Fusion Wheel. It {{is made of}} multiple parts, including the PC Frame, Metal Frame, and Core. Some omit a standard frame and core design, such as L-Drago Destroy which has an upper metal frame to replace the Energy Ring and a lower PC core with <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> to replace the Fusion Wheel, essentially flipping the common construction of most tops from this system.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{rail network}} {{includes}} gradients up to 10%, all vehicle axles are powered, which limits the low-floor area to {{that between the}} bogies. For maximized low floor area, the middle bogies are installed entirely below the centre carriage section rather than under the articulations. The wheels are type Bochum 84, have resilient <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> and have a diameter of 67 cm. They may be worn to a diameter of at least 59 cm.|$|R
50|$|The Ro 80 {{remained}} largely unchanged over its ten year production. From September 1969 the rectangular headlights were replaced with twin halogen units, and air extractor vents {{appeared on the}} C-pillar behind the doors. In August 1970 a slightly reshaped plastic grill replaced the metal grill of the early cars, and a minimal facelift in May 1975 saw the final cars getting enlarged rear lights and <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> in the bumpers which increased the car's overall length by 15 mm to 4795 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{aftermarket}} upgrades {{designed specifically}} for the Generation 5 markers are the Yakuza OLED board made by Tadao technologies which offers a screen to change modes instead of using the stock flashing LED and adds numerous new parameters to change, including the ability to set up multiple preset fire modes and adjust rate of fire by intervals of 0.1bps. a low pressure poppet which uses a slightly longer shaft to open the valve for a slightly longer time and more air as it cycles to create a softer shot by reducing recoil, it also reduces recoil to small degree. The aforementioned 4C eye and laser 4C eye systems which uses two additional sensors to calculate {{the amount of time}} it takes for a ball to be fully loaded into the breach and tells the board to pre-charge the solenoid. This helps increase rate of fire in semi-auto and allows for more uniform streams of paint. Protege users can buy the same pillow bolt that comes stock in the Vice from Bob Long Direct; it uses a <b>rubber</b> <b>insert</b> in the bolt face to put less pressure on the paintball being fired and to prevent paint from breaking inside the barrel. Lurker paintball makes an adjustable ram for the Gen 5 markers to help reduce recoil and lower dwell, thus increasing efficiency. Lurker rams have a cult following within the Intimidator owning and collecting community.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, {{once again}} {{the top of the}} line Oldsmobile series was the 98. Standard {{equipment}} included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts,</b> padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel trim rings, Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, windshield washers, electric clock, and deep twist carpeting. Upholstery was fabric, leather, or Morocceen in a variety of colors. Tire size was [...] by [...] An anti-spin rear axle was optional.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, the CB {{series was}} {{launched}} in December 1978. It was available as a four-door sedan in three trim levels (Standard, Deluxe and Super Deluxe) and as a two-door Super Deluxe hardtop. The engine was the 2.0-liter [...] inline-four engine available with three transmissions (four-speed and five-speed manual or three-speed automatic). The Deluxe model added cloth-inserted seats, push button radio, bumper <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts,</b> <b>rubber</b> body side protection mouldings, intermittent wipers, chrome wheel rings, map reading lights, and seat back map pockets. The Super Deluxe added halogen headlamps, window tint, FM radio, bumper overriders, and electronic safety check panel. For the facelift model from 1980 in Australia, the base [...] "Standard" [...] model was renamed [...] "Special", while the sedan and hardtop Super Deluxe trims each receiving unique (to trim level and body variant) wheel trims. A rear folding armrest, central locking and sunroof {{were added to the}} Super Deluxe sedan. Another minor update in 1981 changed the wheel designs for the Super Deluxe.|$|R
40|$|A detail {{analysis}} of dynamical properties of five-blades-bundle mathematical model {{was carried out}} with the aim to investigate how the damping elements made of special <b>rubber</b> <b>inserted</b> into slots between blades heads influence the response curves at different distribution of exciting harmonic forces. Viscous-elastic linear Voigt–Kelvin model was used for modeling the rheological properties of damping elements. Constant values of stiffness and damping parameters were supposed at analysis, but the frequency dependent parameters are mentioned as well. The effect of complicated form of higher modes of vibration on blades bundle amplitude resonance level is shown. The importance of orthogonality of excitation forces distribution to the other eigenmodes of blades bundle is discovered at isolating selected resonance...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{elements}} of the design, such as the striking colors used for the coordinated body panels, the Space Age instrument panel, translucent passenger grab handles, and slickly serviceable storage compartment had a consumer appliance feel and appearance, [...] "reminding you of current computer peripherals such as HP ScanJet printers." [...] Its small transparent wind screen seemed [...] "iMac-inspired", {{and the use of}} translucent polycarbonate elsewhere hinted at Apple's style at the time. The addition of superfluous oblong slots with incongruous <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> along the sides of the aluminum frame led Rider magazine to quip that it was [...] "overstyled". BMW [...] "ripped a page from the strategy book of Apple Computer Inc" [...] with its three [...] "youth-oriented" [...] color choices, azure blue metallic, golden orange metallic and beluga blue.|$|R

5000|$|Modified traps are now {{available}} with offset jaws, or lamination, or both, which decrease pressure on the animals' legs. Traps are also available with a padded jaw, which has <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> inside the jaws to reduce animal injuries. However these traps may be more expensive. A single number 3 foothold trap which has a 6-inch jaw spread and commonly used for trapping beaver and coyote costs about 10 to 20 dollars depending on the make, while a padded jaw or [...] "Soft Catch" [...] trap may cost from 12 to 20 dollars. [...] Today's traps are specially designed in different sizes for different sized animals, which reduces injuries. Anti-fur campaigns have protested leghold traps claiming that an animal caught in a leghold trap will frequently chew off its leg to escape the trap, while the National Animal Interest Alliance states that modern foothold traps {{have been designed to}} hold animals as humanely as possible to reduce incidences of the animal fighting the trap, possibly injuring itself or getting loose in the process.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1960 the 1958 1100/103 D and the 1110/103 H Lusso were {{replaced}} by three models, first shown at the November 1960 Turin Motor Show: the 1100 Export, the pricier 1100 Special, and the 1100 Familiare station wagon.The Special changed its name depending on the market—e.g. it was named Speciale in Italy and Spezial in Germany. The main difference between Special and Export saloons was the sheetmetal: the Export used a 103 H Lusso bodyshell, while the Special became the first 1100 with four front-hinged doors, as it adopted the more modern 1200 Granluce bodyshell. Otherwise the two saloons had nearly identical interior trim and equipment. Both had been stripped of the Granluce and Lusso's glitzy trim and their complex paint schemes—though a contrast colour roof remained optional on the Special. Sole concessions to ornamentation were a chrome spear down the side and factory-fitted whitewall tyres, with a thicker band on the Special. Export, Special and Familiare all used the same front end, as fitted to the Lusso and the 1959 restyled Granluce; front and rear the bumpers had less bulky over-riders, without <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Renault 19 16S hot hatch (16V in some countries), {{added to}} the lineup {{in the autumn of}} 1990, was the only Renault 19 with 16-valve engine.

The [...] "S" [...] is for Soupapes, French for valves. It was praised for its excellent handling and rev-happy F7P engine which along with the advanced Renix ECU made it faster and more fuel efficient compared to most competitors. The braking system was uprated to include 259 mm vented discs on the front and 237 mm discs on the rear as well as an uprated lower suspension setup and front strut bar. Phase 1 editions benefited from unique front and rear bumpers with front indicators relocated into the bumpers to allow for the twin headlamps, while the Phase 2 retained the original bumpers found throughout the range but added colour-coded tops, <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts,</b> and a discreet lower splitter.|$|R
50|$|Around 1886, Senn {{successfully}} {{tested the}} diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation by inflation with hydrogen gas. Senn used a rubber balloon connected to a <b>rubber</b> tube <b>inserted</b> in his anus to pump 4 gal of hydrogen gas into his intestinal tract. An assistant sealed the tube by squeezing the anus against it. The hydrogen was inserted by squeezing the balloon while monitoring the pressure on a manometer. Senn had previously carried out this experiment on dogs {{to the point of}} rupturing the intestine.|$|R
5000|$|The Fender Performer bass was {{a uniquely}} styled bass guitar, {{designed}} by John Page, {{renowned for its}} extremely slender neck (narrower than Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars). The Japanese Performer Standard has an alder body, with a bolt-on 34" [...] 24-fret micro-tilt adjustable maple neck and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard {{as opposed to the}} United States-made Performer Elite, which sports an ebony fretboard. Controls are: Tone, Volume, Pickup Selector Switch and TBX Circuit Control (Treble Bass eXpander). The latter provided the same tonal range as the Jazz Bass between 0 and 5, with the range 5-10 providing significantly brighter sound - oriented towards solo playing and particularly suiting the sharp attack needed for a slap bass playing style. Both basses were available in Burgundy Mist, Gun Metal Blue, Candy Green, White and Tobacco Sunburst. All finishes were metallic except for the sunburst. Both versions featured a number of minor features underlying the 'high end' design including <b>rubber</b> <b>inserts</b> around the volume and tone controls, a high-quality fully enclosed jack socket, a then new and contemporary Fender logo, sculpted pickups marked with an (original) Fender logo, felt washers to prevent the strap buttons marking the body and individual intonation adjustment for each string as standard (many P-Basses at this time had just two bridge pieces).|$|R
