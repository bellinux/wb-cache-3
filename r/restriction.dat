In addition to overidentifying <b>restrictions</b> the considered <b>restrictions</b> may also involve normalizing <b>restrictions.</b> Tests for both types of <b>restrictions</b> are developed and their asymptotic properties are obtained. Under the null hypothesis tests for normalizing <b>restrictions</b> have an asymptotic "multivariate unit root distribution", similar to that obtained for the likelihood ratio test for cointegration, while tests for overidentifying <b>restrictions</b> have a standard chi-square limiting distribution. Since these two types of tests are asymptotically independent they are easy to cotnbine to an overall test for the spccifed identifying <b>restrictions.</b> An overall test of this kind can consistently reveal the failure of the identifying <b>restrictions</b> in a wider class of cases than previous tests which only test for overidentifying <b>restrictions.</b> and phrases, cointegration, normalizing <b>restrictions,</b> overidentifying <b>restrictions,</b> vector autoregressive process,...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the association between a range of cell phone <b>restrictions</b> and self-reported cell phone use while driving among teen drivers. Methods: U.

Cell phone <b>restrictions</b> for each state were identified using the Public Health Law Research Distracted Driving Law database and divided into five categories. Associations between cell phone <b>restrictions</b> and self-reported cell phone use while driving were estimated as odds ratios, adjusting for driving exposure. Results: In states with cell phone <b>restrictions,</b> teens were less likely to report talking or texting while driving, relative to teens in states with no <b>restrictions.</b> Talking and texting while driving were significantly less likely in states with texting <b>restrictions</b> for all drivers. All driver texting <b>restrictions</b> combined with teen hand-held phone <b>restrictions</b> were significantly associated with lower texting but not talking while driving. Conclusions: The presence of <b>restrictions</b> appears to be better than no <b>restrictions</b> with respect to self-reported teen cell phone use.

This paper quantifies and {{analyzes}} {{measures of}} <b>restrictions</b> on inward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) {{in the service sector}} for developing countries, using a methodology developed in Golub (2003) in a study of OECD countries. Several different types of <b>restrictions</b> are considered: limitations on foreign ownership, screening or notification procedures, management <b>restrictions,</b> and operational <b>restrictions.</b> These <b>restrictions</b> on FDI are computed for a large number of subsectors and then aggregated into a single measure for the service sector as a whole in each country. The sample includes 50 developing countries in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Notwithstanding the world-wide trend towards liberalization of <b>restrictions</b> since the early 1990 s, there remain substantial disparities between regions and individual countries in the severity of observable <b>restrictions</b> on inward FDI in services. The paper finds that Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe generally have low levels of <b>restrictions,</b> whereas the highest levels of <b>restrictions</b> are found in East Asia and the Middle East. Inward FDI in services is strongly negatively correlated with the severity of <b>restrictions.</b> It should be stressed that the study is limited to <b>restrictions</b> discriminating betwee...|$|R
