5|$|February's The New Beginning tour {{featured}} Bullet Club defending both {{of their}} tag team championships and the <b>re-ignition</b> of a rivalry between Devitt and his former partner Ryusuke Taguchi, who returned from an eight-month injury break. Devitt dominated his encounters with Taguchi {{for most of the}} tour, including pinning him in his return eight-man tag team match on February 2, but at the tour ending event, The New Beginning in Osaka, Taguchi pinned his former partner in a tag team match, where he teamed with Togi Makabe and Devitt with Fale. In March, Bad Luck Fale made it to the finals of the 2014 New Japan Cup, but was defeated there by Shinsuke Nakamura. As the one-year anniversary of the break-up of Apollo 55 approached, the rivalry between Devitt and Taguchi escalated, leading to Taguchi challenging his rival to a Loser Leaves Town match. The stipulation, however, was never made official for their April 6 Invasion Attack 2014 match. During the match, Devitt got into an argument with The Young Bucks, after the two repeatedly interfered in the match despite his orders not to do so. This led to The Young Bucks turning on Devitt, who responded by diving onto his Bullet Club stablemates. After Taguchi defeated Devitt, the two men shook hands, ending their rivalry with each other and Devitt's association with Bullet Club. Devitt's resignation from NJPW was announced the following day.|$|E

Off-shore collection grids consist of vast amount of cables, with different length and connection points, which have low surge impedance compared with overhead lines.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{modeling}} of components and calculation of transient overvoltages that build up on the trans-former primary terminals after the transformer has been switched off by a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB). The transformer is con-nected to the circuit breaker by a cable. The transient overvoltages are calculated for different cable lengths, and the cumulative prob-ability of different arc angles is investigated. In this study two cases are considered: transient overvoltages due to steady-state magnetizing current switching, and transient overvoltages due to inrush current switching. It is shown that the case of inrush current switching is worse, as virtual current chop-ping is possible. The cable is modeled by pi sections, whereas the transformer model {{is based on a}} terminal impedance. The VCB <b>re-ignitions</b> are modeled by means of withstand voltage character-istics and high-frequency quenching capability. Due to shortage of field tests, this work uses only literature references to compare the results with actual measurements. Index Terms—Modeling, overvoltage, transformer, VCB. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum breakers for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc furnace and ladle melt furnace (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple <b>re-ignitions.</b> This paper will present a detailed case study of vacuum breaker switching of a new LMF transformer involving current chopping and restrike simulations using the electromagnetic transients program. A technique that involves a combination of surge arresters and snubbers will be applied to the LMF to show that the switching transients can be successfully mitigated. Additionally, some practical aspects of the physical design and installation of the snubber will be discussed.

In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a frequency dependent model which represents high frequency effects like wave propagation, damping and reflection is used to model the cables using PSCAD/EMTDC.

Secondly, a statistical model which emulates the occurrence of <b>re-ignitions,</b> pre-strikes and current chopping behaviours of the VCB during opening or closing operations is dealt with.

40|$|Switching of shunt {{reactors}} and {{capacitor banks}} {{is known to}} cause a very high rate of rise of transient recovery voltage across the circuit breaker contacts. With improvements in circuit breaker technology, modern SF 6 puffer circuits have been designed with less interrupter per pole than previous generations of SF 6 circuit breakers. This has caused modern circuit breakers to operate with higher voltage stress in the dielectric recovery region after current interruption. Catastrophic failures of modern SF 6 circuit breakers have been reported during shunt reactor and capacitor bank de-energisation. In those cases, evidence of cumulative re-strikes {{has been found to}} be the main cause of interrupter failure. Monitoring of voltage waveforms during switching would provide information about the magnitude and frequency of small <b>re-ignitions</b> and re-strikes. However, measuring waveforms at a moderately high frequency require plant outages to connect equipment. In recent years, there have been increasing interests in using RF measurements in condition monitoring of switchgear. The RF measurement technique used for measuring circuit breaker inter-pole switching time during capacitor bank closing is of particular interest. In this thesis, research has been carried out to investigate switching transients produced during circuit breaker switching capacitor banks and shunt reactors using a non-intrusive measurement technique. The proposed technique measures the high frequency and low frequency voltage waveforms during switching operations without the need of an outage. The principles of this measurement technique are discussed and field measurements were carried out at shunt rector and capacitor bank installation in two 275 kV air insulated substations. Results of the measurements are presented and discussed in this thesis. The proposed technique shows that it is relatively easy to monitor circuit breaker switching transients and useful information on switching instances can be extracted from the measured waveforms. Further research works are discussed to realise the full potential of the measuring technique...|$|R
