5|$|The Soviet <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> {{system was}} seen as the quickest, cleanest and {{cheapest}} way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their resources from the automobile industry to the <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> system was the most intensively used in the world.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil Bogue presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> line running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport.

By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E
