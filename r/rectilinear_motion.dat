25|$|Samuel Tolver Preston {{illustrated}} {{that many}} of the postulates introduced by Le Sage concerning the gravitational particles, such as <b>rectilinear</b> <b>motion,</b> rare interactions, etc.., could be collected under the single notion that they behaved (on the cosmological scale) as the particles of a gas with an extremely long mean free path. Preston also accepted Kelvin's proposal of internal energy modes of the particles. He illustrated Kelvin's model by comparing it with the collision of a steel ring and an anvil - the anvil would not be shaken very much, but the steel ring would be in a state of vibration and therefore departs with diminished velocity. He also argued, that the mean free path of the particles is at least the distance between the planets - on longer distances the particles regain their translational energy due collisions with each other, so he concluded that on longer distances there would be no attraction between the bodies, independent of their size. Paul Drude suggested that this could possibly be a connection with some theories of Carl Gottfried Neumann and Hugo von Seeliger, who proposed some sort of absorption of gravity in open space.|$|E

These problems consist of sedimentation starting from rest, impulsive motion in a quiescent fluid, and oscillatory sliding motion. The equations of motion are integro-differential equations with a weakly singular kernel.

As a result, the storm began to slightly accelerate as it moved along a subtropical ridge due to the absorption of Karen by the stronger Iris.|$|R
60|$|We {{imagine a}} large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars and other appreciable masses, that we have before us {{approximately}} the conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space (world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in motion continue permanently in uniform <b>rectilinear</b> <b>motion.</b> As reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus.

60|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations have concurred {{in the establishment}} of the view that a gas is a body, the particles of which are in incessant <b>rectilinear</b> <b>motion</b> at high velocities, colliding with one another and bounding back when they strike the walls of the containing vessel; and, on this theory, the already ascertained relations of gaseous bodies to heat and pressure {{have been shown to be}} deducible from mechanical principles. Immense improvements have been effected, in the means of exhausting a given space of its gaseous contents; and experimentation on the phenomena which attend the electric discharge and the action of radiant heat, within the extremely rarefied media thus produced, has yielded a great number of remarkable results, some of which have been made familiar to the public by the Gieseler tubes and the radiometer. Already, these investigations have afforded an unexpected insight into the constitution of matter and its relations with thermal and electric energy, and they open up a vast field for future inquiry into some of the deepest problems of physics. Other important steps, in the same direction, have been effected by investigations into the absorption of radiant heat proceeding from different sources by solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies. And it is a curious example of the interconnection of the various branches of physical science, that some of the results thus obtained have proved of great importance in meteorology.|$|E
60|$|This {{class of}} {{considerations}} {{leads to a}} conception which we shall find to be of great importance, that of a Permanent Cause, or original natural agent. There exist in nature a number of permanent causes, which have subsisted ever since the human race has been in existence, and for an indefinite and probably an enormous length of time previous. The sun, the earth, and planets, with their various constituents, air, water, and other distinguishable substances, whether simple or compound, of which nature is made up, are such Permanent Causes. These have existed, and the effects or consequences which they were fitted to produce have taken place (as often as the other conditions of the production met), {{from the very beginning}} of our experience. But we can give no account of the origin of the Permanent Causes themselves. Why these particular natural agents existed originally and no others, or why they are commingled in such and such proportions, and distributed in such and such a manner throughout space, is a question we can not answer. More than this: we can discover nothing regular in the distribution itself; we can reduce it to no uniformity, to no law. There are no means by which, from the distribution of these causes or agents in one part of space, we could conjecture whether a similar distribution prevails in another. The co-existence, therefore, of Primeval Causes ranks, to us, among merely casual concurrences: and all those sequences or co-existences among the effects of several such causes, which, though invariable while those causes co-exist, would, if the co-existence terminated, terminate along with it, we do not class as cases of causation, or laws of nature: we can only calculate on finding these sequences or co-existences where we know by direct evidence, that the natural agents on the properties of which they ultimately depend, are distributed in the requisite manner. These Permanent Causes are not always objects; they are sometimes events, that is to say, periodical cycles of events, that being the only mode in which events can possess the property of permanence. Not only, for instance, is the earth itself a permanent cause, or primitive natural agent, but the earth’s rotation is so too: it is a cause which has produced, from the earliest period (by the aid of other necessary conditions), the succession of day and night, the ebb and flow of the sea, and many other effects, while, as we can assign no cause (except conjecturally) for the rotation itself, it is entitled to be ranked as a primeval cause. It is, however, only the origin of the rotation which is mysterious to us: once begun, its continuance is accounted for by the first law of motion (that of the permanence of <b>rectilinear</b> <b>motion</b> once impressed) combined with the gravitation of the parts of the earth toward one another.|$|E

25|$|It was {{a problem}} posed by Wren that serves as an {{ultimate}} source to the conception of Newton's Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis. Robert Hooke had theorised that planets, moving in vacuo, describe orbits around the Sun because of a <b>rectilinear</b> inertial <b>motion</b> by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to Halley and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, {{within the context of}} Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the Kepler's laws with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, De motu corporum in gyrum, which was later to be expanded into the Principia.|$|R

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{was carried out in}} the School of Engineering Science, University of Warwick, between October 1984 and October 1987. Chapter 1 contains a review of recent developments in instrumentation that require both manipulation and measurement over the range 0. 1 - 100 nm. The instruments considered are the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM), Stylus techniques, X-ray interferometry and x-ray microscopy. The rest of the thesis presents the design and assessment of a novel STM incorporating an X-ray interferometer, an ultra-high precision stylus measuring instrument and an x-ray microscope two axis specimen translation stage. Chapters 2 and 3 present an assessment of different mechanisms for the production of <b>rectilinear</b> <b>motions</b> having parasitic errors of better than mm. Theoretical and experimental investigations into monolithic parallel spring systems based on a notch type hinge and long range slideways based on a polymeric bearing sliding on a polished glass prism are presented. Optimisation of a soleniod magnet force transducer is presented as a drive technique for the former device, whilst a mechanically non-influencing feedscrew drive is described for the latter system. A stylus based measuring instrument, called "Nanosurf 2 ", that incorporates the polymeric slideway is presented in chapter 4. The performance of this system has been assessed and the results are presented in the following chapter. The linearity and accuracy of an electromagnetically driven, single crystal silicon, monolithic spring make it a suitable for use as the translation mechanism in a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope. Consequently, a three-axis spring has been constructed to generate the translations required for imaging. An X-ray interferometer is built into the probe axis to facilitate absolute calibration. This work is preceeded by an investigation into the generation of complex shapes in this brittle material. Finally, the current status of this work is reported with the presentation of initial experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Einstein's {{relation}} E=Mc^ 2 {{between the}} energy E {{and the mass}} M {{is the cornerstone of}} the relativity theory. This relation is often derived in a context of the relativistic theory for closed systems which do not accelerate. By contrast, Newtonian approach to the mass is based on an accelerated motion. We study here a particular neoclassical field model of a particle governed by a nonlinear Klein-Gordon (KG) field equation. We prove that if a solution to the nonlinear KG equation and its energy density concentrate at a trajectory, then this trajectory and the energy must satisfy the relativistic version of Newton's law with the mass satisfying Einstein's relation. Therefore the internal energy of a localized wave affects its acceleration in an external field as the inertial mass does in Newtonian mechanics.

40|$|The {{vibratory}} conveyor, routinely {{employed for}} normal-gravity transport of granular materials, usually {{consists of a}} continuous open trough vibrated sinusoidally to induce axial movement of a granular material.

We present a detailed analysis of the mechanics of transport, based on a rigid-slab model for the granular mass with frictional (Coulomb) slip at the upper and lower walls. The form of the vibration cycle plays a crucial role, and the optimal conveying cycle is not the commonly assumed <b>rectilinear</b> sinusoidal <b>motion.</b> The conveying efficiency for the novel slide conveyor will be presented for several simple vibration cycles, including one believed to represent the theoretical optimum...|$|R
