40|$|Evidence {{that death}} and injury rates for young {{children}} involved in automobile collisions could be reduced if children were restrained prompted the State of Tennessee to pass the nation's first child passenger law, a law that became effective in January 1978. Although similar laws have now been enacted throughout the United States, usually <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> are not provided to low-income groups who may have difficulty affording them. Few {{studies have examined the}} use of such devices by welfare recipients. A total of 56 black women, receiving Medicaid and residing in inner city Memphis, were interviewed about their use of passenger restraints during automobile travel for their children ages 0 - 3 years. About two-thirds of the mothers interviewed said they rarely or never used child passenger <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> when transporting their child. Children age 3 years were significantly less likely to be transported in child <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> than younger children. Women who had received welfare payments for 3 years or more or who made fewer than one automobile trip a week with their child were significantly less likely to use child passenger restraints. These results suggest that, in spite of child passenger laws, automobile <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> are not used for a high percentage of children ages 0 - 3 years receiving medical care under State and Federal Medicaid programs. Since treatment costs are paid under these programs when children are injured in collisions, program administrators may have strong incentives to increase the proportion of these children being restrained while traveling in motor vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Objective.  To {{investigate}} physical restraint-related injuries. Areas {{of interest}} were {{the prevalence of}} injury, types of injuries, risk of sustaining an injury and specific <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> associated with injury. Definitions.  Injury {{in the context of}} this review was considered to be either direct injury, such as lacerations and strangulation, or indirect injury considered to be an adverse outcome such as increased mortality rates or duration of hospitalization. Method.  A comprehensive search was undertaken that involved all major databases and the reference list of all relevant papers. To be included in the review studies had to involve people in acute or residential care settings and report data related to injury caused by <b>restraint</b> <b>devices.</b> A number of different types of research designs were included in the review. The findings of studies were pooled using odds ratio and narrative discussion. Results.  The search identified 11 papers reporting the findings of 12 observational studies. These studies were supplemented with the findings of a number of other types of studies that reported restraint-related data. The review highlights the potential danger of using physical restraint in acute and residential health care facilities. Observational studies suggest that physical restraint may increase the risk of death, falls, serious injury and increased duration of hospitalization. However, there is little information to enable the magnitude of the problem to be determined. Discussion.  Many of the findings highlight the urgent need for further investigation into the use of physical restraint in health care facilities. Further research should investigate the magnitude of the problem and specific <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> associated with injury. However, given the limited nature of the evidence, this association should be investigated further using rigorous research methods. David Evans, Jacquelin Wood and Leonnie Lamber...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{incidence}} of unknown routes {{of infectious diseases}} {{has become a major}} public health concern. <b>Restraint</b> <b>devices</b> such as handcuffs used by selected security agency from three 3 Police Stations in Accra were investigated for bacterial contamination. Five 5 handcuffs including two 2 slightly used ones two 2 frequently used ones and one 1 sealed unused handcuff was purposely selected for the study. The presence and quantity of Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli and total coliforms on the handcuffs were measured. The Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli and coliforms showed positive on all the four 4 used handcuffs but were not found on the sealed unused handcuff. There was more contamination on frequently used handcuffs than slightly used ones. The presence and quantity of bacterial contaminants indicated Staphylococcus aureus 64 Escherichia coli 8 and total coliforms 28. This shows that used handcuffs harbour pathogenic bacteria and could serve as potential routes of infectious diseases among users. This requires sensitization of the public on the cleaning of handcuffs between uses with disinfectants. Education on the use and cleaning of handcuff to users and security agencies could enhance environmental hygiene of <b>restraint</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
50|$|Handcuffs are <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> {{designed}} to secure an individual's wrists close together. They comprise two parts, linked {{together by a}} chain, a hinge, or rigid bar. Each half has a rotating arm which engages with a ratchet that prevents it from being opened once closed around a person's wrist. Without the key, the handcuffs cannot be removed and so the handcuffed person is unable to move his or her wrists {{more than a few}} centimetres/inches apart, making many tasks difficult or impossible. This is usually done to prevent suspected criminals from escaping police custody.|$|R
5000|$|A gag {{is usually}} an item or device {{designed}} to prevent speech, often as a <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> to stop the subject from calling for help and keep its wearer quiet. This is usually done by blocking the mouth, partially or completely, or attempting to prevent the tongue, lips, or jaw from moving in the normal patterns of speech. The more [...] "effective" [...] a gag appears to be, the more hazardous it is: for example, duct tape is fairly effective at keeping one's mouth shut but is hazardous {{if for some reason}} (e.g., the common cold) the subject cannot breathe freely through the nose. For this reason, a gagged person should never be left alone.|$|E
50|$|The {{seat belts}} used are five- or six-point harness, which have two straps coming {{down over the}} driver's shoulders, two straps {{wrapping}} around the waist, {{and one or two}} coming up between the legs. Since a string of accidents in 2000 and 2001 that killed Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin, Tony Roper and Dale Earnhardt (plus several other drivers in minor circuits) under similar circumstances, NASCAR has made it mandatory for the drivers to wear the HANS device. Though NASCAR allowed another system, the Hutchens device, in the past, since 2005 HANS is the only head and neck <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> allowed for use. Recently, Hutchens has been allowed again by NASCAR, as seen by its usage by Kyle Larson and Austin Dillon. The HANS device reduces the risk of whiplash during a crash.|$|E
50|$|The {{device was}} first {{adopted by the}} National Hot Rod Association in 1996, {{following}} the death of Top Fuel driver Blaine Johnson, but wasn't a mandatory device until 2004, after the death of 2003 Top Fuel Rookie of the Year Darrell Russell, who was killed during the Sears Craftsman Nationals in Madison, Illinois (Darrell Russell was killed by flying debris). Since that time, all drivers in all categories, either professional, or sportsman, must wear a HANS device, or risk immediate disqualification from the event. Much like NASCAR, the NHRA authorized the use of both the HANS, and the Hutchens device until 2005, when the HANS became the sole head and neck <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> used. The major difference between the HANS device used in NASCAR, CART, or Formula 1, and the one used in the NHRA is that {{the main part of the}} device is molded from high strength polymers. The NHRA version is also wrapped with seven layers of Nomex fabric, which is the same material as the seven-layer fire suits that all NHRA drivers must wear. This extra precaution prevents the device from melting should an engine fire occur.|$|E

50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a {{quick-release}} locking pin mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|R
50|$|Alexander's death, {{caused by}} a basilar skull {{fracture}} sustained in the impact, was the sixth in two years. Other high-profile drivers killed in this period included Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin, Jr., Tony Roper and Dale Earnhardt. As a result of Alexander's crash, NASCAR announced {{that the use of}} head and neck <b>restraint</b> <b>devices</b> would be required to keep drivers safe from these types of injuries, caused by rapid deceleration in wrecks. The use of such devices had been optional up until Alexander's death, though 41 out of 43 drivers in NASCAR's top series were already using them. Only Tony Stewart and Jimmy Spencer had not worn them yet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signals from}} the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various {{additional}} restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and [...] "curtain" [...] airbags which cover the side glass). Each <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> is typically activated {{with one or more}} pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, {{after getting}} his bachelors {{in math and}} science from Vivekananda College, Dr. Datta was {{employed}} by Kuljin, an American civil engineering company in India. While working for this company, he was faced with a very competitive work environment which fostered in him the feeling that he could do something though his experiences there. [...] Working for Kuljin was also very important in his academic pursuits; in order to be accepted to the prestigious Bengal University’s College of Engineering, experience in the field was required among many other rigorous tests. [...] After a few years of working for Kuljin, Dr. Datta applied to Bengal University and was accepted.After acquiring his degree in Civil Engineering at the Bengal Engineering College of the University of Calcutta, he traveled to Detroit, Michigan, in 1967. [...] While studying for his masters degree at Wayne State University, he worked in the Wayne State mailing room to support himself. He was eventually hired as a part-time professor at Wayne State. [...] Dr. Datta was hired as a full-time faculty member in 1973 by Wayne State. While at Wayne State, Dr. Datta has worked on many research projects for MDOT, {{in addition to being a}} professor of Transportation Engineering. After his first year of employment, he received a grant to run safety training programs throughout the state. [...] Dr. Datta then created the Transportation Research Group (TRG) at Wayne State and has led numerous grant projects through this group. Some projects the TRG completed in recent years include “2005 and 2007 Child <b>Restraint</b> <b>Device</b> Use and Misuse Survey,” the “Susan Harwood Training Grant - OSHA Training Material Development for Highway Construction Work Zones and Traffic Control Hazards,” and a study on the “Identification of Targeted Enforcement Locations for the Reduction of Speed-Related Crashes”. Around the same time he was hired as a full-time faculty member at Wayne State, Dr. Datta also began working for Goodell Grivas Inc., a structural engineering consulting firm in Southfield, Michigan. This company was responsible for engineering the structural steel of Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field) as it was being constructed in Cleveland, OH, as well as the roof on Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1981, Dr. Datta became the sole owner of Goodell Grivas Inc after one of the existing owners died. Dr. Datta walked away from the company in the early 1990s to fully dedicate his time to research and teaching at Wayne State.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe {{present study}} {{examined}} a cardiac passive <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> which applies epicardial pressure (HeartNet Implant; Paracor Medical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) in a clinically relevant model of dilated cardiomyopathy to determine effects on hemodynamic and myocardial blood flow patterns. MethodsDilated cardiomyopatht {{was established in}} 10 pigs (3 weeks of atrial pacing, 240 beats/min). Hemodynamic parameters and regional left ventricular blood flow were measured under baseline conditions and after acute placement of the HeartNet Implant. Measurements were repeated after adenosine infusion, allowing maximal coronary vasodilation and coronary flow reserve to be determined. ResultsLeft ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction occurred relative to baseline as measured by echocardiography. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased and left ventricular fractional shortening decreased (3. 8 ± 0. 1 vs 6. 1 ± 0. 2 cm and 31. 6 % ± 0. 5 % vs 16. 2 % ± 2. 1 %, both P < . 05, respectively), consistent with the dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype. The HeartNet Implant was successfully deployed without arrhythmias and a computed median mid–left ventricular epicardial pressure of 1. 4 mm Hg was applied by the HeartNet Implant throughout the cardiac cycle. Acute HeartNet placement did not adversely affect steady state hemodynamics. With the HeartNet Implant in place, coronary reserve was significantly blunted. ConclusionsIn a large animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy, the cardiac passive <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> {{did not appear to}} adversely affect basal resting myocardial blood flow. However, after acute HeartNet Implant placement, left ventricular maximal coronary reserve was blunted. These unique results suggest that cardiac passive restraint devices that apply epicardial transmural pressure can alter myocardial blood flow patterns in a model of dilated cardiomyopathy. Whether this blunting of coronary reserve holds clinical relevance with chronic passive <b>restraint</b> <b>device</b> placement remains unestablished...|$|E
