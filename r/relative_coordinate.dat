5000|$|In {{the theory}} of many-particle systems, Jacobi {{coordinates}} often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation. These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic molecules and chemical reactions, and in celestial mechanics. An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for N bodies may be based upon binary trees.

The position coordinates xj and xk are replaced by their relative position rjk = xj &minus; xk and by the vector to their center of mass Rjk = (mj qj + mkqk)/(mj + mk).

40|$|Abstract — Scalable network {{localization}} is key for realizing ad-hoc networks. In {{this paper}} we propose a localization scheme where nodes form a <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate</b> system of the network in a distributed manner. Each node in the adhoc network is capable of estimating both the range and orientation of its 1 -hop neighbors. The proposed localization scheme then achieves a <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate</b> system for any topology as long as the underlying graph is connected, irrespective of the node density. We evaluate the performace of the proposed scheme and show with simulations that it is more scalable than a similar localization scheme that uses triangulation. We also present propagation of localization error in the network due to estimation errors in both the range and the orientation. We also discuss how this scheme can be implemented using optical wireless technology. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a few-body mixture of two bosonic components, each {{consisting of two}} particles confined in a quasi one-dimensional harmonic trap. By means of exact diagonalization with a correlated basis approach we obtain the low-energy spectrum and eigenstates for {{the whole range of}} repulsive intra- and inter-component interaction strengths. We analyse the eigenvalues {{as a function of the}} inter-component coupling, covering hereby all the limiting regimes, and characterize the behaviour in-between these regimes by exploiting the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Provided with this knowledge we study the breathing dynamics in the linear-response regime by slightly quenching the trap frequency symmetrically for both components. Depending on the choice of interactions strengths, we identify 1 to 3 monopole modes besides the breathing mode of the center of mass coordinate. For the uncoupled mixture each monopole mode corresponds to the breathing oscillation of a specific <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate.</b> Increasing the inter-component coupling first leads to multi-mode oscillations in each <b>relative</b> <b>coordinate,</b> which turn into single-mode oscillations of the same frequency in the composite-fermionization regime.
