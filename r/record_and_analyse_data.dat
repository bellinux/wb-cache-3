40|$|The DLR Institute of Flight Guidance {{is one of}} {{the leading}} establishments in the field of air traffic {{management}} research worldwide. Research is conducted using several simulation environments. Simulators like the Tower Simulator, the Approach and Radar Simulator, and different fast-time simu¬lation tools focus on different parts of air traffic and help to examine various aspects of the air traffic environment (e. g. controller view, pilot view, general traffic situation, etc.). The institute's research activities include validation and verification of new systems and procedures, such as airport infrastructure, routes, or assistance systems for air traffic controllers and pilots. Most software systems to operate the simulators are commercial products that concentrate on simulation, and do not emphasise on analysis of simulation outcome. Other tools do provide detailed output for subsequent analysis, but output content and format varies widely between tools, requiring specific post-processing for each simulation environment. In the past, DLR developers have implemented numerous tools to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> <b>data</b> from individual simulations. These tools were developed independently for different simulators, different simulation campaigns, using several different programming languages. The underlying algorithms were often not sufficiently tested and documented, and tool validation itself was often a by-product of simulation evaluation. The Extensible Workflow Management for Simulations (EWMS) was developed to support, simplify and enhance the process of simulation analysis and evaluation. The main objectives of the EWMS concept are a consistent data backup strategy, transparent post processing and standardised, well docu¬mented and peer-reviewed algorithms and methods for analysis and reporting. This paper describes the motivation for the EWMS project and the requirements that drive the design, followed by a discussion of the implementation for a number of key concepts...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{contribute}} to a municipal information system to support decision making in urban planning and development control, with regard to the recording and analysis needs of spatially related data. The analysis of the situation in Portuguese municipalities has permitted the conclusions that the present use of computers and information systems in planning is still very incipient. As a result, there are no integrated systems in existence in order to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> <b>data</b> which would permit an adequate support in the processes of decision-making. In using a systems approach, and beginning with the listing and specification of the main processes of municipal urban administration, a conceptual model of municipal information system has been developed. It has been concluded that there is a great need for the existence of a municipal information office. An operational model has been developed, based on guidelines and constraints resulting from the conceptual model, whose operative structure consists of three distinct modes of operation: alphanumeric, graphic and hybrid. Each one of these modes was developed in this piece of work. The analysis of information needs in urban planning and development control, {{as well as that of}} available sources, have permitted the identification of the information needed for decision support. In addition, a classification and coding structure was developed. An information system was set-up based on data related to Vieira do Minho and Albufeira do Emal with the purpose of implementing the information system model developed. This permitted the treatment of different scales and objectives. Finally, a construction licensing model, linked to the information system, was developed. It was hereby demonstrated that the operation model developed was able to accept and implement the development control processes presented in the conceptual model. Using the Albufeira do Emal system, an illustrative example was presentedAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.

40|$|During {{the last}} couple of decades, {{information}} technology has become a ubiquitous part of almost all areas of everyday life; exercise and sports being no exception. Sports technology can be defined as digital entities, with which one can measure, <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> <b>data</b> on sports and physical activity, and refine it according to the needs of its users. This kind of technology has already been researched quite extensively. The majority of this research has concentrated on the effects of sports technology on the level of physical activity of its users, and on the adherence of users to different kinds of physical activity recommendations. In addition to this, within this research, sports technology has been seen as a measurement tool: the interest has been either on the accuracy of the data produced by the technology or on the level of physical activity as measured by sports technology. However, the relationships between sports technology and its users has hardly been researched. To address this identified gap, this thesis (based on phenomenographic approach) concentrates on this relationship: why is sports technology used, for which purposes it is used, what kind of meanings are assigned to it and what kind of feelings are connected to its use? As a result of this thesis, a theory on the agency of use of sports technology, and a model of the context of use of sports technology and its dimensions are presented. This theory describes its core category – the agency of use of sports technology – through four different categories. These categories are exercise and sports, sociality, technology, information and service, which are further described by 17 subcategories. The agency of use is influenced by a Giddensian structure of being a decent exercising citizen, which is present in the Finnish society. The presented theory is situated on the continuum from utilitarian to hedonic motives of use. Together these components form the value, which is the basic motive of a user to use sports technology and through which the continuous use is maintained so that the agency of use can take form. The context of use of sports technology consists of four dimensions: the real-world context of use, the individual self, sociality, and community and society. This model of the context of use is broader than the concept of context commonly used within the research of information systems science. The results presented also widen the traditional way of explaining the adoption and use of technology within information systems science into the direction of understanding the relationship between technology and its users. As practical implications, the developers of sports technology can utilise the results of this thesis to better understand the meanings and expectations connected to use of sports technology. This new understanding could be incorporated into the development processes of their products and services...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of routine outpatient assessment of well functioning patients after primary {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) is to detect asymptomatic failure of prostheses to guide recommendations for early intervention. In a tertiary referral arthroplasty centre, conducting approximately 250 primary THAs and 50 Revision THAs per annum, we have observed that the revision of THAs in asymptomatic patients is a very uncommon occurrence. We therefore question the requirement for routine follow-up of asymptomatic patients after THA. Following Ethics approval, a prospective analysis of an orthopaedic database identified 158 patients whom received 177 revision THAs over a 4 year period.

The institute's research activities include validation and verification of new systems and procedures, such as airport infrastructure, routes, or assistance systems for air traffic controllers and pilots. Most software systems to operate the simulators are commercial products that concentrate on simulation, and do not emphasise on analysis of simulation outcome. The software environments for the Tower and Radar Simulator were originally designed in order to train air traffic controllers, with little provisions for in-depth data analysis. Other tools do provide detailed output for subsequent analysis, but output content and format varies widely between tools, requiring specific post-processing for each simulation environment. In the past, DLR developers have implemented numerous tools to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> <b>data</b> from individual simulations. These tools were developed independently for different simulators, different simulation campaigns, using several different programming languages. For use in specific campaigns the tools often had to be adapted or re-implemented from scratch. Finally, the underlying algorithms were often not sufficiently tested and documented, and tool validation itself was often a by-product of simulation evaluation. The Extensible Workflow Management for Simulations (EWMS) was developed to support, simplify and enhance the process of simulation analysis and evaluation. The main objectives of the EWMS concept are: Data backup strategy – Considering the effort needed to gain simulation data (up to six months of preparation and several weeks of simulation execution) the recorded data presents a substantial value. Thus, the EWMS employs a client-server approach to offer a consistent backup strategy, using an off-the-shelf data repository system for backup and versioning of project data, to prevent data loss and to ensure adherence to quality management standards for data handling. Transparent post processing – The EWMS was designed to support the scientific evaluation of simulation data by those scientists that run the actual simulation campaigns. These scientists need not be familiar with the technical details of the simulation environment, or with the mathematical and computer science aspects of the evaluation algorithms. The EWMS provides an environment that automates several aspects of the overall workflow and makes them transparent to the user. This includes backup and version control, as well as the transformation of simulation specific output into a generic format for further processing. Standardised reporting – Until now, the different simulation environments and even different campaigns used their own algorithms and methods for data analysis. In some cases, these differed even between users of the same environment. Consequently, comparison of results was often difficult, if not impossible because of variations in the underlying assumptions. The EWMS offers standardised, well documented and peer-reviewed algorithms and methods for analysis and reporting, enabling comparison between different simulation environments, ensuring and enhancing the overall quality of the results. The EWMS environment provides an abstraction layer that separates the data format of a specific environment from the generic reporting capabilities. This abstraction guarantees that all users can perform the same analyses using common algorithms and methods, regardless of the specific simulation environment used. Scientists can focus on data interpretation while keeping the overhead for data manipulation to a minimum. The results can be displayed numerically or as standardised diagrams, and can be exported for easy inclusion in documents. The EWMS is built around a generic core supported by numerous modules that add support for simulation environments or provide new algorithms for analysis and reporting. The core provides generic functionality including the overall user interface, the repository server connection and a built-in SQL database. Those capabilities are made available to the simulation-specific environments and the reporting modules. The simulation-specific code encapsulates the handling of simulation input and output, as well as data transformation into the generic format required by the reporting modules. Reports publish their input requirements and are shown only when the active simulation environment is capable of delivering the required data. This modular approach simplifies distributed software development, integrating developers from different departments that work on their specific areas of expertise. Looking forward, the EWMS development continues with a focus on two major issues. Based on user requests, additional reporting capabilities will be added that will be of benefit for all users of the supported simulators. Also, additional simulation environments will be integrated to widen the user base...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of music}} {{analysis}} is to enlighten {{our understanding of}} a piece of music. The role of musical performance analysis is to help us understand how a performer interprets a piece of music. The current work provides a tool which combines music analysis with performance analysis. By combining music and performance analysis in one system new questions can be asked {{of a piece of}} music: how is the structure of a piece reflected in the performance and how can the performance enlighten our understanding of the piece's structure? The current work describes a unified database which can store and present musical score alongside associated performance data and musical analysis. Using a general purpose representation language, Performance Mark-up Language (PML), aspects of performance are <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysed.</b> <b>Data</b> thus acquired from one project is made available to others. Presentation involves high-quality scores suitably annotated with the requested information. Such output is easily and directly accessible to musicians, performance scientists and analysts. We define a set of data structures and operators which can operate on musical pitch and musical time, and use them to form the basis of a query language for a musical database. The database can store musical information (score, gestural data, etc.). Querying the database results in annotations of the musical score. The database is capable of storing musical score information and performance data and cross-referencing them. It is equipped with the necessary primitives to execute music-analytical queries, and highlight notes identified from the score and display performance data alongside the score...|$|R
40|$|The Operating Room (OR) is {{a complex}} environment, where a large variety of {{patients}} and diseases can be treated and many unexpected events occur (such as emergency surgeries and unexpected progress of procedures). In practice, OR assistants support OR processes {{as well as they}} can, in order to deliver safe and efficient care. Therefore, they have to be aware of this complex environment, understand the situation at hand, and act accordingly. Technological support systems in the OR should strive to support OR processes in the same way OR assistants do it. The objective of this thesis is to develop technology to support healthcare professionals in improving patient safety and efficiency in the OR. The first part presents a new approach on how to improve patient safety. This approach, called adaptive support, stands for the development of support systems that are adaptive to the different situations in the OR: automating and standardising processes when possible, and providing information and increasing awareness when needed. Technology {{plays a key role in}} adaptive support, especially in <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>data</b> to gain a deep understanding of OR processes, in real- time recognition of a situation and in designing adaptive support systems. Each of the following parts of this thesis presents one topic that have been selected to test our approach in practice: OR devices, surgical instruments and OR scheduling. The ‘Digital Operating Room Assistant’ can be seen as an approach to support surgical practice in the same adaptive manner as operating room assistants. This thesis provides insights into how such technology can be developed, with the involvement of various disciplines, to make the surgical process easier and safer. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In mammals, {{maternal}} care {{represents a}} major constituent of the early-life environment {{and its influence}} on individual development has been documented in rodents, non-human primates, humans and recently in adult dogs. The {{quality and quantity of}} mother-offspring interactions exerts a multilevel regulation upon the physiological, cognitive, and behavioural development of the offspring. For example, in rats variations in maternal behaviour, such as mother-pup body contact and the amount of licking towards pups in the nest during the early days after parturition, influences the endocrine, emotional, and behavioural responses to stress in the offspring. This produces long-term consequences, which may remain into adulthood and can be transmitted to subsequent generations. Literature about maternal care in dogs and its effect on puppy behaviour is still scarce, although the topic is receiving a growing interest. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effects of morning maternal care on behavioural responses of puppies to new environmental and social stimuli. In order to achieve this, maternal care (licking, ano-genital licking, nursing and mother-puppy contact) was assessed in eight litters of domestic dogs living in standard rearing conditions during the first three weeks post-partum. Puppies were subjected to two behavioural tests (arena and isolation tests) at 58 - 60 days of age, and their behavioural responses were video <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysed.</b> <b>Data</b> was <b>analysed</b> using multivariate analyses (PCA, PLS). During the isolation test, a higher level of maternal care was associated with more exploration and a higher latency to emit the first yelp; on the contrary, a lower level of maternal care was associated with increased locomotion, distress vocalisations and destructive behaviours directed at the enclosure. These results, comparable to those reported in laboratory rat models and to some extent to those recently reported in dog literature, highlight the importance of maternal care on the behavioural development of domestic dog puppies...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} methods of <b>recording,</b> processing <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> sound <b>data</b> from wheel brake testing in dynamometers with focus on detecting and measuring squeal. The desired outcome is a method that Scania can use to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> brake sound. A literature study was made to find relevant methodologies and tools proposed in papers, books and industry standards. These methods were tried <b>and</b> evaluated by <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> real sound <b>data</b> <b>and</b> other signals from one of Scanias dynamometers. The resulting method includes directions on what hardware to use, how {{to set it up}} and an algorithm that computes a spectral limit based on normal sound data. This limit is then used as reference when evaluating other recordings. To increase signal to noise ratio, an adaptive filter is proposed to attenuate background noise in the recordings, in particular from the dynamometer and ventilation system. The conclusion is {{that it is possible to}} find squeal using spectral limits based on normal data. The performance of the algorithm is a compromise between being very effective but rather complex, or slightly less effective but also less complex. Its performance is also highly dependent on how squeal is defined. A very narrow definition will only find certain types of squeal while a more broad definition will find more squeal, but also potentially mislabel some recordings...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{advances}} in gene expression analysis as well as protein and metabolite quantification enable genome-scale capturing of complex biological processes {{at the molecular level}} in crop field trials. This opens up new possibilities for understanding the molecular and environmental complexity of field-based systems and thus shedding light on the black box between genotype and environment, which in agriculture always is influenced by a multi-stress environment and includes management interventions. Nevertheless, combining different types of data obtained from the field and making biological sense out of large datasets remain challenging. Here we highlight the need to create a cross-disciplinary platform for innovative experimental design, sampling and subsequent analysis of large-scale molecular data obtained in field trials. For these reasons we put forward the term field-omics: “Field-omics strives to couple information from genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes and metagenomes to the long-established practice in crop science of conducting field trials as well as to adapt current strategies for <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> field <b>data</b> to facilitate integration with ‘-omics’ data. ...|$|R

There is, thus, a pressing need for work which resources {{our understanding of the}} process of inquiry learning in less formal contexts, such as after-school clubs. In recent years, educational policy makers in the UK have been very concerned with a personalization agenda. This is defined and understood in many different ways, but one aspect is the possibility of learner choice. It is this element of choice that is reflected in the idea of personal inquiries. In this chapter the focus is on inquiries that students themselves develop, in the semi-formal context of an after-school club, supported by their teachers and researchers and resourced by a technology toolkit: nQuire. Specifically, key issues and challenges in relation to the orchestration of inquiry learning within semi-formal settings are discussed. The chapter begins by considering the importance of informal and semi-formal inquiry science learning and how these terms are understood in the literature, followed by a review of related work. A case study follows that discusses the processes of inquiry learning in a Geography after-school club, the "Sustainability Squad", which ran for 11 weeks. The students' main inquiries focused on food decomposition experiments and how variables such as the nature of the food and packaging affected this. They monitored the decay of different foodstuffs, observing, <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>data,</b> reflecting on their findings and presenting them to the other students in the club. This less formal setting provided the opportunity for types of inquiry that could not be supported within the formal curriculum, and also for the choice of inquiry to be decided by the students themselves. The case study describes how the nQuire toolkit was able to support a number of aspects of the students’ inquiries including: student choice; a representation of a jointly negotiated, personalized version of inquiry; defining the inquiry; providing a shared focus and for bridging the contexts of school and home. ...|$|R

Tasks and processes such as gathering content, meetings and other group related issues must be <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysed.</b> Time management is an important generic skill and should be nurtured in order to help promote the quality of student project work. Collecting time management data is usually an arduous task for many students involved in group-work. Student teams often do not collect time spent on activities accurately, and if they do, it is often on scrap pieces of paper without proper categories, which later requires much effort to analyse. Evaluating accurate timesheet data can result in higher order thinking- interpreting and evaluating how resources were used in the project. This type of analysis and reflection is a valuable generic skill, required in most project work, both in academic and workplace environments ie how effectively were resources used and could improvements be made?

Particular {{attention is paid to}} the comparison between articulatory results and corresponding acoustic measurements of F 2 in both vowels. Results show that the average di�erences between food and foot and their dynamic pro�les are similar in ar- ticulation and acoustics. In /u:l/ sequences (fool), tongue position is more advanced than could be inferred from its low F 2. In addition, even though the tongues position in fool and full is clearly distinct, there is no comparable corresponding di�erence in F 2. This suggests that the common articulatory metaphor that characterises F 2 increase as fronting must be used cautiously.

The phenomenon has long been recognized as important, yet {{it is only in the}} past decade that time-use researchers have begun seriously both to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> related <b>data.</b> Such studies have shown that a more fully informed understanding of the true extent of time use and activity participation can emerge through the consideration of multitasking. This, in turn, can present a more accurate picture upon which measures of change in time use can be assessed. This article is concerned with an exploratory discussion of the impact of the inclusion of multitasking data upon perception of change in time use as a result of Internet use. Following theoretical discussion, the article presents evidence from a longitudinal, diary-based panel study with around 100 participants and a questionnaire survey with 1000 participants. The article explores the prevalence of multitasking and reveals clear implications of Internet use for the same. In conclusion, those seeking to understand the influence of Internet use upon time use must include multitasking in their analysis if they are to avoid an incomplete and potentially misleading account of time use (and change therein) in the information age...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} a collaborative scheme {{for the development of}} a protocol for <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> managing the cultural heritage in Libya. The critical political situation in the country urges the development of cultural heritage management policies in order to protect it more thoroughly and consistently. Moving on from the numerous international initiatives and projects dealing with a mostly “remote” approach to the issue, the project here presented to engages with staff members of the Department of Antiquities (DoA) in the development of a joint strategy for the application of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) to the preservation and monitoring of Libyan cultural heritage. A series of training courses resulted in an initial development of new ways of <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> field <b>data</b> for a better awareness of the full range of threats that the archaeology of the country is subject to. Focussing on the case of the Jebel Nafusa, the training involved the assessment of site visibility on satellite imagery, the analysis of high-resolution satellite datasets for archaeological mapping, the creation of a GIS spatial database of field data, and the mapping of risks and threats to archaeology from remote sensing data. This led to the creation of of a risk map showing the areas that are affected by a number of threats, thus giving the DoA a tool to prioritise future fieldwork to keep the assessment of site damage up to date. Only a collaborative approach can lead to a sustainable strategy for the protection of the invaluable cultural heritage of Libya...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of team communication, or more specifically speaking up, for safeguarding quality {{of patient care}} is increasingly being endorsed in research findings. However, {{little is known about}} speaking up of clinical teachers in postgraduate medical training. In order to determine how clinical teachers demonstrate speaking up in formal teaching team meetings and what factors influence this, the authors carried out an exploratory study based on ethnographic principles. The authors selected 12 teaching teams <b>and</b> observed, audio <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysed</b> the <b>data.</b> Subsequently, during an interview, the program directors reflected on speaking up of those clinical teachers present during the meeting. Finally, the authors <b>analysed</b> iteratively all <b>data,</b> using a template analysis, based on Edmondson's behaviours of speaking up. The study was conducted from October 2013 to July 2014 and ten teams participated. During the teaching team meetings, the clinical teachers exhibited most of the behaviours of speaking up. "Sharing information" strongly resembles providing information and "talking about mistakes" occurs in a general sense and without commitment of improvement activities. "Asking questions" was often displayed by closed questions and at times several questions simultaneously. The authors identified factors that influence speaking up by clinical teachers: relational, cultural, and professional. The clinical teachers exhibit speaking up, but there is only limited awareness to discuss problems or mistakes and the discussion centred mainly on the question of blame. It is important {{to take into account the}} factors that influence speaking up, in order to stimulate open communication during the teaching team meeting...|$|R
40|$|In {{our field}} of higher education, {{researchers}} agree {{that students in}} the process of constructing knowledge benefit from peer collaborative learning. In fact, as a social species, all of us take part {{in a wide range of}} peer learning experiences each day. Those of us engaged in the study of peer learning seek to discover practices that prove highly effective in terms of student learning and persistence, as well as those that are transportable from one institution to another. The Australasian Journal of Peer Learning is dedicated to bringing its readers those articles that represent the best research and practices in the field. This foreword takes a brief look at Supplemental Instruction, or PASS, which has held a respected place in the field of peer learning since the early 1970 s. Supplemental Instruction, which Australian users of the model have brilliantly renamed and adapted into PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) has now reached the mature middle age of 35 years. Many ask what has given SI its staying power over the years. It’s such a simple idea: find the trouble spots in the curriculum; and with the permission of the lecturer, ask a student who has done well in the subject to help others master the content through small group collaborative activities; pay the group Leader; train the Leader to do certain things and not do others; <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> the <b>data,</b> <b>and</b> voila, you have something that works. Let me tell you the story of Supplemental Instruction, from its beginnings at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, to its widespread international adoption...|$|R

The speech of two groups, one consisting of five females from prestigious private schools in Johannesburg and the other consisting of five females from similar schools in Cape Town, was <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> the <b>data</b> <b>analysed</b> acoustically.

40|$|Introduction: Dose of {{rocuronium bromide}} usually used for rapid {{sequence}} intubation (RSI) allows rapid paralysis but {{the duration of}} action is prolonged making it unsuitable for short duration surgeries. Theoretically, use of low doses of neuromuscular blocking agents shortens the time for recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). Hence we studied the intubating conditions of rocuronium bromide at 2 × ED 95 dose (0. 6 mg/kg) in comparison with 3 × ED 95 dose (0. 9 mg/kg). Methods: Sixty patients aged 18 - 60 years, ASA PS 1 and 2 posted for elective surgeries requiring GA with endotracheal intubation were studied. Patients were randomized into two groups of 30 each (Group A and B), to receive either 0. 6 mg/kg rocuronium bromide or 0. 9 mg/kg rocuronium bromide. Intubating condition was assessed at 60 seconds. Onset and clinical duration were <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysed</b> using independent sample t-test and chi-square analysis. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in the intubating conditions between the groups (p= 0. 001) with 28 patients (93. 3...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe aim of this project is to ascertain whether the data in existing Police recording systems can be used by existing mature data mining techniques in an efficient manner to achieve results that are more accurate than those achieved by Police specialists when analysing crime. The Police Service has no formalised methodology of <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> crime <b>data</b> <b>and</b> it is incumbent on each Force to train and develop appropriate personnel to provide operational analysis. Police data is inconsistent and, frequently, incomplete making the task of formal analysis far more difficult and current analytical practices are semi-manual and time consuming producing results of limited accuracy. These analytical processes would benefit from using data mining techniques within a structured approach as discussed within this thesis. The usage of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques within a structured methodology to mining Police data is evaluated. The research demonstrates that data mining techniques can be successfully used in operational policing. High volume crimes such as burglary that have been committed by one or more known offenders can be classified and the model used to attribute currently undetected crimes to one or more of those known offenders. Burglary crimes that previously had no overt relationship and the identity of the offender is unknown can be clustered with the ability to suggest one or more offenders who may be responsible for committing the crime. The same techniques used in analysing high volume crime can be used to link low volume major crimes such as serious sexual assaults. The recognised benefits include an improvement in the accuracy of results over current semi-manual processes and a reduction in the time taken to achieve those results...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. Despite the {{substantial}} body of Educational Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research {{there is very}} little evidence that the theoretical frameworks that underpin research studies have been considered, or applied optimally. The central argument of this dissertation is that theoretical frameworks serve as epistemological guides that account for the knowledge that is produced in a study. The purpose of this inquiry is to explore how theoretical frameworks are evident in selected masters dissertations and doctoral theses at selected South African universities. A blended theoretical framework, situated in interpretivist theory, with an element of critical theory and positivist theory frames this study. A review of components of research dissertations required both quantified and qualitative data. A mixed methods approach was used to conduct a methodological inventory - cum survey review of 103 texts. A research template was devised in order to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> the <b>data</b> that would be isolated in a reading of the texts, with specific reference to the sections of texts that showed the use of terms related to theoretical frameworks. The findings reveal that studies that were theoretically developed yielded data that could be interpreted in more depth, while a substantial majority of authors that employed their theoretical frameworks in a very limited way, presented findings that were no more than descriptive in nature. I conclude that the reason for the theoretically impoverished studies is possibly, more broadly speaking, located in the wider South African socio-economic, political and localised context. South African Higher Education Institutions face pressures of having to produce masters and doctoral studies in order to secure funding, while supervisors face pressures of having to publish to secure promotion and employability. In the process, students are not given enough opportunity for theoretical emancipation...|$|R

40|$|Camellia japonica, an {{excellent}} flowering shrub for sub temperate and temperate areas, is somewhat difficult to propagate from cuttings {{since it is}} difficult to root and takes longer time for rooting. Keeping in mind its high cost and ever increasing demand in hilly areas of Uttarakhand, J&K and Himachal Pradesh, an attempt was made to propagate it from cuttings. Three types of cuttings viz., current season’s growth (Softwood), semi-hardwood (one year old) and hardwood were prepared and dipped in 250 and 500 ppm NAA and 500 and 1000 ppm IBA for 5 minutes before planting in pre-packed moist mixture of sharp river sand in propagation chamber at RHR & TS Mashobra-Shimla during second fortnight of July 2012. A relative humidity of 85 - 95 % was maintained during whole period of studies through manual misting with no temperature control under light intensity range of 2500 - 3500 foot candles from the month of July to October. Observations on different rooting parameters were <b>recorded</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>analysed.</b> Among different concentrations of chemicals used, 1000 ppm IBA was found most effective in producing the desirable results But the type of cutting has no effect on the parameters recorded...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) {{control is}} {{included}} in the eight Millennium Development Goals, with the aim to halve the prevalence and death rate associated with TB by 2015 compared to 1990. TB is a global public health crisis aggravated by the emergence of multidrug-resistance (MDR) and extensively drug-resistance (XDR). South Africa is currently ranked as the country with the third highest TB and fifth highest MDR-TB burden in the world. Sizwe Hospital is the only specialised TB hospital in the Gauteng Province, responsible for the management of MDR and XDR-TB. The number of admissions has increased since 2007, poor outcomes were reported, the treatment is expensive and patients stay for long periods in hospital. Risk factors and MDR-TB outcomes have not been well described in South Africa. Information on admission trends, demographic and clinical profiles as well as treatment outcomes are lacking and is critical to evaluate and strengthen the management of MDR and XDR-TB at Sizwe Hospital. Aim: The aim of the study is to describe and compare the admission trends and treatment outcomes of MDR and XDR-TB patients at Sizwe Hospital in Gauteng Province for the period January 2008 to December 2009. Methodology: The study design was an analytical cross-sectional study based on a record review of all adult MDR and XDR-TB patients admitted at Sizwe Hospital. Information was extracted from the medical <b>records</b> <b>and</b> drug-resistant registers. Excel and Epi-info was used to <b>record</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyse</b> the <b>data</b> respectively. The variables: admissions, demographic profile, clinical profile and treatment outcomes, were analysed through descriptive statistics and statistical tests were used for the comparison analysis. Logistic regression was performed to determine factors influencing death. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) of the University of the Witwatersrand. Results: The total number of adult admissions for the period was 891 with an increased admission over the two years. MDR-TB accounted for 95. 3...|$|R
