40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} pollutant emission and <b>noise</b> <b>radiation</b> characteristics of both open and impinging inverse diffusion flames (IDFs), produced by five burners of different air port diameter (d air= 5, 6 and 6. 84 mm) and air-to-fuel spacing (S= 8, 11. 5 and 15 mm). The effects of d air, S, overall equivalence ratio F{cyrillic} and nozzle-to-plate spacing H on the pollutant emissions of CO and NO x and the <b>noise</b> <b>radiation</b> are examined. The results show that at fixed air flow rate, a smaller d air curtails NO x emission but augments <b>noise</b> <b>radiation,</b> indicative of a role played by turbulence, which tends to decrease pollutant emission and increase <b>noise</b> <b>radiation.</b> A larger S reduces NO x emission but increases <b>noise</b> <b>radiation,</b> indicating that different flame zones {{may be responsible for}} pollutant emission and <b>noise</b> <b>radiation.</b> When the IDF is under stoichiometric F{cyrillic}= 1. 6, both the NO x emission and <b>noise</b> <b>radiation</b> are highest, as a result of maximum heat release rate. A comparison of EINO x for the open and impinging IDFs shows that the impinging IDFs emit more NO x probably due to the absence of NO reburning. The impinging IDFs have higher <b>noise</b> <b>radiation</b> than the corresponding open IDFs. A higher level of <b>noise</b> <b>radiation</b> from the impinging IDFs is observed as the target plate is brought closer to the burner. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an experimental conceptual design for observation and reduction of <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise.</b> The <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise</b> is increased {{in a high}} finesse cavity with a small mass mirror. In our experiment a Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer with a homodyne detection scheme will be built with Fabry-Perot cavities of finesse of 10000 containing suspended mirrors of 23 mg. To observe the <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise,</b> the goal sensitivity is set to 1 × 10 ^(- 17) [m/√Hz] at 1 kHz. Then the <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise</b> is reduced by adjusting the homodyne phase. To achieve the sensitivity, the other noise sources such as thermal noises, seismic noise and laser frequency noise should be suppressed below 1 × 10 ^(- 18) [m/√Hz] at 1 kHz. The whole interferometer is suspended as a double pendulum on double-layer stacks. As a preliminary setup, a Fabry-Perot cavity of finesse of 800 with a suspended mirror of 100 mg was locked.

40|$|Quantum {{fluctuations}} in the radiation pressure of light can excite stochastic motions of mechanical oscillators thereby realizing a linear quantum opto-mechanical coupling. When performing a precise measurement {{of the position of}} an oscillator, this coupling results in quantum <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise.</b> Up to now this effect has not been observed yet. Generally speaking, the strength of <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise</b> increases when the effective mass of the oscillator is decreased or when the power of the reflected light is increased. Recently, extremely light SiN membranes (≈ 100 ng) with high mechanical Q values at room temperature (≥ 10 ^ 6) have attracted attention as low thermal noise mechanical oscillators. However, the power reflectance of these membranes is much lower than unity (< 0. 4 at a wavelength of 1064 nm) which makes the use of advanced interferometer recycling techniques to amplify the <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise</b> in a standard Michelson interferometer inefficient. Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer that includes the membrane as a common end mirror for the Michelson interferometer part. In this topology, both power and signal recycling can be used even if the reflectance of the membrane is much lower than unity. In particular, signal recycling is a useful tool because it does not involve a power increase at the membrane. We derive the formulas for the quantum <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise</b> and the shot noise of an oscillator position measurement and compare them with theoretical models of the thermal noise of a SiN membrane with a fundamental resonant frequency of 75 kHz and an effective mass of 125 ng. We find that quantum <b>radiation</b> pressure <b>noise</b> should be observable with a power of 1 W at the central beam splitter of the interferometer and a membrane temperature of 1 K...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the cooling water on the vibration mode and damping characteristics of an engine was evaluated through experimental and simulation methods. The wet mode method of the fluid-structure interaction field was applied in numerical analysis, which led to several significant conclusions. Several additional fluid related modes were present when the effect of cooling water was considered. Meanwhile, the frequencies of other modes were almost the same. On the other hand, the damping characteristics of an engine were changed while the cooling water was used. For Rayleigh damping, the cooling water effect has made the mass matrix scale factor α nearly double and the stiffness matrix scale factor β almost unchanged. The engine surface vibration acceleration magnitude was calculated {{by means of the}} multi-body dynamic analysis. It was shown that the calculated vibration acceleration magnitude was close to the measured one when the cooling water was taken into account. Furthermore, acoustic simulation results were estimated by Boundary Element Method, which revealed that the sound power level of the <b>radiation</b> <b>noise</b> of most engine components was lower than that with the fluid structure interaction model being applied in the engine block modeling. The overall sound power level of the whole engine <b>radiation</b> <b>noise</b> was increased by 3. 6 dB when the effect of the cooling water was considered, which demonstrated that the effect of the cooling water on the engine vibro-acoustic characteristics should not be neglected during the computation.
