After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower, however, Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956.

5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E

The respondents regarded Buddhist-Catholic relations as bad before 1975, and normal or friendly after this year.

In December 1933, Galland was recalled to the ZVS headquarters and offered the chance to join the new Luftwaffe. Galland found the choice hard as he wanted the adventure of a military flying career, but as an airline pilot, Galland had enjoyed the life style of flying and visiting exotic places and was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it up.

The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised {{him that he would}} be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E

Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{prevalence}} of compensation systems which reward winners without explicitly identifying losers can be rationalized by workers' concern for relative payo¤s. If the workers' participation constraints are binding, the rm must compensate its employees for the disutility that they may derive from low status. It follows that prot-maximizing employers may be particularly <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> penalize or <b>give</b> poor performance evaluation to employees. The theory also sheds light on many other puzzling features of incentive schemes in practice, such as small salary premia, rat races, job title proliferation, the gender wage gap, the gender/happiness paradox and {{the widespread use of}} tournaments as a sorting device...|$|R
5|$|Hasluck {{had been}} Governor-General since 1969, and his term was shortly due to expire. Whitlam {{wanted him to}} remain a further two years, but Hasluck declined, citing his wife's refusal to remain at Yarralumla longer than the {{originally}} agreed five years. Whitlam offered the post to businessman Ken Myer, who turned it down. Whitlam then turned to Sir John Kerr, the Chief Justice of New South Wales. Kerr was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the Chief Justiceship, in which he intended to remain another ten years, for the Governor-General's post, which traditionally lasted five years. At Kerr's request, Whitlam informally agreed that if both men were still in office in five years, Kerr would be reappointed. Whitlam also secured legislation to address Kerr's financial concerns about the position, including authorising a pension for the Governor-General or his widow. The Leader of the Opposition, Billy Snedden, was enthusiastic about the appointment and also agreed to reappoint Kerr in five years, were he Prime Minister at the time. Kerr then agreed to take the post, was duly appointed by Queen ElizabethII, and was sworn in on 11 July 1974.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{gave the}} Mohave {{a choice between}} war and peace, and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white {{settlers}} along the wagon trail. He also declared that, as punishment, the Mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in the attack. Hoffman demanded that the chief who had ordered {{the attack on the}} settlers offer himself up as a hostage. According to Chooksa homar, the chief who had ordered the attack was Homoseh quahote, who was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> himself up. Cairook offered himself in his place, along with eight others, including Tokwatha, Irataba's son Tekse thume, and Irataba's nephews Qolho qorau, and Aspamekelyeho. Other hostages were named Itsere-'itse, Ilyhanapau, and Tinyam-isalye. They were transported in the river steamer General Jessup to Fort Yuma. Many soldiers remained to begin construction on the Beale's Crossing fort, which was named Fort Mohave. Although Irataba visited the garrison several times and argued for their release, the hostages were held for more than a year. On June 21, 1859, Cairook and one other captive were killed by soldiers while attempting to escape their incarceration. Most of the other Mohave captives escaped.|$|E

He returned to racing in November with two wins and a second in Brisbane. He got to Melbourne in January and started with a win in the Moonee Valley Cup. His next race came in the Ballarat Cup. Blacks A Fake led the inside line throughout; however, Safari sat outside him and held a clear lead over Blacks A Fake for most of the race. Safari won the race. Blacks A Fake then went on to the Hunter Cup, a race in which Natalie Rasmussen was originally <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> start <b>given</b> that the horse would face a 30 metre handicap against a field of many of Australia’s best pacers. However, Blacks A Fake came around the field to narrowly gain the win in race-record time.|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{garnered}} a 17.8 rating with a 30 share - CBS' highest {{rating for}} the entire year. However, citing concern over the pilot's relatively weak ratings in the lucrative adult-demographic (ages 18-49), CBS picked up the series for only a limited, five-episode order (those 5 episodes were aired in April and May 1978, at the tail-end of the 1977-1978 TV season). This run of episodes debuted very well, with the first obtaining a 22.8 rating with 16.6 million viewers, making it the best-rated program for the week on CBS, and the eighth-best-rated program for the week, overall. The series ended up being the 19th-highest-rated show of the entire season. However, CBS was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> commit <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> the show a regular/fixed time slot for the 1978-79 season, as the series was expensive to produce and continued to underperform with older audiences.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{traces the}} {{regulatory}} {{evolution of the}} processes of exploitation, transfer and rationalization of public assets, highlighting the different philosophies underlying the numerous regulatory interventions over the years, the first characterized by an essentially business approach, which aimed to ensure the monetization of assets {{in order to deal}} with more immediate budgetary needs. The second, which was more <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> assert itself, <b>gives</b> greater consideration the welfare of the community with the consequent provision of processes which rather than aiming at the mere sale of assets seek to properly exploit them within integrated programs provided by the public proprietors (bodies). And it is in this context that the characteristics of securitization processes and their criticalities, as well as the new instruments such as the long lease for exploitation, have been analyzed...|$|R

The Taliban had massed with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 fighters. The Taliban were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the area, and after being surrounded by the Canadian Forces, they dug in and fought a more conventional style battle.

Butler, who was childless, unmarried, and at the time living alone, subsequently petitioned for foster custody of Genie, and despite the hospital's objections authorities extended Genie's stay while they considered the matter.|$|E

Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S.
