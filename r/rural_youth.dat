25|$|The late 1970s {{witnessed}} the reemergence of a Georgian national movement {{which called for}} the revival of Georgian national culture and, in its most radical form, saw no compromise to Georgia's ultimate independence from the Soviet Union, a rare instance of pro-independence dissident movement in the Union at the time. Although Georgian opposition intelligentsia preached avoidance of conflict with non-Georgian minorities, as such conflict would hamper the road to independence, and forged ties with the Russian dissidents of the time, including Andrei Sakharov, the movement had a strong anti-Russian emphasis and alarmed some minorities, especially in Abkhazia, {{where there was a}} lingering ethnic discord between Georgian and Abkhaz communities. In early 1977, the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) managed to suppress most Russian dissident groups and moved to Georgia, with the irreconcilable Georgian opposition leaders, Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia, being arrested in April. Such measures failed to curb the movement, however. New influential young dissidents such as Tamar Chkheidze, Avtandil Imnadze, later Giorgi Chanturia, and Irakli Tsereteli, emerged in support of the jailed leaders, and several underground publications (Samizdat) were founded. During this period Georgia acquired the position of the republic with the highest level of per capita higher education in the Soviet Union, and the increasing number of students, especially the <b>rural</b> <b>youth</b> with higher education and with little connection to the Communist Party and Nomenklatura, formed a ground for anti-Soviet sentiments.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} about {{identity}} and lifestyles formation among <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> in Sabah through {{their use of}} the global-local media images in the midst of living in remote places with little socio-economic activities. The key issue here is to identify to what extent globalization have reached into the lives of <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> and how these developments have shaped their identity. Findings presented are a combination of quantitative and qualitative data that has been collected over a span of two years beginning 2013. In terms of their media consumption pattern, globalizations have indeed penetrated into the lives of <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> where almost 70 percent of them are said to have enjoyed a variety of Asian and Western television programs. However, in an interview with 40 informants, out of 38 media images shown, only one girl picked images of an all girls K-pop group as representing who she is. Rather, it was media images of U. S president Barack Obama, Disneyland, Japan and Eiffel Tower that was frequently selected as representing their identity. The reason for this is because these images mediate notions of ‘hope’ and ‘change’ for these youths, who experienced social exclusion. Thus, the main issue concerning globalization, is not about cultural imperialism but how <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> appropriated global cultures from the media to communicate their local condition in line with Kraidy’s (2002 : 17) notion of ‘cultural hybridity’ as a “communicative practice”. <b>Rural</b> <b>youths</b> may appropriate global media content, but it is used to articulate their hope for a better future...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the ways in which a <b>rural</b> school <b>youth</b> {{indicates}} trauma in a single sand tray scene. An empirical study of limited extent, which was conducted from the interpretivistic paradigm and qualitative by nature, was undertaken. A clinical case study was utilised as research design and document analysis was employed as data collection method. The case record of a Grade 9 learner with a complex trauma history, who attended a secondary school in a low-resourced community in Mpumalanga, was selected as the principal participant in the study. Sandplay assessment, trauma indicators and <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> were the main concepts guiding the study. The findings of the empirical study were, firstly, that the ways a <b>rural</b> school <b>youth</b> indicated trauma in a single sand tray scene corresponded with trauma indications in Sandplay literature, of which, secondly, scenes appearing hostile, sexualised, bounded-off, rigid, obstructed or empty and devoid of life (e. g. people, vegetation) and scenery were examples. This reflected the universal dynamism of trauma. Another finding was that the utility of a single sand tray scene as a screening tool for trauma with a <b>rural</b> school <b>youth</b> was high and valuable as it identified different types of trauma and trauma-related suffering (symptoms).

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{effective}} means of reducing disability from psychotic disorders is the provision of early detection and intervention targeted at the prodromal phase. Current research and clinical programs for early psychosis (EP) have failed to encapsulate {{the specific needs of}} rural and remote communities (RARC) such as limited availability of mental health providers and long distances to travel for care (Fox et al, 1995). This study investigated access to care and service delivery for <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> experiencing EP. METHODS: Routine clinical mental health service data were analysed for 10 – 25 year old patients across three rural regions of New South Wales. A large data set (N= 1562) for the Central West (CW) rural region was compared to smaller data sets for the Far West (FW) remote and the North Coast (NC) coastal regions. Demographic, clinical and service features were analysed against characteristics specific to RARC. Clinical measures included the HoNOSCA, HoNOS and SDQ. RESULTS: EP patients in the CW represented 10. 4 % of patients accessing mental health services, but utilised services twice as often as non EP patients and absorbed 37. 6 % of inpatient service encounters. While the median distance to access service for CW EP patients was 88 km, an absence of inpatient services for FW resulted in FW EP patients travelling as far as 895 km for hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasise the importance of developing specific EP services to address the diversity across RARC. The lack of appropriate and timely treatment for <b>rural</b> <b>youths</b> is likely to increase the impairment associated with EP...|$|R
