40|$|Among the {{challenges}} facing the Texas winegrape industry is Phymatotrichopsis omnivora, the cotton root rot (CRR) pathogen. A survey instrument was created and distributed to grape growers which revealed that the disease {{is a serious problem}} in counties where acreage of new vineyards is on the increase. Grape growers expressed significant concern because there were no effective recommendations for disease control. One control option for growers is the use of promising rootstock x scion combinations. In 2012, a <b>root</b> <b>stock</b> field trial was planted with two own-rooted grape varieties (Chardonnay, Merlot) and the same two varieties on Dog Ridge <b>root</b> <b>stock.</b> Both <b>varieties</b> on the <b>root</b> <b>stock</b> showed a significant statistical difference in disease development when compared to own-rooted vines. Merlot own-rooted vines were more resistant than the Chardonnay own-rooted vines. Two experimental fungicide field trials were initiated in vineyards in the spring of 2012. In one vineyard, several fungicides were tested including flutriafol, a fungicide being used successfully to control CRR on cotton. In the commercial vineyard in Travis County, TX, flutriafol was applied at 0. 26 lbs/a. i. /acre (1 X), 2. 6 lbs/a. i. /acre (10 X), and 5. 2 lbs/a. i. /acre (20 X) through a manually applied soil drench. There was a significantly lower level of disease development in the 10 X plots, as compared to untreated controls. Vines treated with a 10 X rate of flutriafol also showed decreased incidence of non-target foliar pathogens and possible plant health effects when compared to the other treatments. In 2014, two new field trials were established using chemigation at an established vineyard and a newly planted vineyard. The experimental block at the newly planted vineyard consisted of 30 rows of Petite Syrah on 5 BB rootstock containing 118 vines/row. Two rates of flutriafol at 0. 26 lbs/a. i. /acre (1 X) and 0. 52 lbs/a. i. /acre (2 X) were applied through the irrigation system with 10 plots (rows) /treatment. In the untreated plots, disease increased from 0 - 5. 5 % over a 12 week period following treatments. No disease was observed until week 11 in any of the treated plots. However, by week 12, disease incidence had increased to 2. 5 % and 1. 4 % in the 1 X and 2 X plots, respectively. Based on these and similar studies, a Section 24 (c) special local needs registration was requested and granted for use by the grape growers to control Phymatotrichopsis omnivora...|$|R

40|$|A {{disorder}} {{causing the}} cracking of bark {{in the lower}} trunk region of seedlings and in the <b>root</b> <b>stock</b> of bud-grafted trees of Hevea brasiliensis was observed recently. A preliminary investigation was carried {{out for the first}} time to study the occurrence, symptoms, its relationship to the genotype of clones or seedlings, age and growth of trees. The observations were that, this disorder appears only after about three years of establishment and reaches a high percentage in about seven years and is completely absent in bud wood nurseries. Bud-grafted trees with the disorder had a greater girth than those unaffected. The genotype of the scion in bud-grafted trees did not have a significant influence on the occurrence of this disorder.

40|$|Grafting per se did {{not affect}} the growth pattern of a normal (‘Red Rock’) and dwarf (‘Patio’) cv. of tomato. It was found, however, that {{reciprocal}} grafts between the two genotypes had a marked effect on both root and shoot growth. The genotype of the scion had a significant effect on root growth, e. g., a ‘Patio’ scion reduced the growth of ‘Red Rock’ roots while a ‘Red Rock’ scion increased the growth of ‘Patio’ roots. Irrespective of the origin of the scion, plants with a <b>root</b> <b>stock</b> from the normal cv. ‘Red Rock’ yielded a higher cytokinin-like activity than those with a <b>root</b> <b>stock</b> from the dwarf cv. ‘Patio’. The inhibition or stimulation of root and shoot growth, however, could not be correlated with cytokinin levels measured in the roots or shoots. Thus, it appears that cytokinin production in the tissues of the two cultivars is genetically determined...|$|R
