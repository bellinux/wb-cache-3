40|$|M Development and Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Across the world, war {{has been}} {{declared}} against poverty because of its devastating effects on local communities. The world has made {{a concerted effort to}} fight the effects of poverty through developmental agencies and <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>bodies</b> such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organisation (WTO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). In an effort to complement the efforts of the above–mentioned agencies and bodies, the South African government has developed its own poverty alleviation strategies, policies, initiatives and Acts that focus primarily on alleviation of poverty on the level of local government. The Constitution of South Africa, 1996 provides the guidelines to several regulations and Acts (such as the Development and Facilitation Act, 67 of 1995, the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, 32 of 2000, and the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act, 117 of 1998.) that support the alleviation of poverty on the local sphere of government. The Integrated Development Planning programme was formulated and implemented to alleviate poverty at this level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how the level of poverty within the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality could be alleviated through effective integrated development planning. A quantitative approach was followed because the target population response rate was expected to be large. In addition, the research design for this study included a literature review, analyses of official documents, observation and data sampling through questionnaires and scientific analysis of the responses. The study found that IDP objectives aligned to service delivery targets were unclear and did not depict the aspirations and needs of the community.

The Guidelines relate to all marine activities where funds are being generated from whale or dolphin watching and this may include research activities that have a commercial component 1. They are intended to serve as a framework for the development of more detailed guidelines by national and regional authorities 2 at a local level. The ACCOBAMS Guidelines should be used to identify what issues need to be addressed and how this may be appropriately done. 1 This is one issue where the appropriate authorities should decide the scope of activities to be included within the guidelines. The options are a. All marine activities that include whale or dolphin watching as a means of raising funds, including all commercial and research activities; or b. All marine activities that include whale or dolphin watching as a means of raising funds, including all commercial activities but excluding primarily research activities, which should be separately licensed, perhaps by a special permit system. The authorities should also pay special attention to those whale watching activities run by conservation organisations and which contribute to cetacean conservation by research or education or in some other fashion. In such cases, a special permit may again be appropriate. 2 “Authorities ” here is intended to primarily mean the relevant parts of the government (i. e. ministries or agencies) of ACCOBAMS Parties which have appropriate powers and interests.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of regional}} powers towards their own regions is often volatile {{in the developing}} world, which leads to unstable integration processes.

When <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> is not in conflict with extra;regional interests, regional powers provide regional leadership. However, when extra-regional interests are in conflict with <b>regional</b> <b>integration,</b> <b>regional</b> powers become regional Rambos. This argument is illustrated with the two examples of Brazil's behaviour in Mercosur and South Africa's behaviour in SADC.

40|$|Intellectual discourses on <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> in Africa have {{continued}} to generate diverse and often contradictory debates and responses. A common convergence in these debates, as they have increasingly come {{to be associated with}} the current process of globalisation, is that <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> is not only desirable but also necessary. The latter consensus seems to be justified on the premise that individual states cannot readily achieve their social, economic and political goals in isolation from their neighbours. Thus, the desirability of promoting <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> continue to be widely acknowledged by multilateral agencies, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), national governments and academics on the continent. The concept of Pan-East Africanism, seen as the new initiative to integrate the East African states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania is contextualized within the emerging global realities and trends. This paper sets out to review the state of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> efforts in East Africa.
