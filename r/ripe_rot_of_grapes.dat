40|$|The {{relationship}} between hyphal growth and branching <b>of</b> the <b>grape</b> pathogen Botrytis cinerea was determined on solid media containing either glucose, fructose, sucrose, tartaric acid or malic acid. The {{concentration of the}} carbon source {{had little effect on}} specific growth rate or the specific rate of tip formation, but growth was inhibited at high concentrations of tartaric and malic acids. Hyphal growth unit length and hyphal extension rate increased with increasing sugar concentration and were always significantly greater than values on tartaric or malic acids. The data provide an explanation for colonization patterns <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> berries. Growth will be poor during the period from setting to the onset of ripening, when organic acids are the main carbon source produced by the berry. Following the onset of ripening, the production of sugars provides more favourable carbon sources for the fungus, enabling achievement of higher specific growth rates, greater hyphal extension rates and, hence, greater colonizing potential. Botrytis cinerea Pers. is the causal agent <b>of</b> an important <b>ripe</b> <b>rot</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> seriously damaging the berries between the onset of ripening (the stage referred to by vignerons as veraison) and harvest (Verhoeff, 1980).

40|$|Bunch <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> {{is caused}} by Botrytis cinerea, a fast-growing {{pathogen}} infecting numerous crops of commercial value. Bunch rot can potentially lead {{to a reduction in}} the yield and quality of table, raisin, and wine grapes, with high economic losses in some locations or years (Flaherty et al. 1992). Botrytis overwinters as sclerotia in mummified berries on the ground or on canes. The disease can first appear as shoot blight following frequent spring rains; flowers can become infected during bloom (Bulit and Dubos 1988). In infected fruits, disease symptoms are latent until late in the season. As sugar concentration increases in the berry, the fungus resumes growth and infects the entire fruit, often resulting in berry splitting and sporulation on the fruit surface (Flaherty et al. 1992). Free water is a requirement for the pathogen, and favorable conditions include humidities exceeding 90 % and temperatures between 15 - 27 °C (Flaherty et al. 1992, Bulit and Dubos 1988, Gubler et al. 2008).

40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a fungal {{secondary}} metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species. It has been detected {{in a wide}} range of commodities, including cereals, coffee, grapes, raisins, must and wine. Within grape derivative products, the raisins, red wine and sweet wines have reported to contain the highest OTA levels. Aspergillus section Nigri (A. niger and A. carbonarius) are considered the OTA source in these commodities and they are commonly isolated among other fungi from grapes and raisins. Starting from this basis the objectives of this thesis were focused into three main aspects: (1) Evaluation of the food products: vine dried fruits and special wines, concerning the mycobiota and OTA occurrence and incidence; (2) Ecophysiological studies of the ochratoxigenic fungi and accompanying mycobiota as affected by environmental conditions; (3) Control and preventive methods such as the evaluation of residual activity of pre-harvest fungicides during grape dehydration and the use of modified atmospheres. Wine origin and winemaking procedure showed to be determinant for the final OTA content. All special wines analysed from northern European regions were negative for OTA while more than 50 % of wines from warmer regions were positive for OTA contamination. The wines with higher OTA levels were fortified musts followed by those made from dried grapes.

However, the cause is not itself over-watering but the fungus. Crop rotation can help, and resistant strains of jalapeño, such as the NuMex Vaquero and TAM Mild Jalapeño, have been and are being bred as this is of major commercial impact throughout the world. As jalapeños are a cultivar, the diseases are common to Capsicum annuum: Verticillium wilt, Cercospora capsici, Powdery mildew, Colletotrichum capsici (<b>Ripe</b> <b>Rot),</b> Erwinia carotovora (Soft Rot), Beet curly top virus, Tospovirus (Tomato spotted wilt virus), Pepper mottle virus, Tobacco mosaic virus, Pepper Geminiviridae, and Root-knot nematode being among the major commercially important diseases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Several postharvest {{diseases}} <b>of</b> table <b>grapes</b> (Vitis vinifera) {{occur during}} storage, and gray mold rot {{is a particularly}} severe disease because the causal agent, Botrytis cinerea, grows at temperatures as low as 0 oC. Other postharvest diseases, such as those caused by Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp., also often lead to deterioration in the quality <b>of</b> table <b>grapes</b> after harvest. The use of plant essential oils such as thymol and linalool, to reduce postharvest diseases in several kinds of fruits, including table grapes and oranges, has received much attention in European countries. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge there has been no report of the use of thymol fumigation to control gray mold in table grapes in Korea. Thymol (30 µg/mL) and linalool (120 µg/mL) significantly inhibited mycelial growth and conidia germination of B. cinerea. The occurrence rate <b>of</b> gray mold <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> B. cinerea and other unknown fungi was significantly reduced by fumigation with 30 µg/mL thymol in several table grape cultivars, such as Campbell early, Muscat Bailey A, Sheridan, and Geobong. In this study, fumigation with 30 µg/mL thymol, had no influence on the sugar content and hardness <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> but reduced fungal infection significantly. This suggests that 30 µg/mL thymol could be utilized to reduce deterioration <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> due to gray mold and other fungal infections during long-term storage...|$|R

The thesis aims to describe rules of management in ecological viniculture conditions and formulate results of improvement quality <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> in ecological viniculture condotions. This work also includes an experiment with comparing qualitative parameters <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> between integrated and ecological viniculture condotions. Samples <b>of</b> beriies <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> was picken up from four same varieties. After comparing each parametr {{was found that}} ecological viniculture conditions make better grapes. The best variety was Pinot Noir...|$|R
