50|$|Considerably more {{spectacular}} are the <b>rope</b> <b>lifts</b> to the monasteries and hermitages around the holy mountain of Athos, {{some of which}} are still accessible today using these means. The 20 large monasteries also had gateways, however. Several Egyptian monasteries also used to be only accessible using <b>lifts.</b> The longest <b>rope</b> <b>lifts</b> led to the Meteora abbeys of Northern Greece. These systems were built on mighty rock towers; so they were not classic elevated entrances. These examples show that small winches could also have been installed in the wooden structures of medieval elevated entrances. There is no record, however, of lift equipment in the interior of the building.|$|R

5000|$|A sheave (...) is {{a pulley}} with a grooved wheel for holding a belt, wire rope, or rope. The grooved wheel spins inside {{the frame of}} the sheave. This allows the wire or rope to move freely {{minimizing}} wear and abrasion on cable. Sheaves can be used to redirect a cable or <b>rope,</b> <b>lift</b> loads, and transmit power. The words sheave and pulley are sometimes used interchangeably.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, August Essenwein saw the <b>rope</b> <b>lift</b> as {{a common}} entry system. For example, in his {{numerous}} artist's impressions of medieval castles, people can often be seen being hauled up towers using a simple lift. The castle researcher, Otto Piper questioned this, however, in his well-known work, Burgenkunde, because {{in the case of}} danger the use of such a lift was impractical in his opinion and in any case would always need a second person in the tower to operate the lift. But he also recognised the problem of hauling up a long, wooden ladder into an elevated entrance. His view was that they would make do with a fixed wooden or stone structure {{at the foot of the}} building. A short, easily retrievable, wooden ladder could then be used to reach the elevated entrance.|$|E
5000|$|Suicide Six is {{the name}} of a ski resort in South Pomfret, Vermont. It has some claim to {{historical}} fame as a very early ski resort. In January 1934, an improvised rope tow, said to be the first ski lift in the Eastern United States, was installed on a hill located on Clinton Gilbert's farm. The rope tow was originally powered with a Ford Model T engine. By the following month, Wallace [...] "Bunny" [...] Bertram (a former ski coach at Dartmouth College who had helped build the original <b>rope</b> <b>lift)</b> took over the operation, and installed a more reliable electric motor. A few years later he moved his operation to a steeper hill nearby, shown on the map as [...] "Hill 6". Bertram once joked that to ski down the nearby Hill No. 6 would be suicide. Two years later the resort was opened using this name and photos of Bertram {{can be seen in the}} resort museum in the base lodge. Devotees of ski mountaineering and backcountry skiing mark this as the beginning of the divergence of resort skiing and traditional backcountry skiing.|$|E

After he kicked out, Vito lifted Pondo onto his shoulders and slammed him onto the mat before Pauly performed a diving front flip splash for another two count. As Pauly climbed to the ropes again, Necro Butcher hit him with a chair then wrapped his legs around Pauly’s head before flipping him to the mat back first.

5000|$|A {{block is}} a set of pulleys or [...] "sheaves" [...] mounted on a single axle. An {{assembly}} of blocks with a rope threaded through the pulleys is called tackle.

5000|$|A {{miniature}} in the Codex Manesse (Her Kristan von Hamle) {{shows how}} a man is hoisted in a basket up to an elevated entrance by a woman {{with the help of}} a rope. This is representative of a common motif that is particularly well known from the Virgil Legends of the Middle Ages (Vergil in the Basket). The lady loved by Virgil promises to meet him at night in her tower room, hauling him up to her room in a basket. However, she deliberately leaves the basket hanging half way up and the jilted Virgil becomes the laughing stock of the local people the following morning when they see him there. The German sayings [...] "to leave someone hanging in the air" [...] (jemanden in der Luft hängen lassen) and [...] "to give someone a basket" [...] (einen Korb geben) probably go back to this legend. Whether <b>rope</b> <b>lifts</b> of this sort were widely used, either for goods or to lift people, is not clear.|$|R

5000|$|The {{raised band}} concept was {{expanded}} over {{the upper body}} to a repeating circumferential pattern, incised or stamped at first, then rolled with a seal-like roller around {{the body of the}} pithos while it was still fresh clay. Some common themes are spirals, meanders, and waves. Waves in relief give the appearance of slack rope; whether they were intended to be that is debatable. Slack <b>rope</b> <b>lifts</b> nothing; moreover, a rope around the neck of the pithos for lifting would only concentrate the weight on the neck, probably shattering it. Multiple lugs, loops and handles indicate that for lifting purposes some sort of harness to distribute the weight must have been used. Rope may have been used during decoration for impressing patterns. These rope-like waves, regardless of the potter's possible intent, have been termed [...] "rope patterns" [...] or [...] "rope decoration", with a certain ambiguity of meaning as to whether actual rope was used to physically impress them, or they are merely intended to visually resemble rope.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the ability, {{mechanism}} and problems for controlling the depth of a towed net using a canvas kite, a model test {{was carried out in}} a flume tank. The changes of the depth and attack angle of the model netting mouth, which depended on the pulling length of the <b>lifting</b> <b>rope,</b> were measured under two conditions, one in which a <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> was connected to a model kite (W/K) and another in which a <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> was directly connected {{to the top of the}} netting mouth (W/O) for purposes of comparison. The results obtained in this study were as follows. The depth decreased monotonously depending on the pulling length under the W/O condition, but it changed by decreasing or increasing under the W/K condition. The range of attack angle was from 15 to - 10 degrees in the pulling length for the effective control of the W/K condition, while in the W/O condition, the attack angle of netting mouth decreased monotonously. The primary factor of the depth control using a kite seemed to be a direction of hydraulic forces by kite on the net mouth, and a relationship between the depth and angle of net mouth was shown, but there was a negligible influence on the projected area of netting mouth in the effective control. The effective ability and mechanism of depth control using a canvas kite were also discussed with the necessity of more basic data for the development and design of the depth control system. ...|$|R
