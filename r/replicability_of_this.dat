40|$|At a {{time when}} social {{services}} are overburdened in Britain, family support in general practice offers one way to fill the gap. In the Well Family Project, a 'family support coordinator' worked within a general practice in Hackney, London. In the first eighteen months she saw 113 clients. Evaluation was by semistructured interviews {{with a sample of}} these clients and with professional workers. Comments from those interviewed indicate that the family support was valued. The general practice base was convenient and non-stigmatizing. By adopting a proactive approach, the project was able to work with clients who had previously 'slipped through the net'. Some of the professionals interviewed would have liked to provide the same help, but were unable to do so because of time and other constraints. Family support provided through general practice was well received by vulnerable families. Although there was overlap with the remit of health visitors and social workers, the protected time and the independence of the coordinator enabled clients to obtain the help they wanted. The <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> strategy now needs to be assessed...|$|E

30|$|We {{incorporated}} a {{qualitative content analysis}} (Schreier 2012) which allowed for the examination of STEM concepts and skills that teachers integrated following participation in a PD experience. A content analysis was chosen as this research method utilizes a systematic approach to make valid and replicable inferences from texts (Krippendorff 2013). More specifically, a summative approach (Hsieh and Shannon 2005) was utilized to explore usage of STEM concepts with a purpose to understand the interpretation of content across phases of learning. This approach allowed researchers to construct meaning through the analysis and interpretation of qualitative texts and materials (Schreier 2012). Due {{to the fact that}} content analysis involves the interpretation of texts by the researchers, Krippendorff (2013) suggests that to help ensure the validity and <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> analysis that the background and experiences of individual coders should be identified.

40|$|A wide gulf {{separates}} South Asia, {{where one}} half of the world's poor lives, from East Asia, where one of human history's most remarkable struggles against poverty has been waged over the past four decades. This contrast raises the inevitable question as to what lessons in the East Asian experience may be of value to the countries in South Asia in their struggle against poverty. The question is all the more important as the world of the 1990 s is far different from the world of the 1950 s and 1960 s when most East Asian countries initiated their successful development efforts.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper it to report the {{findings}} of an empirical study into managers’ job performance. A new measure was developed from the literature to test and establish the multidimensional structure of managers’ contextual and task performance. Design/methodology/approach – Field ratings by executives explicitly and simultaneously measured both managers’ contextual and task performance. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to a variety of public and third sector managers from a range of private, public and third sector occupations residing in (Western) Australia. A purposive sample yielded a response rate of 32 percent. Factor analysis was used to determine the items that constitute executives’ perceptions of managers’ performance using downward appraisal (i. e. by the person to whom a manager reports). Findings – The construct “managers’ job performance” was found to be multidimensional; consisting of four distinct contextual factors (Following, Persisting, Helping, Endorsing) and a further four distinct task factors (Delegating, Monitoring, Technical, Influencing). Originality/value – Performance appraisals of managers represent new items and factors that more accurately reflect the nature of the broader roles undertaken by managers, including transformative and ethical leadership. Findings from this study assist in establishing the structure for the subsequent appraisal of managers’ contextual and task performance.

We examined the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> effect under passive viewing conditions, the potential role of visuoperceptual similarity, where the effect is situated compared to regions that have been previously implicated in visuospatial attention, and how it compares to effects of object identity and location. Forty-six subjects participated. Subjects passively viewed pictures from two categories, musical instruments and vehicles. Semantic similarity between entities was estimated based on a concept-feature matrix obtained in more than 1, 000 subjects. Visuoperceptual similarity was modeled based on the HMAX model, the AlexNet deep convolutional learning model, and thirdly, based on subjective visuoperceptual similarity ratings. Among the IPS regions examined, only left middle IPS showed a semantic similarity effect. The effect was significant in hIP 1, hIP 2, and hIP 3. Visuoperceptual similarity did not correlate with similarity of activity patterns in left middle IPS. The semantic similarity effect in left middle IPS was significantly stronger than in the right middle IPS and also stronger than in {{the left or right}} posterior IPS. The semantic similarity effect was similar to that seen in the angular gyrus. Object identity effects were much more widespread across nearly all parietal areas examined. Location effects were relatively specific for posterior IPS and area 7 bilaterally.

40|$|Climate change adds an {{additional}} layer of complexity to existing sustainable development and biodiversity conservation challenges. The impacts {{of global climate}} change are felt locally, and thus local governance structures will increasingly be responsible for preparedness and local responses. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) options are gaining prominence as relevant climate change solutions. Local government officials seldom have an appropriate understanding of the role of ecosystem functioning in sustainable development goals, or access to relevant climate information. Thus the use of ecosystems in helping people adapt to climate change is limited partially by the lack of information on where ecosystems have the highest potential to do so. To begin overcoming this barrier, Conservation South Africa in partnership with local government developed a socio-ecological approach for identifying spatial EbA priorities at the sub-national level. Using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis and vegetation distribution models, the authors have spatially integrated relevant ecological and social information at a scale appropriate to inform local level political, administrative, and operational decision makers. This is the first systematic approach of which we are aware that highlights spatial priority areas for EbA implementation. Nodes of socio-ecological vulnerability are identified, and the inclusion of areas that provide ecosystem services and ecological resilience to future climate change is innovative. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present and demonstrate a methodology for combining complex information into user-friendly spatial products for local level decision making on EbA.

40|$|Background: Almost {{seven years}} after the {{publication}} of the final report of the World Health Organization’s Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), its third recommendation has not been attended to properly. Measuring health inequities (HI) within countries and globally, in order to develop and evaluate evidence-based policies and actions aimed at the social determinants of health (SDH), is still a pending task in most low and middle income countries (LMIC) in the Latin American region. In this paper we discuss methodological and conceptual issues to measure HI in LMIC and suggest a three-stage methodology for the creation of observatories on health inequities (OHI) and social determinants of health, based on the experience of the Brazilian Observatory on Health Inequities (BOHI) that has been successfully operating since 2010 at the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ). Methods: A three-stage methodology for the creation of an OHI was developed based on a literature review on the following topics: SDH, HI measurement, and the process of setting-up of health observatories; followed by semistructured interviews with key informants from the BOHI. We describe the three stages and discuss the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> methodology in other Latin American countries. We also carried out a search of suitable national information systems to feed an OHI in Mexico, along with an outline of the institutional infrastructure to sustain it. Results: When implementing the methodology for an OHI in LMIC such as Mexico, we found that having strong infrastructure of information systems for measuring HI is required, but not sufficient to build an OHI. Adequate funding and intersectoral network collaborations lead by a group of experts is a requirement for the consolidation and sustainability of an OHI in LMIC. Conclusion: According to the described methodology, and the available information systems on health, the creation of an OHI in LMIC, particularly in Mexico, is plausible in the near future. However, institutional support (in academic, financial, and policymaking terms) is essential to materialize such needed instance, thus locally contributing to attain health equity...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{development}} {{in the field of}} technical aids for the handicapped is electronic speech synthesis. Whereas this revolutionary advancement may have many benefits for persons whose speech is defective or for those individuals who have lost the use of their natural speech apparatus through physical trauma, a satisfactory analysis of language training models applicable to the instruction of the Phonic Mirror Handivoice model HC 120 had not yet been accomplished. In the present study, two non-vocal cerebral palsied subjects participated throughout a series of three experiments. It was considered important to examine intensively the performances of these selected individuals as they interacted with and learned about the various aspects of a unique form of vocal behavior. In the first experiment, a traditional paired-associates procedure, Method A, was the standard training method with which other methods were compared. Method B was essentially a paired-associates procedure that emphasized the personal histories of verbal behavior for each subject; Method C established discriminative control over vocal responses by natural features of the environment; Method D combined a paired-associates procedure with one in which the subject directly supplied supplementary verbal stimuli as part of the training procedure. The criterion for effectiveness was the number of training/testing cycles required for each S to achieve criterion (of 100 % correct) on each word list. The results of these comparisons indicated that none of the three methods was any more or less effective than the traditional paired-associates procedures. Upon the completion of the second comparison (i. e., Method A and Method C), an informal retention survey was conducted. The responses from both subjects to this survey indicated poor retention for test stimuli established on early lists but increasing retention on the more recently trained lists. Experiment 2 was therefore designed to determine the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> retention phenomenon both within and between the two S's, using Method A, across three different word lists. This experiment showed that when test stimuli were presented 24 hours after training, there was little or no loss of control over the appropriate word. An additional finding was that little or no retention was exhibited by either S for words which had not been retested at the 24 hour interval and whose retest intervals were 4, 5, and 6 days. A feature of the Experiment 2 survey was that the variables of time (elapsed from training to testing) and additional training were confounded. Therefore, Experiment 3, again using Method A, was conducted to separately (1) evaluate the effectiveness of a simple retraining procedure on extended retention, and (2) examine the effect of elapsed time on discriminative control over the previously established verbal responses. The results of the retraining procedure were positive. Whereas previous surveys of Experiment 2 had produced little or no evidence of retention beyond the 48 hour interval, 60 % of the test stimuli in Experiment 3 discriminated their appropriate verbal responses. In contrast, the word lists which had not undergone retraining at the 24 hour interval nor had been followed by additional training of new word lists exhibited retention of either 0 or 20 %. Two major outcomes of the present study were (1) the four training methods were all effective, but not differentially so, in teaching the numeric language of the HandiVoice, and (2) effective retention over a number of days could be achieved by a single retraining session. These findings offer several practical guidelines for future HandiVoice instructors to establish and maintain a new but important form of verbal behavior...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the hydrogeological {{functioning}} of volcanic island {{is essential for}} an adapted management of water resource and for a better supply to population, particularly in those who have seen their population increase in years. Nevertheless, geological, hydrological or hydrogeological data are often very scarce, and appropriate approach have {{to be found in}} order to improve the hydrogeological {{functioning of}} these islands. Groundwater resource is closely correlated with the permeability of rocks, and, in basaltic volcanic islands, permeability is usually considered to be negatively correlated with age formations. Younger lavas have higher permeability than older one's often highly weathered (Custodio et al., 1988). Existing hydrogeological models of basaltic volcanic islands describe large-scale systems at the volcano or island scale, and two end models have been described. The Hawaiian model (Meinzer, 1930) considers a low-lying basal aquifer linked to inland dike-impounded and perched aquifers overlying impervious layers and/or confined by dykes (Tabasaki and Mink, 1983). The Canary Islands model (Custodio, 1975; Custodio et al., 1988) considers a continuous and isotropic basal aquifer, and a decrease of hydraulic conductivity with the age of the volcanic rocks. Nevertheless, those models are consistent with Young Island (< 5 Ma) and seem not fully appropriate for older island such as Mayotte Island. Mayotte Island is a small French overseas territory of the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Its population has quickly increased during the last decades and has been multiplied by four in less than 30 years. The island is now very densely populated with more than 500 inhabitants per square kilometer. Water needs are thus substantial. Surface water resource is very strongly solicited, and too dry seasons can lead to critical situations. Nevertheless, its hydrogeological functioning is not well known, and understanding the hydrogeological functioning of the island is thus essential for an adapted management of groundwater resources and to make appropriate drilling campaigns. In 2010, an helborne SkyTEM survey on the whole island has been performed. The transmitter loop is composed of four 284 m² loops that transmit a low moment with a single turn and a high moment with four turns of the loop. The current generated by the low moment is 11 A, giving a moment of about 3100 Am² and a turn off time of 10 microseconds. That generated by the high moment is 108 A, giving a moment of about 123, 000 Am² and a turn off time of 38 microseconds. The first sampling gate is centred about 6. 5 microseconds for the low moment and the last window of the high moment is 8 ms. A linear 3000 km of SkyTEM TDEM data was acquired in a month. The average flight line spacing was 200 metres, with local spacings of 400 metres or 100 metres. The average speed of the helicopter was 18 m/s (65 km/h) with an average ground clearance of the transmitter loop being 48 metres. The TDEM decay curves were filtered using Workbench software with 1 D modelling of the curves based on the Ward and Hohmann (1988) solutions. Data inversion was done with em 1 Dinv software (Auken et al, 2004) using a 20 -layer model with fixed depths and a spatial constraint between the model resistivities of nearby soundings (Viezzoli et al, 2008). This model was preferred to a stratified-type inversion because the development of the weathering profile is not conducive to the presence of a sharp contrast between the bodies. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to show the calibration of 3 D resistivity mapping realized on another and older volcanic island, with boreholes data in a test site in the South of Mayotte Island, and how the highlighted paleo-valley structure enhance understanding the hydrogeological functioning of the South of Mayotte Island. To establish the 3 D model, we used correlation between borehole, geological map and 3 D resistivity grids. Comparison between TDEM data, borehole and pumping tests data have provided new evidence about the hydrogeological scheme of the island, which seems different from the two previously mentioned. This study is focused in the South of the and includes two watersheds. The surface of the Kani-Kéli watershed, the west one, is about 4. 9 km², and the surface of the Mronabeja watershed, the est one, is about 4. 4 km². Four boreholes {{have been made in the}} past Simplified and interpreted geological logs show that two boreholes are drilled in weathered lavas, whereas the two others encountered about 30 m of weathered lavas overlying unweathered and superposed fresh fissured lava flows, with a confined aquifer in the fresh lava. 3 D geological model of this area is made with GeoModeller ® software. Two kinds of data are used: polygons extracted from the provisional geological map using ArcMap and TDEM data. One model was produced with TDEM sounding (i. e. without resistivity interpolatation). 3 D modeling of different geological formations can delineate structures with a hydrogeological interest. Indeed, in healthy fractured lavas, characterized by variable resistivity of 30 to 100 Ω. m, are considered as potential reservoirs of groundwater in these formations modeled structures thus correspond to aquifer sector Choungui South. The results show that helicopter borne TDEM is particularly adapted for this volcanic island, with low resistivities soils outcropping. Data computation also allows to image geological structure in 3 D and boreholes comparison allows attributing geological identification for the main ranges of resistivity data. Productive boreholes, in the axis of a resistive body, and unproductive boreholes outside, allow confirming the implication of paleo-valley as major constraint for groundwater flows and the necessity to enhance existing conceptual model. The South of Mayotte Island is thus proposed as an end member of basaltic models. These results are very hopeful, and we are now looking for similar structure in order to drill new boreholes, to confirm the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> aquifer structure, and to provide water to population. method...|$|E

For the case of no constraint, using {{the idea of a}} Four Step Scheme (Ma, Protter, and Yong 1994), we prove the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> a class of contingent claims (including European call and put options) without assuming ad hoc technical conditions. For the case with the wealth and portfolio being constrained, several positive and negative results concerning hedgeability and replicability are presented.

40|$|Complex {{data driven}} {{experiments}} {{form the basis}} of biomedical research. Recent findings warn that {{the context in which the}} software is run, that is the infrastructure and the third party dependencies, can have a crucial impact on the final results delivered by a computational experiment. This implies that in order to replicate the same result, not only the same data must be used, but also it must be run on an equivalent software stack. In this paper we present the VFramework that enables assessing <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> workflows. It identifies whether any differences in software dependencies among two executions of the same workflow exist and whether they have impact on the produced results. We also conduct a case study in which we investigate the impact of software dependencies on <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> Taverna workflows used in biomedical research of Huntington’s disease. We re-execute analysed workflows in environments differing in operating system distribution and configuration. The results show that the VFramework can be used to identify the impact of software dependencies on the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> biomedical workflows. Furthermore, we observe that despite the fact that the workflows are executed in a controlled environment, they still depend on specific tools installed in the environment. The context model used by the VFramework improves the deficiencies of provenance traces and documents also such tools. Based on our findings we define guidelines for workflow owners that enable them to improve <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> their workflows...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{experiments}} and robotic competitions share some common traits that {{can put the}} debate about developing better experimental methodologies and <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> results in robotics research on more solid ground. In this context, the Robot Competitions Kick Innovation in Cognitive Systems and Robotics (RoCKIn) project aims to develop competitions that come close to scientific experiments, providing an objective performance evaluation of robot systems under controlled and replicable conditions. In this article, by further articulating replicability into reproducibility and repeatability and by considering some results from the 2014 first RoCKIn competition, we show that the RoCKIn approach offers tools that enable the <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> experimental results...|$|R

30|$|Rasch {{modeling}} two separation indices {{providing information}} {{on whether the}} person and item estimates estimated by Rasch model are reliable. Person separation index indicates <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> person ordering while item separation index indicates <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> item placement on an interval scale (Bond and Fox 2015). The widely accepted threshold for the separation index is 3.0 (Bond and Fox 2015). Person and item separation indices {{for the present study}} were 5.07 and 4.31 (corresponding to 7.09 person strata and 6.08 item strata)—these results indicate that this sample and items are separable into 6 – 7 levels of ability or difficulty levels, respectively (Bonk and Ockey 2003), from which they indicated that the person and item estimates from the Rasch analysis are reliable and are replicable on interval scales (Bond and Fox 2015).|$|R
40|$|Goal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{paper is}} to assess the {{scalability}} and <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> smart grid projects, focusing on the identification of limitations and barriers faced by smart gird project. For this purpose, factors have been identified that influence and condition a project’s scalability and replicability through {{a review of the}} state of the art and analysis of smart grid demonstration project. The factors are of technical, economic, and regulatory and social acceptance nature, and they describe requirements for scalability and replicability. Data was collected from on-going European smart grid demonstration project which allowed quantifying the status quo with respect to the scalability and replicability, i. e., to what extent projects take into account these factors. The obtain results allowed the identification of barriers, limitations regarding the scalability and <b>replicability</b> <b>of</b> smart grid projects. In particular, the absence of standards, the physical limits of the existing infrastructure, the absence of cost-benefit analyses and the neglect of varying macroeconomic factors, stakeholder involvement and from the dependency of projects on regional or national regulatory frameworks and market designs. status: publishe...|$|R
