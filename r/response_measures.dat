25|$|Fetuses between 32 and 39 weeks {{gestation}} {{were presented}} a pure tone (CS), which was {{paired with a}} vibroacoustic stimulus (US). A vibroacoustic stimulus is a low bass sound frequency that is felt by the fetus as a mechanical vibration. After 10-20 pairings, approximately 50% of the fetuses showed successful conditioning, unrelated to age or sex of the fetus. It is suggested that poorly prepared experimental set up, inaccurate or inappropriate <b>response</b> <b>measures</b> and unsuitable stimuli could all contribute to failed conditioning, as opposed to lack of fetal memory. Reasons for some fetuses demonstrating conditioning, while others do not, remains undetermined.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{plan was}} to utilize Sevmorput in {{international}} transport, and the Soviet government applied for a permission to have the ship make several stops in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in March 1990. However, the permission was denied because the evacuation and emergency <b>response</b> <b>measures</b> of the city were not deemed adequate {{in case of an}} accident involving the ship's nuclear reactor. Later the ship was mainly used on the Murmansk-Dudinka route, but also made several trips to Vietnam in the early 1990s. The daily operating expenses of Sevmorput were reportedly around US$90,000 and she was not expected to make profit during {{the first two years of}} her career.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for {{the estimation of}} bridge mode shapes using the <b>response</b> <b>measured</b> on a passing vehicle. A truck-trailer system is assumed, equipped with an external excitation at a frequency close {{to one of the}} bridge natural frequencies. The excitation makes the bridge response dominant at its natural frequency. The acceleration <b>responses</b> are <b>measured</b> on two following axles of the vehicle. It is shown that the amplitude of the signal includes the operational deflected shape data which can be used to estimate the bridge mode shapes. The energy of the <b>responses</b> <b>measured</b> on two following axles is obtained using the Hilbert Huang Transform. It is shown that the bridge mode shape can be estimated with high resolution and accuracy using a rescaling process. The presence of road roughness introduces additional contributions to the <b>response</b> <b>measured</b> on the vehicle, in addition to the bridge response. The concept of subtraction of the <b>responses</b> <b>measured</b> from two identical axles is used to remove the effect of road roughness...|$|R

Furthermore, keeping vehicle speed below 4 m/s provides enough data for successful identification of bridge mode shapes...|$|R
40|$|Since 1966, {{researchers}} have examined financial distress prediction models {{to determine the}} usefulness of accounting information to lenders. These researchers primarily used legal bankruptcy as the response variable for economic financial distress, or included legal bankruptcy with other events in dichotomous prediction models. However, theoretical models of financial distress normally define financial distress as an economic event, the inability to pay debts when due (insolvency). This study uses a loan default/accommodation response variable {{as a proxy for}} the inability to pay debts when due. The purpose of this note is to empirically test whether or not using the inability of a firm to pay debts when due, loan default/accommodation, as a <b>response</b> <b>measure</b> produces different results than using legal bankruptcy as the <b>response</b> <b>measure.</b> The study's empirical results show that legal bankruptcy and loan default/accommodation financial distress prediction models produce different statistical results, thus suggesting that the <b>responses</b> <b>measure</b> different constructs. A loan default/accommodation model also fits the data better than a bankrupt model. Our results suggest that a loan default/accommodation response may be a more appropriate measure to determine which accounting information is most useful to lenders in evaluating a firm's credit risk.
