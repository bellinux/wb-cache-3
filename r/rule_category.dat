40|$|A {{neural network}} {{realization}} of the fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) algorithm is described. Fuzzy ART is capable of rapid stable learning of recognition categories in response to arbitrary sequences of analog or binary input patterns. Fuzzy ART incorporates computations from fuzzy set theory into the ART 1 neural network, which learns to categorize only binary input patterns, thus enabling the network to learn both analog and binary input patterns. In the neural network realization of fuzzy ART, signal transduction obeys a path capacity <b>rule.</b> <b>Category</b> choice is determined {{by a combination of}} bottom-up signals and learned category biases.

40|$|There {{has been}} almost fifteen years of {{political}} controversy surrounding changes to the rules and procedures by which aircraft conduct their flight within regional Australia. Decisions based on a predominately heuristic (rule of thumb) approach to design have had many adverse consequences for {{the integrity of the}} proximity warning function. A sound mathematical model is required to establish this function on a mature engineering foundation. To achieve this, the proximity warning function has been investigated as a hybrid-system. This approach recognises the dual nature of the design: that aircraft dynamics give rise to continuous mathematical models while the communication protocols controlling proximity require discrete mathematical approaches. The blending of each aspect has yielded a deeper insight into the operational limitations and failure modes of this function. The presentation of the thesis follows a design thread through the function. It begins with a description of existing standards and implementations. Risk models are then developed. The pilot interface is recognised as a primary design constraint. Mathematical models are then developed to describe the topology of flow, proximity dynamics, and the scheduling constraints associated with visual, voice, and data-link communications required by the proximity warning function. These analyses show that many aspects of design can be bounded by analytical formulae that bring new robustness to the design and resolve some of the misconceptions arising from the often inaccurate perceptions of present airspace operations. Failure modes, unaccounted for in existing designs are found to actually aggravate failure in the very situations in which the airspace design should be robust and should act to prevent collisions. In particular, there are divergences of performance between the demands required by the system design and the ability of the pilot to deliver such performances. In some cases, these failures may be traced to policy decisions such as service between Instrument Flight Rule and Visual Flight <b>Rule</b> <b>category</b> aircraft. On the basis of the conclusions of this research, a formal engineering review of the proximity warning function is required to assure the containment of the likelihood of mid-air collision for all future operations...|$|E

Process renovation is a reengineering strategy that critically examines current business policies, practices and procedures, re-thinks them through and then redesigns the mission-critical products, processes, and services. Renovation is presented as the key element of e-business orientation and the highest level of strategy for managing change that usually cannot be handled by continuous improvement and reengineering methods or organisational restructuring. The paper also introduces different business <b>rule</b> <b>categories</b> and discusses the relationships that exist between business rules and other business-related concepts, addressed in business modelling...|$|R

40|$|School {{rules are}} usually {{associated}} with classroom management and school discipline. However, rules also define {{ways of thinking about}} oneself and the world. Rules are guidelines for actions and for the evaluation of actions in terms of good and bad, or right and wrong, and therefore a part of moral or values education in school. This study is a part of a larger ethnographic study on values education in the everyday life of school. Here the focus is on school rules and students' reasoning about these <b>rules.</b> Five <b>categories</b> of school <b>rules</b> have been constructed during the analysis: (a) relational rules; (b) structuring rules; (c) protecting rules; (d) personal rules; and (e) etiquette rules. The findings show that the students' reasoning about rules varies across the <b>rule</b> <b>categories.</b> The perception of reasonable meaning behind a rule seems to be - not surprisingly - significant to students' acceptance of the rule. According to the students, relational rules are the most important in school. Students also value protecting and structuring rules as important because of the meaning giving to them. Etiquette rules are valued as the least important or even unnecessary by the students.
