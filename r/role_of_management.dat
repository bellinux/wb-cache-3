40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the importance <b>of</b> the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> control systems in creating competitive advantage and present a framework for its measurement. A literature review was conducted on management control systems, competitive strategy, budgetary control systems and competitive advantage. Various components <b>of</b> <b>management</b> control systems were explored. Based on the insights gained, a conceptual framework for the measurement <b>of</b> the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> control systems in creating competitive advantage is presented. The paper presents a conceptual framework of competitive advantage using management control systems. The development of a framework for assessing the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> control in creating competitive advantage is an attempt to contribute to a relatively less explored area. This research is expected to motivate researchers to work in this area. This framework will be beneficial to researchers and practicing managers in identification of opportunities for improvements in management control systems and gaining and sustaining competitive advantage. This paper explores research in a less explored area and offers a framework to help researchers and practitioners in providing a direction for creating and sustaining competitive advantage. management control systems; MCS; competitive advantage; budgetary control systems; BCS; competitive strategy; literature review. ...|$|R

2500|$|Family {{formed in}} Late 1966 in Leicester, England from the {{remaining}} {{members of a}} group that was previously known as The Farinas and later briefly The Roaring Sixties, whose sound was grounded in R. The Farinas originally consisted of John [...] "Charlie" [...] Whitney, Tim Kirchin (born c. 1944, Birstall, Leicestershire died c. 2000), Harry Ovenall (born Richard Harry Ovenall, 12 September 1943, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire) and Jim King, forming at Leicester Art College in 1962. Ric Grech replaced Kirchin on bass in 1965 and Roger Chapman joined the following year on vocals. The American record producer Kim Fowley suggested they call themselves [...] "The Family" [...] as they regularly wore double-breasted suits in performances, giving themselves a mafia appearance, a look they soon abandoned in favour a more casual dress code. They played the famous Marquee Club regularly and other London clubs including The Hundred Club and the famous Sybilla's in Swallow Street where they met Henrietta Guinness who introduced them into society. On meeting Mim Scala who they had known before, Scala asked if there was anything he could do for them. Because they were looking for material at the time, and probably a producer, Ovenall asked Scala if he could arrange for Jimmy Miller to produce the first single which he duly did. Scala also introduced them to John Gilbert, who from then on took over managing the band. Thanks to Miller, Steve Winwood and other members of Traffic participated in the recording. Shortly after the recording and before the release, Ovenall voiced his concern over the movement away from their black musical roots i.e. blues, R, soul. In fact around 1965 The Farinas had publicity cards saying [...] "Farinas Soul and Roll". The single seemed to be going towards psychedelia, emphasised by the use of a phono fiddle borrowed from an Oxford Street busker, and played by Ric Grech. His concerns also included the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> in the band. A meeting of the band was called, during which it was suggested that Ovenall's heart was no longer in the band and as a consequence he walked away from the band. Contrary to several reports he was not asked to leave the band. Family's debut single [...] "Scene Through The Eye of a Lens/Gypsy Woman", produced by Jimmy Miller and released by Liberty Records in October 1967, was not a success. Drummer Ovenall was replaced by Rob Townsend.|$|E

40|$|Management {{accounting}} {{change and}} the changing <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> accountants have dominated both the professional and academic accounting literature in recent years. This paper aims to contribute to these debates by providing evidence from a sample <b>of</b> <b>management</b> accountants working in both dependent (group) and independent (non-group) organizations in the U. K. One thousand (qualified) members of the Chartered Institute <b>of</b> <b>Management</b> Accountants (CIMA), U. K., {{were randomly selected from}} the association’s database for a postal survey questionnaire. In all, 279 professionally qualified management accountants in both types of organizations responded to a postal survey questionnaire (58 percent from dependent and 42 percent from independent organizations respectively). A Mann-Whitney analysis of the responses indicates that while some significant differences exist between the views of the two groups, these management accountants agree on several <b>of</b> the <b>management</b> accounting practices and the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>management</b> accountant investigated. The study provides further insight into MAS and the changing <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> accountants. It was earlier hypothesized that significant differences would exist in the perceptions between the two groups. However the weak support for the hypotheses could be explained by the influence of other institutional forces apart from the head office control which is focused on in the paper. Thus, it was recognized that other institutional forces are likely to be at play in shaping the perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>management</b> accountants. This is a limitation of the paper and future research to study the impacts of other institutional factors is recommended...|$|R
