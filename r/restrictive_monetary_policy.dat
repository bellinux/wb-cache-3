40|$|The paper studies a two-sector {{monetary}} {{economy with}} two factors of production, labor and capital. The industrial sector has increasing returns to scale, the consumption sector non-increasing returns. All firms maximize profits and markets clear. For each {{rate of return}} on capital the model reaches a general equilibrium with an associated demand for money. A <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is a quantity of money supplied. We prove that <b>restrictive</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> decrease the level of operation and profits of the increasing returns to scale sector and eventually force it to operate with negative profits, so that it must close down. The other sector of the economy, however, expands with more <b>restrictive</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies,</b> but national income as a whole decreases. <b>Monetary</b> <b>policies</b> affect the rate of interest of the economy and determine whether or not competitive market equilibria exist with a positive output in the increasing returns sector. With very <b>restrictive</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies,</b> the only market equilibria with continued output from the increasing returns sector are those where this sector is being subsidized. There are, therefore, two choices open to this economy: either adequate liquidity is provided to allow the increasing returns sector to behave competitively and produce positive output, or else this sector must be regulated and subsidized to prevent it from closing down. ...|$|R

Measurable changes in GDP growth began to emerge in the first quarter of 1990, however, overall growth remained positive. The immediate cause of the recession was a loss of consumer and business confidence as a result of the 1990 oil price shock, coupled with an already weak economy.|$|E

50|$|Néstor Kirchner, who {{belonged to}} the {{moderate}} center-left wing of Peronism (rooted in the leftist Peronist factions of the 1970s), continued Duhalde's measures (even keeping his Minister of Economy, Roberto Lavagna) and added some heterodox economics. Heavy taxes on exports have served to keep local prices of valuable commodities in check, while collecting huge revenues (especially from oil products and agricultural exports like soybeans). The <b>restrictive</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> of the 1990s has become aggressively expansive; the Central Bank has injected large amounts of cash into the economy and bought dollars from the free currency market in order to accumulate reserves. The fiscal policy is also expansive; the government has raised private and public salaries by decree on several occasions, and has encouraged negotiations between {{the private sector and}} the labor movements. Inflation has again become a concern. The government has struck price-freezing agreements with certain sectors of the economy (producers of milk, some foods, natural gas, etc.) and put heavy pressure on others. Failure to comply on the part of Argentine beef producers has been met with a punitive suspension of exports, starting March 2006, intended to increase domestic supply (this was then softened to a quota system).|$|E
50|$|When Streseman reshuffled {{his cabinet}} on 6 October 1923, Luther {{took over the}} Ministry of Finance and kept that {{portfolio}} in the two cabinets led by Wilhelm Marx which followed. Luther thus {{was in charge of}} the currency reform which ended the hyperinflation and introduced a new stable Mark. By 15 October, Luther presented a plan that combined elements of a reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther's predecessor Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (Ermächtigungsgesetz) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the plan was implemented that same day, 15 October 1923. The <b>restrictive</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> by Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank helped to stabilize the currency, as did steps taken by Luther to close the budget deficit. On the revenue side, he pushed through three emergency tax hikes, brought forward due dates for taxes, increased prepayments of assesed taxes, raised the sales tax, taxed inflation gains and reorganized the financial burden sharing between Reich and Länder. On the spending side, Luther managed a drastic cut in personnel costs - by reducing the number of Reich employees by almost 25% over four months, a freeze on promotions and fixing public salaries at a level lower than that of 1913.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{transmission}} mechanism of monetary policy under an institutional framework characterized by a dollarized banking system, a flexible exchange rate and free capital movements.

This paper argues that, {{to answer this question}} appropriately, one must consider that EMS membership brings potentially large credibility gains to policy-makers in inflation-prone countries: the reason is that not only it attaches an extra penalty to inflation (in terms of real appreciation), but makes the public aware that the policy-maker is faced with such penalty, and thus helps to overcome the inefficiency stemming from the public's mistrust of the authorities. 1...|$|R

In this paper, the authors examine the appropriateness of conventional policy instruments for tightening money in two common cases: 1) when there is a voluntary credit crunch because of a rise in perceived risk of default, and 2) when individuals rationed in the goods market in reforming socialist economies accumulate savings involuntarily ("money overhang").

The particular case of Romania is analysed in two settings: (i) in an ad-hoc econometric investigation on the determinants of M 1 and M 2 velocity and (ii) in a simple money demand-money supply model which is estimated with and without endogenous inter-enterprise arrears as determinant of money demand. The general conclusion of the research is that, {{even though it is}} theoretically possible for overdue trade debt and arrears to interfere with <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> effectiveness and reflect upon the evolution of monetary aggregates, this was NOT the case with inter-enterprise arrears in Romania between 1991 - 1995.

40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract The Chilean {{experience}} with price-based capital account regulations (i. e., deposits or reserve requirements on capital inflows) has {{been subject to}} extensive discussion in the recent literature. This paper presents evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} similar regulations in Colombia since September 1993, when traditional exchange controls were replaced by price-based regulations. It is important to emphasize that the Tobin tax equivalent of such regulations in Colombia has been quite high (13. 6 % and 6. 4 % tax for 12 and 36 months loans, respectively, in 1994 - 1998), and, as in Chile, it is certainly much higher than the rates suggested for an international Tobin tax. The econometric evidence presented indicates that these regulations have been effective in Colombia, both in terms of reducing the volume of flows and in improving the term structure of external borrowing. This indicates that price-based regulations give the authorities some room for maneuver to adopt <b>restrictive</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> during international capital market booms. They have also been effective in improving the debt profile of the country, a crucial determinant of macroeconomic risks in the face of busts in the international capital market...|$|R
