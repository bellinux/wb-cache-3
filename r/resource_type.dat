During a disaster, an emergency manager knows what capability a resource needs to have to respond efficiently and effectively. <b>Resource</b> <b>typing</b> definitions will help define resource capabilities for ease of ordering and mobilization during a disaster. As {{a result of the}} <b>resource</b> <b>typing</b> process, a <b>resource’s</b> capability is readily defined and an emergency manager is able to effectively and efficiently request and receive resources through mutual aid during times of disaster.

40|$|Scheduling in High-Performance Computing (HPC) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} centered around computing resources (e. g., processors/cores). The ever-growing {{amount of data}} produced by modern scientific applications start to drive novel architectures and new computing frameworks to support more efficient data processing, transfer and storage for future HPC systems. This trend towards data-driven computing demands the scheduling solutions to also consider other resources (e. g., I/O, memory, cache) that can be shared amongst competing applications. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling HPC applications while exploring the availability of multiple <b>types</b> of <b>resources</b> that could impact their performance. The goal is to minimize the overall execution time, or makespan, {{for a set of}} moldable tasks under multiple-resource constraints. Two scheduling paradigms, namely, list scheduling and pack scheduling, are compared through both theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations. Theoretically, we prove, for several algorithms falling in the two scheduling paradigms, tight approximation ratios that increase linearly with the number of <b>resource</b> <b>types.</b> As the complexity of direct solutions grows exponentially with the number of <b>resource</b> <b>types,</b> we also design a strategy to indirectly solve the problem via a transformation to a single-resource-type problem, which can significantly reduce the algorithms' running times without compromising their approximation ratios. Experiments conducted on Intel Knights Landing with two <b>resource</b> <b>types</b> (processor cores and high-bandwidth memory) and simulations designed on more <b>resource</b> <b>types</b> confirm the benefit of the transformation strategy and show that pack-based scheduling, despite having a worse theoretical bound, offers a practically promising and easy-to-implement solution, especially when more <b>resource</b> <b>types</b> need to be managed.
