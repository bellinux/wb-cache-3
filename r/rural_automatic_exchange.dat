5000|$|The use {{of letters}} on dials was {{proposed}} in 1917 by W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T. Large cities like New York would ultimately require a seven-digit number, but some {{tests in the}} early 1900s indicated that the short-term memory span of many people could not handle seven digits and many dialling errors due to memory lapse might occur (the documentation for these tests is lost). Hence the first Panel <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> cutover in 1915 in Newark, New Jersey used [...] "semiautomatic" [...] operation with the local operator keying the number for the caller. And as large cities would have both manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> for some years, the numbers for manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{would have the same}} format (originally MULberry 3456, with three letters then four numbers), which could be either spoken or dialled.|$|R

50|$|In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was {{inspired}} by the idea of manufacturing <b>automatic</b> telephone <b>exchanges</b> that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger <b>Automatic</b> Telephone <b>Exchange</b> Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the <b>automatic</b> telephone <b>exchange.</b> Subsequently, in 1901, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.|$|R

40|$|Tax {{authorities}} are increasingly relying on mutual cooperation with their foreign peers to enforce more effectively their internal tax laws. After the banking scandals of 2008 {{and the subsequent}} global financial crisis, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for TaxPurposes has proposed the exchange of information upon request as the fiscal transparency standard. However, some measures adopted by the European Union, previous initiatives from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and, above all, {{the introduction of the}} Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) by the United States in 2010 have promoted the need to adopt the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information as the new fiscal transparency standard. <b>Automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information allows home countries to verify whether their taxpayers have correctly included foreign income, allowing tax authorities to have early warning of possible noncompliance cases. In February 2014, the OECD published its proposal for a new global model of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of financial account information. The new global model contains the necessary legal instruments and due diligence and reporting procedures, mainly for financial institutions...|$|R

40|$|Resume in English Name of the thesis: "GATCA" and its {{integration}} into legal {{order of the}} Czech Republic The diploma thesis deals with legislation regulating <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in tax matters based on the Common Reporting Standard On Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information (also known as Common Reporting Standard) usually {{referred to as a}} GATCA system and its {{integration into}} legal order of the Czech Republic. A main goal of the legislation is to secure higher public incomes for public budgets and to weaken a position of tax havens in relation to tax evasion by taxpayers. The GATCA system legislation and its integration into legal order of the Czech Republic are evaluated in accordance with this goal. One of the main conclusions of the diploma thesis is considering some possible loopholes of the GATCA system that may be used by taxpayers to avoid duties imposed on them by legislation regulating <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in tax matters and suggesting solutions that should be used to close these loopholes. The greatest GATCA system's loophole is its relation to the another system of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in tax matters known as a FATCA system and based on the US federal statute Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and intergovernmental agreements between [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{provisions}} of the Tax Administration Act, No 28 of 2011 (TAA), as well as the introduction of Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) between South Africa and other nations around the world, the issues around information exchange and the confidentiality thereof has become pertinent. Article 26 of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital provides a standard for information exchange and also highlights the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information as being considered a standard form of information exchange. The recent case of Commissioner of South Africa v Werner Van Kets dealt with the definition of a taxpayer as well as information exchange. In addition, this case ruled on the hierarchy of domestic laws and international agreements. This case has led {{to the question of whether}} or not a third party is considered a taxpayer in terms of international tax agreements and raises question regarding the taxpayer's rights to confidentiality relating to information exchanged. In light of new international best practice, domestic legislation and case law, various domestic laws of South Africa were reviewed to determine whether the domestic law allows for the international exchange of information and whether or not the confidentiality clauses therein are contradictory to one another. When reviewing the manner in which South Africa allows for the exchange of information, in {{light of the}} standard Article 26, it was found that the TIEAs are aligned with both the TAA and Article 26 in terms of the exchange of information that is relevant to domestic laws. It would however appear that South Africa has not yet adopted the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information - apart from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) that was signed with the USA. South Africa has only entered into bilateral agreements which allow for the exchange of information on request and The TAA is silent on <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange,</b> despite the financial benefit of increased annual taxation revenue that South Africa could gain through having <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> agreements in place...|$|R
