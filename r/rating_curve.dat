Discharge at the gauging site is generally estimated by developing single-valued simple <b>rating</b> <b>curves.</b> However, in case of unsteady flows, hysteresis affect is introduced in the stage discharge relationship and as such single-valued <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> are no longer valid for such situations. The present paper presents a simple spreadsheet-based optimization approach for modelling the hysteresis-affected discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curves.</b> Generalized reduced gradient (GRG) technique has been reported as a reliable tool for handling optimization problems; therefore, in the present paper, it has been applied to estimate discharge for two sites with hysteresis affect based on Jones formula. Comparison of results shows that discharge estimated by GRG technique is as efficient as genetic algorithm and the goodness-of-fit criteria shows that the <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> obtained by using Jones formula fit the observed data better than single-valued simple <b>rating</b> <b>curves</b> for both the sites considered in the present study.

50|$|In hydrology, stage {{refers to}} the water level in a river or stream {{with respect to a}} chosen {{reference}} height. Stage is important because direct measurements of river discharge are very difficult while water surface elevation measurements are comparatively easy.

5000|$|The {{development}} of a <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> involves two steps. In the first step the relationship between stage and discharge is established by measuring the stage and corresponding discharge in the river.

If the stage-discharge relationship does not change with time, it is called permanent control. If the relationship does change, it is called shifting control. Shifting control is usually due to erosion or deposition of sediment at the stage measurement site. Bedrock-bottomed parts of rivers or concrete/metal weirs or structures are often, though not always, permanent controls.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{research}} for analysis of flow regime and design of hydraulic structure and river channel. To develop the reliable stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve,</b> numerous discharge data from the lowest to bankful stage should be observed {{over a long period}} of time. The river environment and topography of Nakdong River in Korea has been changed drastically due to the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project from the end of 2009 to 2012. Moreover, 8 weirs were built dividing the main river into nine sectors and it led the discontinuous flow and backwater effect for each sector. In such situations, the stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> should be re-determined with new data for the changed topography and flow characteristics. However, it takes long time to get the new stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> In this study, the alternative stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was developed using the Hydraulic Performance Graph (HPG). HPG is a plot summarizing all the backwater profile for all possible discharge at a channel reach based on the flow equation that is derived from the energy equation. In this study, the 26 cross sections up to a length of 12. 3 km located between Gangjung weir and Dalsung weir in Nakdong River after the project were measured. The HPG for this sector was created. Using the results of discharge and water surface elevation from the HPG, the alternative stage-discharge <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> was created.

40|$|The flood data {{reported}} by gauging authorities, though perceived as measured data, is rather estimated from a <b>rating</b> <b>curve.</b> The <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> represents a relationship {{at a particular}} gauged location between water level and flow values. The {{lower part of the}} <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> is generally established based on flow measurements during smaller flood events typically up to an annual exceedance probability (AEP) of 1 in 10; however, the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> usually needs extrapolation to flood magnitudes corresponding to AEPs of 1 in 100 and beyond. There are different methods of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> extrapolation, with different degrees of uncertainty associated with them. Most hydrologic models use at-site flood data as “accurate” measured values in evaluating the model performance, thus creating a misconception in hydrologic practice. This paper examines the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty levels for a set of New South Wales (NSW) catchments, which have been assembled as a part of Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) Project 5 ‘Regional Flood Methods’. ARR-FLIKE is used to assess the impacts of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty on at-site flood quantile estimates. The results indicate that a higher assumed value of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty in flood frequency analysis inflates the uncertainty bounds of the estimated flood quantiles (i. e. increases the width of the 90 % confidence limits). This is more noticeable for smaller AEP floods. Based on results from the 96 catchments examined here, it has been found that the difference in flood quantile estimates for different assumed <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty values do not depend on standard deviation and skew of log-space annual maximum flood series data. It is noted that the <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> uncertainty issue needs to be recognised in flood frequency analysis as this represents a significant source of uncertainty in flood frequency analysis, which is often ignored in practice. The findings of this study are based on 96 NSW catchments only, and hence caution should be applied in drawing inferences for other catchments and/or other parts of Australia. Further study with a greater number of catchments from all Australian states should be undertaken to understand better the impacts of <b>rating</b> <b>curve</b> extrapolation uncertainty on flood frequency analysis results in different situations...|$|E
