25|$|Getters act by {{chemically}} {{combining with}} residual or infiltrating gases, but {{are unable to}} counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as iconoscopes, orthicons, and image orthicons, comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and <b>resealing),</b> and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, {{so there is no}} long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.|$|E
25|$|Although most injury {{responses}} {{include a}} calcium influx signaling to promote <b>resealing</b> of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid {{separation of the}} proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually leads to bead like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions {{at the site of}} injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are currently unknown.|$|E

25|$|With a few limited exceptions, the High Court has the {{jurisdiction}} {{to hear and}} try any action in personam (that is, directed towards a particular person) where the defendant is served with a writ of summons or other originating process in or outside Singapore, or where the defendant submits to the Court's jurisdiction. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of case no matter how trivial or serious. In practice, though, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000.

25|$|The High Court {{exercises}} both original jurisdiction and {{appellate jurisdiction}} in {{civil and criminal}} matters. By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance; in other words, it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of civil or criminal case, no matter how trivial or serious. However, in practice, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. For example, a Magistrate's Court may hear civil cases where the amount claimed does not exceed S$60,000. If a plaintiff commences an action in the High Court to recover a sum of money based on contract, tort or any written law, and the suit could have been filed in a Magistrate's Court, if the plaintiff eventually succeeds in recovering a sum that does not exceed $60,000, she is not entitled to receive any more costs – legal expenses payable to her by the defendant – than a Magistrate's Court would have ordered. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the <b>resealing</b> of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} review {{is to focus on}} the various features, drug loading {{technology}} and biomedical application of <b>resealed</b> erythrocytes. <b>Resealed</b> erythrocytes are gaining more popularity because of their ability to circulate throughout the body, biocompatibility, zero order release kinetics, reproducibility and ease of preparation [...] Erythrocytes are biocompatible, biodegradable, possess long circulation half lives, and can be loaded with a variety of biologically active compounds using various chemical and physical methods (Hypotonic dilution, Hypotonic hemolysis, Electro-insertion, entrapment by endocytosis, Hypo-osmotic lysis).

40|$|AbstractAlkaline {{phosphatase}} {{is required}} for the mineralization of bone and cartilage. This enzyme is localized in the matrix vesicle, which plays a role key in calcifying cartilage. In this paper we standardize a method to construction a <b>resealed</b> ghost cell–alkaline phosphatase system to mimic matrix vesicles and examine the kinetic behavior of the incorporated enzyme. Polidocanol-solubilized alkaline phosphatase, free of detergent, was incorporated into <b>resealed</b> ghost cells. This process was time-dependent and practically 50 % of the enzyme was incorporated into the vesicles in 40 h of incubation, at 25 °C. Alkaline phosphatase–ghost cell systems were relatively homogeneous with diameters of about 300 nm and were more stable when stored at − 20 °C. Alkaline phosphatase was completely released from the <b>resealed</b> ghost cell-system using only phospholipase C. These experiments confirm that the interaction between alkaline phosphatase and the lipid bilayer of <b>resealed</b> ghost cell is exclusively via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of the enzyme. An important point shown is that an enzyme bound to <b>resealed</b> ghost cell does not lose the ability to hydrolyze ATP, pyrophosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), but the presence of a ghost membrane, as a support of the enzyme, affects its kinetic properties. Moreover, calcium ions stimulate and phosphate ions inhibit the PNPPase activity of alkaline phosphatase present in <b>resealed</b> ghost cells...|$|R

2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful <b>resealing</b> consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|E

40|$|Ribosomal {{subunits}} are {{assembled in}} the nucleus, and mature 40 S and 60 S subunits are exported stoichiometrically into the cytoplasm. The nuclear export of ribosomal subunits is a unidirectional, saturable and energy-dependent process. An in vitro assay for the nuclear export of 60 S ribosomal subunits {{involves the use of}} <b>resealed</b> nuclear envelopes. The export of ribosomal subunits from <b>resealed</b> nuclear envelopes is enhanced by cytoplasmic proteins. Here we present evidence that the export-promoting activity was due to the cytoplasmic 90 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp 90).

To confirm these findings under in vivo conditions, corresponding experiments were performed with Xenopus oocytes using microinjection techniques; the results obtained confirmed the findings obtained with <b>resealed</b> nuclear envelopes. These findings suggest that Hsp 90 facilitates the nuclear export of 60 S ribosomal subunits, probably by chaperoning protein interactions during the export process...|$|R
