40|$|In the {{weighted}} voting protocol {{which is used}} to maintain the consistency of replicated data, the availability of the data to read and write operations not only depends on the availability of the nodes storing the data but also on the vote <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignments used. We consider the problem of determining the vote <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignments that yield the best permormance in a distributed system where node availabilities can be different and the mix of the read and write operations is arbitrary. The optimal vote <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignments depend not only on the system parameters such as node availability and operation mix, but also on the performance measure. We present an enumeration algorithm {{that can be used to}} find the vote <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignments that need to be considered for achieving optimal performance. When the performance measure is data availability, an analytical method is derived to evaluate it for any vote <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignment. This method and the enumeration algorithm is used [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a general}} model of "quaternary" voting rule, {{sensitive}} to voters' choices between four different options (abstaining, voting "yes", voting "no" and staying home), we systematically study {{different types of}} majority <b>and</b> <b>quorum.</b> The model allows for a precise formulation of majority rules <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> constraints. For such rules four types of majority can be defined. We also consider four types of quorum.
