50|$|An {{resistance}} temperature detector (RTD) is used to acquire temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A pressure transducer is used to account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the rigidity of the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Changes in rigidity affect {{the way that the}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> deflects. The <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more deflection in the <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>hose.</b> The <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> must be repeatable, accurate, and precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.|$|R

50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> or tubing to pipes, {{typically}} has a male-threaded end which {{mates with}} female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flexible</b> water <b>hoses</b> (or <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> connectors) {{have become}} commonplace {{in recent years}} and provide a {{low-cost}} and convenient alternative to rigid pipe. Unfortunately, inadequate designs, particularly with regard to the selection of materials and material parameters, have made some hoses prone to failure. Such failures are often initiated by incidental exposure to corrosive substances commonly found in homes (including chlorides in tap water) that attack and corrode the stainless steel metal braid. A failure of the braid then leads to a rupture of the water-carrying tube. We evaluate the design considerations pertinent to <b>flexible</b> water <b>hose</b> failures and consider a recent failure scenario that illustrates some key points...|$|R

5000|$|Skylab had a zero-gravity shower {{system in}} the work and {{experiment}} section of the Orbital Workshop. [...] The shower that had a cylindrical curtain that went from the floor to ceiling, and inside water was dispensed at {{the push of a}} button from a nozzle {{at the end of a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> In addition there was a vacuum system to suck away water. The floor of the shower (in the usual orientation of this module) had foot restraints. The user had to bring a bottle of pressurized water, which was dispensed through the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Liquid soap was used with this shower, and the use of both this soap and the water for showers were carefully planned out as with most items on the station. The first astronaut to use the space shower was Paul J.

40|$|Single and {{two-phase}} {{heat transport}} {{systems for the}} thermal control of large space facilities require fluid lines that traverse joints and either rotate or move in some other manner. <b>Flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> are being considered as one means of traversing these joints. To test the resilience of <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> to bending stress, a test assembly was constructed {{to determine the number}} of flexing cycles the hoses could withstand before losing their ability to maintain a constant pressure. Corrugated metal hoses and Teflon hoses were tested at different pressures with nitrogen gas. The metal hoses had lives ranging from 30, 000 to 100, 000 flexing cycles. But, even after 400, 000 cycles, the Teflon hoses remained essentially intact, though some leakage in the convoluted Teflon is noted...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} an initial {{investigation}} of a hybrid fluid-borne noise control system in hydraulic pipelines. The hybrid system is built by integrating an active feedforward noise controller with passive tuned <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses.</b> The active attenuator is designed to cancel the dominant harmonic pressure pulsations in the fluid line, while the passive hose is tuned to attenuate the residual high frequency pulsations. The active attenuator can effectively decrease the fluid-borne noise by superimposing a secondary anti-phase control signal. Adaptive notch filters with the filtered-X least mean square algorithm were applied for the controller and a frequency-domain least mean square filter {{was used for the}} secondary path on-line identification. The transmission line model was used to model the pipeline, and a time-domain hose model which includes coupling of longitudinal wall and fluid waves was used to model the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Simulation results show that very good noise cancellation was achieved using the proposed approach, which has several advantages over existing fluid-borne noise control systems, being effective {{for a wide range of}} frequencies without impairing the system dynamic response much. While the <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> may be less effective than purpose-built passive silencers, they can form an inexpensive and practical solution in combination with active control...|$|R
