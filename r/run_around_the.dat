The A4, a major road through West London, runs along the southeastern edge of the park, while the A5, a major road to Milton Keynes and the Midlands runs northwest from Marble Arch.|$|E
5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E

This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E
5|$|M-80 {{starts at}} exit378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs {{concurrently}} with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) {{to connect to}} ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeast–southwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly to <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{north end of the}} runway complex at the Chippewa County International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport terminal area to the south and a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates. The roadway continues eastward as 17Mile Road in Pickford Township.|$|E

5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E
5|$|Many temnospondyls {{are much}} larger than living amphibians, and superficially {{resemble}} crocodiles. Others are smaller and resemble salamanders. Most have broad, flat heads that are either blunt (brevirostrine) or elongated (longirostrine). The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above, and are usually covered in pits and ridges. The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels, which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood (early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land, and these dermal bones {{may have been an}} early solution to the problem). Many temnospondyls also have canal-like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci. The sulci, which usually <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> nostrils and eye sockets, are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water. As semiaquatic animals, most temnospondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot. Terrestrial temnospondyls have larger, thicker limbs, and some even have claws. One unusual terrestrial temnospondyl, Fayella, has relatively long limbs for its body, and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E

5|$|Thutmose I {{organized}} great {{building projects}} during his reign, including many temples and tombs, but his greatest projects {{were at the}} Temple of Karnak {{under the supervision of}} the architect Ineni. Previous to Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road. Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple's main road, along with a wall to <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall. Between pylons four and five, he had a hypostyle hall constructed, with columns made of cedar wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.|$|E

Over 200 people embarked for a run to Odessa and Pelican Bay, with the steamer departing the landing on upper Klamath Lake at 9:30a.m. and arriving at Odessa at 11:30. After a stop at Pellican Bay, the boat returned to its home landing at 7:15p.m.|$|E
25|$|Unlike when {{a person}} is {{suspended}} by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can <b>run</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.|$|E
