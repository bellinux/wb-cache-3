40|$|Nonprofits {{are facing}} {{increasing}} expectations from their funders to demonstrate progress and effectiveness. Most foundations strive {{to understand their}} own impact in large part through the successes of their grants and grantees, and many within the philanthropic community are pushing to obtain evidence of effectiveness from the nonprofit organizations they support. At the same time, a number of foundations are also working to simplify <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. Project Streamline, for example, is an effort aimed at "reducing the burden on nonprofits" and freeing up "more time and money for mission-based activities. " Recommendations to trim processes include funders "right-sizing" <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> requirements, enabling web reporting, creating standardized <b>reporting</b> processes, <b>and</b> making other operational improvements. There can be tension between these dual emphases [...] on better understanding effectiveness and on streamlining processes [...] and {{at the center of}} this tension is how best to structure <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. Some funders push for a more rigorous and often time-intensive process, while others seek to trim it down to free grantees' time, resources, and energy for their core work. But how are grantees experiencing foundation required <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes? How helpful do they find them? What actually matters most to grantees? To shed light on these questions, the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) collected survey responses from more than 24, 000 grantees about their views of 130 foundations. We learned that: On average, grantees do not find current <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes to be very helpful in strengthening their organizations and programs. Strong relationships between grantees and their funders are central to helpful <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes.

40|$|Background: Early {{childhood}} {{development is}} one of the most social determinants of health that must be notified in order to reducing social gap and inequity. In spite of increasingly developing intensive neonatal care wards and decreasing neonatal mortality rate, there is no follow-up surveillance system to identify high-risk infants (HRI) and their health problems for timely intervention after discharge. This study was carried out to design and pilot high-risk infant follow-ups (HRIFs) surveillance system, in Alzahra Hospital, a tertiary level center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (TUOMS), in 2012 - 2013. Methods: In this qualitative research after studying international documents, consensus about criteria of HRIs accomplished by focus group discussion. Then, Delphi agreement technique was used to finalizing assessment timetable. In the second phase, we piloted the designed surveillance system in Alzahra Hospital, a tertiary level center of TUOMS. Pilot study was implemented by follow-up team organized in designed model at the first phase of the study. Then, the findings of the pilot study were being assessed by an expert panel. If the members agreed on made decisions, they were being placed on the agenda of the national committee of development care of newborns for final approval. Results: High-risk infants follow-up surveillance system was designed in following steps: Defining of evidence-based criteria of HRIs, organizing the follow-up team, regulating the organs and neurodevelopment assessment timetable, publishing a health certificate notebook for HRIs, and designing Access database software for data collection, <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Conclusions: We designed and piloted HRIFs surveillance system, so this system was institutionalized in Alzahra Hospital, finally.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{report is}} an {{introduction}} {{to a series of}} three research papers that describe the evolution of the approaches taken by the Translating Research in Elder Care (TREC) research team during its first four years to feed back the research findings to study participants. TREC is an observational multi-method health services research project underway in 36 nursing homes in the prairie provinces of Canada. TREC has actively involved decision makers from the sector in all stages from initial planning, through data collection to dissemination activities. However, it was not planned as a fully integrated knowledge translation project. These three papers describe our progress towards fully integrated knowledge translation—with respect to timely and requested feedback processes. The first paper reports on the process and outcomes of creating and evaluating the feedback of research findings to healthcare aides (unregulated health professionals). These aides provide over 80 % of the direct care in our sample and actively requested the feedback as a condition of their continued cooperation in the data acquisition process. The second paper describes feedback from nursing home administrators on preliminary research findings (a facility annual <b>report)</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the reports’ utility. The third paper discusses an approach to providing a more in-depth form of feedback (expanded feedback report) at one of the TREC nursing homes. Findings Survey and interview feedback from healthcare aides is presented in the first paper. Overall, healthcare aides’ opinions about presentation of the feedback report and the understand ability, usability, and usefulness of the content were positive. The second paper describes the use of telephone interviews with facility administrators and indicates that the majority of contextual areas (e. g., staff job satisfaction) addressed in facility annual report to be useful, meaningful, and understandable. More than one-half of the administrators {{would have liked to have}} received information on additional areas. The third paper explores how a case study that examined how involvement with the TREC study influenced management and staff at one of the TREC nursing homes. The importance of understanding organizational routines and the impact of corporate restructuring were key themes emerging from the case study. In addition, the Director of Care suggested changes to the structure and format of the feedback report that would have improved its usefulness. Conclusions We believe that these findings will inform others undertaking integrated knowledge translation activities and will encourage others to become more engaged in feedback processes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Context: Every day {{increasing}} number of malwares are spreading {{around the world and}} infecting not only end users but also large organizations. This results in massive security threat for private data and expensive computer resources. There is lot of research going on to cope up with this large amount of malicious software. Researchers and practitioners developed many new methods to deal with them. One of the most effective methods used to capture malicious software is dynamic malware analysis. Dynamic analysis methods used today are very time consuming and resource greedy. Normally it could take days or at least some hours to analyze a single instance of suspected software. This is not good enough especially if we look at amount of attacks occurring every day. Objective: To save time and expensive resources used to perform these analyses, AMA: an automated malware analysis system is developed to analyze large number of suspected software. Analysis of any software inside AMA, results in a detailed report of its behavior, which includes changes made to file system, registry, processes and network traffic consumed. Main focus {{of this study is to}} develop a model to automate the runtime analysis of software which provide detailed analysis <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of its effectiveness. Methods: A thorough background study is conducted to gain the knowledge about malicious software and their behavior. Further software analysis techniques are studied to come up with a model that will automate the runtime analysis of software. A prototype system is developed and quasi experiment performed on malicious and benign software to evaluate the accuracy of the newly developed system and generated reports are compared with Norman and Anubis. Results: Based on thorough background study an automated runtime analysis model is developed and quasi experiment performed using implemented prototype system on selected legitimate and benign software. The experiment results show AMA has captured more detailed software behavior then Norman and Anubis and it could be used to better classify software. Conclusions: We concluded that AMA could capture more detailed behavior of the software analyzed and it will give more accurate classification of the software. We also can see from experiment results that there is no concrete distinguishing factors between general behaviors of both types of software. However, by digging a bit deep into analysis report one could understand the intensions of the software. That means reports generated by AMA provide enough information about software behavior and can be used to draw correct conclusions. + 46 736 51 83 0...|$|E
40|$|In May of 2004, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Richland and Fluor Hanford {{requested}} {{technical assistance}} from DOE Headquarters EM- 23 {{to provide a}} team of technical experts to evaluate likely chemical/biological amendments for mending the In Situ Redox Manipulation (ISRM) Barrier in the 100 -D Area of the Hanford Site. This request was a follow-on to an earlier request for assistance regarding the cause of chromium (Cr) breakthrough and recommendations for mending the barrier (March 2004 workshop). This report provides written documentation of the team's findings and recommendations. In 1995, a plume of dissolved hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] was discovered along the Columbia River shoreline and in the 100 -D Area. Between 1999 and 2003, a reactive barrier using the ISRM technology, was installed {{at a distance of}} 680 meters along the river to reduce the Cr(VI) in the groundwater. The ISRM technology creates a treatment zone within the aquifer by injection of sodium dithionite, a strong reducing agent that scavenges dissolved oxygen (DO) from the aquifer and reduces ferric iron [Fe(III) ], related metals, and oxy-ions. Bench-scale and field-scale treatability tests were conducted to demonstrate proof-of principle and to estimate barrier longevity, calculated to be in excess of twenty years. However, several years after initial and secondary treatment, groundwater in approximately 17 wells has been found to contain elevated Cr concentrations. The March 2004 technical assistance team (TAT) identified potential causes of Cr breakthrough as likely related to physical and chemical heterogeneity within the aquifer (including loss of reductive capacity within preferential flow paths) and the presence of other oxidants (DO and nitrate) significantly affecting the reductive capacity of the treated aquifer. These aquifer characteristics may limit the ability of alternative amendments to extend the reducing capacity of the barrier. A 2001 Bechtel Hanford <b>report</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the ISRM performance data and barrier longevity assessment corroborate the observations and findings of the March 2004 TAT. The March 2004 TAT recommended the collection of new aquifer characterization data in combination with the interpretation of existing data to develop a conceptual model of aquifer heterogeneity to enable design of the most appropriate barrier mending system. The current TAT was convened to examine the most promising amendment that could be applied to mend the ISRM barrier. The Technical Assistance Team (TAT) performed the following activities: (1) Evaluate the most appropriate single or combination of chemical/biological amendments suitable for increasing the reductive capacity of the ISRM barrier; (2) Evaluate the most practicable means of introducing chemical/biological amendments in the target zones along the current BRM barrier; (3) Provide recommendations for laboratory treatability-testing protocol development to evaluate the type and delivery mechanisms of amendments in the current ISRM barrier location. Sections of this report present analyses and recommendations of potential amendments and delivery options to improve performance of the ISRM barrier. The report covers the spectrum of passive barrier mending to chemical and biological amendments that have been shown to perform more efficiently in more active remedial design approaches. Because DOE/RL is considering significant aquifer characterization studies as additional time and cost investment to mending the barrier, the TAT strongly recommends that DOE/RL conduct cost-benefit analyses of alternative designs to mend the barrier. In this way, the value and extent of characterization studies, compared to passive amendment delivery, compared to engineering redesign, can be quantitatively estimated for decision-making purposes...|$|E

40|$|Background National {{standards}} for delivery of out-of-hours services have been refined. Health service users' preferences, <b>reports,</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of care are of importance in {{a service that}} aims to be responsive to their needs. Aim To investigate NHS service users' <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of out-of-hours care {{in the light of}} UK national service quality requirements. Design Cross sectional survey. Setting Three areas (Devon, Cornwall, Sheffield) of England, UK. Method Participants were 1249 recent users of UK out-of-hours medical services. Main outcome measures were: users' <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> of out-of-hours services in respect of the time waiting for their telephone call to the service to be answered; the length of time {{from the end of the}} initial call to the start of definitive clinical assessment (`call back time'); the time waiting for a home visit; and the waiting time at a treatment centre. Results UK national quality requirements were reported as being met by two-thirds of responders. Even when responders reported that they had received the most rapid response option for home visiting (waiting time of `up to an hour'), only one-third of users reported this as `excellent'. Adverse evaluations of care were consistently related to delays encountered in receiving care and (for two out of four measures) sex of patient. For 50 % of users to evaluate their care as `excellent', this would require calls to be answered within 30 seconds, call-back within 20 minutes, time spent waiting for home visits of significantly less than 1 hour, and treatment centre waiting times of less than 20 minutes. Conclusion Users have high expectations of UK out-of-hours healthcare services. Service provision that meets nationally designated targets is currently judged as being of `good' quality by service users. Attaining `excellent' levels of service provision would prove challenging, and potentially costly. Delivering services that result in high levels of user satisfaction with care needs to take account of users' expectations as well as their experience of careFull Tex...|$|R
