To suppress the turbulent eddies that impair thermal insulation and pressure tight of the plasma, current drive (CD) is necessary, but tools envisaged so far are unable accomplishing this task while efficiently and flexibly matching the natural current profiles self-generated at large radii of the plasma column [1 – 5]. The lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) [6] can satisfy this important need of a reactor [1], but the LHCD system has been unexpectedly mothballed on JET. The problematic extrapolation of the LHCD tool at <b>reactor</b> <b>graded</b> high values of, respectively, density and temperatures of plasma has been now solved.

Namely, using higher RF power densities [8], or a narrower antenna power spectrum in refractive index [9, 10], the obstacle for LHCD represented by too high temperature of reactor plasmas should be overcome. The former method cannot be used for routinely, safe antenna operations, Thus, only the latter key is really exploitable in a reactor.

40|$|In {{fluidized-bed}} gas-phase polymerization <b>reactors,</b> several <b>grades</b> of polyethylene {{are produced}} in the same equipment by changing the operating conditions. Transitions between the different grades are rather slow and result {{in the production of}} a considerable amount of off-specification polymer. Grade transition improvement is viewed here as a dynamic optimization problem, for which numerous approaches exist. Numerical optimization based on a nominal process model is typically insufficient due to the presence of uncertainty in the form of model mismatch and process disturbances. This paper proposes to implement optimal grade transition using a measurement-based approach instead. It is based on tracking the Necessary Conditions of Optimality (NCO tracking) using a decentralized control scheme. For this, the nominal input profiles are dissected into arcs and switching times that are assigned to the various parts of the NCO. These input elements are then adapted using appropriate measurements. NCO tracking is used to determine optimal grade transition in polyethylene reactors. The problem of minimizing the transition time from a steady state of low melt index to that of high melt index is studied, with the feeds of hydrogen and inert and the output flow rate considered as manipulated variables. In the optimal solution, all arcs are determined by path constraints, and all switching times are determined by path and terminal constraints, which significantly eases the adaptation. The on-line and run-to-run adaptation of these parameters is illustrated in simulation...|$|R

The objective is to demonstrate that low levels of gallium will not compromise {{the performance of the}} MOX fuel system in a light-water <b>reactor.</b> The <b>graded,</b> four-phase experimental program was designed to evaluate the performance of prototypic Zircaloy cladding materials against (1) liquid gallium (Phase 1), (2) various concentrations of Ga{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } (Phase 2), (3) centrally heated surrogate fuel pellets with expected levels of gallium (Phase 3), and (4) centrally heated prototypic MOX fuel pellets (Phase 4). This status report describes the results of a series of tests for Phases 1 and 2. Three types of tests are being performed: (1) corrosion, (2) liquid metal embrittlement, and (3) corrosion-mechanical. These tests will determine corrosion mechanisms, thresholds for temperature and concentration of gallium that may delineate behavioral regimes, and changes in the mechanical properties of Zircaloy. Initial results have generally been favorable for the use of WG-MOX fuel. The MOX fuel cladding, Zircaloy, does react with gallium to form intermetallic compounds at {ge} 300 C; however, this reaction is limited by the mass of gallium and is therefore not expected to be significant with a low level (parts per million) of gallium in the MOX fuel. Although continued migration of gallium into the initially formed intermetallic compound can result in large stresses that may lead to distortion, this was shown to be extremely unlikely because of the low mass of gallium or gallium oxide present and expected clad temperatures below 400 C.

40|$|Efficient {{refueling}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} requirements to sustain thermonuclear plasmas in future tokamak based fusion <b>grade</b> <b>reactors.</b> Although injection of cryogenic deuterium pellets from the magnetic high field side (HFS) was predicted to have more potential and at ASDEX upgrade found to be more efficient than injection from the low field side (LFS), the technical implementation of HFS refueling remains critically restricted to low velocities (v = 240 m/s) due to limited accessibility of the high field side of the torus. The maximum speed available by the ASDEX upgrade centrifuge is v = 1200 m/s. The required optimisation of the system guiding the pellets to the HFS is suggested by analysing the components (funnel and curved guiding tube), studying their characteristics and the physical processes involved. Firstly, impact tests on flat targets to emulate impact in a funnel were performed. Pellets were not reflected but found to quasi-slide along the inner surface of the target after the first impact. The impact velocity perpendicular to the target was found to control the survival of the pellets. At a velocity of about 42 m/s all pellets survived one or more impacts under angles of 3 - 6. An impact angle of 2 was extrapolated to ensure pellet survival at v = 1200 m/s. Accordingly, a new funnel was designed. A hidden impact parameter consisting in a transient loss of wall contact and impact onto the opposite tube wall at turning points of the tube curvature was disclosed.

40|$|A renewed {{interest}} in thorium-based fuels has arisen lately based {{on the need for}} proliferation resistance, longer fuel cycles, higher burnup and improved wasteform characteristics. Recent studies have been directed toward homogeneously mixed, heterogeneously mixed, and seed-and-blanket thorium-uranium fuel cycles that rely on "in situ" use of the bred-in U- 233. However, due to the higher initial enrichment required to achieve acceptable burnups, these fuels are encountering economic constraints. Thorium can nevertheless play a large role in the nuclear fuel cycle; particularly in the reduction of plutonium. While uranium-based mixedoxide (MOX) fuel will decrease the amount of plutonium, the reduction is limited due to the breeding of more plutonium (and higher actinides) from the U- 238. Here we present calculational results and a comparison of the potential burnup of a thorium-based and uranium-based mixed oxide fuel in a light water reactor (LWR). Although the uranium-based fuels outperformed the thorium-based fuels in achievable burnup, a depletion comparison of the initially charged plutonium (both <b>reactor</b> and weapons <b>grade)</b> showed that the thorium-based fuels outperformed the uranium-based fuels by more that a factor of 2; where more than 70 % of the total plutonium in the thorium-based fuel is consumed during the cycle. This is significant considering that the achievable burnup of the thorium-based fuels were 1. 4 to 4. 6 times less than the uranium-based fuels. Furthermore, use of a thorium-based fuel could also be used as a strategy for reducing the amount of long-lived nuclides (including the minor actinides), and thus the radiotoxicity in spent nuclear fuel. Although the breeding of U- 233 is a concern, the presence of U- 232 and its daughter products can aid in making this fuel self-protecting, and/or enough U- 238 can be added to denature the fissile uranium. From these calculations, it appears that thorium-based fuel for plutonium incineration is superior as compared to uranium-based fuel, and should be considered as an alternative to traditional MOX in both current and future reactor designs...|$|R
40|$|The most {{challenging}} conceptual problem of thermonuclear energy research based on deuterium plasmas magnetically trapped in toroidal machines, named tokamaks, consists {{in how to}} control and actively shape during operations the current density radial profile of plasma column. To achieve this control is of paramount importance, indeed, for the following reasons: i) to prevent the onset of unstable modes that detriment the figures of stability and fusion power gain from thermonuclear reactions, which are necessary for a reactor; ii) to remove the obstacle of tokamaks of being intrinsically inductive machines, i. e., capable of producing only transient plasma regimes, {{in front of the}} reactor’s need of operating in steady- state. In regard to the former problem, data of modelling and experiments available in the last 25 years showed that the growth rate of pernicious unstable plasma modes, of magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) nature, is strongly depressed when a relative maximum of the plasma current density is suitably located at radii close to the region that interests the unstable modes. They make challenging the possibility of achieving the desired thermal insulation that is necessary for allowing thermonuclear conditions of high temperatures (∼ 100 million of degrees) and high density (∼ 1020 m- 3) of plasma. The limitation of pulsed operation was, instead, well known since the assessment (half century ago) of the tokamak concept, and this was soon perceived as the major conceptual obstacle against the development of a thermonuclear fusion reactor. Indeed, at that time, the further problem of the onset of unstable modes (which produces anomalous transport effects, on heat and matter, via micro-turbulence and MHD modes) did not appear yet. The discovery in 1981 at Princeton (USA) of the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) effect was considered very attractive for facing both the mentioned major problems of a reactor. The LHCD effect consists in the capability of multimegawatt microwave power at several gigahertz, coupled to quasi-electrostatic natural modes of plasma, named lower hybrid (LH) waves, of non- inductively producing current in tokamak plasma. Consequently, the plasma current can flow with continuity in a tokamak under RF power injection. The antenna consists in phased arrays of rectangular waveguides that suitably fit the gaps of the tokamak’s magnet. Via electronic setting of the waveguide phasing, the refractive index (n//, in the direction parallel to the confinement magnetic field) of the RF power spectrum can be usefully determined in order to Landau-resonate with a tail of the electron distribution of plasma electrons, for the temperature that corresponds to the radial layer where the current drive effect would be desirably produced. As further support of attractiveness of the LHCD effect, it should be considered that other methods utilising radiofrequency power in the ion-cyclotron and electron-cyclotron resonant frequencies, as well those that exploit strong power injection of energetic ion beams, present much lower efficiency in driving plasma current than that possible by the LHCD effect. Unfortunately, for long time the LHCD effect was observed to occur successfully only when operating at too low plasma densities – of about a factor three lower than that required by reactor – despite of the many attempts carried out for decades in many laboratories in the world. In these experiments, the RF power was however successfully coupled by the antenna, but remained unexpectedly deposited at the plasma periphery, as a consequence of parasitic effects of plasma edge. Only recently, an original research performed in the ENEA-Frascati Lab. – whose results have been published on Nature Communications: 5, 55, 2010 – has assessed a new method for enabling the occurrence of the LHCD effect at <b>reactor</b> <b>graded</b> high plasma densities. This method is based on previous theoretical predictions of reduced parasitic effect under higher temperature of plasma edge (ENEA Laboratory work published on Physical Review Letters in 2004). These works demonstrated that the parasitic damping of the coupled RF power is produced by non-linear wave-plasma interaction, named parametric instability (PI), which is capable of strongly altering (namely, broadening) the n// spectrum launched by the antenna. Consequently, the temperature required for Landau-resonance of the RF power spectrum with plasma electrons is strongly diminished, which causes absorption in the cold region of plasma periphery. This Thesis is focused on helping solution of an important conceptual problem, which is part of this challenge, by means of a noticeable application of strong radiofrequency power coupled to quasi- electrostatic plasma waves (LH waves). From the engineering point of view, results produced by an originally developed numerical code (LHPI) have backed solving the problem (existing for decades) of how to enable the antenna parameters determining the deposition of the coupled RF power (of several gigahertz) at a desired radial layer of the plasma column. This task would be ideally required indeed by an antenna. With respect to other current drive tool, based on electron cyclotron resonance (at about 150 GHz), this cannot guarantee the coverage of the outer half radius of plasma necessary for a reactor. Thanks to results reported here, new understanding is provided {{that for the first time}} enables a waveguide antenna for current drive in tokamaks to tailor the deposition in the plasma, in different operating conditions, by electronically acting on the launched spectrum (via feeding/phasing of waveguides). In particular, a) in case of too high plasma densities at the plasma edge, as occurs in running experiments, operation with higher temperature of plasma is recommended to avoid parasitic effects of spectral broadening. b) in case of too high plasma temperature at the plasma periphery, as envisaged in a future reactor, the assessment of a new antenna parameter, Δn//, allows however guaranteeing useful penetration of the coupled RF power into the plasma bulk. More specifically, the following issues have been considered in the Thesis. 1) Available data of RF power spectral broadening, kept during experiments carried out on the EAST tokamak (China), have been interpreted on the basis of the parametric instability modelling. This work has been performed thanks to a new version of a numerical code (developed on the basis of a previously version available since 1989 at ENEA-Frascati) having much improved qualities of velocity and precision. 2) The work has also focused on the key problem of how to enable the occurrence of the LHCD effect also in conditions of high electron temperature of reactor plasmas. Indeed, precisely the high temperature that in a reactor is expected to occur even at large radii of the plasma column which usefully prevents the occurrence of the parasitic effects observed in the experiments – would also produce an undesired RF power deposition too far out in the plasma, owing too strong electron Landau damping, as shown by numerical results. This circumstance is in contrast with the primary goal of a reactor of being equipped by current profile control, so that the too high plasma temperature of reactor represents the remaining major conceptual problem preventing the exploitation of the LHCD tool. This problem has been solved by the new outcome described in the Thesis. This result consists in having identified in a sufficiently narrow n// antenna power spectrum the way for reducing the wave-plasma interaction at high temperatures, thus enabling the penetration of the coupled RF power in the hot and dense regions of reactor plasmas. This diminished wave-plasma interaction is consequence of the content of standard quasi-linear theory of plasma waves: this aspect remained singularly undisclosed so far. 3) Finally, the thesis has analysed the problem of how to design an antenna capable of producing the required power spectra necessary for envisaging a current profile control system in a thermonuclear reactor. For carrying out this work, a numerical code has been utilised capable of treating waveguide antenna geometries however complex. Consequently, the desired sufficiently narrow n// power spectrum can be produced, indeed, by suitable array of active and passive phased array of rectangular waveguides. Moreover, the scan of the main antenna parameters (power reflection coefficient, directivity, etc,) performed assuming realistic conditions of plasma edge, has shown that all requirements should be satisfied for envisaging a current profile control system for a tokamak reactor based on the exploitation of the LHCD effect. The lower hybrid current drive tool in now fully supported by know how necessary for enabling the current profile control in the warm and dense plasma of thermonuclear reactor. The current drive method assessed here is of paramount importance for conceiving antennas to be implemented in the system of current profile control, which a reactor mandatorily requires...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores catalyst {{technology for}} the production of renewable liquid fuels via thermo-chemical conversion of biomass derived syngas. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a process for converting syngas, i. e. a mixture of CO and H 2, into energy rich long chain hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. This synthesis process involves a number of elementary reactions leading to an array of polymeric products. The economic operation of an FTS process lie in the interplay of both catalyst and reactor design. In relation to catalysis, the nature of chemisorbed species, and the fractional availability of active metal sites determines rate, conversion and yield. Similarly, reactor design decides the operational envelope and determines the economics of an FTS process. Eggshell cobalt catalysts are used in CO hydrogenation reactions due to their ability to maximize the use of precious cobalt metal. The thickness of the shell can be utilized to control the product yield and distribution. In this study, during catalyst synthesis stage, metal-support interaction has been exploited to control the thickness and hence, the product distribution. The catalysts are prepared using precipitation of cobalt nitrate (dissolved in ethanol) on silica support. The metal deposition rate and the location are controlled through optimized non-polar solvent imbibing, followed by water addition to a Co(NO 3) 2 -ethanol solution and hydrolysis by urea. The eggshell coating thickness (in the absence of restricting solvent) onto silica gel substrate was modeled via theoretical equations and experimentally verified during catalyst preparation through microscopic analysis of catalyst samples. Bulk precursor solution properties such as viscosity and surface tension along with substrate properties such as tortuosity are analyzed and included in the theoretical analysis for tailoring the catalyst eggshell thickness. Polar and non-polar solvent interactions with silica gel are exploited during cobalt precipitation to control the eggshell thickness. The catalyst samples were characterized using hydrogen chemisorption studies. The catalyst was tested in a fixed bed tubular bench scale <b>reactor</b> using research <b>grade</b> synthetic feed gases (H 2 :CO being 2 : 1). Products were analyzed in a GC column fitted with flame ionized detector and the results were compared with Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Liquid product analysis validated the approach used for eggshell catalyst design and synthesis. The impact of solvent and calcination conditions, on the performance of eggshell catalysts was examined. Solvents such as water and alcohol attach to the silanol groups on the silica gel surface and compete with metal salts during ion exchange and adsorption. The solution properties impact metal dispersion and interaction with metal support. The calcination conditions (static versus dynamic, oxidizing versus reducing atmosphere) also have an impact on metal dispersion and support interaction. Ethanol proved to be a better solvent for enhancing the dispersion due to its surface wetting properties. Direct reduction in dynamic hydrogen provided gradual decomposition of the cobalt precursor thus reducing agglomeration. Both the use of water as a solvent and a static air environment during calcination led to lower dispersion. The back reaction of calcination products (especially H 2 O) and agglomeration due to thermal expansion were competing phenomenon in a static oxidizing environment. Catalyst characterization revealed that the latter effect was pre-dominant. Catalyst performance testing was first done with pure gases (H 2 2 ̆ 6 CO) in a fixed bed reactor. Additionally, to examine the technological feasibility and economic viability of producing liquid fuels from biomass via the thermo-chemical route, laboratory scale testing was done using syngas produced by gasification of pine chips. The pine chips were gasified in a tubular entrained flow gasifier operated at MSU and supplied in cylinders. The raw biomass syngas was treated using a series of adsorbents to remove tar, water and other impurities. This pre-treated gas was subjected to Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) in a bench scale fixed bed reactor using the eggshell cobalt catalyst developed in our laboratory. Hydrogen was added to attain the 2 : 1 stoichiometric ratio required for the FTS reaction. The product gases were analyzed using an FTIR gas cell while liquid product was analyzed using a GC/MS HP- 5 column. The eggshell catalyst produced fuel preferentially in the range of middle distillates. The activity of FTS catalyst under biomass derived syngas was lower when compared to that under pure surrogates (H 2 /CO) due to the presence of inert components (such as methane) in the biomass derived syngas To complement the experimental study, a comprehensive model of FTS catalytic process was developed. This included both catalyst and a fixed bed reactor model. While modeling a catalyst pellet, intra-particle diffusion limitation was taken into account. For a spherical 2 mm pellet, eggshell morphology provided highest activity and selectivity. The reactor model was developed by coupling intra-pellet model with inter-pellet model via reaction term. The entire process operation starting with gas injection was considered. Presence of radial temperature profile, due to wall cooling, was confirmed by Mears criterion. Thus for a fixed time duration, a 2 -dimensional reactor model, with respect to temperature and concentration, was developed. The safe operational envelopes for a fixed bed reactor, using cobalt catalyst, was narrow 473 3 ̆c T 3 ̆c 493. The extent of catalyst pore fill changed (i) the radial thermal conductivity (ii) the overall temperature and concentration profile across the bed and (iii) the limits of safe operation without reaction runaway. Finally, hydrocarbon product selectivity also varied during startup. While the catalyst pores were being filled, effluent product mainly composed of lighter, more volatile components. Once the pores are filled, heavier products started to trickle down the bed. The economics of a large scale production of liquid fuels using this technology was explored using a CHEMCAD model of a large scale process for producing liquid fuel from biomass, a sensitivity study was conducted to determine key process parameters Two different gasification technologies were compared, one that uses only biomass (BTL process) and a second process that supplements the biomass feed with natural gas for meeting energy and hydrogen needs (BGTL process). The basis for the design was 2000 metric tons of dry biomass feed per hour. The breakeven price for synthetic crude oil was estimated at 106 /bbl. for the BTL plant, and 88 /bbl. for a natural gas assisted BGTL plant using current market prices for raw materials utilities and capital equipment. With the increasing availability, and falling prices of natural gas, the reforming of natural gas will provide a bridge solution in the short term for economical natural gas assisted BTL conversion, thus making it competitive in marketplace...|$|R
50|$|Nuclear Chemistry Division (NCD) - The Nuclear Chemistry Division {{was founded}} in 1966 by Dr. Iqbal Hussain Qureshi. As of today, the {{division}} is the largest Divisions of the PINSTECH comprising five major groups. Nuclear Chemistry Division has gained experience in the characterization of <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> and high purity materials by using advanced analytical techniques and it is dealing with environmental and health related problems.|$|E
50|$|IFRs and Light water {{reactors}} (LWRs) both produce <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> plutonium, {{and even}} at high burnups remains weapons usable, but the IFR fuel cycle has some design features that would make proliferation more difficult than the current PUREX recycling of spent LWR fuel. For one thing, it may operate at higher burnups and therefore increase the relative abundance of the non-fissile, but fertile, isotopes Plutonium-238, Plutonium-240 and Plutonium-242.|$|E
50|$|Plutonium and uranium can be {{chemically}} {{separated from}} spent fuel. When used nuclear fuel is reprocessed using {{the de facto}} standard PUREX method, both plutonium and uranium are recovered separately. The spent fuel contains about 1% plutonium. Reactor-grade plutonium contains Pu-240 which has {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, making it an undesirable contaminant in producing safe nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, nuclear weapons can be made with <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> plutonium.|$|E
5000|$|... 1993 - The Megatons to Megawatts Program is {{agreed upon}} by Russia and the United States {{and begins to}} be {{implemented}} in 1995. When it is completed in 2013, 500 tonnes of uranium derived from 20,000 nuclear warheads from Russia will have been converted from weapons grade to <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> uranium and used in United States nuclear plants to generate electricity. This has provided 10% of the electrical power of the U.S. (50% of its nuclear power) during the 1995-2013 period.|$|E
5000|$|No information, {{available}} in the public domain, suggests that any well funded entity has ever achieved, or seriously pursued creating, a nuclear weapon with the same isotopic composition of modern, high burn up, <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> plutonium. All nuclear weapon states have taken the more conventional path to nuclear weapons by either uranium enrichment or producing low burn up, [...] "fuel-grade" [...] and weapons-grade plutonium, in reactors capable of operating as production reactors. While the isotopic content of reactor-grade plutonium, created by the most common commercial power reactor design, the pressurized water reactor, never directly being considered for weapons use.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, these very high-energy {{neutrons}} {{are less likely}} to simply be captured without causing fission or spallation. For these reasons, nuclear weapon design extensively utilizes D-T fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons to cause more fission. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as depleted uranium (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of thermonuclear weapons. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> plutonium. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain nuclear proliferation discussions and treaties.|$|E
50|$|As a representative, Burr co-sponsored, with Senator Kit Bond (R-MO) an {{amendment}} to the Energy Policy Act of 2003 relaxing restrictions on the exports of specific types of enriched uranium, first enacted in the Schumer Amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The original Schumer amendment placed increased controls on U.S. civilian exports of weapons grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) to encourage foreign users to switch to <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> low-enriched uranium (LEU) for isotope production. HEU is attractive to terrorists because {{it can be used to}} create a simple nuclear weapon, while LEU cannot be used directly to make nuclear weapons. The amendment allowed exports to five countries for creating medical isotopes.|$|E
5000|$|If the North Korean {{device was}} {{significantly}} short of its predicted yield, {{it could be}} classified as a [...] "fizzle" [...] indicating that some aspect of the nuclear weapon design or material production did not function correctly. In a fizzle the warhead blows itself apart too fast for the nuclear reactions to generate a large amount of energy, or fails to form a supercritical mass for some other reason. A fizzle can result from predetonation, insufficient precision in the explosive lenses used to compress the plutonium core, or impurities in the plutonium itself, among other factors. A fizzle can also result from the use of <b>reactor</b> <b>grade</b> plutonium rather than weapons-grade material.|$|E
