It was found that audit reports are {{an important source of}} information for the users of such statements. The need to increase the information content of audit reports and the criteria as such informative have been established. This publication considers the requirements which are brought to the Auditor's report. Attention is directed both to those charged with governance in the company and all stakeholders. An audit report should describe the responsibilities of the auditor, i. e. to identify and assess risks of material misstatements in the financial statement; to design and implement audit procedures in response to those risks and to obtain sufficient and <b>relevant</b> <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> on which the audit opinion will be based.

The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the effects of conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and source reliability on audit judgement during sequential processing. Eightyeight auditors from the Big 5 CPA firms in Fiji participated in the study. The results suggests that auditors only display significant differences in judgments when presentation order is reversed for conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> from a source with high reliability. Application of a weighted average model supports the notion that the reliability of source affects the weighting of conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> Additional analysis shows that presentation order inhibits auditors from rationally weighing conflicting <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> with varying source reliability. The arithmetic weights computed using a linear model are likely to be useful in setting benchmarks for the validation of cue weights in expert systems and for policy decisions on formulation of audit practice statements...|$|R

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>evidence</b> {{enables the}} auditor to express {{an opinion on}} the {{financial}} statements. To address {{the risk that the}} auditor may express an inappropriate opinion, the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures must be responsive to the assessed risks of material misstatement. The auditor must aggregate the levels of assurance obtained from different combinations of tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to respond to the assessed risks. These evidence planning decisions are complex and require professional judgement. Research has found that the extent of audit procedures is not linked to the assessed risks and that auditors may not know to aggregate evidence from different types of audit procedures. Research also supports the use of a structured audit methodology that includes decision models, to guide the application of professional judgement. This leads to the overall objective of this study: the development of an integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model to quantify the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> The study employs a grounded theory model building approach, interpreting the relevant concepts and principles from the literature review into the development of the model. The integrated <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> planning model quantitatively relates the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> in a logical and structured manner with the risk assessment and three distinct overall levels of assurance needed to support the audit opinion. It uses the cumulative nature of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> and the compensatory inter-relationship between tests of controls, substantive analytical procedures and tests of details to quantitatively aggregate the extent and levels of assurance from the different combinations of procedures to obtain reasonable assurance at the required overall level of assurance. The model provides a framework for influencing and guiding the exercise of professional judgement and is a practical and effective tool to benefit the users thereof when conducting an audit. Thus, the study models the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> with reference to the aggregation of different types and combinations of evidence and the linkage between the risk assessment and the extent of evidence that provides a flexible framework for the application of professional judgement regarding the gathering of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> AuditingD.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the use of <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> in fraud detection. This is because the detection of fraud is not an easy task to be undertaken by auditors, and even most of the auditors were unable to detect fraud as well. To be used to detect fraud, <b>audit</b> <b>evidence</b> must be sufficient, competent, and relevant. Furthermore, to assess their validity, the evidence collected should be tested first. An auditor also needs to have professional skepticism when gathering and evaluating <b>audit</b> <b>evidence.</b> Without applying professional skepticism, auditors will only find misstatements caused by error only and hard to find fraud. For the detection of fraud within the organization, fraud categorized into three groups, namely fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, and corruption. Each type of fraud has its own characteristics, so as to be able to detect the fraud it is necessary to understand well the types of fraud that may arise within the company...|$|R
