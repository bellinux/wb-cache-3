40|$|International audienceDuring the Iron Age, <b>red</b> <b>corals</b> (Corallium rubrum) {{were the}} most {{frequent}} imported object type from the Mediterranean area intothe Celtic world. The density and the distinct patterns of their distribution are perfectly suited {{for the study of}} intra-European cultural contacts and trade relations due to their long-term importation. Despite the 130 -year-old history of research on prehistoric corals, there have been hardly any extensive study. One reason for this limited interest is that corals lose their intense red colour and shiny surface structure due to poorly understood ageing processes. Hence, other light-coloured materials such as bone, ivory, chalk or shells, which were also used to decorate jewellery, are often mistaken for corals. We propose a multi-stage approach to identify <b>red</b> <b>corals</b> and light bio-minerals with emphasis on digital microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.

60|$|Having {{understood}} {{thus far}} the general {{nature of these}} polypes, which are the fabricators both of the red and white coral, let us consider a little more particularly how the skeletons of the <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> and of the white coral are formed. The <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> polype perches upon the sea bottom, it then grows up {{into a sort of}} stem, and out of that stem there grow branches, each of which has its own polypes; and thus you have a kind of tree formed, every branch of the tree terminated by its polype. It is a tree, {{but at the end of}} the branches there are open mouths of polypes instead of flowers. Thus there is a common soft body connecting the whole, and as it grows up the soft body deposits in its interior a quantity of carbonate of lime, which acquires a beautiful red or flesh colour, and forms a kind of stem running through the whole, and it is that stem which is the <b>red</b> <b>coral.</b> The <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> grows principally at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, at very great depths, and the coral fishers, who are very adventurous seamen, take their drag nets, of a peculiar kind, roughly made, but efficient for their purpose, and drag them along the bottom of the sea to catch the branches of the <b>red</b> <b>coral,</b> which become entangled and are thus brought up to the surface. They are then allowed to putrefy, in order to get rid of the animal matter, and the <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> is the skeleton that is left.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>red</b> <b>coral,</b> the hard {{skeleton}} belongs to the interior of the stem and branches only; but in the commoner white corals, each polype has a complete skeleton of its own. These polypes are sometimes solitary, in which case the whole skeleton is represented by a single cup, with partitions radiating from its centre to its circumference. When the polypes formed by budding or division remain associated, the polypidom is sometimes made up of nothing but an aggregation of these cups, while at other times the cups are at once separated and held together, by an intermediate substance, which represents the branches of the <b>red</b> <b>coral.</b> The <b>red</b> <b>coral</b> polype again is a comparatively rare animal, inhabiting a limited area, the skeleton of which has but a very insignificant mass; while the white corals are very common, occur in almost all seas, and form skeletons which are sometimes extremely massive.|$|E
