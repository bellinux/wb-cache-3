5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by <b>retrotransposon</b> presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E
50|$|Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) and {{endogenous}} short interfering RNA (esiRNA) {{are small}} RNA fragments that partner with cleaving proteins {{to act as}} guides to a <b>retrotransposon.</b> piRNA and PIWI protein complexes are a common defense mechanism against retrotransposons in the germline—sperm or egg cells--, cells that are extremely vulnerable to <b>retrotransposon</b> induced mutations. Once <b>retrotransposon</b> RNA has been encountered, the piRNA/ PIWI protein complex cleaves the RNA, rendering it unable to reverse transcribe. EsiRNA and it’s protein complex may also function to promote heterochromatin creation near <b>retrotransposon</b> sites, silencing the DNA by {{making it difficult for}} DNA polymerases to access it. Although it is unclear how piRNAs and esiRNAs are produced, it is thought that <b>retrotransposon</b> cleaving by PIWI may produce new piRNA, in the so called ping pong theory. Production of piRNA in both the male and female germline is known to be regulated by the nuage, a protein-RNA hybrid also sometimes called the intermitochondrial cement, the absence of which causes infertility in males but not females. This may imply that <b>retrotransposon</b> induced mutations may be more prevalent or more devastating in the male germline. A microRNA—another type of small RNA—from strawberries has been shown to post transcriptionally silence <b>retrotransposon</b> function by blocking the binding site for proteins involved in reverse transcription.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Retrotransposons</b> are {{commonly}} occurring eukaryotic transposable elements (TEs). Among these, {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) <b>retrotransposons</b> are the most abundant TEs and can comprise 50 – 90 % of the genome in higher plants. By comparing the orthologous chromosomal regions of closely related species, the effects of TEs {{on the evolution of}} plant genomes can be studied in detail. Results Here, we compared the composition and organization of TEs within five orthologous chromosomal regions among three grass species: maize, sorghum, and rice. We identified a total of 132 full or fragmented LTR <b>retrotransposons</b> in these regions. As a percentage of the total cumulative sequence in each species, LTR <b>retrotransposons</b> occupy 45. 1 % of the maize, 21. 1 % of the rice, and 3. 7 % of the sorghum regions. The most common elements in the maize retrotransposon-rich regions are the copia-like <b>retrotransposons</b> with 39 % and the gypsy-like <b>retrotransposons</b> with 37 %. Using the contiguous sequence of the orthologous regions, we detected 108 <b>retrotransposons</b> with intact target duplication sites and both LTR termini. Here, we show that 74 % of these elements inserted into their host genome less than 1 million years ago and that many retroelements expanded in size by the insertion of other sequences. These inserts were predominantly other retroelements, however, several of them were also fragmented genes. Unforeseen was the finding of intact genes embedded within LTR <b>retrotransposons.</b> Conclusion Although the abundance of retroelements between maize and rice is consistent with their different genome sizes of 2, 364 and 389 Mb respectively, the content of <b>retrotransposons</b> in sorghum (790 Mb) is surprisingly low. In all three species, retrotransposition is a very recent activity relative to their speciation. While it was known that genes re-insert into non-orthologous positions of plant genomes, they appear to re-insert also within <b>retrotransposons,</b> potentially providing an important role for <b>retrotransposons</b> in the evolution of gene function. </p...|$|R

However, the composition and structure of its genome are largely unknown, which have hindered its utilization in sugarcane breeding and evolutionary research. <b>Retrotransposons</b> constitute an appreciable fraction of plant genomes and {{may have played a}} significant role in the evolution and sequence organization of genomes. In the current study, we investigate the phylogenetic diversity and genomic abundance of Ty 1 -copia <b>retrotransposons</b> for the first time and inspect their chromosomal distribution patterns in E. arundinaceus. In total, 70 Ty 1 -copia reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences with significant levels of heterogeneity were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis revealed these Ty 1 -copia <b>retrotransposons</b> were classified into four distinct evolutionary lineages (Tork/TAR, Tork/Angela, Retrofit/Ale, and Sire/Maximus).
