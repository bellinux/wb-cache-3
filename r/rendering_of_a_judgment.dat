He wrote, [...] "I think God has a Quarrel with you for your Abuse of and Cruelty to the poor Negroes." [...] Furthermore, Whitefield wrote: [...] "Your dogs are caressed and fondled at your tables; but your slaves who are frequently styled dogs or beasts, have not an equal privilege." [...] However, Whitefield [...] "stopped short <b>of</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>a</b> moral <b>judgment</b> on slavery itself as an institution." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{indispensable}} party (also {{called a}} required party, necessary party, or necessary and indispensable party) {{is a party}} in a lawsuit whose participation is required for jurisdiction or the purpose <b>of</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> In reality, <b>a</b> party may be [...] "necessary" [...] but not indispensable. For example, if s/he claims {{an interest in the}} litigation, that interest may be impeded if s/he is not joined. That doesn't transform him or her into an indispensable party unless her absence threatens some other party's interest. Often, an indispensable party is any party whose rights are directly affected by disposition of the case. Many jurisdictions have rules which provide for an indispensable party to be joined (brought into the case as a party) at the discretion of the judge. In some cases, the inability to join such a party means that the case must be dismissed. This is outlined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 19.|$|R
40|$|Gödel {{showed that}} formal systems which discuss natural numbers cannot be {{complete}} or prove their own consistency. Incompleteness {{in this sense}} is limited to formal systems, and so is not applicable to law by it own terms. Looking to the philosophy behind the Incompleteness Theorem, Gödel intended to show that positivism was a bankrupt world-view, and this resonates strongly with Lon Fuller. Fuller is analogous to Gödel in his condemnation of the positivist philosophy because he showed that <b>a</b> system <b>of</b> rules, by itself, was not capable <b>of</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>judgments.</b> <b>A</b> legal system is dependent upon an external morality, but a close inspection reveals that Fuller’s own natural law view was positivistic in its denial of substantive natural law. A legal system consistent with Gödel’s philosophy would seek justice in an objective and non-arbitrary sense, and would rely on a natural law system akin to that described by Aquinas...|$|R

SmethersThis study {{describes}} {{and maps}} the process journalists employ when deciding issues of coverage, content, {{and treatment of}} news at community newspapers {{within the context of}} community standards. Much scholarship has been devoted to how journalists should make ethical decisions of news judgment in accordance with moral, ethical, and social responsibility theory. But little has been done in the way of describing and mapping how journalists – specifically, community journalists – actually make these on-deadline news decisions and how the concept of community standards plays into those decisions. Through the use of naturalistic inquiry methodology, in this case, <b>a</b> triangulation <b>of</b> qualitative depth interview methods – informant and ethnographic – within the context of society, this research describes the factors considered by community journalists when faced with decisions of news judgment, how that process takes place, and how and where community standards fit into that process. Data indicate that values and value-based moral and ethical reasoning are tempered by at least three considerations in the decision-making process: (1) how coverage and treatment will affect the journalist, (2) how coverage and treatment will affect others, and (3) the public instructional value, before being filtered through <b>a</b> screen <b>of</b> community standards prior to the final <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> news <b>judgment</b> decision. Furthermore, findings offer a base on which to construct <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> community journalism decision making, useful for study and discussions of ethical decision making among community journalism scholars, instructors, and students, and for its applications in practical situations by future or novice community journalists...|$|R
40|$|As Simon P. Keefe's book begins, the German pedagogue Heinrich Christoph Koch is {{defending}} the concerto from his usual authority on aesthetic values, the Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Künste (1771 - 74) of Johann Georg Sulzer. The Theorie complained that "the concerto {{appears to have}} more the purpose <b>of</b> giving <b>a</b> skillful player {{the opportunity to be}} heard [...] . than to be used for the <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> passions," <b>a</b> stern <b>judgment</b> given Sulzer's conviction that expressing emotion was tantamount to a moral responsibility in the arts (quoted in Koch 1983 : 209). Koch countered by imagining soloist and accompaniment as partners in a "passionate dialogue," in which the soloist "expresses his feelings to the orchestra, and it signals him through short interspersed phrases sometimes approval, sometimes acceptance of his expression [...] . by a concerto I imagine something similar to the tragedy of the ancients, where the actor expressed his feelings not towards the pit, but to the chorus" (quoted in Keefe, 17 - 18). While not always agreeing that what soloist and orchestra share are feelings, many subsequent writers would echo Koch's description of the concerto as conversation or drama. No works have been more affected than his ideal, the concertos of Mozart...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the problems of}} procedural premises in proceedings for rendering <b>a</b> cumulative <b>judgment.</b> There are some modifications of premises in those proceedings in comparison with ordinary proceedings. Namely, beside some modified general premises there are also special premises, characteristic only for proceedings for rendering <b>a</b> cumulative <b>judgment.</b> The said proceedings are conditioned upon theree general positive procedural premises: a) being subject to Polish criminal courts, b) jurisdiction, c) the existence of litigant parties. To general negative premises belong: 1) immunities (Art. 11 sec. 3 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 2) the lapse of the prercribed statute of limitation (Art. 11 sec. 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 3) material validity (Art. 11 sec. 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 4) pendency of the litigation (Art. 11 sec. 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code), 5) amnesty as a negative premise not mentioned in Art. 11 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Special premises are specific factors, the existence <b>of</b> which is <b>a</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>a</b> cumulative <b>judgment.</b> From {{that point of view}} one can distinguish: 1) special material premises, 2) a special procedural premise. Special material premises are regulated in the Criminal Code (Art. 66, 68, 69, 71 § 2). Those provisions allow to distinguish the following premises: 1) real concurrence of offences, 2) concurrence <b>of</b> penalties. <b>A</b> special procedural premise is formal validity of separate judgments sentencing for concurring offences (Art. 503 § 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code). The admissibility <b>of</b> proceedings for <b>rendering</b> <b>a</b> cumulative <b>judgment</b> depends on <b>a</b> simultaneous appearance <b>of</b> general and special premisesDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
