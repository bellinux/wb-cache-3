During this project, which was funded by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Joint Research Centre (JRC) performed several investigations to evaluate the comparative performance of selected software tools for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity prediction, and to develop a number of case studies to illustrate the opportunities and difficulties arising in the computational assessment of pesticides. This exercise also included an investigation of the chemical space of several pesticides datasets. The results indicate that different software tools have different advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific requirements of the user / risk assessor. It is concluded that further work is needed to develop acceptance criteria for specific regulatory applications (e. g. evaluation of pesticide metabolites) and to develop batteries of models fulfilling such criteria.

40|$|This {{scientific}} output, {{published on}} 02 / 08 / 2012, replaces the earlier version published on 26 / 07 / 2012. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) {{to develop an}} opinion on approaches to evaluate the toxicological <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> and degradates of pesticide active substances in dietary risk assessment. This opinion identifies the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept as an appropriate screening tool. The TTC values for genotoxic and toxic compounds {{were found to be}} sufficiently conservative for chronic exposure, {{as a result of a}} validation study with a group of pesticides belonging to different chemical classes. Three critical steps were identified in the application of a TTC scheme: 1) the estimate of the level of the metabolite, 2) the evaluation of genotoxicity alerts and 3) the detection of neurotoxic metabolites. Tentative TTC values for acute exposure were established by the PPR Panel by analysis of the lowest 5 th percentiles of No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) used to establish the Acute Reference Doses (ARfD) for the EFSA pesticide data set. Assessment schemes for chronic and acute dietary risk assessment of pesticide metabolites, using the TTC approach and combined (Q) SAR and read across, are proposed. The opinion also proposes how the risk assessment of pesticid...|$|E
30|$|Transformation {{products}} {{can be as}} or even more persistent than their parent compounds and thus must be included in chemical assessment. However, the regulatory frameworks for substances differ {{with respect to the}} inclusion of metabolites or transformation products in PBT identification. For PPPs, the consideration of metabolites in the context of PBT identification has been controversially discussed, as PPPs Regulation 1107 / 2009 [2] does not address this issue precisely and only refers to the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> in a general sense (Art. 3 (32) Annex II point 3.3). However, a current proposal envisages excluding metabolites in the process of PBT identification and in the identification of candidates for substitution (i.e. substances that meet two of the three criteria) [11]. REACH requires that registration documents for chemicals produced or imported in excess of 100  t/a include information about metabolites and transformation products [54]. They are to be considered in PBT identification if they exceed 0.1 % of the substance weight [9, 26]. For both human and veterinary medicinal products, transformation products > 10 % are considered to be ‘relevant’ and thus included in risk assessment as well as in PBT assessment. In the assessment of biocides, major metabolites (≥ 10 % or ≥ 5 % at two consecutive sampling points or maximum not reached but ≥ 5 % of the active substance at the final time point) are considered in PBT identification and minor metabolites only if data are available or there is any reason for concern. It is questionable whether relevance can be defined in terms of any percentage. Since humans and the environment should be protected from exposure to PBT and vPvB substances, the same criteria should apply to metabolites or transformation products as to the parent compounds. We suggest that in all regulatory frameworks, metabolites and transformation products {{should be included in the}} assessment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Blood samples {{collection}} {{is a common}} method in biological research using domestic animals. However, most blood sampling techniques are complicated and highly invasive and may therefore not be appropriate for wildlife animals in research concerning stress. Thus, a non-invasive method to measure steroid hormones is critically needed.

The physiological <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> fecal glucocorticoid <b>metabolites</b> was further validated by demonstrating: (1) The translocation of a male to a females enclosure resulted in a 3. 5 -fold increase compared to baseline concentrations, (2) changes in adrenocortical activity, as reflected in concentrations <b>of</b> fecal cortisol <b>metabolites</b> during reproduction, gestation and lactation in females foxes, indicating that social interactions resulted in large increases <b>of</b> fecal glucocorticoids <b>metabolites</b> during the reproductive season.

40|$|With {{the use of}} {{molecular}} techniques, numerous studies have evaluated {{the composition of the}} intestinal microbiota in health and disease. However, it is of major interest to supplement this with a functional analysis of the microbiota. In this review, the different approaches that have been used to characterize microbial metabolites, yielding information on the functional end products of microbial metabolism, have been summarized. To analyze colonic microbial metabolites, the most conventional way is by application of a hypothesis-driven targeted approach, through quantification <b>of</b> selected <b>metabolites</b> from carbohydrate (e. g., short-chain fatty acids) and protein fermentation (e. g., p-cresol, phenol, ammonia, or H(2) S), secondary bile acids, or colonic enzymes. The application of stable isotope-labeled substrates can provide an elegant solution to study these metabolic pathways in vivo. On the other hand, a top-down approach can be followed by applying metabolite fingerprinting techniques based on (1) H-NMR or mass spectrometric analysis. Quantification <b>of</b> known <b>metabolites</b> and characterization <b>of</b> <b>metabolite</b> patterns in urine, breath, plasma, and fecal samples can reveal new pathways and give insight into physiological regulatory processes of the colonic microbiota.

40|$|Understanding the {{architecture}} of the metabolism from annotated genome sequences of organisms is a major task for postgenomic biology. Recent studies of metabolic networks have focused on the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>metabolites</b> [1]. However, from a practical and biological point of view, it is important to investigate the enzymatic influence on the network since metabolites are not encoded in the genome, while enzymes are subjected to evolution and can be genetically engineered to change the metabolism. A critical issue is the determination of the important enzymes that can be used as targets for drugs. We propose a novel graph analysis of the metabolism that determines the most important (essential) enzymes of an organism and apply it to E. coli [2] as a model organism. Essential enzymes belong to the set of proteins necessary to an organism to be viable. Not all proteins in an organism are necessary to its survival, those are non-essential. Experiments using systematic mutagenesis have identified a substantial number of essential enzymes of E. coli and this information is available at the (PEC database, [URL] maintained by the Genetic Resource Committee of Japan...|$|R

The measurements were done near workers nose and during the normal activities. All measurements were done continuously and had the duration of 5 minutes at least. It was consider the higher value obtained in each measurement. In addition, for knowing fungi contamination, five air samples of 50 litres were collected through impaction method at 140 L/minute, at one meter tall, on to malt extract agar with the antibiotic chloramphenicol (MEA). MVOCs results range between 4. 7 ppm and 8. 9 ppm in the 6 locations consider. These results are eight times higher than normally obtained in indoor settings. Considering fungi results, two species were identified in air, being the genera Penicillium found in all the samples in uncountable colonies and Rhizopus only in one sample (40 UFC/m 3). These fungi are known as MVOCs producers, namely terpenoids, ketones, alcohols and others. Until now, there has been no evidence that MVOCs are toxicologically relevant, but further epidemiological research is necessary to elucidate their role on human’s health, particularly in occupational settings where microbiological contamination is common.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} prohibitin {{complex is}} a context-dependent modulator of longevity. Specifically, prohibitin deficiency shortens the lifespan of otherwise wild type worms, while it dramatically extends lifespan under compromised metabolic conditions, {{as in the}} case of the diapause daf- 2 (e 1370) mutant. This extremely intriguingly phenotype has been linked to alterations in mitochondrial function and in fat metabolism. Nevertheless, the true function of the mitochondrial prohibitin complex remains elusive. With the ultimate goal of understanding how mitochondrial prohibitin complex affects longevity, we have employed several metabolomic approaches to characterize the changes elicited upon prohibitin depletion by RNAi on the metabolome of wild type and daf- 2 mutant worms. Metabolic analysis by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy reveals that prohibitin depletion leads to an alteration in the overall fatty acid composition of the worm, as well as in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. To enlarge the coverage of the metabolome, we employed a lipidomic mass spectrometry-based approach. We identify that prohibitin has a differential effect in the content of various species of triglycerides and phospholipids in wild type and in daf- 2 mutant animals. In particular, we find that prohibitin affects not only the amount but also the composition of fat storage lipids. Overall, prohibitin depletion has a more pronounced effect on the metabolic profiles of wild type worms than of daf- 2 mutants indicating that daf- 2 mutants are more robust to the changes elicited upon prohibitin depletion. We are currently exploring the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> identified <b>metabolites</b> in the context of the effect of prohibitin on the C. elegans longevity. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} play {{a significant}} role in mediating plant-microbe interactions. Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important staple crops. Once rice is attacked by microbial pathogens, it will produce phytoalexins antibiotics to defend against enemies such as the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. Diterpenoids provide a rich source <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> mediating rice-X. oryzae interaction. First, gibberellin (GA), as complex diterpenoid phytohormone, besides the profound effects on plant growth and development, it has been shown to negatively regulate rice defense. Interestingly, we found a putative GA biosynthetic gene operon in rice bacterial leaf streak pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc). Based on this, we biochemically characterized Xoc for its capacity to produce the precursor of GA. With genome mining, we found three other genera of rhizobia contained homologous GA biosynthetic gene operon and shared the identical biochemical function for production of ent-kaurene. As for Xoc, we detected the putative production of GA was relevant to virulence ability in Xoc through antagonism to jasmonic acid. The role of putative GA diterpenoid regulated Xoc 2 ̆ 7 s association with rice. Second, rice produces an arsenal of phytoalexins as responses to fungal and bacterial infection. Most of the known rice phytoalexins are diterpenoids.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> the human vertebral endplate poromechanics on the fluid and metabolic transport from {{and to the}} intervertebral disc (IVD) based on educated estimations of the poromechanical parameter values of the bony endplate (BEP). Methods 50 micro-models of different BEP samples were generated from μCTs of lumbar vertebrae and allowed direct determination of porosity values. Permeability values were calculated by using the micro-models, through the simulation of permeation via computational fluid dynamics. These educated ranges of porosity and permeability values were used as inputs for mechano-transport simulations to assess their effect on both the distributions <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> within an IVD model and the poromechanical calculations within the cartilaginous part of the endplate i. e., the cartilage endplate (CEP). ResultsBEP effective permeability was highly correlated to local variations of porosity (R 2  ≈  0. 88). Universal patterns between bone volume fraction and permeability arose from these results and from other experimental data in the literature. These variations in BEP permeability and porosity had negligible effects on the distributions <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> within the disc. In the CEP, the variability of the poromechanical properties of the BEP {{did not affect the}} predicted consolidation but induced higher fluid velocities. ConclusionsThe present paper provides the first sets of thoroughly identified BEP parameter values that can be further used in patient-specific poromechanical studies. Representing BEP structural changes through variations in poromechanical properties did not affect the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>metabolites.</b> However, attention might be paid to alterations in fluid velocities and cell mechano-sensing within the CEP...|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} anabolic androgenic steroids, such as testosterone, {{are widely}} misused {{in sports and}} can be harmful {{to the health of}} the athlete. Their popularity can be explained by the difficulty to unequivocally establish the difference between synthetic or endogenous origin of measured urinary androgens and metabolites constituting the steroid profile. As these compounds are always present in urine, only when an unnaturally high steroid value exceeds a certain threshold, misuse can be established. Although steroid profiling is the most versatile method to determine the misuse of endogenous steroids, the currently used steroid profile parameters suffer from large inter-individual variances resulting in limited efficiency of the detection methods using population-based threshold values. Moreover, a wide diversity of endogenous steroids on the market can cause various alterations of the steroid profile complicating its interpretation and the use of micro doses still remains unnoticed in doping control laboratories. Therefore, there is compelling need for novel detection methods and better biomarkers to detect the misuse of endogenous steroids in a more efficient way. The focus of this work was put on specific hydroxylated steroid metabolites usually occurring in low urinary concentrations as an alternative approach on current steroid profiling. An analytical method was developed that monitors a broad range <b>of</b> steroid <b>metabolites</b> and their corresponding reference ranges were calculated. Application of these reference criteria on the evaluation of excretion urines after administration of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone indicated the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> minor steroid <b>metabolites</b> for doping control. In combination with a Bayesian model, the potential of the alternative steroid profile was investigated for implementation in the Biological Passport. Interesting steroid ratios were proposed as biomarkers to support the probability of guilt. These markers showed good detection accuracy and were suitable for longitudinal following. Finally, a support vector machine model was developed that optimally discriminated between normal and altered steroid profiles. With this model, a boost in detection accuracy was demonstrated, longer detection times were obtained, steroid gel formulations could be detected and various influences on the steroid profile could be differentiated from the normal state...|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) {{was examined}} in ex-plant cultures of human bladder and bronchus. Three-day cultures {{were exposed to}} radiolabeted BP for 24 h, and the metabolism was determined by analysis {{of the level of}} binding <b>of</b> reactive <b>metabolites</b> to DNA, and by the release <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> into the medium. For a given individual, the DNA binding level and extent of metabolism was usually higher in the bladder than in the bronchus. In specimens ob-tained from 16 individuals, the average DNA-binding levels for B P- D N A adducts following a 24 h exposure to 1 /tM BP were 6. 4 ± 5. 0 /unol BP/mol deoxyribonudeotide for the bladder and 3. 1 ± 1. 9 /unol BP/mol deoxyribonudeotide for the bronchus. The major B P- D N A adduct in both tissues co-chromatographed with one of the adducts formed by reac-tion of r- 7,r- 8 -dihydroxy-r- 9, 10 -oxy- 7, 8, 9,l(Metrahydroben-zo[a]pyrene with deoxyguanosine using high-pressure liquid chromatography. In tissues obtained from the same in-dividual, the binding levels <b>of</b> BP <b>metabolites</b> to bladder cell DNA was not strongly correlated to that of bronchial ceil DNA (r= 0. 54). The medium of both tissues contained small amounts <b>of</b> free, unconjugated <b>metabolites</b> <b>of</b> BP (< 3 % of the total) and large amounts (30 - 85 % of the total) of unidentified, highly polar material. Human bladder appears to be the most active human explant tissue yet studied with respect to its ability to activate BP to DNA binding forms.

40|$|Background: Information {{regarding}} the variability <b>of</b> <b>metabolite</b> levels {{over time in}} an individual is required to estimate the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>metabolite</b> measurements. In intervention studies, {{it is critical to}} appropriately judge changes that are elicited by any kind of intervention. The pre-analytic phase (collection, transport and sample processing) is a particularly important component of data quality in multi-center studies. Methods: Reliability <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> (within-and between-person variance, intraclass correlation coefficient) and stability (shipment simulation at different temperatures, use of gel-barrier collection tubes, freeze-thaw cycles) were analyzed in fasting serum and plasma samples of 22 healthy human subjects using a targeted LC-MS approach. Results: Reliability <b>of</b> <b>metabolite</b> measurements was higher in serum compared to plasma samples and was good in most saturated short-and medium-chain acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and hexose.

Permeability values were calculated by using the micro-models, through the simulation of permeation via computational fluid dynamics. These educated ranges of porosity and permeability values were used as inputs for mechano-transport simulations to assess their effect on both the distributions <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> within an IVD model and the poromechanical calculations within the cartilaginous part of the endplate i. e., the cartilage endplate (CEP). 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eResults 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eBEP effective permeability was highly correlated to local variations of porosity (R 2 ≈ 0. 88). Universal patterns between bone volume fraction and permeability arose from these results and from other experimental data in the literature. These variations in BEP permeability and porosity had negligible effects on the distributions <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> within the disc. In the CEP, the variability of the poromechanical properties of the BEP {{did not affect the}} predicted consolidation but induced higher fluid velocities. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eConclusions 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eThe present paper provides the first sets of thoroughly identified BEP parameter values that can be further used in patient-specific poromechanical studies. Representing BEP structural changes through variations in poromechanical properties did not affect the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>metabolites.</b> However, attention might be paid to alterations in fluid velocities and cell mechano-sensing within the CEP. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Biochemically {{detailed}} stoichiometric matrices {{have now}} been reconstructed for various bacteria, yeast, and for the human cardiac mitochondrion based on genomic and proteomic data. These networks have been manually curated based on legacy data and elementally and charge balanced. Comparative analysis of these well curated networks is now possible. Pairs <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> often appear together in several network reactions, linking them topologically. This co-occurrence <b>of</b> pairs <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> in metabolic reactions is termed herein "metabolite coupling. " These metabolite pairs can be directly computed from the stoichiometric matrix, S. Metabolite coupling {{is derived from the}} matrix ŜŜ T, whose off-diagonal elements indicate the number of reactions in which any two metabolites participate together, where Ŝ is the binary form <b>of</b> S. Results <b>Metabolite</b> coupling in the studied networks was found to be dominated by a relatively small group of highly interacting pairs <b>of</b> <b>metabolites.</b> As would be expected, metabolites with high individual metabolite connectivity also tended to be those with the highest metabolite coupling, as the most connected metabolites couple more often. For metabolite pairs that are not highly coupled, we show that the number of reactions a pair <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> shares across a metabolic network closely approximates a line on a log-log scale. We also show that the preferential coupling <b>of</b> two <b>metabolites</b> with each other is spread across the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> and is not unique to the most connected metabolites. We provide a measure for determining which metabolite pairs couple more often than would be expected based on their individual connectivity in the network and show that these metabolites often derive their principal biological functions from existing in pairs. Thus, analysis <b>of</b> <b>metabolite</b> coupling provides information beyond that which is found from studying the individual connectivity <b>of</b> individual <b>metabolites.</b> Conclusion The coupling <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> is an important topological property of metabolic networks. By computing coupling quantitatively {{for the first time in}} genome-scale metabolic networks, we provide insight into the basic structure of these networks. </p...|$|R

The results showed that the <b>metabolites</b> <b>of</b> all the eight strains had significant antimicrobial effect based on zone of inhibition results when compared to control. There was a statistically significant difference in the zone of inhibition data for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli among the <b>metabolites</b> <b>of</b> the eight strains cultivated in the two different growth medium. Certain L. acidophilus strains were more effective against  Staphylococcus aureus, while other strains were more effective against  Escherichia coli. On the other hand, the growth medium had no significant influence on the antimicrobial effect <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> <b>of</b> seven strains except  L. acidophilus FTDC 4462 against Escherichia coli. As for  Staphylococcus aureus, the growth medium only affected the antimicrobial effect <b>of</b> <b>metabolite</b> <b>of</b> strain  L. acidophilus FTDC 1295, but did not affect the antimicrobial effect <b>of</b> <b>metabolites</b> <b>of</b> the other seven strains.
