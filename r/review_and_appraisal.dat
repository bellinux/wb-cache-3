40|$|Distributive {{justice is}} an aspect immensely debated {{in studies of}} philosophy, po-litical, {{behavioural}} and social sciences both in mainstream or Islam. Given its increasing relevance to the global village we share {{and the intensity of}} socio-eco-nomic problems invariably related to the distribution of resources amongst us, this work is aimed at adding value through a deeper understanding and appreciation of justice placed by the Syariah in all domains of of our economic lives. The existing works within this area appear to lean mostly towards redistributive mechanisms available in the revealed knowledge. Hence a comprehensive analysis of the no-tion of distributive justice from the theoretical level translated into practical terms is expected to contribute significantly to policymakers committed towards finding permanent solutions to economic problems especially in the Muslim world. It is a modest yet serious attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} distributive justice in letter and spirit as clearly ordained in the Holy Quran. The entire analysis is based on critical <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> <b>appraisals</b> of the all relevant literary on distributive justice in Islamic Economics. The final product is a conceptual framework that can be used as a blueprint in establishing the notion of justice in the distribution of economic resources, i. e. income and wealth as aspired by the Syariah...|$|R
40|$|This study {{illustrates}} {{a process of}} accessing and utilising clinical and economic evidence in health care decision making. The scenario examined {{was that of a}} UK Health Authority evaluating evidence prior to the introduction of assertive community treatment (ACT), as part of guidance from the UK National Service Framework for Mental Health. The consistency between clinical and cost evidence from a number of sources (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), HTA database, NHS Economic Evaluation database (NHS EED)) was also addressed, as was the usefulness of structured abstracts on NHS EED. The findings showed that within specified caveats ACT tends to be more effective and also less costly than alternative interventions; there is general agreement between sources principally reporting effectiveness and economic evaluations; and NHS EED abstracts are useful in the decision making process where information gaps exist. In terms of health care policy in the health authority examined, two ACT teams were subsequently introduced in the city of Leicester. Although systematic <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> <b>appraisals</b> of evidence are arguably the gold standard in health care decision making, the study illustrates how the use of databases of structured abstracts can assist in making optimal choices in real life decision making scenarios...|$|R
