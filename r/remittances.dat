This has attracted large foreign investments to Jordan and has enabled the country to export its workforce to Persian Gulf countries.

30|$|We {{address the}} {{endogeneity}} of <b>remittance</b> income and <b>remittance</b> income volatility, {{along with the}} potential CEV problems in measuring <b>remittance</b> income and <b>remittance</b> income volatility, using an instrumental variable approach. We instrument <b>remittance</b> income and <b>remittance</b> income volatility with the predicted values derived from models of <b>remittance</b> flows and <b>remittance</b> income volatility. Because only 6 percent of individuals reside in a remittance-receiving household, the distribution that applies to the modeling of <b>remittance</b> inflows and <b>remittance</b> income volatility is both discrete and continuous. An option in those instances is to use selection models (such as the Heckman-type model). However, the results from such models are sensitive to identification exclusions that are debatable given the difficulty of envisioning factors that affect the likelihood of <b>remittance</b> receipt or that of experiencing <b>remittance</b> income volatility, yet have {{no impact on the}} peso amount received by the household or on the degree of <b>remittance</b> income volatility endured.|$|R

Among all, study {{of the history}} of the overseas Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia are most important and popular. Because of their ideal geographical location, Singapore and Malaysia served as a window for the western countries to develop Southeast Asia and constructed a close economic relationship with South China. In the study of Overseas Chinese history, <b>remittance</b> is one on the topic that cannot be neglect. The literature nowadays is mainly concerning the <b>remittance</b> method, amount, organization and the effect of <b>remittance</b> on the homeland of the overseas Chinese. However, <b>remittance</b> network is seldom concerned. Actually, <b>remittance</b> network represents the financial network that connecting South China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia together. It’s because <b>remittance</b> not only mean remit money to homeland, but also mean a close trading and investment relationship. This financial network, in a large extent, is based on the <b>remittance</b> network of the local <b>remittance</b> houses, with the two main centers of Singapore and Hong Kong. This flow of the capital provided a closer economic relationship and encouraged the economic development between South China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. <b>Remittance</b> network is based on the <b>remittance</b> houses, however, seldom case study on <b>remittance</b> house is available. Thus, it’s difficult to analysis the structure, change and the flow of capital of the <b>remittance</b> network.

5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and <b>remittances</b> from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E

With the rise of political and economic instability in Indonesia in the late 1990s—including religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi—tourism in Tana Toraja has declined dramatically. Toraja continues to be a well known origin for Indonesian coffee, grown by both smallholders and plantation estates, although migration, <b>remittances</b> and off-farm income is considered far more important to most households, even those in rural areas.|$|E

30|$|To gain further {{insights}} into the impacts of <b>remittance</b> inflows on household spending patterns we now turn to examining remittance-receiving households exclusively. Table  5 reports expenditure shares on asset accumulation according to the uncertainty of <b>remittance</b> inflows. We separate households into two categories. The first category consists of remittance-receiving households enduring high uncertainty in their <b>remittance</b> inflows as reflected by {{a high level of}} variability in <b>remittance</b> income, which, in turn, is captured by the coefficient of variation of <b>remittance</b> income falling in the upper two quartiles of the distribution. The second category is composed of remittance-receiving households with less volatile <b>remittance</b> inflows as reflected by a coefficient of variation for <b>remittance</b> income that falls within the lower two quartiles of the distribution. The results indicate that higher uncertainty in the receipt of <b>remittance</b> inflows favors asset accumulation by approximately 2 additional percentage points. By asset category, more volatile <b>remittance</b> income results in a statistically higher share of asset accumulation in health and in real estate and a lower share with respect to spending on education. For durable assets and for business investments, {{there appears to be no}} differences in spending by uncertainty levels. Yet, these figures do not take into account other household characteristics possibly correlated with their spending and remittance-receiving patterns, such as the level or magnitude of their <b>remittance</b> receipts. We address this limitation in the next sections in order to more fully understand how uncertainty in <b>remittance</b> receipts affects asset accumulation.|$|R

One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E

5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in <b>remittances</b> flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E
