The object of this thesis is {{the analysis of the}} technical, economic and environmental potential of the use of <b>regenerated</b> lubricant <b>oils</b> in the national industry. It is intended to analyze and show the potential gains of the industrial and technological development in this sector, while identifying the opportunities in the national market for the production and exportation of <b>regenerated</b> lubricant <b>oils.</b> Therefore, based on an extensive bibliographic research and the collection of data, three scenarios where proposed. The first scenario is about the exclusive use of new lubricant oils, produced nationally using non-renewable resources. In the second scenario, the use of only <b>regenerated</b> lubricant <b>oils</b> is simulated and finally, the third scenario aims to test the phased deployment of <b>regenerated</b> lubricant <b>oil</b> in the national industry. The analysis and comparison of this scenarios took into account adequate indicators based on the industrial reality. After the discussion {{of the results of the}} analysis, it was proved that it is possible to combine sustainable innovation with wealth generation and environmental preservation. This is a major contribution to the creation of eco-efficient companies that maintain or even increase production using less resources, emitting less and with less waste, using alternative raw materials and clean technologies aimed for efficienc...|$|R

40|$|DOGR 1, which encodes for 2 -deoxyglucose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase, {{has been}} used as a {{selectable}} marker gene to produce transgenic plants. In this study, a transformation vector, pBIDOG, which contains the DOGR 1 gene, was transformed into oil palm embryogenic calli mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404. Transformed embryogenic calli were exposed to 400 mg lâ€“ 1 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -DOG) as the selection agent. 2 -DOG resistant tissues were regenerated into whole plantlets on various regeneration media containing the same concentration of 2 -DOG. The plantlets were later transferred into soil and grown in a biosafety screenhouse. PCR and subsequently Southern blot analyses were carried out to confirm the integration of the transgene in the plantlets. A transformation efficiency of about 1. 0 % was obtained using DOGR 1 gene into the genome of oil palm. This result demonstrates the potential of using combination of DOGR 1 gene and 2 -DOG for <b>regenerating</b> transgenic <b>oil</b> palm...|$|R

The {{results indicated that the}} performance of anti-extreme pressure of regeneration oil increase by 34. 1 % compared with the waste one and its load- carrying ability is close to the new oil; the feature of wear spot are better than those of the waste oil and frictional coefficient almost reach the level of the new oil's.

The purpose of this research is to extract cellulose from oil palm wood according to TAPPI test method. The extracted cellulose was treated with ionic liquid, BMIMCL at different weight percentange (2 wt % and 5 wt %). The chemical, structural, morphology and thermal properties of cellulose samples (untreated and treated cellulose) were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emisssion Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) respectively. In this study, the cellulose treated cellulose with BMIMCL is find out more amorphous properties compared to untreated cellulose. This proves that BMIMCL ionic liquid is effectively in convert the cellulose into amorphous cellulose. However, the BMIMCL is less efficient in conversion from cellulose to nanocellulose...|$|R
40|$|The major aim of {{the thesis}} was to develop the {{prerequisites}} for efficient genetic engineering of oil palm by DNA microinjection with the long-term objective to generate transgenic oil palm producing recombinant proteins, PIPP (a chimeric antibody against human chorionic gonadotropin; hCG), D 12 (a human antibody against dental carries) and HSA (human serum albumin). The products will be synthesized in the leaf, mesocarp and kernel tissues of oil palm with the respects of plants must be stable and free from selectable marker. To achieve this, the constructs of PIPP, D 12 and HSA genes, which were driven either by the promoter of LSP, MSP or KSP were successful constructed and their functionality was demonstrated in tobacco plants. To implement the oil palm protoplasts as starting material {{for the development of}} stable transgenic oil palms via DNA microinjection, the regeneration of true plants from protoplasts is a mandatory. Therefore, an improved protocol for the efficient isolation of high-quality protoplasts from oil palm suspension cultures was established. Subsequently, for the first time true oil palms were successfully <b>regenerated</b> from <b>oil</b> palm protoplasts by using optimal parameters. Nearly 14 - 17 months after protoplasts were isolated; true plants were generated using agarose bead culture. Following the success in regeneration of plants from protoplasts, the objective of this project became clearly to be achieved in the future when the protoplasts were used for PEG-mediated transient gene expression, and further used in the stable gene expression via DNA microinjection. The efficient and reliable protocol for PEG mediated transformation of oil palm protoplasts was developed by determing and validating the optimal parameters like heat shock treatment, the amount of DNA, PEG and magnesium chloride concentrations, and the procedure to transfect the protoplasts. As the main objective of this study, the transgenic microcalli of oil palm were successful generated from protoplasts transformed by DNA microinjection within 6 months. More conclusive results will be obtained when small plantlets are produced and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLifetime {{extension}} of power transformers {{is a subject}} of high importance for electric power systems utilities. The decision of replacing, refurbishing or repairing a service aged power transformer requires considering several factors, especially the cost and time to execute the work. The lifetime of the power transformer being related to {{the condition of the}} insulation system; one way of improving the situation is to reclaim insulating oil by Fuller??s Earth treatment. This procedure is economically attractive because of increasing prices for both mineral and synthetic transformer coolants, effective cost and environmentally sounds. Reclamation rejuvenates the transformer oil by eliminating contaminants. In this paper, a series of experiments has been performed with service aged oils reclaimed in laboratory conditions. Fast, inexpensive and reliable laboratory testing procedures developed by ASTM (D 6802 and D 6181) were also used to monitor decay products as traces impurities. The results obtained in laboratory conditions, indicate {{that a large number of}} reclamation passes (around 15 passes) are required to <b>regenerate</b> inservice aged <b>oil</b> to a grade close to new oil. It is also shown that not only the reclamation improves the gassing tendency of oil, but also the type of Fuller??s Earth is very important for reclamation process. By upgrading the analytical chemistry of oil, the predictive maintenance of this non-renewable resource is modernized, its cost diminished and the service reliability of transformers enhanced. Currently, Fuller??s Earth is only used once. After depletion it must be disposed of in a land fill. By using two organic solvents that are recoverable by atmospheric distillation, it is shown, in laboratory conditions, that this mineral absorbent can be reactivated and successfully reused many times...|$|R
