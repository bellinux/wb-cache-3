A random sample of 30 respondents was drawn from a population of local residents who are already occupying the constructed houses. The study aims at highlighting the implications of lack of integration of sustainable livelihoods approach in <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> projects. It argues that the packaging of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> projects should incorporate both sustainable livelihoods and community participation approaches. These approaches in housing development should not only focus on the top structure or the shelter, but on other factors, such as infrastructure, electrification, agriculture water and sanitation services.

40|$|Abstract: Energy {{efficient}} and cost saving cement alternatives {{have been identified}} for use by researchers without compromising standards. The utilization of artificial pozzolanas as Cementitious Materials (CMs) in cement chemistry and engineering is widely known. Nevertheless, there is continual search for optional and greener substitutes. The use of Rice Husk Ash (RHA) as CM was studied. The abundance of RHA {{and the need for}} low cost shelter triggered this investigation looking into chemical composition of the generated ash and the compressive strength of the concrete type produced by partly replacing Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with RHA under short hydration periods. 60 cubes of 300 mm dimensions were cast with cement substituted by RHA ranging from 0 - 40 %, adopting 28 day targeted strength of 25 MPa as control. Specimens hydrated at relative humidity (RH) of 95 - 100 % and temperature (T) of 22 - 25 0 C in a chamber for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Results revealed trends of strength gain and reduced density with increase in RHA. The 28 day density and strength of the control specimen was 2465 kg/m 3 and 28. 6 MPa while the 10 % RHA sample (i. e. best replaced matrix) had 2398 kg/m 3 and 26. 0 MPa respectively. The strength of 10 % RHA/OPC product (26. 0 MPa) was slightly higher than the adopted strength (25 N/mm 2) at 28 days. This can serve as cost saving means in <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> with less structural demands...|$|R

50|$|These {{views are}} {{supported}} by research in the area. For example, Hanstad, Brown, and Prosterman suggest based on research in Karnataka and West Bengal that providing amply-sized plots of land (these can be as small as 0.05-0.15 acres in size) gives substantial benefits to landless families at relatively low costs. These benefits include increased income, increased access to credit, and increased social status. They also note that based on the land costs in their Karnataka study, {{the cost of a}} program to distribute packages of land like this to the ten million poorest families in India would be approximately 3,330 million rupees spread over ten years. By contrast, the central government’s <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> <b>scheme</b> has cost 15,360 million rupees per year over the past five years, whilst producing housing viewed as being of very low quality by the participants in this study.

40|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>housing</b> land {{accounted}} for 67. 3 % of China's total construction land in 2000. While {{there are numerous}} studies analyzing the loss of arable land due to urban sprawl, less {{attention has been paid}} to the study of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land in China. This paper develops a theoretical framework for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China. It introduces a research method, which is using the spatial differentiation in regional development for compensating the deficiencies in time-series data, to analyze the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in the Transect of the Yangtse River (TYR). Detailed land-use data and socio-economic data from both research institutes and government departments were used to test the following hypothesis on <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition. We assume that <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in every region will undergo specific stages the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land will decline gradually with the development of the local economy, and the end of the transition corresponds to a new equilibrium between <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> and other construction activities. Five regional types of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change were defined according to an aggregation index used to reflect landscape patterns. The outcomes indicated that the share of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land declines gradually from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Yangtse River, i. e. from Ganzi-Yushu to Luzhou-Diqing, Enshi-Chongqing, Tongling-Yichang and to Shanghai-Chaohu. Each region is in a different phase of the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition, which corresponds to a particular socio-economic developmental level. Finally, some policy implications were discussed by applying this research to land management issues. The authors argue that there are problems in the current <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land managerial system in China, and that the Central Government needs to define uniform regulations for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> according to regional socio-economic developmental level, physical conditions and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition phase...|$|R

This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal coupling characteristics of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 2000 and 2008, and the data from the Ministry of Land and Resources of China.

The objectives of this study are to (i) analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of RHLT, and (ii) detect the underlying driving forces and mechanism of RHLT in Bohai Rim during 2000 - 2010. To achieve these goals, we collected and rasterized high resolution Landsat TM data, socio-economic and physical environmental data for the Bohai Rim. Spatial econometric regression models at both grid scale and county scale were developed to examine the driving forces of RHLT in Bohai Rim. The results indicated that the distribution of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land was characterized by vertical zonality, i. e., the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land decreased gradually with the increase of elevation, and was more sensitive to slope than to elevation. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the spatial mismatch of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change and rural population migration made the regional differences of RHLT more remarkable, based on which four <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land consolidation regional types were differentiated. The authors argue that towns are effective hubs for linking the urban system and rural system, and it is better to get the farmers to migrate to towns instead of big cities in the process of pushing forward China's new-type urbanization in the future. For this, it is necessary to further improve related system and institution.
