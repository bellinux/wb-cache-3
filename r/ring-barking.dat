Girdling can also be caused by herbivorous mammals feeding on plant bark and by birds and insects, both of which can effectively girdle a tree by boring rows of adjacent holes.|$|E

By 1869, many of the Turrbul had died from gunshot or disease, but the Moreton Bay Courier makes frequent mention of local indigenous people who were working and living in the district. In fact, between the 1840s and 1860s, the settlement relied increasingly on goods obtained by trade with aboriginals—firewood, fish, crab, shellfish—and services they provided such as water-carrying, tree-cutting, fencing, <b>ring-barking,</b> stock work and ferrying.

In total, 140 spruce trees in groups of five were ring-barked with the same number of control trees in groups of five that were selected as reference trees in order to compare their development. The laboratory measurements were analysed regarding the separability of ring-barked and control samples using spectral reflectance, vegetation indices and derivative analysis. Subsequently, a random forest classifier for determining important spectral wavelength regions was applied. Results from the methods are consistent and showed a high importance of the visible (VIS) spectral region, very low importance of the near-infrared (NIR) and minor importance of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. Using spectral reflectance data as well as indices, the earliest separation time was found to be 292 days after <b>ring-barking.</b> The derivative analysis showed that a significant separation was observed 152 days after <b>ring-barking</b> for six spectral features spread through VIS and SWIR.

40|$|A 2 -year {{demographic}} {{field study}} {{was carried out}} on the understorey tree Garcinia lucida in the humid Atlantic forests of South Cameroon. The bark and {{the seeds of the}} species are exploited for medicinal purposes and palm wine processing in West and Central Africa. The bark is often removed over almost the entire circumference of the stem, leading to high mortality rates. The goal {{of the study was to}} assess the impact of bark harvesting on population structure and dynamics, in order to obtain an indication to what extent the actual harvesting practices can be sustained for longer periods, and to provide information on the future availability of the resource. Comparison of populations that had been subject to different harvest regimes allowed assessment of the effects of G. lucida bark harvesting on population stand structure. In lightly exploited populations, unharvested individuals represented more than the half of the trees (> 10 cm DBH), while this was only one-third in heavily exploited stands. The percentage of dead exploited trees (> 20 cm DBH) was more than 40 and 70 %, for lightly and heavily exploited populations, respectively. This reflects the high intensity of bark harvesting, mainly directed at large trees. For the assessment of bark harvesting on population dynamics, we constructed matrix models for each of the three common bark harvest practices: (1) partial debarking of stem, (2) <b>ring-barking</b> trees and (3) felling trees at approximately 1 m height above ground level to extract bark. For all harvest practices, the asymptotic population growth rates (λ) were not significantly different from 1 indicating that populations were neither growing nor decreasing in size. Nevertheless, model projections showed that the stock of available trees decreased. Under an annual regime of partial debarking of all trees > 10 cm DBH, the amount of harvestable trees gradually declined and reached 50 % of the initial size after 20 years. For <b>ring-barking</b> and felling trees, the projections showed a sharp drop in the amount of harvestable trees directly after the start of the simulations, and the amount continued to decline below 4 % of the initial size under an annual harvest regime. Even after a long time, populations did not recover to their pre-harvest numbers. The stable size of harvested populations predicted by λ values suggest that current harvest practices of bark do not jeopardize the future existence of G. lucida populations. However, as the frequently applied harvest practices of <b>ring-barking</b> and felling strongly reduced the stock in our simulations, commercial bark exploitation cannot be sustained over long periods. Nevertheless, as long as populations can recover from the loss of exploited individuals, by continuous recruitment, there is still prospect for sustained bark extraction. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Tanzania is {{endowed with}} more than 10, 000 plant species, of which 1, 100 are endemic. The coastal regions host most endemic species, due to its wide range of {{productive}} ecological conditions. Over 25 % of all species are used as wild-harvested medicinal plants. About 60 % of the Tanzanian population in both rural and urban areas depends on traditional medicine and herbs as their primary health care, and {{as a means of}} generating income. This is due to high costs and unavailability of the universal healthcare, which was abolished in 1993. The aim of the thesis is to make a structured and a quantitative investigation to identify traded medicinal plants traded in markets of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania with a purpose to understand the chain and consequences of commercial trade on wild-harvested medicinal plants. A quantitative market research using free list surveys was used in combination with individually repeated in-depth structured and semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, Conservation Assessment and Planning Management method was used to prioritise species that are in need of conservation due to commercial trade. The results show that the chain of commercial trade of medicinal plant species begins in the forest and is then distributed to different stakeholders, such as harvesters, vendors, Traditional Healing Practitioners, consumers and exporters. The research also shows that the large urban and international demand of medicinal plant species supplied by the vendors and exporters is the major threat, specifically to destructively harvested species such as Cassia abbreviata, Zanthoxylum usambarense, Zanthoxylum chalybeum, Myrsine africana, Milicia excelsa and Prunus Africana. These medicinal plants species are up-rooted and/or <b>ring-barked</b> and are therefore in need of conservation. This calls for several conservation guidelines such as policy and regulations, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, education and planting of the medicinal plant species in their natural forests as well as collecting samples of medicinal plant species in a herbarium. Policies can be implemented to conserve these species, for instance only allowing registered practitioners to harvest the medicinal plant species to a level that will sustainably balance the quantity of medicinal plant species in the forest and its supply. In conclusion, an important policy regulation could be an export tax on internationally-traded wild-harvested medicinal that is levied on the purchasing international pharmaceutical companies, which would then be used to fund the conservation of the medicinal plant species to retain a sustainable wild stock. More investigation on the actual population sizes of these plant species is needed in order to secure their existence and contribute to sustainable development both socially and environmentall...|$|R

Especially due to the last mentioned, early detection {{of changes in the}} health status could help minimizing economical loss. The fundamental idea which lead to Norway spruce needle re flectance spectra analysis is, that within a time period of five months after artificial weakening of trees, reflectance spectra of needles show differences, which might make it possible to distinguish between weakened and control trees. Artificial weakening through <b>ring-barking</b> leads to a wide time frame for change detection due to a slow die back of trees. The point of time where needles still appear green but changes in reflectance spectra indicate a decline in the health status of ring-barked trees is of special interest. During the whole period needles were sampled directly within tree crowns and reflectance spectra were measured in a spectral laboratory. Comparison of spectra between both groups was conducted with the principal component analysis, the Jeffries-Matusita Distance and different health related indices.

40|$|Features of {{the land}} {{management}} history over a 125, 755 km 2 area of central Queensland, Australia were determined {{from a variety of}} sources. A random sample of 205 site locations provided the basis for determining trends in land use. Trends in vegetation clearing were determined using sequential aerial photography for the sample sites, revealing a steady rate averaging nearly 1 % of the region per annum over 41 years. This measure of sustained clearing over a large region is higher than recently published clearing rates from South America. Land types have been selectively cleared with over 90 % of the Acacia on clay land type having been cleared. A land-holder questionnaire pertaining to the random sites yielded a response rate of 71 % and provided information on vegetation clearing, ploughing, tree killing (<b>ring-barking</b> or tree poisoning), and fire frequency, season and intensity. The land-holder responses were compared with independent data sources where possible and revealed no mis-information. However, land-holders may have been marginally less likely to respond if the sample area had been cleared, although this effect was not statistically significant. Ploughing and tree killing are variable depending on land type, but the former has affected about 40 % of the Acacia on clay land type, effectively eliminating options for natural regrowth. The proportion of decade-site combinations that were reported as having no fires increased from 22 % in the 1950 s to an average of 42 % for subsequent decades, although the reporting of more than one fire per decade has been relatively constant through the study period. The reporting of at least one fire per decade varies from 46 % for the Acacia on sand land type to 77 % for the Eucalypt on sand land type for decade-site combinations. Fires are more intense when associated with clearing than in uncleared vegetation, but the proportion of cool and hot fires is relatively constant between land types in uncleared vegetation. Nearly all fires reported were either in spring or summer and this seasonally restricted regime is probably at variance with Aboriginal fire regimes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} IAA upon cambial activity, xylem {{differentiation}} and translocation of assimilates from the lateral shoot {{was investigated in}} spring and late summer in decapitated and ring-barked young trees of Pinus silvestris in the forest stand. Decapitation interrupted cambial xylem production in the uppermost part of the main stem of decapitated trees in spring and late summer, regardless of whether lateral branches below were growing, dormant or disbudded, and the contact through phloem with the roots was maintained or severed. Auxin supplied to the decapitated stems caused an increasing stimulation of cambial xylem production in spring. It also stimulated cambial activity in August but was ineffective in September. Apical control of cambial xylem production was strongly dependent upon the continuity of phloem and/or cambial tissues of the decapitated main-stem-section with lower parts of the plant. Decapitation of the stem strongly reduced the daily rate of cell wall deposition in the cambial xylem derivatives which {{on the day the}} experiment started constituted the zones of radial enlargement and maturation. This reduction limited progressively secondary wall deposition in consecutive maturing tracheids even though the cells differentiated longer. Irrespective of the season, auxin prevented the effect of decapitation in cells which were already differentiating when the experiment started as well as extension of the maturation phase. The effect of auxin was somewhat reduced when the lateral branches were additionally decapitated in early summer. In early summer auxin caused a significant increase of the daily rate of cell wall deposition in cells of the cambial zone or the newly produced ones, thus resulting in formation of progressively thicker secondary walls. Late in summer assimilates were transported mostly to {{the lower part of the}} stem. Decapitation changed the intact tree pattern of assimilate distribution, increasing the transport in spring and reducing it later in the summer. Prevention of the contact with roots via phloem and cambium in spring (by <b>ring-barking</b> the stem at tree base) decreased decapitation-induced downward transport of assimilates. Application of auxin to the decapitated uppermost segment of the main stem resulted in a significant increase of assimilate translocation into the stem. At least two mechanisms of auxin involvement in regulation of the rate of secondary wall deposition in pine stem tracheids can be considered: (a) induction (or activation) of the cell wall metabolic potential which seems to occur during meristematic or early radial enlargement phases of tracheid differentiation, and (b) regulation of substrate availability during the phase of tracheid maturation...|$|E
