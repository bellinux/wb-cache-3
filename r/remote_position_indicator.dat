50|$|While in Noum√©a, the S-31 {{became the}} first American {{submarine}} to be equipped with a plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator,</b> or PPI.

30|$|According to Liu [21], {{there are}} four {{different}} system topologies for IPSs: (1) <b>remote</b> <b>positioning</b> system, (2) self-positioning systems, (3) indirect <b>remote</b> <b>positioning</b> systems, and (4) indirect self-positioning systems. In <b>remote</b> <b>positioning</b> system, a mobile node acts as main signal transmitter and several anchor measuring units receive and measure its broadcasted signal. The results from all measuring units are collected, {{and the location of}} the transmitter is computed in a central master station. In self-positioning systems, the mobile acts instead as measuring unit. This unit receives the signals of several transmitters in known locations and computes its location locally based on the measured signals. Two middle-way approaches are also possible: in indirect <b>remote</b> <b>positioning</b> systems, measurements collected by the mobile node are transmitted via a wireless data link for <b>remote</b> <b>position</b> computation; in indirect self-positioning systems, measurements collected locally by fixed stations are transmitted to the mobile through a wireless data link.|$|R

The interface wirelessly transmits {{a communication}} signal {{when it is}} in the <b>remote</b> <b>position.</b> A communication unit has an emergency call sender with an antenna for transmitting the communication signal via the antenna. A base unit detects and stores user data in a memory of a control unit of the interface, and is mechanically coupled with the interface when the interface is in the <b>remote</b> <b>position.</b> An independent claim is also included for a method for transmitting a communication signal...|$|R

Social <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> refer to what {{is commonly known as}} social class and social status. There exists in the sociological literature many theoretical conceptualisation and empirical operationalization of social class and social status. This first version of the package offers tools to construct the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) and the Oesch social class schema. It also provides tools to convert several occupational classifications (PCS 82, PCS 03, and ISCO 08) into a common one (ISCO 88) to facilitate data harmonisation work, and tools to collapse (i. e. group) modalities of social <b>position</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

40|$|The system-integrated reactor {{currently}} under {{development at the}} Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute is being designed with a soluble boron free operation {{and the use of}} a nuclear heating for the reactor start-up. These design features require a Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM) for the integral reactor to have a fine-step movement capability as well as a high reliability for a fine reactivity control. Also the reliability and accuracy of the information for the control rod position is very important to the reactor safety as well as the design of the core protection system. The <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> is classified as a Class 1 E component because the rod position signal of the <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> is used in the safety related systems. Therefore it will be separated from the control systems to the extent that a failure of any single control system component of a channel and will have sufficient independence, redundancy, and testability to perform its safety functions assuming a single failure. The <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> is composed of a permanent magnet, reed switches and a voltage divider. Four independent <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> around the upper pressure housing provide an indication of the position of a control rod comprising of a permanent magnet with a magnetic field concentrator which moves with the extension shaft connected to the control rod.

A voltage divider electrically connected to the reed switches provides a signa...|$|R
