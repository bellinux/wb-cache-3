30|$|From Figs.  6 and 7 can be {{concluded}} {{that the effect of}} mud pressure on stress distribution in the radial direction is affected by the orientation of the wellbore stresses. At θ =  90 o the tangential stress reaches its highest value for a greater section of the <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> from the wellbore. At θ =  0 o the tangential stress reaches its lowest value and the axial or radial stresses may become maximum at the <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> from the wellbore as mud weight increases.|$|R

The model is accurate for reproducing the bio-potential {{even for a}} small electrode to fiber <b>radial</b> <b>distances.</b> Established current activities of axon is used and programmed in the developed FPGA-based instrument, the model takes into consideration action potential propagation properties, electrode to fiber <b>radial</b> <b>distances,</b> medium conductivity. This paper investigates differences in the action potential amplitude for two longitudinal probe positions one {{in front of a}} node of Ranvier (NOR) and one between two NOR, for a large range of <b>radial</b> <b>distances.</b> Results are reported and compared with simulation with a correlation level of 97. 6 %.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of coordinate chart which are adapted to this family of nested spheres, each introducing {{a different kind of}} distortion. The best known alternative is the Schwarzschild chart, which correctly represents distances within each sphere, but (in general) distorts <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> and angles. Another popular choice is the isotropic chart, which correctly represents angles (but in general distorts both <b>radial</b> and transverse <b>distances).</b> A third choice is the Gaussian polar chart, which correctly represents <b>radial</b> <b>distances,</b> but distorts transverse distances and angles. In all three possibilities, the nested geometric spheres are represented by coordinate spheres, so we can say that their roundness is correctly represented.|$|R
25|$|The angles are {{typically}} measured in degrees (°) or radians (rad), where 360°=2 rad. Degrees are {{most common in}} geography, astronomy, and engineering, whereas radians are commonly used in mathematics and theoretical physics. The unit for <b>radial</b> <b>distance</b> is usually determined by the context.|$|E
25|$|Assume {{the liquid}} {{exhibits}} laminar flow. Laminar flow {{in a round}} pipe prescribes {{that there are a}} bunch of circular layers (lamina) of liquid, each having a velocity determined only by their <b>radial</b> <b>distance</b> from the center of the tube. Also assume the center is moving fastest while the liquid touching the walls of the tube is stationary (due to the no-slip condition).|$|E
25|$|Present in the D Ring is a finescale {{structure}} with waves 30km apart. First {{seen in the}} gap between the C Ring and D73, the structure was found during Saturn's 2009 equinox to extend a <b>radial</b> <b>distance</b> of 19,000km from the D Ring to the inner edge of the B Ring. The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical corrugations of 2 to 20 m amplitude; the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60km in 1995 to 30km by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ~1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the rings out of the equatorial plane. A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter's main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.|$|E

The revised absolute intensities of electrons in the energy range 0. 06 - 21 MeV are less than previous estimates by factors as great as 10 for L not exceeding 6. Previously published intensities at greater <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> for Ee less than 21 MeV and at all <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> for Ee greater than 21 MeV are not affected by the revisions...|$|R
40|$|Efficiency {{scores of}} {{production}} units are measured by their distance {{to an estimated}} production frontier. Nonparametric data envelopment analysis estimators {{are based on a}} finite sample of observed production units, and <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> are considered. We investigate the consistency and the speed of convergence of these estimated efficiency scores ~or of the <b>radial</b> <b>distances!</b> in the very general setup of a multioutput and multi-input case. It is shown that the speed of convergence relies on the smoothness of the unknown frontier and on the number of inputs and outputs. Furthermore, one has to distinguish between the output- and the input-oriented cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and precision of two key field measurements used to produce estimates of marine mammal abundance from shipboard surveys – the horizontal angles from the ship's trackline and the <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> to the animals in the water – were assessed. Measurements were made from two ships, the McArthur and the David Starr Jordan, under field conditions. Horizontal angles were measured using angle rings and <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> were measured with reticles in 25 X binoculars. Distances to targets were measured simultaneously using radar and reticles. Rounding of horizontal angles in field survey data to 5 degree increments, and of reticle values to both 0. 2 and 0. 5 reticle increments, was indicated by autocorrelation tests. The rounding was eliminated by "smearing " the original horizontal angles over ± 2 degrees and the original reticles over ± 0. 05 reticles. Replicated measurements of angles in the radar database indicated 95 % of angle measurements to a single target {{were expected to be}} within ± 3 degrees of one another. The precision of <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> measured using reticles was inversely proportional to target <b>distance.</b> The <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> calculated using the formula proposed by Lerczak and Hobbs (1998) were a closer fit to distances from radar than alternative formulas, but exhibited a slight tendency to underestimate distances to targets close to the horizon under field conditions. Adjusting reticle measurements for light refraction improved the fit to target distances by reducing this downward bias. A second adjustment corrected ship-specific responses to sea conditions at the time the reticles were used...|$|R

40|$|The four {{spacecraft}} of the Cluster mission {{collect a}} unique data set since January 2001. We process {{the time period}} from January 2001 to December 2009. The spacecraft changed their orbits {{over the last few}} years, resulting in the data set with excellent coverage {{of a wide range of}} <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> from the Earth, especially in the equatorial plane. We focus on the statistical analysis of whistler-mode waves called the equatorial noise (EN). These intense wave emissions are generated by unstable ion distributions. They propagate close to the geomagnetic equator at frequencies between the local proton cyclotron frequency and the lower hybrid frequency. Polarization of the magnetic field fluctuations corresponding to these emissions is linear. We processed data from the STAFF-SA instruments which preanalyze data from electric and magnetic field fluctuations onboard and provide us hermitian spectral matrices. We use the data measured at <b>radial</b> <b>distances</b> from about 2 to 11 RE to show the dependence of the occurrence of EN on the magnetic local time (MLT).
