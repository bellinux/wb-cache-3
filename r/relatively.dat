5|$|Acantharea, a <b>relatively</b> {{large group}} of marine radiolarian protozoa, produce {{intricate}} mineral skeletons composed of strontium sulfate. In biological systems, calcium is substituted in a small extent by strontium.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have <b>relatively</b> low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is <b>relatively</b> weak, with <b>relatively</b> little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{skeletonised}} animals {{could have}} fed {{directly on the}} <b>relatively</b> undefended Ediacaran biota.|$|E
5|$|Although {{concrete}} casualty {{numbers are}} unavailable for either side, sources agree that Belgian-Congolese losses were <b>relatively</b> light, while several hundred Mahdist {{soldiers were killed}} in the two actions.|$|E
5|$|Although xenon is {{rare and}} <b>relatively</b> {{expensive}} to extract from the Earth's atmosphere, {{it has a}} number of applications.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage in <b>relatively</b> open {{habitats and}} reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of <b>relatively</b> dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Cena {{had started}} {{learning}} Mandarin Chinese to help WWE expand its reach, and spoke the language <b>relatively</b> smoothly at a WWE/PPTV {{press conference in}} Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|Assuming its existence, {{computer}} climate simulations {{have confirmed}} {{the possibility of}} the existence of surface water and these factors combine to a <b>relatively</b> high measure of planetary habitability.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 census, Brownhills had 5,768 {{people in}} employment, {{of which the}} largest {{percentage}} (28.85%) worked in manufacturing, followed by retail (19.35%) and construction (8.93%). Compared to the national average, the town had a <b>relatively</b> high percentage of workers {{in the construction industry}} and a <b>relatively</b> low number in real estate and financial intermediation. The average distance travelled to work by Brownhills residents was 10.36km; the vast majority (62%) travelled to work by car.|$|E
5|$|At war's end, {{the type}} was retired and <b>relatively</b> few Hotspurs were {{preserved}} for display.|$|E
5|$|August 19–20, 1892 – Though {{winds are}} <b>relatively</b> light, a {{hurricane}} {{to the west}} causes some agricultural, structural, and maritime damage.|$|E
5|$|August 23, 1935 – A Category 3 {{hurricane}} narrowly misses to the northwest, with <b>relatively</b> light winds reported.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have <b>relatively</b> less hydrogen and helium and <b>relatively</b> more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|By {{orienting}} the substrates into {{a productive}} arrangement {{to reduce the}} reaction entropy change. The contribution of this mechanism to catalysis is <b>relatively</b> small.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is brittle, and behaves as a {{semiconductor}} in {{a direction}} perpendicular to its planes. Most of its chemistry is nonmetallic; it has a <b>relatively</b> high ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a <b>relatively</b> high electronegativity. Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms carbonic acid H2CO3.|$|E
5|$|Crickets have <b>relatively</b> {{powerful}} jaws, {{and several}} {{species have been}} known to bite humans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>relatively</b> small {{central nervous}} system, some spiders (like Portia) exhibit complex behaviour, {{including}} {{the ability to}} use a trial-and-error approach.|$|E
5|$|Despite their <b>relatively</b> short history, over 30 {{men have}} managed The Blues. Paul Ogden has had six {{separate}} spells in charge.|$|E
5|$|Dissecting aneurysms of the {{vertebral}} artery constitute 4% of all cerebral aneurysms, and are hence a <b>relatively</b> rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has a <b>relatively</b> low density, and these shales {{may not be}} chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is <b>relatively</b> fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received <b>relatively</b> few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, {{who were able to}} out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the <b>relatively</b> new television medium. DuMont, however, did win a number of awards during its years of operation.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear <b>relatively</b> close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a <b>relatively</b> fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5|$|Employment by {{industry}} was 22% manufacturing; 18% retail; 10% construction; 10% transport and communications; 9% real estate; 8% {{health and social}} work; 6% public administration; 5% education; 5% hotels and restaurants; 1% finance; 1% agriculture; 1% energy and water supply; and 4% other community, social or personal services. Compared to national figures, Sheerness had a <b>relatively</b> high percentage of workers in manufacturing, transport and communications, and a <b>relatively</b> low percentage in agriculture, hotels, restaurants, education, health, social work and finance.|$|E
5|$|Even in 2011, the Filwood ward {{was still}} an area with a <b>relatively</b> small amount of ethnic minorities, with 85.8 per cent of the 12,267 {{residents}} being White British.|$|E
5|$|Ewiniar {{affected}} {{many areas}} {{due to its}} track and <b>relatively</b> long life, killing at least 40people along the way and leaving much damage in its path.|$|E
5|$|Giffnock {{experiences}} a temperate maritime climate, {{like much of}} the British Isles, with <b>relatively</b> cool summers and mild winters. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Hemp oil, <b>relatively</b> low in emissions. Production is {{problematic}} {{in some countries}} because of its association with marijuana.|$|E
5|$|His {{material}} {{contains a}} <b>relatively</b> {{high number of}} Basque-derived items.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Ronald Breslow {{proposed}} that a <b>relatively</b> stable nucleophilic carbene, a thiazol-2-ylidene derivative, {{was involved in}} the catalytic cycle of vitamin B1 (thiamine) that yields furoin from furfural.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989 Alternate Commander Jok Reng of the SPLA Mainstream recaptured Mongalla with a <b>relatively</b> small force.|$|E
5|$|In North American {{terrestrial}} sequences, {{the extinction}} event is best {{represented by the}} marked discrepancy {{between the rich and}} <b>relatively</b> abundant late-Maastrichtian palynomorph record and the post-boundary fern spike.|$|E
5|$|In some {{locations}} in Pennsylvania {{the quality of}} the ore was quite good, with <b>relatively</b> deep veins containing 45% iron, and very low sulfur.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place <b>relatively</b> cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and <b>relatively</b> cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a <b>relatively</b> flat basin near sea level {{on the western}} margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from {{surrounding}} mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at <b>relatively</b> the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E
5|$|In {{the central}} Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, <b>relatively</b> {{unbranched}} stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper Whanganui River. On old trees, the leaves {{tend to be}} <b>relatively</b> broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that tī manu is adapted to the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by lava, volcanic ash, and pumice. Trees of the tī manu type are also found in northern Taranaki, the King Country and the Bay of Plenty lowlands.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is <b>relatively</b> deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located <b>relatively</b> high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E
