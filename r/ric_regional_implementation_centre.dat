40|$|After {{disastrous}} leakages {{of government}} guns in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, Australia {{led the charge}} to help island nations lock up their small arms, building secure state armouries across the region. But of late, <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> of the UN Programme of Action has lagged. Philip Alpers writes that {{five years after the}} adoption of the UN Programme of Action to address the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons the recent UN PoA Review Conference closed without so much as an outcome document. A spin-off Arms Trade Treaty, argues Alpers could distract from more direct and localised efforts to curb gun violence. In Pacific Islands Forum countries civilians alone hold 3. 1 million firearms, or one gun for every ten people. After disastrous leakages of government guns in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, Australia led the charge to help island nations lock up their small arms, building secure state armouries across the region.

40|$|The {{introduction}} in 2010 of the Freedom of Choice Act {{represents one}} of the most far-reaching reforms of the Swedish health system. While it is mandatory for the regional counties to introduce choice plans for primary care it is voluntary for ambulatory specialist services. The voluntary nature of the regulations for the latter types of care generates a potential gap between the central government's reform attempts and the <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> of the plans. We review the <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> of this reform with respect to specialist services from a political economy perspective. Data on the scope of implementation show that counties of the same political ideology as the central government have introduced the most choice plans for specialist care. In particular, counties ruled by right-wing majorities have introduced the Choice Act to a considerably larger extent than left-wing counties. This creates a highly uneven situation across the various parts of the country, possibly at odds with the basic premises of the country's health law of equal access to care. The introduction of choice plans forms part of a decidedly contentious set of issues that are high on the political agenda of Sweden. The nature and impacts of these reforms are also a concern to the general public and the broader industry. Considerably more rigorous analyses will be needed to assess the impact on key policy parameters such as overall system efficiency and equitable access to services {{as a result of these}} changes to the health care markets...|$|R
30|$|Third, we {{expected}} {{that the quality of}} the interventions would strongly depend on regional policy strategy. On average, the local agency may control quality by managing the total participation rate. A high participation rate may signal market demand, which may cause a downshift in marginal quality. In addition, local economic conditions have a direct effect on the willingness to set up new ventures because economic conditions are correlated with the level of competition and overall demand (e.g., Falck 2007). As a result, the local level is highly important in supporting the conditional independence assumption. In this study, we controlled for the <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> of promotion programs by modifying the matching algorithm.|$|R

The conceptual framework for a common definition of terrorism is set out in this paper.

The paper concludes by considering ASEAN progress in adopting cooperative mechanisms to combat terrorism thus far...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of the Mediterranean Fore-casting System (MFS) project, the performance of re-gional numerical ocean forecasting systems is assessed by means of model-model and model-data comparison. Three different operational systems considered in this study are: the Adriatic REGional Model (AREG); the Adri-atic Regional Ocean Modelling System (AdriaROMS) and the Mediterranean Forecasting System General Circulation Model (MFS-GCM). AREG and AdriaROMS are <b>regional</b> <b>implementations</b> (with some dedicated variations) of POM and ROMS, respectively, while MFS-GCM is an OPA based system. The assessment is done through standard scores. In situ and remote sensing data are used to evaluate the system performance. In particular, a set of CTD measurements col-lected in the whole western Adriatic during January 2006 an...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Regional {{scientists}} {{have long been}} interested in measuring the effects of various external and internal stimuli on a regional economy. Measuring the actual size and timing of exogenous and endogenous impacts has been of special interest, as numerical or estimation techniques allow regional actors (governments, business, and others) to make policy-type probability statements and actions in response to changes to these stimuli. Recently, the use of vector autoregressive (VAR) models and, consequently, impulse response functions has become increasingly popular. This paper will closely examine the VAR methodology and its assumptions and will address the types of empirical issues that arise from actual <b>regional</b> <b>implementation.</b> T h e issues of stationarity, model specification and selection, order determi-nation, and impulse responses are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Water Framework Directive has {{introduced}} a new governance approach that offers implementing agencies in EU Member States policy discretion to implement ecological ambitions. The aim {{of this paper was}} to gain insight into the way regional actors use this discretion and into the rationale behind their behaviour. Our research revealed that in <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> processes in the Netherlands, limited ecological ambitions have been framed due to several complications. These complications also occur in other EU Member States. As {{it might be possible to}} reduce some of the complications by improving collaboration, exchange and learning between the actors involved, the paper concludes by outlining the important role that communities of practice might play in the implementation process of water policy at the regional level...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to present {{attendees}} with the journey taken by the regional approach to developing and implementing uniform standards associated with Engineering Works for planning, design and construction. By coordinating and facilitating the process of bringing key staff from various Municipal organisations together and reviewing current processes, the opportunity of regional agreement to adopt and utilise standards has evolved into a realistic approach. Rather than view the potential introduction of any standard in isolation, it was considered more appropriate to include colleagues from adjacent Councils in an attempt to gain the most from a <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> with economies of scale and assist the development industry with a uniform standard that covers the region. To achieve consensus from these neighbouring Councils was both the challenge and incentive in for the representatives...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a currently running research project, which aims at exploring potential geographical and discursive shifts in regional cultural policy in Sweden. The backdrop against which these shifts are understood {{is that of}} globalization processes, understood as parallel processes of internationalization and decentralization in political-administrative organization. Two regional experiments, Region Skåne and Region Västra Götaland, carried out since the 1990 ’s, constitute the comprehensive case studies of the project. Within both regions, two municipalities and two cultural activities have also been selected for the project. By analyzing strategic documents and by interviewing key agents in the cultural policy field in the two regions and four municipalities, the construction of regional identity is explored. In this process of construction, the relations between strategy and <b>implementation,</b> <b>centre</b> and periphery and formal and informal agents are highlighted...|$|R
