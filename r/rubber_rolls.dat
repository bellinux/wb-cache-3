5000|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] In Great Britain the grinding process is now being used extensively on passenger car axles (particularly the journals) passenger railway carriage axle bearing units, crosshead guide bars, links, piston rods, chilled rolls, granite rolls, brass rolls, <b>rubber</b> <b>rolls,</b> paper rolls, crankshafts, camshafts, piston rings, planer knives, ball race rings, aluminium pistons, lenses, plate glass edges, glass tubes. Experiments are being carried out on the grinding of cylinders for locomotive and other engines. [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E

The main objective of rice milling system is to remove the husk and bran layer to produce the white rice. In this process, <b>rubber</b> <b>roll</b> sheller is used to remove husk from the grains by friction process. If the rubber material is too soft, there may not be sufficient shear force to husk the paddy.

Hence, for efficient husking the <b>rubber</b> <b>roll</b> material should possess the balance of physico-mechanical properties. Rice breakage depends on several other parameters like the type of harvest, drying temperature, drying methods, physical characteristics of paddy, husking characteristics, paddy moisture content, rubber roller speed, <b>rubber</b> <b>roll</b> pressure, paddy feed rate and fissures. <b>Rubber</b> <b>roll</b> wear depends on the type of rubber material attached to the roller, feed rate, roller speed, pressure etc...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPaddy {{harvesting}} is {{the process}} of collecting the mature rice crop from the field which consists of activities such as cutting, handling, threshing and cleaning. Cutting, threshing and cleaning plays an important role to reduce postharvest losses. Lower performance of traditional harvesting process, labour shortage, reduced turn-around time and use of high yielding varieties have inevitably forced farmers to shift into mechanical grain harvesting in Sri Lanka. Rice milling is carried out to produce an edible polished or white rice product from harvested rough rice. Head rice yield is considered for marketing purposes because broken rice has low price in the market. Field survey was conducted in Polonnaruwa, Ampara and Hambanthota districts to identify most popular types of combine harvesters operating in the above districts. Paddy samples were collected from harvest of two most popular models of combine harvester in triplicate. Paddy sample of 1 m 2 area from every paddy field were harvested separately by manual harvesting followed by manual threshing and cleaning in laboratory as control sample of relevant paddy field. Moisture content of the paddy grains were measured in the paddy field using digital moisture meter before harvesting. Paddy samples were subjected to sun drying until the moisture content come down to 14 ± 1 % before the quality analysis in the laboratory. Each paddy sample was analyzed for moisture content, chaff percentage and head rice yield percentage (HRY). Paddy was milled using laboratory scale <b>rubber</b> <b>roll</b> sheller and abrasive polisher. Chaff content percentage was measured by adding 100 ml of paddy to water and volume of chaff was measured using graduated cylinder. HRY was calculated dividing the weight of grain partials, which are larger than the 3 / 4 of the grain, by weight of paddy sample. HRY between the two combine harvesting machine models evaluated were not significantly different at p< 0. 05 and also it was not significantly dependent on the harvesting methods such as combine harvesting and manual harvesting. The chaff content was significantly higher in model- 2 in comparison to control sample for long grain paddy while model- 1 was not significantly different with control sample for short grain paddy...|$|R

40|$|Rice production, {{processing}} and consumption {{are part of}} culture of the Bangladesh population. However, their experiences are very much limited to parboiled paddy for home consumption. Recently, the country attained almost self-sufficiency in paddy production and heading towards production and export of long grain aromatic rice. The milling yield of locally available aromatic rice processed in automatic mills ranged from 50 to 54 %, which may be improved by adopting proper processing technology. Two recently developed aromatic rice i. e. BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38 are comparatively longer than the existing aromatic varieties which need better processing technology {{in order to minimize}} breakage and improve product quality. An industry level experiment was conducted at a <b>rubber</b> <b>roll</b> type automatic rice mill located at North-west region of Bangladesh for processing BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38. The initial moisture content of BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38 were 13. 39 and 12. 86 percents respectively. The paddy was sun dried for 4 hours followed by 20 hours tempering everyday; and were dried for 3, 4, 5, and 6 days. The ranges of temperature and relative humidity during drying of paddy were 34 - 42 o C and 42 - 79 %, respectively. After two days of drying, the moisture content of the paddy reduced to 9 %. However, in the following morning the paddy moisture increased up to 10 % due to condensation. But the hardness of the kernel was on increasing trend, which is necessary to reduce breakage during milling. The highest crushing strengths of BRRI dhan 37 and BRRI dhan 38 were found 8. 0 and 6. 76 kg, respectively at 3 days of drying and tempering which are attributed as the proper milling condition for better head rice recovery. Kernel translucency increased with drying duration irrespective of the variety. The highest milling yield of BRRI dhan 37 was 60. 2 % when samples were dried for 4 days and the highest milling yield of BRRI dhan 38 was 60. 1 % when samples were dried for 3 days.
