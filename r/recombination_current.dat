P-i-n solar cells with their intrinsic region replaced by a multilayered heterostructure (e. g. GaAs-AlGaAs thin successive layers) are devices of exceptional performance, when illuminated, for two main reasons (a) they provide wider optical windows to incident solar photons, compared to their bulk counterparts, and therefore higher number of photo-excited carriers and (b) they reduce recombination in the intrinsic region, thus leading to more pronounced thermal currents out of the quantum wells. In the present communication, incident photons are modeled as two current sources representing photogenerated (Iph) and recombining electrons (Ir) respectively, along with the shunt and series resistance of such devices. General relations are developed for open circuit voltage Voc, short circuit current Isc, incident power, all as functions of net (after <b>recombination)</b> thermionic <b>currents</b> Ith = Iph – Ir.

However, recent economic analysis has suggested that for solar to become a truly wide spread source of electricity, the costs still need to plummet by a factor of 8 x.
