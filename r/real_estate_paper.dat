40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to demonstrate, through the Delphi technique, how demand drivers and {{accommodation}} priorities for emerging knowledge-intensive firms are understood and how corporate property and asset managers can respond to them. Design/methodology/approach – This empirical paper discusses the results emerging from a Delphi study in four rounds with ten experts. This research focuses on the high growth, commercial sector in south-east Queensland in Australia. Findings – The accommodation priority demands of knowledge-intensive firms varied depending on the stage of their lifecycle, that is, start-up, established or mature. For start-ups, accommodation cost was of primary importance; however, for the established and mature firms, their priorities were directly related to those supporting the progress of the firms itself and the productivity of its employers. Practical implications – Many of the findings are likely to be applicable to commercial environments elsewhere and would provide a basis for investors, developers, asset owners and managers to better align their “old” assets, through better asset management, to these “new” firms within this rapidly changing environment. Originality/value – The use of the Delphi technique in this multi-faceted research topic captures the practical knowledge, wisdom and intuition of experts who deal with such issues on a day-to-day basis. Most real estate issues usually involve diverse specialities and perspectives – this paper illustrates how common ground through consensus can be achieved.

This paper applied the bivariate Markov-switching autoregressive model (MS-ARX) and the Markov-switching vector auto-regression model (MSVAR) to identify the turning points of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> cycles.

40|$|Information profoundly {{influences}} market trading. <b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> {{businesses are}} always prone to news about change. However, little {{work has been}} done on the relationship between inside information and performance of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> equities. This <b>paper</b> investigates the likelihood of informed trading in equities issued by <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> developers. The <b>paper</b> adopts the framework of probability of informed trading (PIN), using high-frequency data from Hong Kong. Compared with Tay, Ting, Tse, and Warachka (2009) 's logistic model, this study provides a new and better approach, with Pareto distribution, to model time-varying probabilities of news. Importantly, it tackles the floating-point (FP) problem arising from large loads of financial data in numerical computation, by giving a better solution. The findings suggest that the likelihood of informed trading in equities happens among <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> developers. Particularly, the equities of mainland-based developers with lower market values have a higher chance of informed trading than those issued by HK-based developers of high market values. Somehow, a diversified business is less likely to be associated with informed trading. Furthermore, the liquidity of equities has an effect of dilution on informed trading. While this study focuses on <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> equities data, its proposed approach {{can be applied to the}} detection of likelihood of informed trading in other sectors.
