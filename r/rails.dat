5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail {{has a low}} basal {{metabolic}} rate (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not {{as a result of}} flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for <b>rails.</b> This in turn would favour energy conservation by the <b>rails,</b> resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless <b>rails,</b> including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that <b>rails</b> that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.|$|E
5|$|The clutch size is two eggs, {{which is}} low for such small <b>rails.</b> The eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve spots that are {{concentrated}} around {{the apex of}} the egg.

Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E

5|$|The <b>rails</b> are a bird family {{comprising}} nearly 150 species. Although {{origins of}} the group are lost in antiquity, {{the largest number of}} species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World, suggesting this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated, but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake, C. egregia, which has sometimes been given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. Both species are short-billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of <b>rails.</b> Porzana crakes, particularly the ash-throated crake (Porzana albicollis) are near relatives of the Crex genus.|$|E
