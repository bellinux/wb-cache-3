5|$|L'Empire des Mille Planètes (Empire of a Thousand Planets) premiered in Pilote in 1969 {{and marked}} a further {{development}} for the Valérian series and for Mézières art. This story was the series' first full-blown attempt at space opera and it {{set out for the}} first time the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> Valérian and Laureline, as opposed to the caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who serves {{as one of the}} game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game. A handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games, such as Secret of Evermore. Additionally, Final Fantasy SGI, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> Locke, Terra, and Shadow.|$|E
5|$|State Arms of the Union, {{illustrated}} by Henry Mitchell {{and published by}} Louis Prang (known {{as the father of}} the lithographic industry), offers historically accurate <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> the state's coats of arms as they existed in 1876. An accomplished engraver with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for 40 years, Mitchell was responsible for engraving several coats of arms for official state use as well as arms for well-known educational and philanthropic organizations. The illustrations are presented alongside proof impressions from the engraved dies used to print the state arms on the first issue of United States National Bank Notes.|$|E

5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Users could create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> completed designs. Picture This Home was awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. In 1998, the software and its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.|$|E
5|$|Ferrier's discography {{consists}} of studio recordings originally {{made on the}} Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only {{a small part of}} her St John Passion was captured on disc.|$|E
5|$|The bas-reliefs in Borobudur {{depicted}} many {{scenes of}} daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also native vernacular architecture. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as asuras, gods, bodhisattvas, kinnaras, gandharvas and apsaras. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century Maritime Southeast Asia. One of the famous <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is Borobudur Ship. Today, the actual-size replica of Borobudur Ship that had sailed from Indonesia to Africa in 2004 is displayed in the Samudra Raksa Museum, located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur.|$|E

40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THIS DISSERTATION IS THE <b>RENDERING</b> <b>OF</b> THE HOLY EUCHARIST AS THE CENTER OF THE LITURGICAL TRADITION OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH BY DISPLAYING THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE CONNECTION OF THE SACRAMENTS WITH THE HOLY EUCHARIST. THE STUDY CONSISTS OF THE "INTRODUCTION" AND THE FOUR "PARTS". IN THE "INTRODUCTION" THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBJECT IS PRESENTED AND THE THEOLOGICAL IMPORTANCEOF THE CONNECTION OF THE SACRAMENTS WITH THE HOLY EUCHARIST IS STRESSED. THE FIRST THREE PARTS COMPRISE THE STUDY OF THE THREE MORE PROBLEMATIC SACRAMENTS OF BAPTISM, OF MATRIMONY AND OF HOLY UNCTION. THE FOURTH PART COMPRISES THE SYNOPTICAL PRESENTATION OF THE REST OF THE SACRAMENTS AND HOLY RITES WHICH REMAINED CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE DIVINE LITURGY UNTIL TODAY, NAMELY, ORDINATION, SANCTIFICATION OF THE HOLY MYRRH, THE CONSECRATION OF A CHURCH BUILDING AND THE MONASTIC TONSURE; AND THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE WATERS AND THE FUNERAL SERVICE WHICH WERE VERY EARLY DISSOCIATED FROM IT. IN THIS PRESENT DISSERTATION, THE UNBROKEN CONNECTION OF THE HOLY EUCHARIST TOWARDS THE OTHER SACRAMENTS, ASTHEY APPEAR TO BE PERFORMED UNTIL THE TIME OF THE TURKISH OCCUPATION, IS ASCERTAINED. FURTHERMORE, THE RESTORATION OF THE CORRECT LITURGICAL ACT IS SUGGESTED. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} popular music, instrumental {{tracks are}} sometimes <b>renderings,</b> remixes <b>of</b> a corresponding release that features vocals, {{but they may}} also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A blues band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include electric guitar, harmonica, upright bass/electric bass and drum kit.|$|R
5000|$|A {{storyboard}} artist visualizes {{stories and}} sketches frames of the story. Quick pencil drawings and marker <b>renderings</b> are two <b>of</b> {{the most common}} traditional techniques, although nowadays Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, and other storyboard applications are often used. The digital camera {{is one of the}} latest techniques in creating storyboards.|$|R
25|$|The modern, more {{personal}} element {{to the contemporary}} {{part of the story}} is narrated using the rough, energetic Squigglevision technique of traditional animation. It conveys the kind of restlessness inherent in the story and achieves a more light-hearted, universal tone with its simple, highly stylised <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> character and environments.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of modern Kannada literature {{can be traced}} to the early 19th century when Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III and his court poets moved away from the ancient champu form of prose toward prose <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana's Mudramanjusha ("Seal Casket", 1823) is the first modern novel written in Kannada.|$|E
25|$|In Medieval times (16th century), {{the first}} {{examples}} of the Latin <b>renderings</b> <b>of</b> the Belarusian (Cyrillic) text are known to occur, coming from the need to include the Old Belarusian quotes in the Polish and Latin texts. Those renderings were un-codified and, seemingly, were done by applying the Polish orthography to the Old Belarusian sounds.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was the determination of testing conditions and visual and numerical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>renderings</b> made with three different rendering engines in Maya software, which is widely used for educational and computer art purposes. In the theoretical part the overview of light phenomena and their simulation in virtual space is presented. This is followed by a detailed presentation of the main rendering methods and the results and limitations of their applications to 3 D objects. At the end of the theoretical part the importance of a proper testing scene and especially the role of Cornell box are explained. In the experimental part the terms and conditions as well as hardware and software used for {{the research}} are presented. This is followed by a description of the procedures, where we focused on the rendering quality and time, which enabled the comparison of settings of different render engines and determination of conditions for further rendering of testing scenes. The experimental part continued with rendering a variety of simple virtual scenes including Cornell box and virtual object with different materials and colours. Apart from visual evaluation, which was the starting point for comparison <b>of</b> <b>renderings,</b> a procedure for numerical estimation and colour deviations <b>of</b> <b>renderings</b> using the selected regions of interest in the final images is presented. </p...|$|R
50|$|With Version 3.5, Deneba went cross-platform, {{releasing}} a version with file-format compatibility for Macintosh and Windows computers.
