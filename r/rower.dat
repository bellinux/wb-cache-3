5000|$|Number of <b>rowers.</b> In {{all forms}} of modern {{competition}} the number of <b>rowers</b> can be 1, 2, 4, or 8. Although they are very rare, boats for other numbers of <b>rowers</b> do exist (such as the 24 person Stämpfli Express). In the 19th century, there were often races with 6, 10 and 12 <b>rowers</b> per boat.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rowers</b> {{competing}} at the 2000 Olympic Games {{were measured}} for 38 anthropometric dimensions. The {{aim was to}} identify common physical characteristics that could provide a competitive advantage. The participants included 140 male open-class <b>rowers,</b> 69 female open-class <b>rowers,</b> 50 male lightweight <b>rowers,</b> and 14 female lightweight <b>rowers.</b> Body mass, stature, and sitting height were different (P < 0. 01) between the open-class and lightweight <b>rowers,</b> {{as well as a}} comparison group of healthy young adults ("non-rowers", 42 males, 71 females), for both sexes. After scaling for stature, the open-class <b>rowers</b> remained proportionally heavier than the non-rowers, with greater proportional chest, waist, and thigh dimensions (P < 0. 01). <b>Rowers</b> across all categories possessed a proportionally smaller hip girth than the non-rowers (P < 0. 01), which suggested the equipment places some constraints on this dimension. Top-ranked male open-class <b>rowers</b> were significantly taller and heavier and had a greater sitting height (P < 0. 01) than their lower-ranked counterparts. They were also more muscular in the upper body, as indicated by a larger relaxed arm girth and forearm girth (P < 0. 01). For the male lightweight <b>rowers,</b> only proportional thigh length was greater in the best competitors (P < 0. 01). In the female open-class <b>rowers,</b> skinfold thicknesses were lower in the more highly placed competitors (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, the <b>rowers</b> in this sample demonstrated distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from non-rowers and other sports performers...|$|R

5000|$|The crew {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} <b>rowers,</b> each having one oar, one on the stroke side (<b>rower's</b> right hand side) and one on the bow side (<b>rower's</b> lefthand side). As the name suggests, there is no coxswain on such a boat, and the two <b>rowers</b> must co-ordinate steering and the proper timing of oar strokes between themselves or by means of a steering installation which is operated by a foot from one of the <b>rowers.</b> The equivalent boat when it is steered by a cox is referred to as a [...] "coxed pair".|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the eight}} <b>rowers</b> has one oar. There are four <b>rowers</b> on the stroke side (<b>rower's</b> right hand side) and four on the bow side (<b>rower's</b> lefthand side).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} effects of iron depletion without anemia (IDNA) on physical performance and training in female collegiate <b>rowers.</b> In a cross sectional study, 165 <b>rowers</b> were screened for iron status {{at the beginning of}} a competitive season (10 % anemic, 30 % IDNA, Hgb> 12. 0, Hgb> 12. 0 g/dL and ferritin < 20 [MICRO SIGN]g/L). IDNA <b>rowers</b> reported 2 K times that were 21 seconds slower compared to <b>rowers</b> with normal iron status (p= 0. 004). During the first week of training, 48 <b>rowers</b> (n= 24 IDNA) had their physical performance assessed (VO 2 peak, 4 K time, gross energetic efficiency) and recorded their training regimen. Compared to <b>rowers</b> with normal iron status, IDNA <b>rowers</b> trained ~ 10 minutes/d less (p= 0. 02), and had a 0. 3 L/min lower VO 2 peak (p= 0. 03). Less highly-trained <b>rowers</b> with poor iron status had a lower VO 2 peak (- 0. 32 L/min, p= 0. 02), and were less energetically-efficient (- 1. 7 %, p= 0. 09) compared to more highly-trained <b>rowers</b> with poor iron status. In a randomized controlled trial, 43 <b>rowers</b> received 100 mg/d FeSO 4 (n= 22) or placebo (n= 21) for 6 weeks, and completed daily training logs. Iron status, performance, and training quality were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks. Thirty-one <b>rowers</b> (n= 15 iron, 16 placebo) completed the trial. <b>Rowers</b> supplemented with iron improved their body iron stores (log ferritin, total body iron, p= 0. 07), and those with most depleted stores at baseline improved the most. Blood lactate concentration during the first 2000 m of a 4 K TT and 5 min post-recovery was significantly lower in the iron group (p< 0. 01), and <b>rowers</b> in the iron group had a greater improvement in work efficiency (p= 0. 15) compared to placebo. Additionally, the energetic efficiency of those <b>rowers</b> with poorer baseline stores (ferritin < 20 [MICRO SIGN]g/L) benefitted more from supplementation. Finally, <b>rowers</b> in the iron group had an improved training quality score (p= 0. 03) compared to those in the placebo group. We conclude that iron status should be screened {{at the beginning of a}} training season, and that iron supplementation (~ 15 mg iron/d) improves iron stores in female <b>rowers</b> during training, especially in the most deplete. The iron status of those with marginal/low stores should be monitored to prevent detrimental effects on training and performance...|$|R
40|$|Balance in {{rowing boats}} {{is crucial for}} {{experienced}} and non-experienced <b>rowers,</b> allowing them to keep their blades off the water and keep the boat from rolling that requires <b>rowers</b> to contract muscles to even out the boat and to stabilize their bodies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to create reference stabilometric values in fixed seat rowing and compare them between male and female <b>rowers</b> in different sensorial conditions with eyes open and closed. Fifteen subjects voluntarily participated in this study, six male <b>rowers</b> and nine female <b>rowers</b> from University of Alicante fixed seat rowing team, all belonging to the senior category. A FreeMed baropodometric platform (Rome, Italy) was used for the stabilometric measurements: (TE) total excursion of the CoP, (CEA) area of the 95 % confidence ellipse, (MV) mean velocity, (MDx) mediolateral direction, (MDy) anteroposterior direction, (RMSx) amplitude in mediolateral direction and (RMSy) amplitude in anteroposterior direction. Results indicate that male <b>rowers</b> had greater ability to maintain balance than female <b>rowers</b> in bipodal stance with eyes open and closed. Female <b>rowers</b> demonstrated more ability to preserve sitting position than male <b>rowers</b> with eyes open and closed. However, there was no clear trend in relation to a greater balance between male and female in monopodal stance...|$|R

50|$|Some rowing enthusiasts {{claim that}} the disproportionate number of tall <b>rowers</b> is simply due to the unfair {{advantage}} that tall <b>rowers</b> have on the ergometer. This {{is due to the}} ergometer's inability to properly simulate the larger <b>rowers</b> drag on a boat due to weight. Since the ergometer is used to assess potential <b>rowers,</b> results on the ergometer machine play a large role in a <b>rower's</b> career success. Thus, many erg scores are weight-adjusted, as heavyweights typically find it easier to get better erg scores. Also, since crew selection has favored tall <b>rowers</b> long before the advent of the ergometer, and bigger, taller crews are almost universally faster than smaller, shorter crews on the water, being tall is a definite advantage ultimately having {{little to do with the}} ergometer.|$|R

2500|$|The middle <b>rowers</b> of a crew (numbers 2 and 3 in a four, and 3, 4, 5 and 6 in an eight) are {{normally}} {{the most powerful}} and heaviest <b>rowers,</b> colloquially known as the Fuel Tank, Engine Room, Power House or Meat Wagon. [...] The boat pitches and yaws less in the middle, and the <b>rowers</b> there have less effect on these movements, being closer to the centre of mass and centre of buoyancy. [...] Therefore, the <b>rowers</b> {{in the middle of the}} boat do not have to be as technically sound or reactive to the movements of the boat, and can focus more on pulling as hard as they can. It is common practice among crews to put the most technically proficient <b>rowers</b> at the bow and stern and the physically strongest and heaviest <b>rowers</b> in the centre.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether adolescent <b>rowers</b> with and without low back pain (LBP) displayed differences in spino-pelvic kinematics and trunk muscle activation during prolonged ergometer rowing. Ten <b>rowers</b> with LBP and twelve <b>rowers</b> without LBP performed a 20 minute ergometer trial with kinematics, muscle activation and self reported perception of pain data (VAS) collected during the trial. Results of this study show that <b>rowers</b> with LBP postured their lumbar spine in flexion for a greater proportion of the drive phase and nearer to their end range of flexion when compared to those without LBP. This study highlights potential mechanisms for the ramping of back pain in adolescent <b>rowers...</b>|$|R

5|$|At Christ Church {{college at}} Oxford, {{where he was}} an {{undergraduate}} from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, {{and the effect of}} music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen <b>rower,</b> stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.|$|E

After the approval of Ethics Committees, 398 junior, 634 senior and 743 master <b>rowers</b> who have competed at 2007 World Rowing Championships (WRC) were interviewed. There were a total of 1775 participants from 70 countries. Rowing is a sport with low risk of injuries per training among <b>rowers</b> who sustained between 1. 75 and 2. 25 injuries/ 1000 training sessions/rower. High average number of training per a week caused that more than 50. 0 % of elite junior and senior <b>rowers</b> have been injured during the observed rowing season. The predominant injuries were overuse injuries of low severity. Low back injuries were the most frequent complaint. Senior <b>rowers</b> who were injured during the observed rowing season compared to those without injuries were significantly older, longer practiced rowing, competed at junior WRC, competed in “A” finals and won medals at previous senior WRC, and achieved significantly better final ranking at current senior WRC. The results of this research that junior <b>rowers</b> who were acutely injured during the on-water training had rowed for a shorter time compared to the <b>rowers</b> who did not sustain such injuries and that the higher incidence of chronic injuries was associated with higher average number of rowing trainings among junior and senior <b>rowers</b> have confirmed the hypothesis of this research that acute injuries are negatively associated with experience while chronic injuries are positively associated with the frequency of trainings...|$|R
