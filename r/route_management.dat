40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} bus <b>route</b> {{scheduling}} <b>management</b> model based on Ant Colony Optimization and traditional scheduling model. It optimizes the existing bus <b>route</b> scheduling <b>management</b> model according to Ant Colony algorithm, enhances {{the performance of}} both Ant Colony algorithm and the traditional scheduling model, and improves the optimal performance of the combining algorithm. The experiment results show that, the proposed algorithm can effectively deal with the bus <b>route</b> scheduling <b>management,</b> and the optimization result obtained is obviously better than the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, it solve the problems exist in the traditional algorithms, therefore has great application value. ...|$|R

(A proposed link between Marylebone and the sub-surface section of the Metropolitan Railway, which would have allowed GCR trains to run across London via the MR-controlled Thames Tunnel and on to the south coast, was abandoned.) The sharing arrangement meant through trains running from Chesham to Marylebone, as well as the MR terminus at Baker Street, and that the branch was worked by GCR trains as well as the ageing MR rolling stock.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An ad hoc {{wireless}} network is a self-organized network sys-tem. In this system, wireless terminals autonomously construct a multi-hop network which maintains its structural information by exchanging network information with some neighbor terminals. In such a network, the network topology changes frequently {{due to an}} unsettled wireless en-vironment. Flexible Radio Network (FRN), one of the products applying ad hoc {{wireless network}} system, adopts an original protocol that pro-vide a multiple <b>routes</b> <b>management</b> and a packet retransmission ability against packet transmission errors. This system has been in use in recent years. In this paper, we first evaluate its performance through simulations of data-link protocol and routing protocol to clarify its basic properties, and then we discover some problems on these protocols that degrade the performance. Furthermore, we propose some performance improvement techniques, simulate them, and then show how they improve the system performance...|$|R

50|$|The {{season of}} 1937 was {{intended}} to be far more successful than past seasons in terms of the tonnage and number of ships making the Arctic passage; however, many of the ships attempting it were not fully suited to Arctic conditions. Two convoys, led by Litke and , as well as , scrambled to rescue them and were trapped in the ice themselves, off Khatanga Gulf, for the winter. Through bad planning, weather and bad luck, 25 of the 64 ships underway on the Northern Route in 1937 were out of action - at least until next spring; one, Rabochiy, was lost. Only in April 1938 did Krasin, resupplied from the coastal coal dumps, break through and release Litke and its transports. The failures of 1937 were used as a pretext for replacing the Northern Sea <b>Route</b> <b>management,</b> and at least 673 men fell victims to the Great Purge. The Glavsevmorput was limited to maintaining coastal navigation, its auxiliary function relegated to Dalstroy and other organizations.|$|E
50|$|SCRIBE is a {{decentralized}} publish/subscribe {{system that}} uses Pastry for its underlying <b>route</b> <b>management</b> and host lookup. Users create topics to which other users can subscribe. Once the topic has been created, {{the owner of}} the topic can publish new entries under the topic which will be distributed in a multicast tree to all of the SCRIBE nodes that have subscribed to the topic. The system works by computing the hash of the topic name concatenated with the name of the user who owns the topic. This hash is then used as a Pastry key, and the publisher then routes packets to the nodeclosest to the key using Pastry's routing protocol to create the root node of the topic on that node. People then subscribe to the topic by computing the key from the topic and publisher's name and then using Pastry to route a subscribe message to the topic towards the root node. When the root node receives the subscribe message from another node it adds the node ID to its list of children and begins acting as a forwarder of the topic.|$|E

5000|$|Ekidens {{are usually}} road races, {{and as such}} require {{intensive}} <b>route</b> <b>management</b> and police traffic control. Cross country races can include grass, mud, sand, and steep slopes. Each ekiden competitor runs a different distance, whereas all cross country runners run the same course and start {{at the same time}} [...] Some Japanese high school ekiden stages are longer and some stages are shorter than the [...] "standard" [...] 5000 meters for USA high school cross country (see below). Ekiden competition does not highlight the single individual winner of the race as in cross country, but ekiden analysis does highlight individual fastest runners in each stage; these runners may {{be in the middle of}} the field. Each ekiden runner has to run without reference to his or her own teammates for help in judging pace, whereas cross country team races can include strategies like [...] "pack" [...] running. This same contrast can be made between track and ekiden; only the runners in the first ekiden stage run as a group; later stage runners must judge for themselves the appropriate pace and the decisions to challenge and pass other runners, whose abilities might be significantly different and whose position was determined by the efforts of preceding teammates.|$|E
50|$|The Highways Agency {{declares}} the New Forest A31 section {{as being}} 'an abnormal and heavy load route'. The westbound route, particularly, suffers from poor {{horizontal and vertical}} alignment due to its original function as an old single carriageway. The Highways Agency's <b>route</b> <b>management</b> strategy (RMS) for the A31 has identified that the westbound carriageway needs realigning at Cadnam where it undulates rapidly before negotiating a sharp right turn and passes an at-grade U-turn box, {{though there is no}} timetable for this at present. There is also a pinch point at Ringwood where the A31 interplexes with the A338; the section of road was widened to four lanes each way {{for the duration of the}} A338 interplex (following the upgrade of the Ashley Heath Junction to Bournemouth in the early 1990s) but a short section where westbound A338 traffic joins westbound A31 was left with 2 lanes, and the lack of capacity at this section causes safety problems and queues at peak times. Dorset County Council cites relieving this junction as a high priority in the Bournemouth LTP 2006-2011. In December 2014 the Government announced a series of schemes as part of a £15bn investment in transport infrastructure that included widening the Westbound carriageway to 3 lanes. A Highways Agency review in 2010 records that the collision rate between the A338 Ringwood junction and the Poulner Hill Interchange was 4.5 Personal Injury Collisions (PICs) per 100million vehicle kilometers, whilst the rate for the stretch between Poulner Hill and Picket Post is 11.7 PICs per 100million vehicle kilometers.|$|E
