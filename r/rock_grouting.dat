40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>grouting</b> is {{performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston type pumps are mostly used for high pressure <b>rock</b> <b>grouting.</b> A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this type of pump due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on <b>rock</b> <b>grouting</b> is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston type pump. The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different types of pumps. From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston type pump by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different types of pumps. QC 20121221 </p...|$|E

30|$|There are two {{combination}} {{forms of}} rock bolting and grouting: one is grouting first, then installing rock bolts and cables; another is grouting and bolting {{at the same}} time using pipe grouting bolts, which are not only used as grouting tubes to inject slurry, but also the bolts anchored by slurry. Based on the characteristics of roadways in coal mines, many kinds of grouting bolts have been developed (Wang et al. 2005). For extremely broken rocks, the self-boring grouting bolts have been invented. These bolts are used as boring rods and grouting tubes {{at the same time}}, and provide an effective way {{to solve the problem of}} borehole caving in the extremely broken rocks (Lu 2003). On the basis of the pretension resin cable with small borehole, the cable anchored with resin capsules and grout slurry was developed.

30|$|Under the {{influence}} of extremely weak rock, ground stress and swelling pressures, the roadway deformed to a significant extent, in which floor heave was particularly serious. Steel sets or bolts alone had little effect in controlling roadway deformation. So, a variety of supporting methods, such as closed 36 U-shape steel sets and bolting, a pair of 12 I-beam steel sets and bolting, were tested in situ. Although offering significant support strength, roadways deformed continuously and those supports failed to achieve an ideal effect. Because {{of the presence of}} expansive clay in this extremely weak <b>rock,</b> <b>grouting</b> was unfeasible. So, the alternative was to improve the strength of steel sets, or to improve the strength of bolts, or to improve the strength of both.

40|$|Abstract For many {{applications}} {{data on the}} transmissivity distribution of individual fractures are necessary, i. e., discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling of groundwater flow and transport of solutes in fractured rock and design and performance of <b>rock</b> <b>grouting.</b> Using borehole data from the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory, Sweden, it is shown that evaluated fracture transmissivities from three boreholes at Äspö can be well described by a Pareto or power-law distribution. Evaluated distribution parameters for the three boreholes are similar, which indicates that the Pareto distribution is a robust tool to assess three fracture transmissivity distributions. Using the evaluated distribution parameters random simulations of the original interval test data show that the approximate lognormal distributions of these are reproduced. This strengthens {{the credibility of the}} approach. It is shown how the distribution parameters can be assessed from incomplete data using the properties of the distribution. Finally, Pareto distribution transmissivities also imply Pareto distribution apertures of the fractures...|$|E
30|$|With massive {{coal mines}} {{entering}} {{the stage of}} deep mining, many new issues come out and the reinforcement of soft surrounding rock mass of roadways {{is one of those}} problems. The main issues of reinforcing deep soft rock roadways include high field stress, high temperature, and high water content [1 – 4], thus lead to a loose and broken surrounding <b>rock.</b> Hollow <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts can be employed to improve the mechanical properties of the surrounding rock mass and also provide anchorage in soft rock roadways due to their convenience and fast installation. Hollow <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolt has middle hollow tube design. The middle hollow tube of the rock bolt is used as the high-pressure blast channel and grouting channel. Compared with conventional rock bolts with the same cross-section area, the hollow design can make the rock bolts have better stiffness and shear strength [5]. The external surface of this bolt has threads with large thread pitch. The thread structure is convenient for cutting and lengthening. Compared with smooth rock bolts, the bonding area between the rock bolt and the grouting material is improved, and therefore, the load bearing capacity is improved. Several researches show that the anchorage quality of the <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolt is influenced by shear stress on the interfaces between the <b>rock</b> bolt, the <b>grout,</b> and the surrounding rock mass [6 – 9]. The shear stress mainly relies on the mechanical property of the <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolt, the bond on the interface, and the compaction rate of the surrounding <b>rock</b> mass after <b>grouting</b> [10]. Several researchers studied the anchorage quality based on theoretical analysis and physical research, providing basis and reference for the design of <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts [11, 12]. However, in engineering, detecting the anchorage quality still mainly relies on pullout tests [13]. The limits are that the examination area is narrow and it cannot reflect the whole anchorage quality of the rock mass. Furthermore, pullout tests can ruin the rock bolting system. The mining engineering aims at the digital mining and green mining in the future [14]. Non-destructive detecting technology has the advantages of intelligence, rapidness, and large area detecting. Therefore, this method can be used to study the anchorage quality of hollow <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the contribution of <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts on the stability of concrete dams. The load capacity of the <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts are assessed considering eventual deteriorating processes. An additional objective was to compare the resulting load capacity with the prevailing regulations in RIDAS (the power companies’ guidelines on dam safety) and possibly suggest new guideline values. The literature study consists of two parts; concrete dams and <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts. In the first part concrete dams are discussed and especially the inherent forces and aspects when controlling their stability. The second part treats <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts and the theoretical focus is on their function and possible failure modes {{as well as on}} the degrading processes (primarily corrosion) that are affecting the rock bolts.   Subsequently, the theory was applied on the Swedish concrete buttress dam Storfinnforsen, which is the largest concrete dam in Sweden. The dam was selected for this study mainly because its shape is archetypical for buttress dams. In addition, a digitalized model of the dam was obtainable from previous research projects.   A numerical analysis with the finite element analysis software ABAQUS was performed in order to evaluate the stability of the dam and to support the analytical analysis. The load capacity of the <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts was analytically evaluated with consideration to eventual degradation. Assuming a corrosion rate of 60 μm/year, the <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts in Storfinnforsen could after 100 years be trusted with a load capacity of approximately 180 MPa. That load capacity is due to shear failure, which constitutes the most plausible failure mode for rock bolts in buttress dams. The value 180 MPa is to be seen in contrast to the current limitation of 140 MPa that is defined in RIDAS (2011). The conclusion of this thesis is accordingly, that the maximum allowed load capacity that can be assigned the <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts in the stability calculations of concrete dams can be increased from todays 140 MPa. This conclusion is substantiated by the analytical analyses with the numerical calculations as support...|$|R
40|$|Silica sol is a {{material}} {{that seems to}} fulfill the non-hazardous requirement of final repository and capable of penetrating into narrow fractures. The <b>rock</b> <b>grouting</b> strategy with silica sol has been studied and applied for some recent projects in Sweden. The design methodology {{is based on the}} determination of the distribution of fracture transmissivity and the theoretical penetration length. In 2008, grouting with silica sol was applied in the construction of a short tunnel at 450 m depth in the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Äspö HRL), the TASS-tunnel. In 2010, a grouting experiment with silica sol was performed at a niche of 300 m depth in the Mizunami Underground Research Laboratory, the MIU- 300 -niche. Despite the fact that silica sol has been used for a couple of decades for soil consolidation or sealing of fractures, it has seldom been applied as {{a material}} for <b>rock</b> <b>grouting</b> during tunneling. The purposes of this study are: • Comparing the grouting work with silica sol in TASS-tunnel and MIU- 300 m-niche. • Investigating the applicability of the design method used in TASS-tunnel to the grouting experiment performed in MIU- 300 m-niche. • Suggesting further development of grouting techniques. It was found that although there was quite a difference in the geological conditions and grouting methods, both sites had good sealing quality results. In addition, the Swedish design method seems to be applicable to MIU- 300 m-niche even with the difference in the fracture aperture distribution in each site. Furthermore, the water inflow in a borehole at MIU- 300 m-niche has gradually decreased during the three years. One explanation for this good durability of silica sol can be that the grout penetration created a larger overlap between the boreholes than that achieved in TASS-tunnel. A large penetration length of grout minimizes the risk of erosion and/or dilution of grout, thus creating a durable sealing. It can be suggested that the Swedish method {{can be applied to the}} design and evaluation of the grouting works in Japanese rock with high intensity of fractures. Moreover, the use of Japanese silica sol or an additional overlap and pumping time might improve the grouting quality in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Low pH silica-based grouts {{suitable}} for penetrating fine aperture fractures {{are increasingly being}} developed for use in engineering applications. Silica sol has an initial low viscosity and mixing with an accelerator destabilises the suspension producing a gel. The influence of sodium, calcium and ammonium chloride accelerators on gel time, rate of gelation and shear strength of the resulting gel were investigated in this study. For {{the first time the}} potential use of bacterial ureolysis as an accelerator for the destabilisation of silica sol was also explored. This study demonstrates that bacterial ureolysis can be used to control the gelation of silica sol. The rate of ureolysis increases with increasing bacterial density, resulting in faster gel times and higher rates of gelation. In addition, for grouts with similar gel times, using bacterial ureolysis to induce destabilisation results in a higher rate of gelation, a higher final shear strength and a more uniform gel than direct addition of the corresponding chemical accelerator. These results suggest that bacterial ureolysis could potentially be used in <b>rock</b> <b>grouting</b> to achieve long gel times and hence greater penetration, while also maintaining sufficiently rapid gelation to minimise issues related to fingering and erosion of the fresh grout...|$|E
30|$|Cement based grouts {{are by far}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used for grouting of rock. However, cement is limited by its particle size to enter very fine fractures and underperformes for strict demands on ingress to tunnels. Better penetration can be achieved by using the so called chemical grouts. Generally materials characterized as chemical grouts are polyurethane, epoxy resins, acrylamide, methacrylate and acrylate [2, 3]. Moreover, water glass and a number of composite materials such as polyurethane/water glass [4], epoxy resin/sand [5], acrylamide/sand [6], have also been used as grouting materials. Although, there is lot of experience in controlling the viscosity, achieving the desired penetration length, desired gel time and good sealing of the small cracks or pores by using organic molecules based grouts, the big issue is their toxicity, As shown by Svedrup et al. there was considerable leaching from the acrylamide based grout used in a tunnel in Norway [7]. In Sweden in the swells of environmental catastrophe involving acrylamide based grouting material in Hallandsås tunnel environmental compatibility of grouting material is highly prioritized. Silica nanoparticles are considered to be non-toxic, mainly due to their instability in groundwater, which is of utmost importance for sustainable development [8, 9]. Therefore, in <b>rock</b> <b>grouting</b> silica nanoparticle based grouts can work as alternative to the organic molecules based grouts since high penetrability can be achieved due to the small particle size.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the fracture aperture distribution facilitates design of grouting measures in crystalline rock masses, this since both the penetrability (ability of grout to enter the fractures) and penetration length {{is linked to the}} aperture. This is considered in a design process for <b>rock</b> <b>grouting</b> that has been developed at Chalmers University of Technology. The process suggests that fracture aperture distribution can be estimated based on transmissivity data from hydraulic tests combined with fracture data from boreholes. However, hydraulic tests seldom contain information that can be linked to individual fractures and measurement data need to be further processed using probability distributions. To resemble a rock mass where few fractures dominate the flow Fransson suggested the use of a Pareto distribution and combinatorics to estimate transmissivity of individual fractures. A freely available computational tool for the statistical analyses based on this concept with Pareto distributed fractures was developed previously. The purpose of the tool is to process field data and create probability distributions that can be used as input to grouting design and approximate tunnel leakage estimates. The methodology has been developed with tunnel data, which sofar has been the main application. For dam and open cut grouting, with higher proportions of surficial rock the validity of the connectivity assumptions may need to be investigated. This paper briefly present the design process and calculation tool in its context using real datasets from a Swedish tunneling project, to provide advice on usage and to give examples of pitfalls in data collection...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the sealing efficiency in <b>rock</b> <b>grouting,</b> the fractures should be entirely grouted while the filtration of cement particles is an obstacle. By reducing the filtration, penetrability of grout will be increased resulting in a more reliable grouting. Some {{of the advantages of}} controlling filtration are decreas in time, costs and the environmental impacts of the projects. Increase in the safety margins of the projects during both the construction and the operation are also among the benefits of regulating the filtration. Use of variable pressure for improving grout penetrability has been studied in both the lab and the field over the years. The focus of the previous investigations was mainly on application of high frequency oscillating pressure using artificial parallel plates without constrictions with openning sizes larger than 100 μm. The mechanism of improvement of grout penetrability was interpreted as reduction in viscosity due to the oscillation in all those studies. The missing parts of the resulted knowledge are the influences of different shapes of the variable pressure and the effects of low frequencies i. e. longer cycle periods to penetrate through micro fractures smaller than 100 μm with constrictions. Moreover, other mechanisms of improvement of grout penetrability might also be more efficient than reduction in viscosity due to the oscillation. The focus of this study is therefore to investigat the influence of low frequency instantaneous variable pressure with different peak and rest periods on regulating the filtration. A pneumatic pressure control system has been thus employed using parallel plates with constrictions of 43 and 30 μm. The proposed mechanism of action was change of flow pattern due to the change in pressure and the corresponding velocity. Comparison of results of the variable and the constant pressures revealed the great impact of the examined variable pressure on improving grout penetrability. QC 20171218 </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>grouting</b> is a {{commonly}} used process for sealing rocks in tunnels to reduce water ingress. In {{order to achieve}} sufficient sealing level the grout must effectively penetrate into rock fractures while the limiting factor is filtration of cement based grout. Many devices and measuring methods {{have been developed to}} study filtration and to measure the penetrability. The filter pump and the penetrability meter are two of the most commonly used instruments for measuring filtration tendency in the field and in the lab, while short slot is used mainly in the lab. The results obtained from these devices have relatively different estimations of the penetrability partly due to the weaknesses in measuring methods and test procedures. Furthermore, there are no clear criteria to find out which of the results are closer to the reality or how much the results differ among these instruments. The aim of this study is comparing, and evaluating the results of these devices in relatively similar conditions while using more accurate methods of weight-time and pressure-time compared to the less reliable total volume method. The filter pump and the penetrability meter were modified In order to fulfill the requirement of testing in similar conditions and to improve their accuracy and versatility. The results show that increasing the pressure improves the penetrability significantly. The modification of the filter pump results in reducing many uncertainties related to the testing procedure. Probably the modified filter pump has higher accuracy in measuring the penetrability compared to regular filter pump. The short slot has the highest accuracy in estimating penetrability of cement based grout especially at higher pressures, furthermore, the short slot provides a more flexible way to measure penetrability with different pressures in the range of 1 - 15 bars...|$|E

40|$|Grouting is used {{to change}} the {{physical}} characteristics of concrete, soil and rock. The changes are usually related to permeability and/or strength. Although {{the most widely used}} grout for sealing of rock masses is cement suspension, there are certain conditions where polyurethane grout is used as a complement. The most favourable property in this respect is that such grouts react with water and expand due to exertion of carbon dioxide gas (CO 2). Other important features of these grouts are the time dependency, the flow behaviour of unreacted as well as reacting polyurethane, and the physical influence of the carbon dioxide. The scope of this research was to study the typical behaviour of polyurethane grouts in order to explain why the grouting result has been unsatisfactory at times, while mostly successful where other grouts have failed. A comprehensive laboratory test programme was performed, including simple expansion tests, where the general characteristics of polyurethane grouts were studied, as well as a series of pipe flow tests. The latter tests comprised grouting of polyurethane against static groundwater pressure and into flowing water. The performance of polyurethane grouting in a field situation was also investigated with a test at the Röda Sten Rock Laboratory in Göteborg. The study resulted in conclusions and recommendations for the application of polyurethane for <b>rock</b> <b>grouting.</b> The main conclusion regarding the practical use of such grouts is that a volume criterion, in combination with an awareness of the time dependency of the gelling of the material, is useful for achieving an optimal sealing result. When grouting into flowing groundwater, a sufficiently high grouting pressure should be used in order to cut off the water flow and facilitate grout penetration upstream. The CO 2 gas generated in the reaction between polyurethane and water, contributes to the grout penetration in two ways: (i) by causing a volume expansion, and (ii) by increasing the pressure behind the front of the reacting polyurethane grout...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{foundation}} preparations {{during construction}} of the Wolf Creek Dam concrete masonry section precluded {{the need for additional}} rehabilitation to mitigate seepage through karstic limestone bedrock. Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River in southern Kentucky has become well known for karst related seepage issues underneath the embankment section, and yet has had little to no seepage issues associated with the concrete masonry portion of the dam. Post-construction efforts to control seepage underneath the embankment began in 1967 and 1968. Emergency grouting commenced and continued through 1970. Between 1975 and 1979 a more permanent solution of a concrete diaphragm cut-off wall was constructed through the centerline of the left portion of the embankment section down to competent bedrock. The wall interrupted the progression of foundation erosion, but post construction monitoring, instrumentation readings, and persistent wet areas downstream showed that seepage paths under or around the wall continued. A second cut-off wall upstream of the first was constructed between 2007 and 2013, extending nearly {{the entire length of the}} embankment and up to 75 feet (22. 9 m) deeper than the original wall. Cost of the second wall and other concurrent rehabilitation efforts reached nearly $ 600 million. Exploratory grouting beneath the concrete masonry section of the dam in 2012 resulted in low grout volume takes, so no further remediation efforts below the masonry dam were conducted. The original construction photographs and foundation reports for the concrete masonry section of Wolf Creek Dam instill confidence that the designers and builders of the monoliths took adequate, if not excessive measures to ensure that all the monoliths were founded on competent bedrock. These measures included extensive borehole investigations both prior to and during excavation, efforts to locate, delineate, remove, and clean all karst solution channels, the removal of all loose <b>rock,</b> <b>grouting</b> in the foundation and side vertical faces, large stair-step faces on the left abutment, extended excavations to remove soft beds, final manual cleaning of rock surfaces, and the careful documentation of foundation preparations. These measures do not guarantee that seepage issues will not develop under the concrete dam over time, but they do show with reasonable certainty that the monoliths were originally founded on competent bedrock, and that future seepage issues are either unlikely or will be significantly inhibited by the preparation made to the foundation prior to the {{construction of the}} concrete monoliths...|$|E

Attempts should be conducted {{on the scale of}} the wavelet transform to decompose the original signals collected by the signal collector to find the optimal character points. Experiment results certify that low-pass filters of 5 scale in wavelet transform can be used to easily distinguish the interface between the free part and grouted part. High-pass filters with 5 scale can be used to identify the defect character point position and the end of anchorage part. The research results can provide an experimental basement for further developing non-destructive detecting technology and methods for hollow <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts.|$|R

This formula reflects the complex grouting process in a simple way. And the orthogonal experiment {{results indicate that the}} factors affecting grouting pressure are the permeability of <b>rock</b> mass, <b>grout</b> viscosity, and grouting pump flow. Based on the empirical formula, and according to the achievement in fluid mechanics, this paper further studies and proposes the empirical formula of grouting pressure influenced by pipelines 1...|$|R

30|$|Hollow <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolts {{are widely}} used in deep soft rock roadways. The density of grout has a {{significant}} influence on the anchorage quality. However, {{there is still a}} lack of effective methods to detect the grouting quality fast, accurately, and extensively. Based on the wave velocity and the law of stress wave transmission and reflection in the impedance mismatch, non-destructive experiment focused on the defect in the anchorage was conducted. The wavelet transform was used to analyze the test signals. The test results show that the free length of hollow <b>grouted</b> <b>rock</b> bolt could be accurately detected through the analysis of the stress wave signal by using the low-pass filter in the wavelet toolbox. The grouted length, defect length, and specific position of the anchorage section can be accurately detected through the analysis of the stress wave signal by using the high-pass filter in the wavelet toolbox. The research can provide experiment foundation for further study of grouting quality based on the non-destructive methods.|$|R
