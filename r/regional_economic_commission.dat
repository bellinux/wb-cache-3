40|$|This {{issue of}} the Bulletin deals with road safety, which has become an urgent {{worldwide}} problem. Given the fact that road accidents are increasing, that they affect the planet's most vulnerable population (namely the lowest income groups in developing countries) {{and that this is}} becoming a genuine public health crisis, the United Nations has decided that it is urgent to address the matter. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore dedicated the World Health Day 2004 to road safety. Given the urgent need for action, the Chiefs of Transport of the five <b>Regional</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Commissions</b> of the United Nations held a meeting in Geneva (September 2004), where they agreed to reinforce the studies and projects carried out in this area.

40|$|This volume {{explores the}} case for and the {{prospects}} {{of the development of}} world-regional social policies as integral elements of a pluralistic, equitable and effective system of global governance. Focusing on transnational regionalism, this book examines the trajectory and crossing over of the three strands of scholarly analysis within the past decade which have given rise to this volume: the perceived negative impact of neo-liberal globalisation upon national social policy; the need for but the difficulty of securing reforms in the institutions of global social governance; and the increasing salience of the world-regional level of governance in handling cross-border issues. The authors develop an intellectual and research agenda that will also inform the political development of an international programme concerned with the social policy dimensions of regional governance. Combining the perspectives and collective expertise of a team of international scholars and activists, the book features: •Theoretical and policy cases for a focus on regionalism and social policy •A mapping and analysis of social policy dimensions of regional integration processes and formations in four continents •An assessment of the regional dimensions of global agencies, in particular of the UN (ILO, WHO, UNESCO, UNDP) including the approach to regional social policy of the UN <b>Regional</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Commissions</b> and Development Banks •An articulation of a multi-levelled conceptualisation of global social governance within which regional associations of countries plays a significant part.

40|$|Many of the {{environmental}} problems we face today are increasingly complex in nature and widespread in extent, and cut across national boundaries or are of global scale in their effects. But they are rarely truly global in their causes or sources. Even the so-called global environmental problems are rooted in human activities taking place at local and national levels, and therefore best dealt with at those levels closest to the source, {{rather than at the}} global level, although in most cases they do simultaneously require some kind of regulatory action and/or cooperative effort at international levels. (Commonly referred to as the “subsidiarity principle” in international law / international relations vernacular.) However, this does not negate the importance of regional approaches to dealing with problems of the environment commonly shared by countries within a geographical or economic/geopolitical region. Among the various United Nations bodies, UNEP has long recognized the importance of this regional approach, and established regional offices in each of the five regions of the world where the UN <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>commissions</b> are located, and assisted them in setting up environmental coordinating units (all of which have by now become fully established and incorporated into the institutional structure of the regional commissions.) The Regional Seas Programme has been hailed {{as one of the greatest}} achievements of UNEP to date. In the Asia-Pacific region, a “Regional Strategy for Environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development (ESSD) ” was adopted at the second Ministerial Conference of ESCAP in 1991, followed five years later by the adoption of the “Regional Action Programme (RAP), 1996 - 2000 ” at the third Ministerial Conference. Because of the vastness and diversity of the region in terms of geography, topography, climatic, ecological, and other natural conditions as well as differences in socio-cultural, economic and political systems, intergovernmental initiatives for environmental cooperation were first taken at the subregional level, starting with the adoption of the ASEAN Sub-regional Environment Programme (ASEP) in 1977, followed by the establishment of the South Asi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>economic</b> {{development}} {{has become a}} widely popular research subject within economics and economic geography. The rise of the 'new economic geography' in economics and the recent development in economic geography with (among others) institutional, evolutionary and relational 'turns' have introduced {{a considerable number of}} new conceptual and theoretical instruments that can be utilised in the analysis of regional development. The variety of different approaches has certainly produced many positive outcomes for the discipline and the picture of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> {{development has}} emerged. Yet, {{at the same time the}} field of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development studies has become somewhat fragmented. While researchers are working with some special theoretical frameworks and while they are concentrating on some specific issues, the general view of the <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development remains fuzzy. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to illustrate prospects for examining <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development in a broader scope. The theoretical basis for the study is derived from institutional economic geography and political economy. It is argued that <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development process should be understood as a multi-level dynamic spatial process where different institutional, economic and political development paths interconnect and interact. The enquiring of these paths and their underlying mechanisms in detail deepens and diversifies the understanding of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development process. The empirical part of the study concentrates on the different paths and institutional settings that have contributed to the <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development within the national borders of Finland. Although the research subject is a nation state, open system methodology is employed and relational aspects of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development are recognised. By exposing the driving mechanisms of regional development process and by investigating their implications at different spatial scales a comprehensive view of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development in Finland is obtained...|$|R
