Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Both Owumi and Niang, due to their appearance, were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and then imprisoned in solitary confinement for two hours.
