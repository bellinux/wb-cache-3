30|$|We {{found that}} {{large numbers of}} packets being dropped, {{especially}} during the <b>relay</b> <b>process,</b> has an adverse effect on the gain because of the large overhead associated with sending relay packets (if a packet is dropped, we use up {{a lot of time on}} both the primary and secondary channels only to have the <b>relay</b> <b>process</b> fail). In addition, the relatively large number of packets required to accomplish a relayed transmission (7, compared to just 2 for a direct transmission) makes it more likely that something will go wrong during the process. However, as the results show, we can design our protocol to choose sufficiently conservative power thresholds for each data rate so that the probability of packets being dropped is low enough that it does not adversely affect our results.|$|E

40|$|In a new {{paradigm}} of the decentralized traffic information system as a recent thrust in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), vehicles form ad hoc mobile networks, and information may be propagated between vehicles through wireless communication with a short transmission range. Fundamental to the system design is effective information propagation. In this paper, we study information propagation along a traffic stream on which presence of equipped vehicles follows an independent homogeneous Poisson process. We define a <b>relay</b> <b>process</b> in which only the furthest equipped vehicle within each transmission range continues the relay, and model it as a transient Markov process. We present closed form formulas for the expected value and variance of propagation distance in the case without transmission delay. We also study the expected number of relays and the expected propagation distance in the case with transmission delay. The results make transparent the relationship between propagation distance, equipped vehicle density and transmission range. In addition, we study the probability distribution of propagation distance, and find that the Gamma distribution {{could be used as}} a good practical means of approximation especially when the number of equipped vehicles is large within a transmission range. The Gamma-like behavior is also observed on heterogeneous traffic. It is noted that the <b>relay</b> <b>process</b> has many other applications as well. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} game-theoretic {{approach in}} this paper adopts a proactive opportunistic <b>relaying</b> <b>process.</b> As the name implies, opportunistic relaying selects the best relay according to different relay selection criteria among all candidate relays to forward the signal between the source and the destination [14]. An opportunistic <b>relaying</b> <b>process</b> consists of two time slots. In the first time slot, the source broadcasts the signal which could be heard by all relay nodes in its radio coverage and the destination; in the second time slot, if the signal received by the selected relay node could be decoded successfully, it would be forwarded to the destination; the destination then combines the received signal from the source and selected relay to recover the information sent from the source. The source selects the best relay before transmitting {{the data from the}} source to the destination [15]. There is no requirement on all intermediate relays to listen to the source’s broadcasting except for the selected relay; thus, power or energy spent by unselected relays on listening to the channel and receiving the message sent by the source is saved. There are three proactive diversity schemes: fixed selective decode-and-forward (FSDF) with direct link combining, FSDF without direct link combining, and smart selective decode-and-forward [16].|$|R

This notion is based on the diverse neurone composition and highly ordered structure of the nucleus, on the complex electrophysiological properties and activity patterns of the neurones, on the activity of local and descending modulatory mechanisms and on the presence of a highly sophisticated intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis. This review puts emphasis on introducing the experimental findings supporting the above statements and on the questions which should be answered in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the function of the cochlear nucleus...|$|E

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of high-end mobile devices that feature wireless interfaces, many promising applications are enabled in opportunistic networks. In contrary to traditional networks, opportunistic networks utilize the mobility of nodes to relay messages in a store-carry-forward paradigm. Thus, the <b>relay</b> <b>process</b> in opportunistic networks faces several practical challenges in terms of delay and delivery rate. In this paper, we propose a novel P 2 P Query algorithm, namely Betweenness Centrality Forwarding (PQBCF), for opportunistic networking. PQBCF adopts a forwarding metric called Betweenness Centrality (BC), which is borrowed from social network, to quantify the active degree of nodes in the networks. In PQBCF, nodes with a higher BC are preferable to serve as relays, leading to higher query success rate and lower query delay. A comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms reveals that PQBCF can provide better performance on both the query success Ratio and query delay, and approaches the performance of Epidemic Routing (ER) with much less resource consumption...|$|E
40|$|Fgf signaling, {{mediated}} {{in part by}} {{the transcription}} factor Brachyury/Xbra/Ntl, plays important roles in mesoderm formation during the early development of vertebrate embryos. We have identi®ed a zebra®sh gene, spr 2, which encodes a member of the Sp 1 -like transcription factor family. spr 2 is expressed in both hypoblast and epiblast cells during late blastulation/ early gastrulation, and in some mesodermal and neural tissues at later stages. Injection with spr 2 mRNA enhances ntl expression and alleviates the inhibitory effect on ntl of XFD, a Xenopus dominant-negative FGF receptor. In contrast, morpholino-mediated knockdown of Spr 2 activity inhibits ntl expression and reduces the inductive effect of Fgfs on ntl. We also demonstrate that Fgf signaling relays mesoderm induction activity of Nodal signaling and Spr 2 is involved in this signal <b>relay</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, the correct spatial expression of spr 2 requires Nodal, Fgf and Wnt signals. We suggest that expression of spr 2 is an immediate-early response to mesoderm induction by Fgfs, which in turn regulates the expression of effector genes involved in the development of mesodermal tissues...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a network where each route comprises a backlogged source, {{a number of}} relays and a destination at a finite distance. The locations of the sources and the relays are realizations of independent Poisson point processes. Given that the nodes observe a TDMA/ALOHA MAC protocol, our objective {{is to determine the}} number of relays and their placement such that the mean end-to-end delay in a typical route of the network is minimized. We first study an idealistic network model where all routes have the same number of hops, the same distance per hop and their own dedicated relays. Combining tools from queueing theory and stochastic geometry, we provide a precise characterization of the mean end-to-end delay. We find that the delay is minimized if the first hop is much longer than the remaining hops and that the optimal number of hops scales sublinearly with the source-destination distance. Simulating the original network scenario reveals that the analytical results are accurate, provided that the density of the <b>relay</b> <b>process</b> is sufficiently large. We conclude that, given the considered MAC protocol, our analysis provides a delay-minimizing routing strategy for random, multihop networks involving a small number of hops...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{admission}} control mechanism for QoS-enabled opportunistic routing protocols.

[23] which proposes a ticket-based mechanism for resource allocation. Their idea is extended by considering the characteristics of the opportunistic routing paradigm. It differs from the previous work because each node uses all possible connections to its descendent nodes instead of limiting it to just a subset of descendent neighbors, allowing growth in resource reservation.|$|R

In order to solve this problem, a two-way relaying approach has been considered in [7 – 9]. In a typical two-way relaying scheme, the communication is completed in two steps. First, the transmitters send their symbols to two relays, simultaneously. Upon receiving the signals, each <b>relay</b> <b>processes</b> them based on an efficient relaying scheme to produce new signals.

As an application, we present exact analytical expressions of these parameters in an amplify-and-forward relaying system with selection diversity and diamond topology over Rayleigh fading channels.
