50|$|David Victor Canter (born 5 January 1944) is a psychologist. He {{began his}} career as an {{architectural}} psychologist studying the interactions between people and buildings, publishing and providing consultancy on the designs of offices, schools, prisons, housing and other building forms as well as exploring how people made sense of the large scale environment, notably cities. He set up the Journal of Environmental Psychology in 1980. His work in architecture led to studies of human <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>fires</b> and other emergencies. He wrote about investigative psychology in Britain. He helped police in 1985 on the Railway Rapist case. He was the Professor of Psychology at the University of Surrey for ten years, where he developed investigative psychology described in detail in Investigative Psychology: Offender Profiling and the Analysis of Criminal Action and a course curriculum. He set up and was Director of the Centre For Investigative Psychology which is based at the University of Liverpool. Since 2009 he has been at the University of Huddersfield where he is the Director of the International Research Centre in Investigative Psychology. He is the {{founder and director of the}} International Academy for Investigative Psychology, an academy for researchers seeking to apply social science to investigative and legal processes.|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} code has been {{developed}} at the University of Sheffield to simulate the structural response of steel and composite framed buildings subjected to fire. The steel skeleton is represented using two-noded line elements, the steel-to-steel connections using spring elements and the flooring system by isotropic flat shell elements. Structures are therefore considered as a complete entity, allowing a more realistic prediction of structural behaviour at elevated temperature. A series of numerical simulations of fire tests carried out on the full-scale, eight-storey composite frame at the BRE laboratory at Cardington in 1995 and 1996 have been conducted. These tests {{have been subject to}} a number of significant parametric studies including slab thickness and secondary beam connection strength and stiffness. The concrete floor slab element has also been extended to a layered flat shell element allowing the inclusion of material non-linearities, thermal bowing, thermal degradation, anisotropic properties and a more advanced cracking model. Using the new concrete floor slab element the Cardington fire tests have been simulated in detail, to further understanding of the structural <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> <b>fire.</b> Another series of parametric studies have been conducted considering again the thickness of the floor slab, the effect of the slab temperature gradient, the compressive strength, tensile strength and load ratios. These have all been compared to results from the Cardington fire tests. Current design methods based on isolated element design are considered by comparing the results of analyses in which the concrete floor is either included as a continuous slab in an extensive subframe, or is treated simply as forming the flanges of composite beams in a three-dimensional skeleton. These examples show clearly the effects of membrane and bridging actions of the continuous floor slab. The implications for future design developments are discussed with particular reference to the parametric studies conducted...|$|R

Moreover, a probabilistic description method of pre-evacuation human behavior concerning psychological process <b>in</b> <b>fires</b> is proposed <b>in</b> this paper for an exploration. The results may assist in completing the theory of human psychological reactions and emergency behaviors in pre- evacuation time of fire situations, and also providing scientific reference for those coping with unconventional emergencies and developing the measures of intervention...|$|R
40|$|Most energy {{studies on}} the {{traditional}} ceramic manufacturing process focus on the firing stage {{because this is the}} process stage that consumes the greatest amount of thermal energy. At present in Europe, using typical technologies, about 50 % of the energy input <b>in</b> the <b>firing</b> stage is still lost through the kiln stacks. A key issue in energy studies is the accurate determination of the energy efficiency of the process, an issue that may become crucial in coming years to enable the energy management of different facilities and products to be compared. To reliably determine energy efficiency, accurate determination is required of the energy needed for the necessary physico-chemical transformations to develop in the material <b>in</b> the <b>firing</b> stage. This energy is also the only strictly unrecoverable energy, as the energy contained in other streams could, potentially at least, be partly recoverable. The present study was undertaken to develop an analytical methodology for estimating the heat of reaction of seven different traditional ceramic products, involving a broad spectrum of compositions, with peak firing temperatures ranging from 850 oC to 1200 oC. The following industrial ceramic compositions were studied: four ceramic tile compositions (red-body stoneware tile, porcelain tile, red-body earthenware wall tile, and white-body earthenware wall tile); two structural ceramics compositions (white brick and roof tile), and a porcelain tableware composition. To estimate the energy involved <b>in</b> the physico-chemical <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> the <b>firing</b> stage, an analytical methodology was developed, based on the mineralogy data of the unfired body composition and on the enthalpy of formation of the minerals <b>in</b> the <b>fired</b> tiles.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the expansion of fire seals and fire stoppers will be dependent on the heat exposure. Standardized methods for classification includes exposure to a rapid heat exposure of the product that is tested, but this might not always be the worst case scenario for the product. In this paper a series of tests are presented in order to study how a graphite based intumescing system, intended for cavities, reacts when subjected to fire conditions different form that in the standardised method EN 1366 - 4. Two different experimental setups, a cone calorimeter at Lund University and a small-scale furnace at SP Fire Technology, were used in the tests. The start of expansion <b>reaction</b> <b>in</b> the tested <b>fire</b> stopper was around 180 °C. The start of reaction temperature is rather independent of the incident heat flux, while expansion rate is clearly dependent on the incident heat flux. Furthermore, the studied fire stopper performed well in the small-scale furnace because the graphite expanded enough to give the same protection, although it is preheated or wet, as when subjected to a heat exposure similar to ISO 834. These results are good but they are only considered valid for the studied system and for the given situation. Future research is needed in order to study how other types of intumescing fire protection systems work when subjected to realistic fire environments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSmouldering {{combustion}} is {{the driving}} phenomenon of wildfire in peatlands, like those causing haze episodes in Southeast Asia and Northeast Europe. These are the largest fires on Earth and an extensive source of greenhouse gases, but poorly understood, becoming an emerging research topic in climate-change mitigation. In this work, a series of multistep heterogeneous kinetics are investigated to describe the drying and decomposition in smouldering combustion of peat. The decomposition schemes cover a range of complexity, including 2, 3 or 4 -step schemes, and up to 4 solid pseudo-species. The schemes aim to describe the simultaneous pyrolysis and oxidation <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> smouldering <b>fires.</b> The <b>reaction</b> rates are expressed by Arrhenius law, and a lumped model of mass loss is used to simulate the degradation behaviour seen during thermogravimetric (TG) experiments in both nitrogen and air atmospheres. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve the corresponding inverse problem using TG data from the literature, and find the best kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for four types of boreal peat from different geographical locations (North China, Scotland and Siberia). The results show that at the TG level, all proposed schemes seem to perform well, {{with a high degree}} of agreement resulting from the forced optimization in the inverse problem approach. The chemical validity of the schemes is then investigated outside the TG realm and incorporated into a 1 -D plug-flow model to study the reaction and the species distribution inside a peat smouldering front. Both lateral and in-depth spread modes are considered. The results show that the drying sub-front is essential, and that the best kinetics is the 4 -step decomposition (one pyrolysis, and three oxidations) plus 1 -step drying with 5 condensed species (water, peat, α-char, β-char, and ash). This is the first time that the smouldering kinetics and the reaction-zone structure of a peat fire are explained and predicted, thus helping to understand this important natural and widespread phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>fire</b> simulations, one of {{the most}} {{critical}} challenges is the incorporation of detailed chemical description for the combustion process where intermediate chemical products are formed through a series of elementary reactions. It is essential to apply a comprehensive reaction scheme that fully describes the oxidation processes of the parent fuel and the formation processes of major intermediate chemical species. A novel in-house fire field model based on Large Eddy Simulations (LES) approach incorporating fully coupled subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence, combustion, soot formation and radiation models for the interactive and non-linear nature of the turbulent reacting flow <b>in</b> compartment <b>fire</b> phenomena has been developed in this dissertation. It uniquely embraces the detailed reaction mechanisms for the chemical processes involved during combustion. Since the modelling of hydrocarbons by-products are enabled when considering the full chemical profile, the formation of soot particles can be related to the concentration of main incipient such as acetylene, which provides an appropriate representation of nucleation, surface growth processes. Furthermore, two alternative SGS turbulence models: Vreman model (VM) and Wall-Adapting Local Eddy Viscosity model (WALEM) are incorporated and examined for compartment fire simulations. Parametric studies have been performed in two large-scale compartment fire tests. It is found that the turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers of 0. 3 respectively and the Smagorinsky constant of 0. 2 should be applied to correctly model the flow and thermal diffusivities. Furthermore, temperature and velocity field predications accuracies are enhanced using WALEM, owing to the wall adaptive features and the consideration of both strain and rotational rates of the turbulent field. The importance of incorporating the detailed <b>reaction</b> mechanisms <b>in</b> compartment <b>fire</b> simulations has been confirmed by comparing with experiments. It is discovered that species concentrations especially CO 2 and CO are more accurately predicted by the detailed scheme comparing to the multi-step scheme, since the formation of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are considered.

Updates to a previous mechanism were made by the addition and modification of <b>reactions</b> <b>in</b> the mechanism for a more complete description of the recombination <b>reactions.</b> <b>In</b> this work, the laminar flame speed is measured experimentally and calculated numerically for a premixed propane/air flame, under a range of equivalence ratios, undoped and doped with dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). A detailed investigation of the catalytic cycles involved in the recombination of key flame radicals is made for two equivalence ratios, lean and rich. From this, the importance of different catalytic cycles involved in the lean versus rich case is discussed. Although the importance of certain cycles is different under different stoichiometries, the OPCs are similarly effective across the range, demonstrating the robustness of OPCs as flame suppressants. In addition, it is shown that the phosphorus compounds are most active in the high temperature region of the flame. This may, in part, explain their high level of inhibition effectiveness. 1...|$|R
