5|$|The {{extension}} runs {{in its own}} <b>right-of-way</b> on a route {{similar to}} that of the Dulles Access Road, running both at grade and via aerial structures. The only significant diversions from the access road route are for the stops in Tysons Corner and at Dulles International Airport, where the Metro is currently planned to alternate between subway and elevated track to maintain the exclusive <b>right-of-way.</b>|$|E
5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a few hundred meters (yards) from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the <b>right-of-way</b> is an overgrown path. From Egge to Muggerud, the <b>right-of-way</b> is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the <b>right-of-way</b> from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street, {{although most of the}} <b>right-of-way</b> north of Rønning has disappeared, as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling. The station area at Svangstand in intact, with the station building looking just like it did in 1904. Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{expected}} {{rapid growth}} in the northwestern reaches of the metropolitan area, long-term regional highway plans include acquisition of <b>right-of-way</b> for eventual future expansion of SR 74 to a controlled-access freeway.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{railroad}} <b>rights-of-way</b> (ROW or R/O/W) {{are generally}} considered private property by the respective railroad owners and by applicable state laws. Most U.S. railroads employ their own police forces, who can arrest and prosecute trespassers found on their <b>rights-of-way.</b> Some railroad <b>rights-of-way</b> include recreational rail trails.|$|R
40|$|Municipal <b>rights-of-way</b> are {{essential}} to the health, safety, transportation, communications and economic development of a community. They accommodate pedestrian and vehicular traffic, shade trees and other beautification, traffic signals and signs, street lights, electric wires, telephone, cable television, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water mains, gas lines and pipelines. Management of the municipal <b>rights-of-way</b> is therefore a process of balancing essential and competing demands on the same property. To protect {{the health and safety of}} our communities, as well as to protect the existing facilities of local government and other <b>rights-of-way</b> users, municipal governments must have the ability to ensure the efficient use of municipal <b>rights-of-way</b> through the development of effective policies and management practices, including the ability to levy fees to recovery costs and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of these municipal <b>rights-of-way</b> by utility and telecommunication companies...|$|R
50|$|ORV use is {{restricted}} to the designated multi-use trails. Trail direction is marked with red arrows. Pipelines, powerlines, and other utility <b>rights-of-way</b> are closed to ORV use; however, crossing of these <b>rights-of-way</b> is permitted at designated locations.|$|R
5|$|NY5 heads {{southeast}} {{from the}} village of Caledonia, paralleling the former <b>right-of-way</b> of an Erie–Lackawanna Railroad branch line that connected the villages of Caledonia and Avon as it heads through spacious fields containing little more than farmland. At a rural intersection controlled by single-head flashing traffic signals west of Avon, NY5 meets US20 for the second time. The routes embark on a second concurrency, merging onto the <b>right-of-way</b> of NY5 as they cross the Genesee River and enter both the town and village of Avon.|$|E
5|$|Scenic {{points along}} the road {{included}} Mule Shoe Curve, the trestles and cut at Sandy Gap Bend, and the high bluffs along the <b>right-of-way</b> at Butcher Knife Point.|$|E

25|$|But on August 8, {{the state}} of Virginia {{abandoned}} its plans and agreed to begin work on the northern route for Lee Boulevard. For nearly a year, state and county officials had disagreed whether the northern route <b>rights-of-way</b> were adequate to begin construction. The state disagreed, but Arlington County officials {{did not wish to}} spend more money {{in the depths of the}} Great Depression to acquire more <b>rights-of-way.</b> By actively reconsidering the southern route, however, {{the state of}} Virginia put pressure on Arlington County to fix the <b>rights-of-way</b> problems with the northern route. Agreement to begin construction on the northern route finally was reached on August 8. The state of Virginia agreed to provide $83,450 to purchase the remaining required <b>rights-of-way.</b> Arlington County provided another $21,122.|$|R
5|$|Consequently, {{within a}} wild area, no new {{permanent}} camp leases, mines, wells, roads, or <b>rights-of-way</b> for utility lines are allowed, although existing camps, roads, and <b>rights-of-way</b> may remain. Vehicles are allowed only on public roads; trails {{are limited to}} hikers, bicyclists, equestrians, and wheelchairs, and only primitive camping by backpackers is allowed. Quehanna has two paved roads open to vehicles, and is crossed by <b>rights-of-way</b> for three electrical power lines and two natural gas pipelines. It {{is one of the}} largest areas in Pennsylvania without permanent inhabitants.|$|R

5|$|After the {{completion}} to Nesttun, {{the line was}} exteneded southwards to Rådal at Lagunen Storsenter. Construction began in January 2011, on its own <b>right-of-way</b> parallel to the existing road;, the track was completed in October 2012. The first test run to Lagunen was conducted on 6 December 2012, and the line was {{opened to the public}} on 22 June 2013.|$|E
5|$|I-155 {{was created}} to replace Illinois Route 121 (abbreviated IL121). Prompted by safety {{concerns}} at a major intersection near Morton, state transportation officials replaced the entire route with a limited-access freeway. The interstate was built in several segments from 1970 to 1992, a period that included a ten-year delay due to a lawsuit over <b>right-of-way.</b> I-155 fully opened to traffic on October 29,1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{a section}} {{bypassing}} Morrisburg was opened to accommodate traffic displaced from {{a portion of}} Highway2 through The Lost Villages of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Highway 2 would ultimately be reopened on a new alignment which followed the CN rail <b>right-of-way.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because some {{populations have}} become {{established}} in road <b>right-of-ways</b> and ditches, {{it is important}} to check road ditches before mowing or construction. This ensures no populations that have established in road <b>right-of-ways</b> are destroyed. Simply not mowing an area of roadside will not detract from the aesthetics of an area, and will protect valuable individuals/populations.|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this Native Plant Community Policy {{is to provide}} {{guidance}} for the identification, care, and preservation of native remnants/restorations and reconstructions (including prairies, woodlands, wetlands, and mixtures of these communities) in Johnson County’s <b>right-of-ways,</b> and to provide objective criteria for evaluating and ranking these communities. This policy addresses any roadway <b>right-of-ways</b> managed by the Secondary Road Department, and activities performed either by County personnel or by private individuals or companies seeking permits to work therein. Furthermore, this policy allows the incorporation of fact-based native-vegetation-related considerations into daily decision-making processes related to the ongoing maintenance of roads and utilities (including ditch maintenance), the siting and construction of roads and utilities, and other public uses of roadside <b>right-of-ways.</b> Although routine activities of private landowners in the <b>right-of-ways</b> are not regulated by county policies, these individuals are also encouraged to consider the suggestions made in the managemen...|$|R
5|$|NY30 {{historically}} followed School Street {{through the}} village of Mayfield. The new routing has it heading toward Riceville, where NY30A rejoins NY30. Here, the Adirondack Trail begins as NY30 turns right, following the <b>right-of-way</b> of NY30A into Adirondack Park shortly before entering Mayfield.|$|E
5|$|Newhall granted <b>right-of-way</b> to Southern Pacific Railroad {{to build}} a rail line to Los Angeles and sold them {{a portion of the}} land, upon which sprang a new town that the company named after him, Newhall. Another town grew around the train station and Newhall named it after his hometown, Saugus.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a <b>right-of-way</b> for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal <b>right-of-way</b> for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Unionville, {{the route}} slowly bends to the northeast, {{paralleling}} the former <b>right-of-way</b> of the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad (MNJ) as it runs northwest through farmlands. At the far {{eastern end of}} the hamlet of Waterloo Mills, the highway also begins to follow Rutgers Creek. The waterway, the former railroad <b>right-of-way</b> and the road take similar paths to the hamlet of Westtown, where NY284 serves as the main northsouth route through the community. It passes Lockenhurst Pond {{in the southern part}} of the hamlet before meeting CR1 near Art Fords Lake. Past Westtown, NY284 winds its way northeastward across another rural part of Minisink, intersecting CR62 and CR22 at back-to-back junctions near the northern town line. The latter route provides access to the hamlet of Johnson, which NY284 bypasses to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the Hanlon Expressway, Hanlon Road existed as far north as College Avenue. Edinburgh Road was the westernmost crossing of the Speed River. On {{the opposite side of the}} valley, Silvercreek Road continued, as it does today, along the same <b>right-of-way</b> as Hanlon Road.|$|E
5|$|Route 153 was deleted {{from the}} Regional Transportation Plan {{starting}} in May 2007, {{and much of}} the western half of the original alignment was re-used as <b>right-of-way</b> for the Sky Train people mover at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. It is now an extension of 44th St.|$|E
2500|$|In 1944, after {{extensive}} lobbying by Congressman B. Carroll Reece, Congress authorized {{construction of}} a [...] road connecting US-129 at Chilhowee Lake and I-40 along the Pigeon River. [...] In 1945, the Tennessee state legislature authorized the Tennessee Highway Department to buy <b>rights-of-way</b> for the road, and a second bill in 1947 authorized the transfer of <b>rights-of-way</b> to the National Park Service.|$|R
50|$|While {{the early}} bureaucratic hurdles had been cleared, the Tennessee Highway Department moved slowly in {{purchasing}} the road's <b>rights-of-way.</b> In 1956, park superintendent Edward Hummel {{managed to get}} the Foothills Parkway project included in the National Park Service's Mission 66 program, assuring early construction funds. Shortly thereafter, Governor Frank G. Clement authorized the THD to begin buying <b>rights-of-way.</b> Construction finally began in 1960.|$|R
5000|$|From 1850 to 1871, {{these acts}} {{typically}} allocated <b>rights-of-way</b> to specific named railroads.
