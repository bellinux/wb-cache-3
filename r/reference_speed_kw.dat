Both adults and 5 -year-olds were {{more sensitive to}} changes from the faster than from the slower <b>reference</b> <b>speed.</b> Five-year-olds were less sensitive than adults at both <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> but significantly more immature at the slower (1. 5 °s− 1) than at the faster (6 °s− 1) <b>reference</b> <b>speed.</b> The {{findings suggest that the}} mechanisms underlying speed discrimination are immature in 5 -year-olds, especially those that process slower speeds...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{processing}} of speed {{is a critical}} part of a child’s visual development, allowing children to track and interact with moving objects. Despite such importance, no study has investigated the developmental trajectory of speed discrimination abilities or precisely when these abilities become adult-like. Here, we measured speed discrimination thresholds in 5 -, 7 -, 9 -, 11 -year-olds and adults using random dot stimuli with two different <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> (slow: 1. 5 deg/s; fast: 6 deg/s). Sensitivity for both <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> improved exponentially with age and, at all ages, participants were more sensitive to the faster <b>reference</b> <b>speed.</b> However, sensitivity to slow speeds followed a more protracted developmental trajectory than that for faster speeds. Furthermore, sensitivity to the faster <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> reached adult-like levels by 11 years, whereas sensitivity to the slower <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> was not yet adult-like by this age. Different developmental trajectories may reflect distinct systems for processing fast and slow speeds. The reasonably late development of speed processing abilities may be due to inherent limits in the integration of neuronal responses in motion-sensitive areas in early childhood...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{industry}} and research {{practice in the}} area of transportation system performance measurement utilizes <b>reference</b> travel <b>speed</b> as benchmark for calculation of delay, mobility and reliability indices. These <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> reflect free-flow (unconstrained) travel conditions on different facilities (freeways, arterial streets, etc.). However, the rationale behind the choice of this important parameter is still not entirely established. An average driver?s perception of <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> on a roadway segment is influenced not only by the posted limit but also a few other factors including road geometry and driving conditions. Therefore, deriving applicable <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> from actual travel time data may be superior to the use of a <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> value based solely on a fixed posted speed limit. The posted speed limit may not be reflective of current operational conditions on roadway segments. This research investigates an appropriate reference time window representative of free-flow conditions by analyzing all-day travel patterns. This was done for both uninterrupted flow facilities (interstates and freeways) and interrupted flow facilities (major and minor urban arterials) because of their inherent differences in travel behavior and characteristics. Using probe-based travel time data from INRIX?, a private sector data provider, the analysis incorporated different urban areas in order to provide a more balanced representation of travel patterns and minimize any sampling bias. It is found that nighttime hours provide a good representation of unconstrained travel and <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> on both interrupted and uninterrupted flow facilities excluding minor arterial streets. Various temporal windows are examined and based on data availability and variability considerations, the 85 th percentile speed during 9 PM- 6 AM overnight hours is recommended as <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> on all uninterrupted flow facilities and major arterial streets. On facilities with sparse traffic and inadequate data during these nighttime hours, mid-day (11 AM- 4 PM) data should be used in place of nighttime hours to derive <b>reference</b> <b>speed.</b> On minor arterial streets, occurrences of actuation and priority treatment cause nighttime hours to concede lower travel speeds and for such facilities, the 85 th percentile of mid-day (11 AM- 4 PM) data is better representative of reference travel conditions. Inclusion of weekend travel data does not significantly impact derived <b>reference</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The tach(ometer) timer is an {{instrument}} used in aviation to accumulate {{the total number}} of revolutions performed by the engine. The unit of measure is equivalent to the number of hours of running at a certain, specific <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> of rotation. If the <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> of rotation is 2400 RPM then the timer runs in real time when the engine is running at 2400 RPM, half speed while the engine is run at 1200 RPM (a fast idle for some aviation engines) or at 5/6ths real time at 2000 RPM (a slow cruise speed).The tach timer integrates over time the instantaneous rotation speed displayed by the tachometer. The displayed number is incremented by one if the engine is run at its <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> for one hour. The quantity recorded is referred to as tach(ometer) hours.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figures  25 and 26, in the {{steady-state}} stage, the motor speed efficiently traces the <b>reference</b> <b>speed,</b> and {{the error of}} tension is regulated to near zero.

40|$|Accurate {{travel time}} data are {{necessary}} to monitor and evaluate traffic conditions effectively. In the past 20 years, the hours per year lost by the average driver have increased by 300 % in the 85 largest U. S. cities, which translates into lost productivity and increased costs. State department of transportation (DOT) agencies and other government organizations need accurate travel time and speed information to better combat this congestion faced by motorists. In the past, ground truth travel time information was typically collected with probe vehicles using the ?floating car? method. However, new methods using data collected from global positioning systems by private companies such as INRIX?, Navteq?, and TomTom? have emerged that allow travel time data to be obtained more cheaply and quickly. The Urban Mobility Report (UMR) has turned to these companies, specifically INRIX?, for calculating congestion indices across the United States. This is done by analyzing average <b>speeds</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> supplied by INRIX. The UMR analysis relies on INRIX-supplied <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> to calculate delay, which produces artificially high delay on many suburban arterials. Currently, these <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> are determined by taking the 85 th percentile of weekly speeds (typically overnight hours [10 PM to 6 AM]). There {{is a need to}} refine the <b>reference</b> <b>speeds</b> on arterials in order to account for signal operations, particularly during the daytime hours, so that the UMR more accurately reflects arterial congestion across the nation. Using Bluetooth and INRIX speed data, this thesis develops a new <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> methodology that accurately reflects arterial delay during daytime hours. This study found that a 60 % daytime free-flow <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> best represents arterial congestion. Using Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) guidelines, this thesis also explores the use of Bluetooth data for arterial and intersection level of service (LOS) analysis under both HCM 2000 and HCM 2010 methodologies. Through analysis, it was found that Bluetooth data capture more of the high and low LOS values compared to the HCM methodology based on segment speed calculations. These high and low LOS values, as well as the rapidly changing LOS between 15 -minute intervals, could be attributed to an insufficient sample size...|$|R

This method is particularly useful when the robot-patient synchronization algorithms generate compensations that fluctuate significantly throughout the gait cycle, making it unsuitable to apply these compensations directly to the <b>reference</b> <b>speed</b> values. The method was tested with a synchronization algorithm that generates continues temporal-compensations based on a phase controller.
