5000|$|Until 1917, it was {{possible}} for someone who was not a priest, but only in minor orders, to become a cardinal (see [...] "lay cardinals", below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests, and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment. As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop. These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye lived long enough to exercise the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest.|$|E

Sometimes, due to the special nature of some contracts, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> is conditioned and certain procedures must be enforced. Also, due to an obvious possibility that the respective contract might create an unbalance to the debtors’ accounts and other sectors, the judicial administrator must take special consideration and can also modify the articles of the contract, rendering new significance or substituting {{the content of the}} provisions.

40|$|A natural person’s {{patrimony}} consists, {{apart from}} rights (assets of the succession), of a liabilities {{side as well}} related to obligations that the patrimony’s holder bequeaths onto the heirs following his/her death. The succession implies {{that there are two}} parties, i. e. the assets of the succession and the inherited debt. The inherited debt is mainly made up of the inheritance duties and liabilities. The main components of the inherited debt are the debts the deceased has left, following that the duties shall be the obligations arising out after the succession will be opened. However, without defining the inherited debt concept in the specialized literature, successional liabilities have been considered to mean those patrimonial obligations of the deceased toward a third party or the inheritors existing in the successional patrimony on the opening of succession, regardless of their origin (contractual, tortious or legal). Inheritance duties refer to those obligations which did not exist in the de cujus patrimony, but come into existence devolving upon the heirs on the date of succession’s opening or subsequently after that time, either in consequence of the deceased’s desire, or independently of it. The main characteristic of the option on succession is that the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> belongs exclusively to the presumptive heirs.

40|$|It is well {{entrenched in}} Islamic Law that khiyar is an {{inherent}} {{right of the}} contracting parties in a contract.

In Peninsular Malaysia, all house purchasers who wish to buy houses built by the licensed housing developers who are subject to the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Act 118) and subject to control of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG) are required to use the prescribed housing statutory standard sale and purchase agreements as contained in Schedules G, H, I and J ('the said agreements'). However after a close scrutiny over the said agreements, there is no term of khiyar provided. Thus, due to the absence of term of khiyar in the said agreements, the said agreements, it is submitted, are null and void under Islamic Law. Likewise, it follows that due to this nullity, the subsequent housing transactions involving loan agreements, effected through Bay' Bithaman al-Ajil (BBA), Musharakah Mutanaqisah, Ijarah Thamma al-Bay' and Istisna' used by Islamic Banks, may also be affected and void. This academic paper is a fruit of a completed research undertaken by the author. Its objective is to discuss and explore the issues of khiyar in the said agreements, particularly when the housing projects are abandoned. The author used qualitative legal research methodology to unravel the issues of khiyar in the said agreements. This paper contends that due to the absence of khiyar in the said agreements, the said agreements have not complied with the requirements under Islamic law and could cause the housing transactions and the subsequent loan transactions entered into by the purchasers/borrower. developers and Islamic banks, void too.

Imali se to u vidu, posjedovanjem prava stjecanja stvari ili prava tijekom određenog vremena ili u određeno vrijeme i za unaprijed određenu cijenu moguće je izbjeći negativne učinke promjene novčane vrijednosti te stvari ili prava u budućnosti (hedging) ili postići zaradu na razlici između unaprijed određene cijene i cijene koja će postojati u budućnosti (špekulacija). U te svrhe stječu se prava – najčešće – kupnje ili prodaje vrijednosnih papira, robe i financijskih instrumenata uvrštenih u kotaciju na burzi. Ta prava nazivaju se opcije i najčešće se stječu opcijskim ugovorima, sklapanje kojih podrazumijeva određivanje barem bitnih sastojaka opcijskog ugovora i ugovora koji će nastati kad stjecatelj opcije izvrši pravo opcije. Sporno je pitanje je li opcijski ugovor ugovor o kupoprodaji prava opcije, ili je opcijski ugovor kupoprodajni ugovor za predmet opcije, ili je on ugovor sui generis. Sklapanjem opcijskog ugovora nastaje stjecateljevo pravo (opcija) i obveze strana, među kojima se posebno ističe stjecateljeva obveza plaćanja premije.

In {{domestic}} business {{practice and}} economic literature {{the concept of}} options and option contracts has been {{more and more often}} present in recent years. In Croatian legal literature options are almost not mentioned, while in Croatian regulations options and option contracts are mentioned only conceptually. On the other hand, in comparative law there exist rich business and court practice and literature which analyse in detail option contracts and options. The concept of option in the widest sense implies the right of one person to cause the formation of another contract by unilateral declaration. This right is subjective and as a rule transferable and thus it is suitable for being the object of legal transactions which may be concluded after it has occurred or after the acquirer of the option has acquired it. Most frequently it is the right to cause the formation of the sales contract on securities, currencies, interest rates and commodities included in quotation on the regulated market (stock-exchange). This right is called derivative because is has been derived and whose value has also been derived from some other property or some other financial instrument. Options are most frequently acquired by option contracts. The option contract should contain declaration of the seller by which he transfers to the buyer the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> (or the option itself) and the declaration of the buyer directed to the acquiring the same. At the same time, by indication of at least the essential components of the contract which will arise by the exercise of the <b>right</b> (<b>of</b> <b>option),</b> the content of the right or authority which the acquirer of the option acquires must be determined or determinable. As regular economic purposes of the acquisition of options, avoidance of negative effects of the change of the monetary value of the commodity or right in the future (hedging) and gaining profit on the difference between the price set in advance and the price which will exist in the future (speculation) may be mentioned. As regular immediate purposes of acquiring options in the area of finance, insurance from the risk of the change of the exchange rate and expectation of gain because of the expected change of the exchange rate or price of the object of option, which regularly has a current or stock-exchange price may be specified. The possibility of concluding option contracts is sometimes limited by coercive regulations because only authorised companies may trade in securities included in stock quotation at the stock-exchange, and there is a similar situation in respect of concluding option contracts for foreign currency. Therefore, there arises the problem of the validity of the contract which would be concluded by persons without necessary characteristics, which should be solved by acting in accordance with the principle favor negotii. Option contracts in banking and stock-exchange law are regularly bilaterally binding because by them the buyer of the option – in return for acquiring the option – is obliged to pay to the seller of the option a premium on the option. In Croatian law option contracts may be taken as unnamed, consensual, and informal contracts, may be of civil law or commercial character, although in banking or stock-exchange law they will regularly have commercial character. Option contracts have characteristics of a special kind of contract of chance i. e. aleatory legal transaction, which is called “differential” transaction. The legal nature of option contracts is disputable. It is disputable whether the option contract, in which there is the obligation of the acquirer to pay a premium on the option, is a contract on the purchase and sale of the right to option, or whether the optional contract is a sales contract for the object of the option concluded with the delayed potestative condition which enters into force when the acquirer realizes or exercises the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> by declaration to the giver to exercise the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option,</b> or it is a contract sui generis. By exercising the option, in principle the transferors obligation to transfer the object of the option to the acquirer arises, but when the acquirer has concluded the optional contract for the purpose of speculation, the so-called “cash settlement” is regularly contracted, i. e. monetary payment of the difference between the current and contracted price of the object of the option, and thus this difference is paid instead of the transfer of the object of the option to the acquirer, legal qualification of which is, from the standpoint of Croatian law, an open question. In der kroatischen Geschäftspraxis und ökonomischen Literatur sind in den letzten Jahren die Begriffe der Option und des Optionsvertrags immer häufiger anzutreffen. In der kroatischen Rechtsliteratur werden Optionen nahezu gar nicht erwähnt, während die kroatischen Vorschriften Optionen und Optionsverträge nur als Begriffe anführen. Andererseits kennt die Rechtsvergleichung eine umfangreiche Geschäftspraxis, Rechtsprechung und die Optionsverträge und Optionen detailliert behandelnde Literatur. Unter dem Begriff der Option ist im weitesten Sinne das Recht einer Person zu verstehen, durch einseitige Erklärung die Entstehung eines anderen Vertrags zu erwirken. Es handelt sich um ein subjektives und in der Regel übertragbares Recht, das sich somit als Gegenstand von Rechtsgeschäften eignet, die abgeschlossen werden können, nachdem das Recht entstanden ist und vom Optionserwerber erworben wurde. Meist bezieht es sich auf das Recht, die Entstehung eines Kaufvertrages für Wertpapiere, Zinsen oder auf einem geregelten Markt (Börse) notierte Ware herbeizuführen. In der ökonomischen Literatur wird dieses Recht als Derivat bezeichnet, da es abgeleitet oder deriviert ist wie auch sein Wert aus einem anderen Vermögen oder einem anderen Finanzinstrument abgeleitet oder deriviert ist. Optionen werden meist durch Optionsverträge erworben. Der Optionsvertrag muss die Erklärung des Verkäufers, mit der er das Recht der Option (oder nur die Option) auf den Käufer überträgt, und die Erklärung des Käufers, die auf den Erwerb desselben gerichtet ist, enthalten. Zugleich muss durch Bezeichnung zumindest der wesentlichen Bestandteile des Vertrags, der durch die Ausübung des Rechts (der Option) entsteht, der Inhalt des Rechts beziehungsweise die vom Optionserwerber erworbenen Befugnisse bestimmt oder bestimmbar sein. Als regelmäßige wirtschaftliche Zwecke des Optionserwerbs können die Vermeidung negativer Effekte der zukünftigen Veränderung des Geldwertes von Sachen oder Rechten (hedging) und die Gewinnerzielung auf Grund des Unterschieds zwischen dem vorab festgelegten Preis und dem zukünftigen tatsächlichen Preis (Spekulation) genannt werden. Als regelmäßige nähere Zwecke des Optionserwerbs im Bereich der Finanzen sind die Absicherung gegen das Wechselkursrisiko und die Erwartung eines Gewinns auf Grund einer erwarteten Veränderung des Wechselkurses beziehungsweise des Preises des Optionsgegenstands, der in der Regel einen aktuellen beziehungsweise Börsenpreis hat, zu nennen. Die Möglichkeit, Optionsverträge abzuschließen, ist manchmal durch zwingende Vorschriften begrenzt, da börsennotierte Wertpapiere an der Börse nur von befugten Gesellschaften gehandelt werden dürfen, ähnlich verhält es sich mit dem Abschluss von Optionsverträgen auf ausländische Währungen. Daher entsteht das Problem der Wirksamkeit von Verträgen, die von nicht qualifizierten Personen geschlossen wurden, welches durch die Anwendung des Grundsatzes favor negotii zu klären ist. Optionsverträge sind im Banken- und Börsenrecht in der Regel zweiseitig verbindlich, weil sich der Optionskäufer – als Gegenleistung für den Erwerb der Option – darin gegenüber dem Optionsverkäufer verpflichtet, die Optionsprämie zu zahlen. Nach kroatischem Recht können Optionsverträge als Innominat-, Konsensual- und formlose Verträge aufgefasst werden und zivilrechtlichen oder handelsrechtlichen Charakter haben, obwohl sie im Banken- und Börsenrecht in der Regel handelsrechtlich eingeordnet werden. Optionsverträge tragen Merkmale einer besonderen Art des Glücksvetrags, d. i. des aleatorischen Rechtsgeschäfts, das als "Differenzgeschäft" bezeichnet wird. Die rechtliche Natur des Optionsvertrags ist umstritten. Umstritten ist die Frage, ob ein Optionsvertrag, in dem die Verpflichtung des Erwerbers zur Zahlung der Optionsprämie besteht, ein Kaufvertrag über das Optionsrecht ist oder ein Kaufvertrag über den Optionsgegenstand, der mit einer aufschiebenden Potestativbedingung geschlossen wurde und wirksam wird, wenn der Erwerber das Optionsrecht verwertet oder durch Erklärung an den Optionsgeber ausübt, oder aber einen Vertrag sui generis darstellt. Durch Ausübung der Option entsteht grundsätzlich die Verpflichtung des Übertragenden, den Optionsgegenstand auf den Erwerber zu übertragen. Hat der Erwerber den Optionsvertrag jedoch zu Spekulationszwecken geschlossen, wird in der Regel ein sog. "cash settlement" vereinbart, d. h. eine Auszahlung der Differenz zwischen aktuellem und vereinbartem Preis des Optionsgegenstands in Geld, so dass statt der Übertragung des Optionsgegenstands auf den Erwerber die Differenz ausbezahlt wird. Die rechtliche Beurteilung dieses Vorgangs ist vom Standpunkt des kroatischen Rechts aus offen...|$|E

40|$|The {{law is a}} many splendored thing, but {{one thing}} is clear, that certain kinds <b>of</b> {{contracts}} and <b>rights</b> embodied within contracts can be confusing, especially for attorneys. True to form then, where even lawyers practicing in a particular area of law find something difficult to deal with, or they find that the law itself is unclear or that it has many ways to say the same thing, clarity is a welcome thing. In relation to real estate law in particular and specifically about the law <b>of</b> <b>options</b> and <b>rights</b> embodied within real estate contracts (whether purchase/sale documents or leases), much should be desired {{in the state of the}} United States “body of law” on this topic. Because of the difficulty in deciphering what is actually occurring in live transactions which often spawn years of litigation, the author proposes black-letter clarity on these kinds of clauses, and a uniformity across the United States, in order that the laws affecting the sale or rental of real estate be easier to digest, common in its understanding and application, and uniform in its laws. This Article reviews the many different kinds <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>options</b> and terms that are commonly used in the U. S., and explores many popular issues that arise out of the use <b>of</b> <b>options</b> and <b>rights,</b> in addition to their impact on other legal concepts in Property Law. Part II provides an introduction into the overall context of the Article and provides insight into the problems attendant to the mixup between rights and options in general. Part III opens up the proverbial Pandora’s Box and identifies and explains the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>options</b> that are used in U. S. real estate transactions commonly within Subpart A. Subpart B identifies concerns over priority in rights and options when two kinds of things are simultaneously announced or exercised by one or more parties or third parties involving real estate. Subpart C discusses the assignability <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>options</b> and explores the complications that arise when original parties to a real estate contract or lease assign or are the recipients of an assignment and lay a claim to a right or option. Part IV discusses issues in exercising rights and options and Subparts A through C discuss Landlord/Tenant (and vendor/vendee), Tender, Doctrines of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Restraints and Perpetuities, and the issues of contiguous and unrelated parcels. Part V rounds out the discussion with thoughts and reflections on how the law might be shaped through modification of existing frameworks, crafting of a uniform statute governing rights and <b>options,</b> in consideration <b>of</b> the “boots on the ground confusion” that is being displayed in courtrooms across America. While not a comparison of every kind <b>of</b> <b>right</b> vs. <b>option</b> case that ever was, the sum of the parts is intended to provide a jumping off point for a dialogue in the halls of those drafting model and uniform rules, and to spurn more critical examination of the issues that truly affect the parties and their counsel when things are left in a confused state, such as whether we have an option, a right, or merely a question about what is what...|$|R
40|$|The {{ownership}} {{that involves}} transactions and barters {{is subject to}} the validity of the intellectuals and the lawmaker, which is created by hypothetical (i‘tibārī) existence and can somehow be called a hypothetical relation for whose validity the existence of local convention is sufficient; therefore, ownership is neither among the categorical accidents, the existence of whose subjects is necessary in the outer world, nor like the mental conventions that resembles the concepts whose accidents and qualification are mental. Right (ḥaqq) is a specific capability that sometimes applies to physical goods (‘ayn), sometimes to the contract, and sometimes to the person; such as the right of delimitation (taḥjīr), the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>option</b> (khiyār), and the right of retaliation (qiṣāṣ). The object of right is in all cases an action that involves the physical goods, or person, or contract; whereas, property is a possession or domination that in reality involves the very physical good, or benefit, or action. Therefore, since the property is essential for absolute domination and the right is regarded as a special credit in some specific appropriations, the right cannot be considered as the property itself; and, furthermore, since property is by nature a simple issue and non-gradational, the right cannot be considered as a degree of the property. Besides, in some rights, including the right of delimitation and the right of specification (ikhtiṣāṣ), ownership is essentially out of question. Given its specifications, right is principally conveyable, relinquishable, transferable to inheritance except in cases in which a specific reason prohibits all or a part of appropriations and everything that is in nature characterized by right is apt to relinquish, otherwise it is regarded as a decree, in which case it is not relinquished except by compliance with decree or denial of the subject. Since evidences for transactions stand as enforcement of legal means, if in cases of doubt, there is certainty about transferability and doubt in deterrence or conditionality is the specific cause, the generality of the evidence of condition or amicable settlement (ṣulḥ) would be executed; and if doubt is in the transferability itself, the principle is the non-acceptance of transference. ملکیتی که مدار معاملات و معاوضات است، تابعی از اعتبار عقلاء و شارع می باشد که به وجود اعتباری ایجاد می‌شود و می‌توان به نوعی، آن را اضافه ی اعتباری خواند که وجود موضوع اعتباری و بلکه صرف وجود محلی برای آن، به لحاظ توقع آن محل، در اعتبار آن کافی است؛ بنابر این، ملکیت، نه در زمره ی أعراض مقولی است که وجود موضوع آن ها در خارج لازم می باشد؛ و نه مانند اعتبارات ذهنی، از سنخ مفاهیمی است که عروض و اتصاف آن ها ذهنی است. حقّ، توانایی خاصی است که گاهی به عین، گاهی به عقد و گاهی به شخص تعلق می‌گیرد؛ مانند:حقّ تحجیر، حقّ خیار و حقّ قصاص. متعلق حقّ، در تمام موارد، عملی است که به عین، یا شخص و یا عقد تعلق دارد، در حالی که ملک، احاطه و سلطنتی است که حقیقتاً به خود عین، یا منفعت و یا عمل، تعلق می‌گیرد؛ بنابر این، از آنجا که ملک، ملزوم سلطنت مطلق است و حق اعتباری ویژه در برخی تصرفات خاص به شمار می‌رود، حق، نمی‌تواند عین ملک تلقی گردد و افزون بر این، از آنجا که ملک، ماهیتاً، امری بسیط و غیر مقول به تشکیک است، حق نمی‌تواند مرتبه‌ای از ملک به شمار رود. مضافاً اینکه در برخی از حقوق، از جمله:حقّ تحجیر و حقّ اختصاص، اساساً، ملکیت فرض ندارد. حقّ، با اوضافی که دارد، جز در مواردی که دلیلی خاص، مانع تمام یا برخی از تصرفات می شود، علی‌الاصول، قابل نقل، اسقاط و انتقال به ارث است و هر آن چیزی که در ماهیت، به وصف حقّ، متصف می باشد، قابل اسقاط است و إلّا حُکم به شمار می‌رود که در این صورت، جز با امتثال حُکم، یا انتفای موضوع، ساقط نمی‌شود. از آنجا که ادله ی معاملات، در مقام انفاذ اسباب شرعی است، در موارد شک، اگر یقین به قابلیت نقل و شک در مانعیت، یا شرطیت سبب خاص باشد، عموم دلیل شرط، یا صلح، جاری می‌شود؛ و اگر شک، در اصل قابلیت نقل باشد، اصل، عدم قبول نقل است...|$|E
40|$|Bug {{prediction}} {{is a technique}} used to estimate the most bug-prone entities in software systems. Bug prediction approaches vary in many design options, such as dependent variables, independent variables, and machine learning models. Choosing the <b>right</b> combination <b>of</b> design <b>options</b> to build an effective bug predictor is hard. Previous studies do not consider this complexity and draw conclusions based on fewer-than-necessary experiments. We argue that each software project is unique {{from the perspective of}} its development process. Consequently, metrics and AI models perform differently on different projects, in the context of bug prediction. We confirm our hypothesis empirically by running different bug pre- dictors on different systems. We show that no single bug prediction configuration works globally on all projects and, thus, previous bug prediction findings cannot generalize...|$|R

Firstly, the size and direction of {{the share price}} response is examined. Secondly, the determinants of the share price response are examined. Where possible, comparisons are made to evidence from international markets. The sample of data tested consists of 43 announcements of convertible debt issues, 39 announcements of preference share issues and 19 announcements <b>of</b> <b>option</b> issues made between 1983 and 2000 by Australian firms. The analysis of the share price impact in response to the announcements is conducted using Maynes and Rumsey (1993) event study methodology that adjusts for thin trading. The determinants of the share price response are examined using model specifications that are derived from the theoretical literature. The analysis of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds significant negative abnormal returns for convertible debt issues, insignificant negative abnormal returns for preference share issues and significant positive abnormal returns for option issues. In comparison to international studies, the convertible debt results are similar to public and rights issues, the insignificant preference share results are similar to other findings and the option results are similar to private placements <b>of</b> equity and <b>rights</b> issues <b>of</b> <b>options.</b> The results <b>of</b> the investigation of the determinants of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds that convertible debt issues are best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the information asymmetry - dynamic hypothesis and the agency cost hypothesis. The impact of preference share issues is best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the agency cost hypothesis and the price pressure hypothesis. The announcement effect <b>of</b> <b>option</b> issues is best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry -dynamic hypothesis and the optimal capital structure hypothesis...|$|R

Numerical results reported in the thesis show that our approach can price American options on stocks, bonds and interest rates derivatives efficiently and very fast, compared with existing methods. The efficiency gains of our method stem from the fact that it involves only one step of approximation, as the European prices embodied in the American option prices can be calculated analytically. The gains of computational speed come from the fact that our method can reduce the integral dimensions of the early exercise premium considerably...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of breast cancer surgical choice; Breast Conservative Therapy (BCT) versus Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM); on body image perception among Egyptian postmenopausal cases. Methods One hundred postmenopausal women with breast cancer were divided into 2 groups, one group underwent BCT and the other underwent MRM. Pre- and post-operative assessments of body image distress were done using four scales; Breast Impact of Treatment Scale (BITS), Impact of Event Scale (IES), Situational Discomfort Scale (SDS), and Body Satisfaction Scale (BSS). Results Preoperative assessment showed no statistical significant difference regarding cognitive, affective, behavioral and evaluative components of body image between both studied groups. While in postoperative assessment, women in MRM group showed higher levels of body image distress among cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects. Conclusion Body image {{is an important factor}} for postmenopausal women with breast cancer in developing countries where that concept is widely ignored. We should not deprive those cases from their <b>right</b> <b>of</b> less mutilating <b>option</b> <b>of</b> treatment as BCT. </p...|$|R

If {{consumers}} can be encouraged to spend more instead of saving; or if the government runs a fiscal deficit to offset private savings; or if the corporate sector divert more of their profits to investment, then any current account surplus will tend to be reduced. However, in 2009 Germany amended its constitution to prohibit running a deficit greater than 0.35% of its GDPand calls to reduce its surplus by increasing demand have not been welcome by officials,adding to fears that the 2010s will not be an easy decade for the eurozone.In their April 2010 world economic outlook report, the IMF presented a study showing how with the <b>right</b> choice <b>of</b> policy <b>options</b> governments can shift away from a sustained current account surplus with no negative effect on growth and with a positive impact on unemployment.|$|R

In this paper the attention {{is dedicated to}} the coal. Coal is the main fossil fuel for energy production and also the key driver of emerging economies (China, India). On the other end, the coal has been the driver of developed economies (EU, US) and a systematic review <b>of</b> policy <b>options</b> can offer several insights on the path to sustainability. Whereas coal combustion externalities (mainly CO 2) are well regulated, policies for coal mining externalities are mainly neglected. Policy options present several characteristics and a formal discussion of the nexus externality and efficiency is provided. The result of a systematic web search for the coal mining externalities is presented. The strength of this search is to review several national and international reports/papers on coal mining effects. Policies for environmental and societal externalities are reviewed. Results show that the command and control is still the most popular instrument. However, mature economies (e. g. US) have successfully shifted towards voluntary agreements. These instruments promote efficiency and minimize distributional effects. It also emerges that landscape and biodiversity lost are not well regulated...|$|R
40|$|The Czech Republic {{has been}} dealing {{for the last}} four years with a legal {{revolution}} in the field of private law. A new Civil Code was adopted in 2012 and many new and forgotten legal figures were restored in the text of the code. An interesting example of forgotten legal figures is the superficiary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> building, which has again entered the legal order of the Czech Republic after a long one hundred years. Unlike the Act on the Superficiary <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> Building of 1912, the new Civil Code extends the scope of persons that may create the superficiary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> building to their land. This should eliminate the obstacle that has substantially limited its wider use. The superficiary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> building is not likely to become a legal concept very frequently seen in public registers. The aim of this paper is, therefore, a reflection on divided ownership and the purpose and genesis <b>of</b> the superficiary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> building in relation to its origins, as well as a prediction of future developments of this legal concept in the real estate market. To analyse the concept, the paper employs formal and legal methods (logical, grammatical and historical method). A comparative study is conducted in the spirit of the comparative method. The superficiary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> building is a suitable complement to the range <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>of</b> property <b>rights</b> offered by the new Civil Code. The author concludes that the use <b>of</b> the superficiary <b>right</b> <b>of</b> building, although not limited in comparison with the 1912 Act, will likely be less frequent and focused on longer-term projects...|$|R
