5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German bombing {{of the city in}} April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following Croatia's Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, Bhutanese, Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
25|$|There, <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> {{at risk of}} disease, {{child soldier}} and {{terrorist}} recruitment, and physical and sexual violence. There {{are estimated to be}} 700 refugee camp locations worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} weeks of the war, between 9 February and 9 May, several hundred {{thousand}} German refugees fled across the Baltic Sea, fleeing the advancing Soviet Army. For the most part, the <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> from East Prussia and Pomerania. Many of the <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> women, children, or elderly. Many were malnourished, exhausted or seriously ill. A third of the <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> younger than 15 years old.|$|R
50|$|If the {{protection}} of the Federal Office for Migration and <b>Refugees</b> <b>is</b> not revoked, the <b>refugee</b> <b>is</b> granted a permanent residence permit. In practice, it has been granted to 95 percent of all refugees.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{incidents}} in which fishermen and <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> shot by Myanmar Army troops, and <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> repelled by Bangladeshi troops have {{occurred on the}} Naf River. These include {{but are not limited}} to the following events: ...|$|R
25|$|On 2 July, CNN {{reported}} that 220 Zimbabweans {{fled to the}} US Embassy in Harare, seeking refuge from election-related violence. Many of the <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> supporters of MDC.|$|E
25|$|Also on {{the rise}} are kidnappings of refugees. According to Meron Estifanos, Eritrean <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> often kidnapped by Bedouin in the {{northern}} Sinai, tortured, raped, and only released after receiving a large ransom.|$|E
25|$|For many reasons, UNRWA's refugee load has {{increased}} {{much faster than}} its budget. The 1967 war created additional refugees. In addition, the descendents of <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> also within UNRWA purview; with all generations included, about five million people are eligible for UNRWA's services.|$|E
50|$|All <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> interviewed and {{screened}} by U.S. immigration personal {{deployed to}} the base for operations. Haitian <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> repatriated and returned to their country under a joint agreement between Haiti and the United States. Following an agreement between the U.S. and Cuban governments exodus was once again prevented by Cuba. The Cuban <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> allowed entry into the United States, and the camps were removed and the base returned to normal conditions.|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, Israel {{has charged}} that Palestinian <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> {{neglected}} by most Arab nations, whereas Jewish <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> integrated into Israeli society, {{and that this}} neglect is a contributing cause to the poverty and misery experienced by the residents of those camps.|$|R
25|$|There is {{a system}} for {{protecting}} refugees, of which the country held about 7,300 {{at the end of}} 2010, most of them from Togo. Benin works with the UNHCR and other groups to assist such individuals. Those who do not qualify as <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> invited to apply for residence permits.|$|E
25|$|The only {{plants that}} survive are thorny bushes {{and a few}} African flat-topped trees. As {{agriculture}} is almost impossible this results in fierce competition among different local groups for ownership of cattle. <b>Refugees</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to keep animals, due to the potential for conflict between the refugees and the local Turkana people.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Palestinian {{refugees}} of the 1948 war {{is estimated at}} between 700,000 and 800,000, and another 280,000 to 350,000 people were refugees of the 1967 war. Approximately 120,000–170,000 among the 1967 <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> believed to have also been refugees from the 1948 war, fleeing the second time. Today, the estimated number of Palestinian refugees exceeds four million.|$|E

5000|$|On April 2, 2016, Richard Dixon intercepted {{another small}} vessel from the Dominican Republic, {{carrying}} 20 refugees. [...] Fourteen of the <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred to a}} Dominican naval vessel. [...] Three of the remaining <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> taken to the United States, for prosecution, because this was not their first attempt to leave the Dominican Republic. The other three <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> not Dominicans, they {{were believed to be}} from India. They too were taken to the US, to be repatriated there.|$|R
25|$|The {{illegal entry}} of Vietnamese <b>refugees</b> <b>was</b> {{a concern for}} the Hong Kong {{government}} for 25 years. The issue was first resolved in 2000. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated.|$|R
25|$|Two Border Patrol agents {{demanded to}} know where he was from. He {{answered}} their question accurately and produced a copy of a form showing his admission into the U.S. as a refugee. The agents asked whether he had been fingerprinted and photographed through NSEERS ("Special Registration"). He answered, accurately, that he had not: <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> exempt from that program. They arrested him.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Syrian {{civil war}} {{threatened}} {{to spill over}} in Lebanon, causing more incidents of sectarian violence and armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in Tripoli. As of 6 August 2013, more than 677,702 Syrian <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> in Lebanon. As the number of Syrian refugees increases, the Lebanese Forces Party, the Kataeb Party, and the Free Patriotic Movement fear the country’s sectarian based political system is being undermined.|$|E
25|$|The {{residency}} {{status in}} the host country whilst under temporary UNHCR protection is very uncertain as <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> only granted temporary visas {{that have to be}} regularly renewed. Rather than only safeguarding the rights and basic well-being of refugees in the camps or in urban settings on a temporary basis the UNHCR's ultimate goal is to find one of the three durable solutions for refugees: integration, repatriation, resettlement.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{concentration}} of Sahrawi <b>refugees</b> <b>was</b> created in 1975-76, when Sahrawi <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> fleeing from Moroccan forces, who advanced through Western Sahara during the Western Sahara War between Morocco and Sahrawi Polisario Front. Those refugees {{ended up in}} Sahrawi refugee camps in the Tindouf Province, Algeria. With most refugees {{still living in the}} camps, the <b>refugee</b> situation <b>is</b> among the most protracted ones worldwide.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the initial}} counterattacks <b>was</b> against Achol-pi <b>Refugee</b> Settlement on August 5, 2002.

50|$|In Spain, {{the first}} and second episodes of The <b>Refugees</b> <b>were</b> {{broadcast}} simultaneously the same day on four television channels (Neox, Nova, laSexta and Antena 3) of Atresmedia.

25|$|UNRWA {{services}} {{are available to}} all those living in its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the Agency, and who need assistance. The descendants of Palestine refugee males, including adopted children, are also eligible for registration as refugees. When the Agency began operations in 1950, it was responding {{to the needs of}} about 750,000 Palestine refugees. Today, some 5million Palestine <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> registered as eligible for UNRWA services.|$|E
25|$|As of 13 February 2013, {{more than}} 182,938 Syrian <b>{{refugees}}</b> <b>are</b> in Lebanon. As {{the number of}} Syrian refugees increases, the Lebanese Forces Party, the Kataeb Party, and the Free Patriotic Movement fear the country’s sectarian based political system is being undermined. Other parties, such as the mostly Shia Lebanese Option Gathering and the mostly Sunni Najjadeh Party have also taken stances close to 14 March, including calling cancellation of agreements between the two countries.|$|E
25|$|In theory, Kenyan law {{applies to}} Kakuma camp. In practice, this seldom happens. It is not usual for the Kenyan police to {{intervene}} in camp security without having been specifically asked {{to do so by}} UNHCR. Refugees have been allowed to establish their own 'court' system which is funded by LWF. Community leaders preside over these courts and are allowed to pocket the fines they impose. Apart from fines there are punishments, including flogging and detention. Dinka community members (from South Sudan) tend to get stronger punishments. <b>Refugees</b> <b>are</b> left without legal remedies against abuses as they can’t appeal against their own courts.|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War, about 50,000 Norwegian {{refugees}} {{found their}} way to Sweden. The <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> received at Öreryd and later Kjesäter, and a number of camps were established. Many of the <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> educated as police troops. Annæus Schjødt led the refugee office from 1942 to 1943.|$|R
25|$|<b>Refugees</b> <b>are</b> {{often more}} {{susceptible}} to illness for several reasons, including a lack of immunity to local strains of malaria and other diseases. Displacement of a people can create favorable conditions for disease transmission. Refugee camps are typically heavily populated with poor sanitary conditions. The removal of vegetation for space, building materials or firewood also deprives mosquitoes of their natural habitats, leading them to more closely interact with humans. In the 1970s, Afghani refugees that were relocated to Pakistan were going from {{a country with a}}n effective malaria control strategy, to a country with a less effective system.|$|E
25|$|Scurvy {{currently}} is rare. It occurs {{more often in}} the developing world in association with malnutrition. Rates among <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> reported at 5% to 45%. Scurvy was described as early as the time of ancient Egypt. It was a limiting factor in long distance sea travel, often killing large numbers of people. A Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, was the first to prove it could be treated with citrus fruit in a 1753 publication. His experiments represented the first controlled trial. It took another 40 years before the British Navy began giving out lemon juice routinely.|$|E
25|$|European Union's minimum {{standards}} definition of refugee, underlined by Art. 2 (c) of Directive No. 2004/83/EC, essentially reproduces the narrow definition of refugee {{offered by the}} UN 1951 Convention; nevertheless, by virtue of articles 2 (e) and 15 of the same Directive, persons who have fled a war-caused generalized violence are, at certain conditions, eligible for a complementary form of protection, called subsidiary protection. The same form of protection is foreseen for displaced people who, without being <b>refugees,</b> <b>are</b> nevertheless exposed, if returned to their countries of origin, to death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatments.|$|E
50|$|In February 2011, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel {{reported}} that some 190 Eritrean and Ethiopian <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> {{being held hostage}} in Sinai, and that numerous refugee women reported having been raped on their trip to Israel. In 2013, the same organization estimated that about 1,000 <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> being held in Sinai hostage camps, and that in total about 7,000 <b>refugees</b> had <b>been</b> abused in these camps, resulting in more than 4,000 deaths.|$|R
