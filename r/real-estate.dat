5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, {{which was at}} odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, <b>real-estate</b> investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, Kirchner's {{secretary}} and confidant Daniel Muñoz (who died early that year) was {{identified in the}} Panama Papers as owner of <b>real-estate</b> investment firm Gold Black Limited.

5|$|Most {{functions}} {{which are}} handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, {{leading to a}} significant concentration {{of power in the}} Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s. However, the hundreds now serve no administrative role; their only current official legal use is in <b>real-estate</b> title descriptions.|$|E
5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been Charley Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie, {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching.

5|$|The evicted {{residents}} were mostly Jewish immigrants from Arab states whose weak financial status left them vulnerable to Kollek's plan. The following steep increase in <b>real-estate</b> values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice {{line and the}} Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as an injustice. This became a key issue in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and {{the founding of the}} Black Panthers movement in Israel.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A <b>real-estate</b> boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood.

5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and <b>real-estate</b> deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low <b>real-estate</b> prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of places of worship in Summer Hill. St Patrick's Catholic Church was built in 1874, and is the oldest known {{building}} in the suburb. There is also a small primary school associated with the church and located next to it. The building was originally a private home known as Kelvin Grove, and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the internal walls were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan's death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield <b>real-estate</b> developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first mass was celebrated in Kelvin Grove on St Patrick's day 1946, giving the church its name.|$|E
