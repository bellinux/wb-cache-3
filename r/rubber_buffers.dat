50|$|Front {{suspension}} of the Kabinenroller was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element rubber spring at the inside end. Front suspension travel was limited by <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers.</b> Rear suspension was by a trailing arm similar to a single-sided motorcycle swingarm which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel. The trailing arm was suspended by another torsional rubber spring.

Instead, a rotating crank lever on the right side of the gun is used to pull the bolt back. While semi-automatic in function, the L-39's bolt locks back after every shot, and the grip safety also functions to release the bolt. The entire front of the grip and trigger is protected by a large guard and a <b>rubber</b> <b>buffer</b> to protect the operator's hands from the spent casings which eject from the bottom of the gun at very high speeds.|$|R

The building also had tea-rooms, two shops, a post office, a roof garden and a garage below. The main room on the ground floor was a tearoom and cabaret, running the whole length of the building to accommodate 200 people, with a dining room on the first floor. The cabaret featured a special dance floor laid down on <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers.</b> Particularly innovative was the installation of a [...] "Wireless and Talking Machine", which allowed music or talking to be simultaneously broadcast to the cabaret, roof garden and all landings.|$|E
40|$|Suspension seat end-stop impacts may be {{a source}} of {{increased}} risk of injury for the drivers of some machines and work vehicles, such as off-road vehicles. Most suspension seats use <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers</b> to reduce the severity of end-stop impacts, but they still result in a high magnitude of acceleration being transmitted to drivers when an end-stop impact occurs. An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effect of buffer stiffness and buffer damping on the severity of end-stop impacts. The results show that the end-stop impact performance of suspension seats with only bottom buffers can be improved by the use of both top and bottom buffers. The force-deflection characteristics of <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers</b> had a significant influence on the severity of end-stop impacts. The optimum buffer should have medium stiffness which is nearly linear and occurs over a long deflection, without being compressed to its high stiffness stage. It is shown, theoretically, that buffer damping is capable of significantly reducing the severity of end-stop impacts. However, since current rubber material provides only low damping, alternative materials to those in current use, or either passive or active damping devices, are required. © 1998 Academic Press. </p...|$|E
40|$|Symmetrical <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers</b> {{mounted on}} a tracktype {{bulldozer}} are used in passive damping for the reduction of vibrations. As heat accumulation due to hysteresis  may occur in continuous operation distributions of three typical cases were  evaluated by FEM. The simulation result shows that hysteresis–related heat  accumulation occurring near the contact region of the rubber pad remains unchanged in different cases. The maximum temperature in the case of  earthmoving somewhat exceeds the range. The value of cutting and bulldozing is below the range. The value of loosening obviously exceeds the range. The great conductivity gap of heat flux between steel and rubber, which caused the most  heat, was dissipated through the steel plate. Superficial temperatures were  measured with a non-contact thermometer {{for the convenience of}} calculation that revealed a fair agreement between simulation and measurement in the case of  earthmoving and cutting andbulldozing case. A lot of hysteresis-related heat  produced due to excessive load caused a large error...|$|E
40|$|In {{the scope}} of this thesis, a three-layered safety concept for the {{rotational}} Drive Unit of the bimanual Haptic Device was developed and partially implemented. It has to be ensured, that {{for the use of the}} Drive Unit no hazards can occur as there is an human operator directly involved in the action. In addition, it has to be ensured, that the chair's working space is well defined and can not be exceeded. Otherwise, the risk of cables shearing off occur. Therefore, there is the need of several safety features. For each layer safety features can be identified. The most important safety-layer consists of Mechanical End Stops (third layer). This layer is the most important one as in case its safety features' functions become inoperative, no other layer is able to replace the important core characteristics. Mechanical end stop blocks were designed to be mounted below the chair in order to mark the very end position of the chair's working space. The design is done in a way, that even in case the highest possible loads occur, the mechanical end stop blocks will not break down. This characteristic is achieved by a bolt calculation ensuring the screws are able to withstand the occurring loads. In addition, it is ensured, that even in case of an impact, non of the two Light Weight Robot arms connected with the Drive Unit will break down due to too high decelerations. This is achieved by <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers</b> mounted on the mechanical end stops which break the system slowly in contrary to a hard end stop. Furthermore, considerations of an appropriate voltage limitation limiting the angular velocity of the rotating system is conducted. The second safety-layer consists of a Sensoring System. Inductive-based proximity switches are selected and positioned in order to be mounted on each side of the chair. These sensors detect the end position of the chair and trigger certain events in case of detection. The second sensor acts as an end stop. Positioned directly in front of the <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers</b> which are mounted on the mechanical end stop, the motor's current supply is cut off in case the chair reaches its position. The first sensor is positioned in front of the second one in a way that there is enough time left for the motor to turn the system's direction of rotation, even in case of a maximal angular velocity of the rotating system. The selection of these sensors was conducted by applying methods of Systems Engineering. Several core-technologies were properly examined and rated by a cost-utility analysis. Finally, the inductive-based sensor technology ranked best and was therefore selected. The first safety-layer consists of the analysis of data from a Force-Torque-Sensor (FTS) developed at DLR. Considerations for plausible values show that torques referring to the z-axis (up-down direction) are probably not higher than 15. 31 Nm in case an human operator with a total mass of around 75 kg is sitting upon the chair. This value can be assumed as a limiting value for the meausured torques around the z-axis by the FTS in action of the Drive Unit...|$|E
40|$|Several {{experimental}} studies of frictional isolators suggest that the coefficient of friction depends on the sliding velocity and the normal pressure. Therefore {{people are concerned about}} the impact of the seismic response of frictional isolated bridges. In this study, in order to investigate the effect of variational normal load of isolators on seismic response of bridges, the shaking table tests were conducted. The specimen was a 5 x 3 m girder model supported by a set of 4 frictional isolators and 2 <b>rubber</b> <b>buffers.</b> As factors of causing the variational normal load at isolators in the bridge system, (1) inertia force of the girder due to the vertical motion and (2) rocking behavior of the girder due to the horizontal motion were taken into account. From the tests, it is observed that the hysteretic shape of each isolator was trapezoid and the coefficient of friction varied largely due to the horizontal and vertical ground motion. However adding all hysteresis loops of the isolators, the effect of the rocking behavior of the girder was canceled and the resultant hysteresis loop becomes rectangular shape. As the results it is found that the large amount of hysteretic damping of frictional isolators can be expected even under the variational normal force. Next, in order to express the normal pressure and sliding velocity dependency of frictional force, the numerical model was developed based on the tribology theory and the property of materials. Compared with the experimental results, it is found that the numerical model can simulate well the behavior of frictional isolators under variational normal pressure and sliding velocity...|$|E
