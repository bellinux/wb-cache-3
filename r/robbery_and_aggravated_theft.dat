5000|$|A {{defendant}} {{may move}} for judgment of acquittal {{after the government}} closes its evidence or all evidence under rule 23 [...] of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Clark attempted to gain acquittal on identity <b>theft</b> <b>and</b> <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft.</b> Clark argued that sections [...] and [...] of US code proscribe to the same offense. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution would prohibit a sentence for both identity <b>theft</b> <b>and</b> <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft.</b> In United States v. Felix 503 U.S. 378 (1992), it was ruled that an offense and conspiracy to commit that offense are not the same; fundamentally one cannot be tried twice for the same offense. In this case however, the court decided that section [...] allows for punishment for both identity <b>theft</b> <b>and</b> <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft</b> <b>and</b> that {{the intent of the}} United States Congress is to impose multiple punishments for both identity <b>theft</b> <b>and</b> <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft,</b> as both are separate statutes. In Blockburger v. United States, , it was confirmed that multiple punishments for convictions that fall under separate statutes do not violate the double jeopardy clause. The motion of judgment of acquittal was denied, citing Chase [...] applying the same standard of review to the district.|$|R
