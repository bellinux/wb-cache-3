40|$|Abstract. Geoscience Australia and the Australian State and Territory Geological Surveys have {{systematically}} surveyed {{most of the}} Australian continent {{over the}} past 40 years using airborne gamma-ray spectrometry to map potassium, uranium and thorium elemental concentrations at the Earth’s surface. However, the individual surveys that comprise the national gamma-ray spectrometric <b>radioelement</b> database are not all registered to the same datum. This limits {{the usefulness of the}} database as {{it is not possible to}} easily combine surveys into regional compilations or make accurate comparisons between radiometric signatures in different survey areas. To solve these problems, Geoscience Australia has undertaken an Australia-Wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS), funded under the Australian Government’s Onshore Energy Security Program, to serve as a <b>radioelement</b> baseline for all current and future airborne gamma-ray spectrometric surveys inAustralia. TheAWAGS survey has been back-calibrated to the International Atomic EnergyAgency’s (IAEA) <b>radioelement</b> datum. We have used theAWAGS data to level the national <b>radioelement</b> database by estimating survey correction factors that, once applied, minimise both the differences in <b>radioelement</b> estimates between surveys (where these surveys overlap) and the differences between the surveys and the AWAGS traverses. The database is thus effectively levelled to the IAEAdatum. The levelled database has been used to produce the first ‘Radiometric Map of Australia ’ – levelled and merged composite potassium (% K), uranium (ppm eU) and thorium (ppm eTh) grids over Australia at 100 m resolution. Interpreters can use themap to reliably compare the radiometric signatures observed over different parts of Australia. This enables the assessment of key mineralogical and geochemical properties of bedrock and regolith materials from different geological provinces and regions with contrasting landscape histories.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach of}} source-term evaluation for performance assessment of nuclear waste repositories uses speciation-solubility modeling tools and assumes pure phases of <b>radioelements</b> control their solubility. This assumption may not reflect reality, as most <b>radioelements</b> (except for U) may not {{form their own}} pure phases. As a result, solubility limits predicted using the conventional approach are several orders of magnitude higher then the concentrations of <b>radioelements</b> measured in spent fuel dissolution experiments. This paper presents the author's attempt of using a non-conventional approach to evaluate source term of radionuclide release for Yucca Mountain. Based on the general reactive-transport code AREST-CT, a model for spent fuel dissolution and secondary phase precipitation has been constructed. The model accounts for both equilibrium and kinetic reactions. Its predictions have been compared against laboratory experiments and natural analogues. It is found that without calibrations, the simulated results match laboratory and field observations very well in many aspects. More important {{is the fact that}} no contradictions between them have been found. This provides confidence in the predictive power of the model. Based on the concept of Np incorporated into uranyl minerals, the model not only predicts a lower Np source-term than that given by conventional Np solubility models, but also produces results which are consistent with laboratory measurements and observations. Moreover, two hypotheses, whether Np enters tertiary uranyl minerals or not, have been tested by comparing model predictions against laboratory observations, the results favor the former. It is concluded that this non-conventional approach of source term evaluation not only eliminates over-conservatism in conventional solubility approach to some extent, but also gives a realistic representation of the system of interest, which is a prerequisite for truly understanding the long-term behavior of the proposed repository. Therefore, it is a very promising alternative approach for source-term evaluation...|$|R
