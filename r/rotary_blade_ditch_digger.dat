40|$|The {{effect of}} shape of {{prototype}} <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> {{on the performance}} of rotary power tiller was investigated in this study. Three sets of rotors, i. e. 14 -blade rotor of the Japanese C-shape blade (4. 5 cm tilling width of one blade; T 1), 14 -blade rotor of the prototype <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> no. 1 (4. 5 cm tilling width of one blade; T 2), and 10 -blade rotor of the prototype <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> no. 2 (6. 5 cm tilling width of one blade; T 3) were used. The tests were conducted in a dry-land field of clay loam with soil moisture content of 16. 04 % (d. b.) and dry bulk density of 1. 51 g/cm 3 at different rotational speeds of 300, 350 and 400 rpm at one and two tilling passes. For all rotors, experimental results showed that the mean soil clod diameter decreased and soil inversion increased with increasing rotational speed of the rotor. The mean soil clod diameter decreased at pass 2. Soil inversion during pass 2 was higher than pass 1. However, the three sets of rotors showed no significant difference on mean soil clod diameter and soil inversion. The shape of <b>blade</b> prototype <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> no. 1 and the decreasing number of prototype <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> no. 2 did not affect the tillage performance as compared with the Japanese C-shaped blade...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small {{agricultural}} machinery with forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> was proposed for {{solving the problem}} of cultivation with compacted soil. Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) based models of forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> were carried out using the LS-DYNA software. SPH is a mesh free method, thus large material distortions {{that occur in the}} soil cutting problem are easily managed. In most earth moving machinery, such as bulldozers or tillage tools, the working tool is a blade. Hence for tillage systems, accurately predicting the forces acting on the blade is of prime importance in helping to enhance productivity. Structural parameters of reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> were studied and optimized with orthogonal test and numerical simulating technology. Results show that forward and reverse-rotational rotary tool can independently work for the cutting of compacted soil with different operating resistance. It is perfectly feasible to apply the proposed composite rotary tiller to compacted soil deep-tilling with low power motor. Proper structural parameters of forward and reverse-rotational <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> can reduce the power consumption. This method provides theoretical basis for the design of tools...|$|R

40|$|Mixing of {{microfluidic}} flows {{is difficult}} {{due to the}} fact that microfluid is generally laminar flow and turbulence is not enough. To improve the mixing of microfluid, passive or active microfluidic mixers are developed. Active micromixers need external energy input, but generally result in better mixing outcome compared to passive micromixers. In this poster, an active rotary microfluidic mixer with four <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> is designed. It has three inlets and one outlet. The four <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> introduce turbulence of the microfluid to help improve the mixing. The four <b>rotary</b> <b>blades</b> are arranged to form a fully differential structure. They can be activated to rotate clockwise, counter-clockwise or with a combination of both. The shape of the micromixer is custom-designed to reduce the dead angle compared to traditional cylinder mixer...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} soil {{workability}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> suitable for large tilling depth (over 20 cm) manufactured through boronizing treatment, this work {{focuses on the}} corrosion behavior of 65 Mn steel after boronizing treatment in two acid mediums, i. e. the strong acidic medium that hydrochloric solution and the weak acidic that fertilizer-containing soil, and the comparison with existing technology of general <b>rotary</b> <b>blade</b> (lonnealing after overall quenching). The result shows that the corrosion resistance in the two acid mediums of 65 Mn steel after boronizing treatment is remarkably improved. After 168 hoursâ€™ corrosion in the hydrochloric acid solution, the weight loss of boronizing-status sample is only 27. 9 % of that of lonnealing-status sample. Moreover, there is no obvious weight loss in boronizing-status sample after 168 hoursâ€™ corrosion in the fertilizer-containing soil, while the weight of lonnealing-status sample is lighter than the original weight after about 150 hoursâ€™ corrosion. The improvement of the corrosion resistance lies in the significant reduction of the anodization speed in strong acid medium and the effective prevention of phosphorization reaction in weak acidic medium...|$|R
