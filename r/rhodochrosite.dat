5|$|Manganese {{comprises}} about 1000ppm(0.1%) of the Earth's crust, the 12th {{most abundant}} of the crust's elements. Soil contains 7–9000ppm of manganese {{with an average}} of 440ppm. Seawater has only 10ppm manganese and the atmosphere contains 0.01µg/m3. Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite (MnO2), braunite, (Mn2+Mn3+6)(SiO12), psilomelane (Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10, {{and to a lesser extent}} as <b>rhodochrosite</b> (MnCO3).|$|E
5|$|Gemstones include rubies, diamonds, <b>rhodochrosite,</b> opal, emerald, and {{amethyst}} among others. Fossils include shark teeth, coprolites, or fossilized dung, petrified wood, dinosaur eggs, trilobites, {{and a baby}} dinosaur of the Psittacosaurus genus. One display features all 12 birthstones with {{a version}} of each in its natural state and as finished gemstones, along with the same before and after for other gemstones such as aquamarine. Around 1,000 of the specimens at the museum are only viewable using a microscope.|$|E
5|$|Another copy of {{the same}} book was put into auction on November 2016. It was {{auctioned}} for £ 368,750 on 12 December 2016. The book was auctioned by Sotheby in London. The book is a leather bound manuscript decorated with <b>Rhodochrosite</b> (A precious stone) and a silver skull. The copy does have a note by Rowling to Mr. Cunningham as follows “To Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell … THANK YOU.” She has also added a note about the stone as “traditionally associated with love, balance and joy in daily life”.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{oxidation}} state for manganese is +2, {{which has a}} pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl2). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral <b>rhodochrosite</b> (manganese(II) carbonate). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state {{because of the high}} pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II). There are no spin-allowed d–d transitions in manganese(II), explaining why manganese(II) compounds are typically pale to colorless.|$|E

25|$|The school {{operates}} the Colorado School of Mines Geology Museum, which displays rock and mineral specimens collected from Colorado's numerous mining districts {{as well as}} around the world. The museum's exhibits include specimens from the Frank Allison gold and silver collection, part of the famous Nininger meteorite collection, and Sweet Home Mine <b>rhodochrosite,</b> {{as well as a}} model uranium mine and various pieces of mining related art.|$|E
25|$|As {{cleavage}} is {{a function}} of crystallography, {{there are a variety of}} cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or <b>rhodochrosite,</b> it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.|$|E
500|$|The main <b>rhodochrosite</b> {{attraction}} is the [...] "Alma Rose" [...] from the Sweet Home Mine in Colorado. The Alma Rose includes crystals measuring up to 9.5cm in length along with quartz and calcite highlights. The Rices once owned the complementary [...] "Alma King" [...] <b>rhodochrosite</b> {{from the same}} mine, but sold the piece to the Coors Brewing Company, who then donated it to the Denver Natural History Museum. The two stones had been purchased by the couple for US$800,000. Other <b>rhodochrosite</b> specimens include those from mines in Arizona. The museum also has a collection of 107 gold pieces from the F. John Barlow collection featuring items such as a 42 troy ounce (1.31kg)) leaf and pieces mined from the Ace of Diamonds mine in Liberty, Washington. One of the museum's pieces, a sperrylite from Russia, {{is considered one of}} the finest in the world.|$|E
500|$|The Denver Museum of Nature and Science {{holds an}} {{aquamarine}} specimen valued at over $1 million, {{as well as}} specimens of the state mineral, <b>rhodochrosite.</b> Every September the Denver Mart, at 451 E. 58th Avenue, hosts a gem and mineral show. The state history museum, History Colorado Center, opened in April 2012. It features hands-on and interactive exhibits, artifacts and programs about Colorado history. It was named in 2013 by True West Magazine {{as one of the}} top-ten [...] "must see" [...] history museums in the country. History Colorado's Byers-Evans House Museum and the Molly Brown House are nearby.|$|E
2500|$|The {{action of}} {{micro-organisms}} can fix uranium; Thermoanaerobacter can use chromium(VI), iron(III), cobalt(III), manganese(IV) and uranium(VI) as electron acceptors while acetate, glucose, hydrogen, lactate, pyruvate, succinate, and xylose {{can act as}} electron donors for the metabolism of the bacteria. In this way the metals {{can be reduced to}} form magnetite (Fe3O4), siderite (FeCO3), <b>rhodochrosite</b> (MnCO3), and uraninite (UO2). Other researchers have also worked on the fixing of uranium using bacteria , Francis R. Livens et al. (Working at Manchester) have suggested that the reason why Geobacter sulfurreducens can reduce [...] cations to uranium dioxide is that the bacteria reduce the uranyl cations to [...] which then undergoes disproportionation to form [...] and UO2. This reasoning was based (at least in part) on the observation that [...] is not converted to an insoluble neptunium oxide by the bacteria.|$|E

50|$|Manganoan calcite is {{sometimes}} confused with <b>rhodochrosite.</b> The amount of manganese in manganocalcite varies at different localities, and the mineral forms a solid solution series between calcite and <b>rhodochrosite,</b> with the color becoming redder {{with a higher}} proportion of manganese.|$|E
