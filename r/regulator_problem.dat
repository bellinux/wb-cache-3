40|$|Efficient Riccati {{equation}} based {{techniques for}} the approximate solution of discrete time linear <b>regulator</b> <b>problems</b> are restricted in their application to problems with quadratic terminal payoffs. Where non-quadratic terminal payoffs are required, these techniques fail {{due to the}} attendant non-quadratic value functions involved. In order to compute these non-quadratic value functions, it is often necessary to appeal directly to dynamic programming {{in the form of}} grid- or element-based iterations for the value function. These iterations suffer from poor scalability with respect to problem dimension and time horizon. In this paper, a new max-plus based method is developed for the approximate solution of discrete time linear <b>regulator</b> <b>problems</b> with non-quadratic payoffs. This new method is underpinned by the development of new fundamental solutions to such linear <b>regulator</b> <b>problems,</b> via max-plus duality. In comparison with a typical grid-based approach, a substantial reduction in computational effort is observed in applying this new max-plus method. A number of simple examples are presented that illustrate this and other observations. Comment: 39 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|In {{the optimal}} linear {{quadratic}} <b>regulator</b> <b>problem</b> for finite dimensional systems, the method {{known as an}} alpha-shift {{can be used to}} produce a closed-loop system whose spectrum lies to the left of some specified vertical line; that is, a closed-loop system with a prescribed degree of stability. This paper treats the extension of the alpha-shift to hereditary systems. As infinite dimensions, the shift can be accomplished by adding alpha times the identity to the open-loop semigroup generator and then solving an optimal <b>regulator</b> <b>problem.</b> However, this approach does not work with a new approximation scheme for hereditary control problems recently developed by Kappel and Salamon. Since this scheme is among the best to date for the numerical solution of the linear <b>regulator</b> <b>problem</b> for hereditary systems, an alternative method for shifting the closed-loop spectrum is needed. An alpha-shift technique that can be used with the Kappel-Salamon approximation scheme is developed. Both the continuous-time and discrete-time problems are considered.

Specifically, the considered problem consists of finding a compensator which, besides guaranteeing closed loop asymptotic stability and zero error regulation when all the instrumentation is in operation, also ensures that these properties are preserved, at their maximum possible extent, when some sensors and/or actuators failures occur, that is, some of the feedback loops open. Thus, a single regulator has to be found, able to contemporarily solve a certain number of classical regulator problems. Referring to exogenous signals polynomial in time and a centralized control structure, the paper shows that a solution exists if and only if each standard <b>regulator</b> <b>problem,</b> composing the overall reliable <b>regulator</b> <b>problem,</b> admits a solution...|$|E
