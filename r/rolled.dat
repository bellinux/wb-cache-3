5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then <b>rolled</b> to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being <b>rolled</b> into spirals, kneaded and <b>rolled</b> into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the <b>rolled</b> strips of tea leaf are then <b>rolled</b> to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E

50|$|The three {{adjacent}} <b>rolls</b> of a three <b>roll</b> mill (called {{the feed}} <b>roll,</b> centre <b>roll</b> and apron <b>roll)</b> rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, {{usually in the}} form of paste, is fed between the feed <b>roll</b> and the center <b>roll.</b> Due to the narrowing space between the <b>rolls,</b> most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two <b>rolls.</b> Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center <b>roll</b> moves through the second nip between the center <b>roll</b> and apron <b>roll.</b> This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron <b>roll</b> and typically, a smaller gap than between the feed and centre <b>rolls.</b> A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron <b>roll</b> and the paste <b>rolls</b> down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|R

50|$|To {{minimize}} the <b>roll</b> diameter a four-high or cluster mill is used. A small <b>roll</b> diameter is advantageous because less <b>roll</b> is {{in contact with}} the material, which results in a lower force and power requirement. The problem with a small <b>roll</b> is a reduction of stiffness, which is overcome using backup <b>rolls.</b> These backup <b>rolls</b> are larger and contact {{the back side of the}} smaller <b>rolls.</b> A four-high mill has four <b>rolls,</b> two small and two large. A cluster mill has more than 4 <b>rolls,</b> usually in three tiers. These types of mills are commonly used to hot <b>roll</b> wide plates, most cold rolling applications, and to <b>roll</b> foils.|$|R

50|$|The {{counter to}} a break is often a {{displacement}} <b>roll</b> called a barrel <b>roll</b> attack. A barrel <b>roll</b> consists of performing a <b>roll</b> and a loop, completing {{both at the same}} time. The result is a helical <b>roll</b> around a straight flight path. The barrel <b>roll</b> attack uses a much tighter loop than the <b>roll,</b> completing a full loop while only executing 3/4 of a <b>roll.</b> The result is a virtual 90 degree turn, using all three dimensions, in the direction opposite of the <b>roll.</b> <b>Rolling</b> away from the defender's break, the attacker completes the <b>roll</b> with the aircraft's nose pointed {{in the direction of the}} defender's travel.|$|R

40|$|The {{consumption}} of work <b>rolls</b> in cold strip mills is significant. One {{of the key}} issues for work <b>rolls</b> is the surface roughness which affects the rolling stability and surface finish of the strip. The produced strip has lower surface finish if the <b>roll</b> surface roughness is large. However, if the <b>roll</b> surface roughness is small, it is not helpful for establishing the rolling process, which will reduce the productivity. In this case, a laser treatment is employed to increase the value of <b>roll</b> surface roughness. In {{order to reduce the}} times of <b>roll</b> grinding, the cold strip mill and <b>roll</b> manufacturers have developed new types of <b>rolls</b> such as the <b>rolls</b> containing Ti to increase the <b>roll</b> wear resistance in cold strip rolling. Results show that the new 4 CrTi <b>roll</b> has a significant advantage of preventing decrease of the <b>roll</b> surface roughness. The size and generation of particles during <b>roll</b> wear process and the effect of Ti on <b>roll</b> wear have been discussed...|$|R
