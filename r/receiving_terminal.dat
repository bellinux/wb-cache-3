25|$|LNG is shipped {{around the}} world in {{specially}} constructed seagoing vessels. The trade of LNG is completed by signing an SPA (sale and purchase agreement) between a supplier and <b>receiving</b> <b>terminal,</b> and by signing a GSA (gas sale agreement) between a <b>receiving</b> <b>terminal</b> and end-users. Most of the contract terms used to be DES or ex ship, holding the seller responsible for the transport of the gas. With low shipbuilding costs, and the buyers preferring to ensure reliable and stable supply, however, contracts with FOB terms increased. Under such terms the buyer, who often owns a vessel or signs a long-term charter agreement with independent carriers, is responsible for the transport.|$|E
25|$|The LNG {{industry}} developed slowly {{during the}} second half of the last century because most LNG plants are located in remote areas not served by pipelines, and because of the large costs to treat and transport LNG. Constructing an LNG plant costs at least $1.5billion per 1mmtpa capacity, a <b>receiving</b> <b>terminal</b> costs $1billion per 1 bcf/day throughput capacity and LNG vessels cost $200 million–$300 million.|$|E

The results show that the hidden terminal will produce large volume of MAC packets collisions and RET packet loss, so the TCP always goes into RTO. In the same sending rate, UDP <b>receiving</b> hidden <b>terminal</b> is more harmful (drop TCP to 20 %) to the TCP performance than sending hidden terminal (drop TCP to 80 %).

40|$|Accurate {{localization}} of Primary Users (PUs) is {{an extremely}} useful procedure which can improve the performance of Cognitive Radio (CR) by more efficient dynamic allocation of channels and transmit powers for unlicensed users. In this paper, we analyze {{the performance of a}} Compressive Sensing (CS) method which simultaneously yields the PU transmitter locations and transmit powers for any channel in a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN).
