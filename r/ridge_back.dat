2500|$|After {{seven hours}} of fighting, having been pressed {{back to the}} tail of the column, twelve British cavalry {{appeared}} on the next <b>ridge</b> <b>back,</b> having heard of the request for help and arriving just in time, as the rearguard was exhausted. The cavalry held off the attackers and then fifty men sent by Aga Petros arrived and relieved Savige and the Dunsterforce party. Dr Shedd reached the British encampment but during the night died of cholera and was buried nearby. Attacks on the refugee column by Ottoman troops and local Kurds diminished {{but for the rest of}} the march there were frequent attempts to take loot and rustle cattle before the escort could intervene. The cavalry guarded the money and the Dunsterville party provided the rearguard but was not able to protect wounded or exhausted women and children, who had been abandoned by their men, from being murdered. Short of Bijar, an attack by [...] hillmen was deterred, by a show of force by Agha Petros and on 17 August, the rearguard entered Bijar, by when the Dunsterforce members were so worn out that only four regained their fitness before the end of the war. Of about [...] who fled from Urmia, perhaps [...] the Persian road.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Ridge and Taylor's remarriage, Brooke {{continues}} her {{attempts at}} winning <b>Ridge</b> <b>back.</b> Stephanie encourages Taylor to see Brooke's intent, with Tylo observing: [...] "It was so obvious {{she was going}} after Ridge.

[...] Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie ("Steffy") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting {{with a man who}} has it. Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies. Tylo said that this was [...] "a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women". When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the [...] "horrible reality", saying: [...] "He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go of this woman who he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with." [...] Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate. Taylor's [...] "ghost" [...] visits Ridge in 2004 and encourages him to be with Brooke. Following Taylor's return to the show, her marriage to Ridge fell apart in 2006 and they divorce. They have since reunited on several occasions but he continues going back to Brooke, despite Taylor's efforts to thwart this from happening. Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens noted that Steffy and Thomas [...] "grew up watching their daddy basically climb out of their mom's bed and right into the sack with Rick (Jacob Young) and Hope's (Kimberly Matula) mom, over and over again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Africanis is a short-coated, {{medium-sized}} dog, well-muscled {{and slightly}} longer than tall. It {{can be of}} any colour and occasionally comes with a ridgeback.(Regarding the <b>ridged</b> <b>back,</b> according to the Africanis Society of South Africa: [...] A ridge of varying form can exceptionally {{be seen on the}} back. It has sadly been established that this mutation can be associated with a dermoid sinus. Therefore, ‘ridged’ individuals are not recommended for breeding). There is also a wirehaired variety of the breed, but it is relatively rare. The height usually varies from 50 to 60cm (with the tolerance of 2–3cm).|$|R

60|$|The borderman {{proceeded}} {{to relate the}} events that had occurred during a recent tramp in the forest with Wetzel. While returning from a hunt in a swamp several miles over the <b>ridge,</b> <b>back</b> of Fort Henry, they ran across the trail of three Indians. They followed this until darkness set in, when both laid down to rest {{and wait for the}} early dawn, that time most propitious for taking the savage by surprise. On resuming the trail they found that other Indians had joined the party they were tracking. To the bordermen this was significant of some unusual activity directed toward the settlement. Unable to learn anything definite from the moccasin traces, they hurried up on the trail to find that the Indians had halted.|$|E
60|$|Jean rode away {{to an open}} knoll a short {{distance}} from the house, and here he stationed himself to watch all points. The cedared <b>ridge</b> <b>back</b> of the ranch was the one approach by which Jorth's gang might come close without being detected, but even so, Jean could see them and ride to the house in time to prevent a surprise. The moments dragged by, {{and at the end of}} an hour Jean was in hopes that Blaisdell would soon come. These hopes were well founded. Presently he heard a clatter of hoofs on hard ground to the south, and upon wheeling to look he saw the friendly neighbor coming fast along the road, riding a big white horse. Blaisdell carried a rifle in his hand, and the sight of him gave Jean a glow of warmth. He was one of the Texans who would stand by the Isbels to the last man. Jean watched him ride to the house--watched the meeting between him and his lifelong friend. There floated out to Jean old Blaisdell's roar of rage.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{disqualification}} in the AKC {{standard for}} this breed is [...] "ridgelessness". This term {{refers to the}} purebred offspring of heterozygous parental animals that do not inherit {{a copy of the}} ridge mutation from either parent and are, in effect, normal dogs without a <b>ridged</b> <b>back.</b> The most current research suggests that the ridge mutation is autosomal dominant with complete penetrance. However, while the few studies that have analyzed the issue do not agree on the incidence of ridgelessness within the breed, they all show a ridgeless rate significantly lower than 25%, which cannot be explained using the Punnett square model for single gene/two allele inheritance.|$|R
5000|$|Rebbachisaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur of the {{superfamily}} Diplodocoidea, {{estimated at}} 14 m to 20 m in length, and 7 MT in weight, that lived during the Early-Late Cretaceous period in Africa about 99 million years ago. This massive four-legged plant-eating animal {{had a small}} head, a long, graceful neck and a whiplike tail. Rebbachisaurus is distinguished from other sauropods by its unusually tall, <b>ridged</b> <b>back.</b> The discovery of Rayososaurus, a South American sauropod nearly identical to Rebbachisaurus, supports the theory that {{there was still a}} land connection between Africa and South America during the Early Cretaceous, long after it was commonly thought the two continents had separated.|$|R
60|$|The desert {{began to}} lighten. Gray {{openings}} in the border of shrubby growths changed to paler hue. The road could be seen some rods ahead, and {{it had become a}} stony descent down, steadily down. Dark, <b>ridged</b> <b>backs</b> of mountains bounded the horizon, and all seemed near at hand, hemming in the plain. In the east a white glow grew brighter and brighter, reaching up to a line of cloud, defined sharply below by a rugged notched range. Presently a silver circle rose behind the black mountain, and the gloom of the desert underwent a transformation. From a gray mantle it changed to a transparent haze. The moon was rising.|$|R

From the River to Metairie Ridge the upper boundrary is Canal Street, New Orleans, across which is the 3rd Ward, and the lower boundary is St. Louis Street, across which is the 5th Ward. This portion was the original 4th Ward as defined in 1852. In 1880 additional ground (still mostly undeveloped swamp at the time) {{was added to the}} Ward from City Park Avenue on Metairie <b>Ridge</b> <b>back</b> to the lake.

Myola 2 was developed as the major resupply point as the Australian forces advanced, following the Japanese forces as they withdrew from Ioribaiwa <b>Ridge</b> <b>back</b> toward Kokoda. A strip was developed at Myola 2, being a larger area but it was considered too risky for general use.

It was found in 1963 by the Speleologists Club and excavated by Father Hours. Flint tools found in the deposit were geometric in design and suggested to be a form of Natufian or later Mesolithic than discovered at Jeita II, from where it may have been displaced. Forms of these flints included rectangles with straight or oblique truncation, borers of the [...] "crochet" [...] type, micro-burins, end scrapers, bladelet cores, two transverse arrowheads, crescents and short triangles.

50|$|Donna {{returned}} to LA in 2006, and immediately {{began trying to}} persuade her sister Brooke, who had now married Nick Marone, to take <b>Ridge</b> <b>back,</b> reminding her of how long she had fought to keep him. When Donna was unsuccessful in convincing her sister to return to Ridge, she went after him herself. This eventually failed, when she realized that Brooke and Ridge would always be connected. She was then engaged to marry Thorne Forrester. However it ended soon after when Donna's younger sister, Katie revealed that Donna was only with Thorne out of spite and revenge rather than actual love. Donna then became involved with Eric Forrester who was still married. He later divorced Stephanie to be with Donna. This sparked a rivalry between Donna and Stephanie's younger sister Pamela who was desperate to see Stephanie and Eric reunite. Eric and Donna eventually married, much to Pam's dismay. However their marriage was not without problems. Eric's daughter Felicia had allied herself with her brothers, Thorne and Ridge, to eliminate Donna out of Forrester Creations, because of the supposed bad publicity {{that the company had}} received since Eric married Donna (of whom none of them approve). Their efforts had been not too well received by Eric, who was angry that his children aren't willing to give Donna a chance. Even their mother Stephanie encouraged them to drop their animosity toward her, if only for their father's sake.|$|E

In the brackish water of the Baltic Sea it usually does not surpass 20 cm. The body is ball-like. It has a knobbly, <b>ridged</b> <b>back</b> and three large bony tubercles on each flank. Its pelvic fins form suction discs which it uses to attach strongly to rocks or other surfaces. The head and the pectoral fins of males are larger than those of females. It has a jelly-like layer of fat under the skin which makes it appear to quiver when held in the hand. Its colour is highly variable; bluish, greyish, olive, yellowish or brownish.
