40|$|<b>Retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> is an {{instructional}} strategy designed to engage readers in analyzing and evaluating {{the quality of}} their own oral reading miscues. This study was concerned with exploring how <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> used as {{an instructional}} strategy with adults influenced both the reading process and the perceptions adult readers hold about that process. A pilot study with one adult reader was conducted to evaluate and modify <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> techniques used in previous research. The revised <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> procedures were then studied in-depth with two adult women. The subjects participated in weekly <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> sessions for approximately four months each. During those sessions, the readers analyzed their own miscues from the previous week's reading, and then tape-recorded a selection for analysis during the next <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> session. The subjects read materials from third-grade through college readability levels. When texts were grouped according to relative difficulty and analyzed using Procedure I of the Reading Miscue Inventory, each subject demonstrated improvement in utilizing reading strategies, as suggested by a reduction in miscues per hundred words and a strengthening of control over syntactic an semantic relationships in text. Analysis of the tape-recorded <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> sessions revealed over time that each subject shifted from a text reproduction model of the reading process to a model which placed importance on the construction of meaning. Those findings were corroborated by comparing each reader's responses to interview questions asked at the outset and conclusion of the study. Research findings indicated that <b>retrospective</b> miscue <b>analysis</b> used as an instructional strategy with adult readers was instrumental in moving readers toward more effective use of reading strategies and more positive and realistic perceptions about themselves as readers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{national}} model and analyze the value of a molecular epidemiological Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA fingerprint-outbreak database. Incidents were investigated by the United Kingdom PHLS Mycobacterium Reference Unit (MRU) from June 1997 to December 2001, inclusive. A total of 124 incidents involving 972 tuberculosis cases, including 520 patient cultures from referred incidents and 452 patient cultures related to two population studies, were examined by using restriction fragment length polymorphism IS 6110 fingerprinting and rapid epidemiological typing. Investigations were divided into the following three categories, reflecting different operational strategies: <b>retrospective</b> passive <b>analysis,</b> <b>retrospective</b> active <b>analysis,</b> and <b>retrospective</b> prospective <b>analysis.</b> The majority of incidents were in the <b>retrospective</b> passive <b>analysis</b> category, i. e., the individual submitting isolates has a suspicion they may be linked. Outbreaks were examined in schools, hospitals, farms, prisons, and public houses, and laboratory cross-contamination events and unusual clinical presentations were investigated. <b>Retrospective</b> active <b>analysis</b> involved a major outbreak centered on a high school. Contact tracing of a teenager with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis matched 14 individuals, including members of his class, and another 60 cases were identified in schools clinically and radiologically and by skin testing. <b>Retrospective</b> prospective <b>analysis</b> involved an outbreak of 94 isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis cases in London, United Kingdom, that began after cases were identified at one hospital in January 2000. Contact tracing and comparison with MRU databases indicated that the earliest matched case had occurred in 1995. Subsequently, the MRU changed to an active prospective analysis targeting linked isoniazid-monoresistant isolates for follow up. The patients were multiethnic, born mainly in the United Kingdom, and included professionals, individuals from the music industry, intravenous drug abusers, and prisoners...|$|R

25|$|Through a <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{national}} administrative data, {{the association between}} mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This “weekday effect” has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{estimate}} that 2-5% {{of those with}} peripheral nerve injury, and 13-70 percent of those with hemiplegia (paralysis of {{one side of the}} body), will develop CRPS. In addition, some studies have indicated that cigarette smoking was strikingly present in patients and is statistically linked to RSD. This may be involved in its pathology by enhancing sympathetic activity, vasoconstriction, or by some other unknown neurotransmitter-related mechanism. This hypothesis was based on a <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of 53 patients with RSD, which showed that 68% of patients and only 37% of controls were smokers. The results are preliminary and are limited by their retrospective nature. 7% of people who have CRPS in one limb later develop it in another limb.|$|E

25|$|No new {{guidelines}} dealing specifically with HPV+OPC have yet been developed, outside of clinical trials. Indirect data suggests {{the efficacy of}} less intense treatment. A <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of advanced (N+) HPV+OPC suggested 96% 5 year local control with deintensified radiation of 54Gy and concurrent cisplatin based chemotherapy. The conclusions of the above pair of similar phase II trials have been supported by several other phase II trials. A prospective trial (ECOG 1308) demonstrated similar locoregional control with 54Gy., and another study, a high pathological complete response rate at 60Gy. These studies all used well below the previous standard dose of 70Gy. Since long term toxicity is associated with radiation dose, determining the efficacy of lower and hence less morbid doses of radiation is a priority, since many HPV+ patients {{can be expected to}} have long term survival.|$|E
25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, a <b>retrospective</b> <b>analysis</b> (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (low, intermediate, and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation. Even if recurrence or metastases occur, HPV positivity still confers an advantage.|$|E
