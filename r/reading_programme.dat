40|$|Considering {{the poor}} {{state of the}} Nigerian reading culture, this paper went {{to look into the}} how school library {{programmes}} could be used to promote free voluntary reading thereby reviving the dilapidated reading culture. The main objectives of the study were to find out the school library <b>reading</b> <b>programmes</b> employed in promoting free voluntary reading of secondary school students and examine the influence of school library <b>reading</b> <b>programmes</b> on free voluntary reading. The study was a survey; the population comprised of 36 secondary schools from where 27 were sampled with about 1000 student users of the school libraries. Questionnaires and interview (for the teacher librarians) were used to collect data which was analyzed using frequencies, percentages, averages, and presented in tables and pie chart. Multiple Regression analysis (at 0. 05 level of significance) was used to test the null hypothesis. Major findings showed that access to reading materials, lending of books for personal reading, debate and assistance in selection of books for personal <b>reading</b> were <b>programmes</b> employed by school libraries; there is a strong positive correlation between school library programmes and free voluntary reading of secondary school students and hypothesis testing showed that there is a relationship between school library reading prograrmmes and free voluntary reading...|$|R

50|$|Craigie was {{followed}} by Professor A. J. Aitken, who endorsed Craigie's principles, but he was nonetheless aware that {{the coverage of the}} language provided in Volumes I and II still had some room for improvement. He more than doubled the number of source texts read for the dictionary and launched a new <b>reading</b> <b>programme,</b> with more than 50 new voluntary excerptors, reading both printed editions and, mostly on microfilm, manuscripts. Aitken also widened the scope of the editing. Under his regime sense analysis was refined and the illustration of usage came more and more to be considered an important part of an entry. As regards coverage, Aitken aimed at exhaustiveness for the pre-1600 linguistic record. At the same time however, he continued Craigie's policy of filtering out material belonging to the 17th century.|$|E
5000|$|Owing to the {{shifting}} debate over time (see [...] "History and Controversy" [...] below), many school systems, such as California's, have made {{major changes in}} the method they have used to teach early reading. Today, most [...] teachers combine phonics with the elements of whole language that focus on reading comprehension. Adams and the National Reading Panel advocate for a comprehensive <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> that includes several different sub-skills, based on scientific research. This combined approach is sometimes called balanced literacy, although some researchers assert that balanced literacy is merely whole language called by another name. Proponents of various approaches generally agree that a combined approach is important. A few stalwarts favour isolated instruction in Synthetic phonics and introduction to reading comprehension only after children have mastered sound-symbol correspondences. On the other side, some whole language supporters are unyielding in arguing that phonics should be taught little, if at all.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} benefits Stanger Secondary has gained from the twinning agreement is the construction of a state-of-the-art Learning Centre {{at the heart of the}} school.

Construction began in May 2008 and completed in November 2008. The Centre was officially opened on 19 March 2009 in a function graced by many local representatives in education as well as the Kwazulu Natal Minister of Education, Ina Cronje. The Centre's first manager was Mrs E. Hendricks.The centre aims to be a multimedia and literacy hub. Literacy, being a major problem in the school, is tackled by means of a Reading Assistance Programme. Since the start of 2009, reading assists were employed by the Fundanami Trust to assist Grade 8 learners who possess a very low reading age. The learners are identified by means of a Reading Test conducted early in the academic year. Learners who progress in their reading age are rewarded with a Participation Certificate. The first two certificates were presented at the centre's official opening on 19 March 2009 by Mike Wood of the Fundanami Trust.In addition to the <b>Reading</b> <b>Programme,</b> the centre is also utilized for a period called [...] "Special English" [...] (for Grades 8 to 12) - basically a Library Period where learners are encouraged to borrow books and read.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. The {{intention}} of this mini-dissertation {{was to establish}} {{the success of a}} specific computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> presented at a selected secondary school. The Selected School admitted a growing number of learners {{during the past few years}} whose reading skills were so limited that their scholastic track record was affected, creating a substantial problem for the school. To address this predicament the school decided to establish a computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> consisting of selected software available in a computer reading lab, as well as reading guidance in the media centre. It was available to all the learners from grade eight to grade ten, regardless of their reading abilities. The Grade 11 and 12 learners who experienced learning problems also participated in the programme. The ulterior aim was to establish whether the <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> complied with the initial expectations of the school. To answer this question the programme was researched and evaluated as a unit. The various aspects of the <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> were included in the research and the initial anticipation of the school was taken into account. The research methodology was that of a case study. A single 'case', namely; The Selected School's computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme,</b> was studied in depth. The computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> was investigated as a unit and explored in depth. This study was an empirical qualitative inquiry that investigated a contemporary phenomenon namely the <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> in its real life context at the Selected School over a single time period. The research question of this study asked how it could be established to what extent a computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> is presented successfully in a secondary school context. The answer to the research question was guided by answering several sub questions: how effective the programme was in providing reading instruction, how effective the software design was, how the learners and teachers experienced the computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme,</b> and how usable the software was that was utilised in the computer-based <b>reading</b> <b>programme.</b> Preparatory literature studies were conducted to provide a theoretical background and to extend my knowledge as researcher. This was an ongoing process throughout the research study. The literature study served as a basis to analyse and interpret the data, and gave a broader insight into the field of computer-based reading for learners at secondary schools. It study provided a holistic indication of the current level of knowledge, important issues and recent developments in this field. After analysing the data the conclusion was drawn that the <b>reading</b> <b>programme,</b> as it was presented at The Selected School, did have the capacity to provide effective reading instruction to the School's secondary school learners. Mostly, the design of the educational reading software complied with the criteria for effective educational design of educational software. It is believed that the software may be effectively used in educational environments for reading education. Both learners and teachers experienced the <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> as a successful resource that could be utilised and applied to their benefit. The reading software complied with all the criteria of usability and the conclusion was drawn that it is useful in a secondary school context to supply reading instruction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Providing {{access to}} quality {{education}} {{should be viewed as}} a social responsibility. And the backbone of a good education system lies in its ability to promote literacy among the community, particularly the children. This paper reports the findings of a study conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a supplementary <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> conducted in remote schools in the states of Sabah and Sarawak, Malaysia. Using the qualitativenaturalistic framework to programme evaluation proposed by Patton (2001) and Guba and Lincoln (1981, 1992) and using a mixed-method approach comprising quantitative and qualitative data collection and analytic techniques, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 2, 734 students and 142 teachers from 40 primary schools in Sabah and Sarawak and triangulated with qualitative data from the interviews of students and teachers as well as observations of their reactions to the programme and reading camps. The results suggest that the supplementary <b>reading</b> <b>programme</b> has improved the students ’ attitudes towards reading, motivated them to read extensively and improved their reading habits.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 78 - 90. There is {{evidence}} that many primary school teachers of English Second Language (EL 2) are inadequately equipped to teach reading comprehension skills. They test their pupils on literal, {{at the expense of}} inferential, reading skills. This investigation therefore sought to test the literal and inferential reading comprehension skills of a group of Afrikaans-speaking EL 2 teacher trainees and to design a <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>programme</b> which would improve their thinking skills over a period of nine months. The students were also instructed in a programmed reading course (the SRA Reading Laboratory) to determine its efficacy in improving their thinking skills. A further objective was to establish whether a programmed reading course or the author's cognitive <b>reading</b> development <b>programme</b> benefitted high-status (proficient in English) more than low-status (less proficient) EL 2 students and what effects the two different programmes would exert on their reading comprehension skills a year after formal instruction in reading comprehension ceased. It was found that specific sequences of the two different instructional programmes were associated with significant changes in the students' reading comprehension scores. It was also found that, while high-status students benefitted sooner from the author's cognitive <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>programme,</b> that approach was also ultimately beneficial for low-status students. It is suggested that cognitive <b>reading</b> development <b>programmes</b> be implemented at primary, secondary and tertiary institutions where language skills and levels of meaningful reading need to be raised...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the best practices implemented by four Excellent Principals who have won wide recognition in reading activities. This qualitative research used purposive sampling. The sample consisted of four Excellent Principals and four State Educational Technology officers. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and later analysed using the content analysis method. The ATLAS. ti software {{was used to determine}} the themes and sub-themes, and to further answer the research questions. Murphy’s Reading-based Leadership Function (2004) served as a theoretical framework. The study found that there were ten leading practices adopted by the principals, i. e. 1) emphasised reading as priority, 2) developed quality <b>reading</b> <b>programmes,</b> 3) created a reading environment, 4) established a comprehensive reading system, 5) believed that all students could read, 6) supported teachers to carry out activities, 7) developed leadership capacities, 8) implemented performance assessment and monitoring, 9) nurtured relationships with student and 10) held activities with PTA. Data also showed that all the principals involved in the study acted as problem solvers, were knowledgeable in reading, were {{the driving force behind the}} teachers and students as well as became their role models. Input from this study can be used as guidance for principals to implement <b>reading</b> <b>programmes</b> in schools more effectively.
