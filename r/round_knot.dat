"Compositionally, the {{vertical}} and horizontal geometry of the bridge and its reflection in the water create a great central cross which imparts a classical symmetry and equilibrium to the canvas. [...] This central geometric framework, which is echoed and enclosed by the bands of sky above and the bank below, is relieved and enlivened by the great undulating sweep {{of the hill and}} shore, the <b>round</b> <b>knot</b> of washerwomen amid the circular ripples of the water, and the flexible, slightly curved grasses at the right.

It is small truly, so small that I can barely see it, nevertheless it is not {{more than half a}} bow-shot off. Do you object to make that your mark?" ...|$|E
60|$|Captain JOHN FORBES of New, aged forty-five years, married, who being solemnly sworn, purged of malice {{and partial}} council, {{examined}} and interrogate, Depones, That James Small having suggested to the deponent {{that it might}} be proper that Duncan Clerk the panel's wife, should be examined upon what rings she had in her possession, and that some other witnesses in relation thereto, might be precognosced, presented a petition to the deponent, as the next Justice of Peace to where she lived, craving, to the purpose above mentioned: That the deponent went for that end to Braemaar; and she being summoned to appear at the Castletown of Braemaar, appeared before the deponent, and declared, in substance, as follows: That since she was married, a small brass ring, which she then presented to the deponent, and a gold ring which she got from her mother, and wore sometimes, were the only rings that she had since her marriage; and that before her marriage she got a copper ring from one Allan M'Donald, brother to James Macdonald, in Allanquoich, with a <b>round</b> <b>knot</b> of the same metal raised upon it, which, the summer before she was married, she gave to Alexander M'Intosh alias Rioch, then a glen-herd, and now servant to Thomas Gordon in Fetherletter, in Strathaven, and that she was married to the said Duncan Clerk, panel, in harvest 1751. Causa scienti√¶ patet. And this is the truth, as he shall answer to God.|$|E
50|$|The most {{frequently}} represented animals are rodents, bats, peccaries and growling jaguars. Strips frequently applied with grooves, are disposed in spiral or long circles.

50|$|In {{sedimentology}} and geology, a nodule is small, irregularly <b>rounded</b> <b>knot,</b> mass, or lump of {{a mineral}} or mineral aggregate that typically has a contrasting composition, {{such as a}} pyrite nodule in coal, a chert nodule in limestone, or a phosphorite nodule in marine shale, from the enclosing sediment or sedimentary rock. Normally, a nodule has a warty or knobby surface and exists as a discrete mass within the host strata. In general, they lack any internal structure except for the preserved remnants of original bedding or fossils. Nodules {{are closely related to}} concretions and sometimes these terms are used interchangeably. Minerals that typically form nodules include calcite, chert, apatite (phosphorite), anhydrite, and pyrite.|$|R
50|$|The lace is made {{by tying}} knots, usually tied onto the {{previous}} round of the piece creating small loops of thread onto which the next <b>round</b> of <b>knots</b> can be tied. Patterns are created by varying {{the length of the}} loops, missing loops from the previous round, adding extra loops and similar.|$|R

60|$|She went on, drawing near. She {{was aware}} of the great flash of hoofs, a bluish, {{iridescent}} flash surrounding a hollow of darkness. Large, large seemed the bluish, incandescent flash of the hoof-iron, large as a halo of lightning <b>round</b> the <b>knotted</b> darkness of the flanks. Like circles of lightning came the flash of hoofs from out of the powerful flanks.|$|R

60|$|Of {{course he}} did not see her. Flame-lit and unseeing! Always the same, with his meeting eyebrows, his common cap, and his red-and-black scarf <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> his throat. Not even a collar to meet her! The flames had sunk, there was shadow.|$|R
60|$|Tramping {{down the}} riding we met two boys, fifteen or sixteen years old. Their clothes were largely patched with tough cotton moleskin; scarves were <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> their throats, {{and in their}} pockets rolled tin bottles full of tea, and the white knobs of their knotted snap-bags.|$|R
60|$|He {{started at}} the funereal aspect of the room, into which, since he last stood there, undertakers seemed to have stolen. The {{curtains}} of the window were festooned with long weepers of crape. The {{four corners of the}} red cloth on the <b>round</b> table were <b>knotted</b> with crape.|$|R
60|$|A British crew went to its {{quarters}} {{in those days}} with the quiet serenity of men on their daily routine. In a few minutes, without fuss or sound, the sailors were <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> their guns, the marines were drawn up and leaning on their muskets, and the frigate's bowsprit pointed straight for her little victim.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now, Buckskin," [...] said Roy, soothingly, and {{he slowly}} {{approached}} the quivering animal. He went closer, hand over hand, on the lasso. Buckskin showed {{the whites of}} his eyes and also his white teeth. But he stood while Roy loosened the loop and, slipping it down over his head, fastened it in a complicated <b>knot</b> <b>round</b> his nose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{three men}} were then tied with ropes to the guns, their backs against the muzzle. The rope, {{fastened}} {{to one of}} the spokes of the wheel, passed with a <b>knot</b> <b>round</b> the arms, over the muzzle of the gun, round the other arm, and then to the spoke of the opposite wheel, which kept the body fixed.|$|R

"For their {{performance}} the dancers usually wore their normal working clothes - brown fustian trousers, striped shirt with red muffler <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> the neck, navy blue jacket and soft cap. They danced {{in their everyday}} clogs though these were usually somewhat lighter in weight than those worn {{by the majority of}} weavers...the street dancers normally belonged to a set of rather dandified working youths and the lighter clog was part of their accepted dress." ...|$|R
50|$|A rope pump {{is a kind}} of pump where a loose {{hanging rope}} is lowered down into a well and drawn up through a long pipe with the bottom {{immersed}} in water. On the rope, <b>round</b> disks or <b>knots</b> matching the diameter of the pipe are attached which pull the water to the surface. It is commonly used in developing countries for both community supply and self-supply of water and can be installed on boreholes or hand-dug wells.|$|R

60|$|He {{expected}} her to join him and her mother in being amused at this, but he was as well pleased to have her touched at his having brought them, and to turn their gaiety off in praise of the roses. She got a vase for them, {{and set it on}} the table. He noticed for the first time the pretty house-dress she had on, with its barred corsage and under-skirt, and the heavy silken rope <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> it at the waist, and dropping in heavy tufts or balls in front.|$|R

[...] "If I could win you----" [...] His tongue tied itself in a bow <b>knot</b> <b>round</b> his uvula, and he could say no more. He moved slowly to the door, paused with his fingers on the handle for one last look over his shoulder, and walked silently into the cupboard where Eunice's aunt kept her collection of dried seaweed.|$|R
50|$|Halters may be {{classified}} into two broad categories, {{depending on whether}} the material used is flat or round. Materials include cured leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Leather and rawhide may be flat or rolled. Fibers may be woven into flat webbing or twisted into round rope. Flat or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles or rings at attachment points; <b>round</b> materials are <b>knotted</b> or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen rabbit {{atrioventricular}} nodes {{were studied}} both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Two of these nodes were subsequently recon-structed in three-dimensional fashion. From the morphological standpoint, {{it was shown}} that the atrioventricular node was divided into a smaller enclosed portion and a larger open portion by a fibrous collar derived from the central fibrous body. Three distinct nodal cell types were identified within these nodal segments. The open node was mostly occupied by transitional cells which merged proximalry with the atrial myocardium. As they entered the enclosed node, some of these transitional cells merged into a knot of midnodal cells. Others passed circumferentially <b>round</b> this <b>knot</b> and together with the mid-nodal cells, joined with a tract of lower nodal cells. The latter cells were continuous with the His bundle anteriorly, but they also extended into the open node posteriorly. It was possible to correlate the activation sequence of the node accurately with the disposition of these cells. Using both reconstruc...|$|R

Is it firm? Yes, capitally. Now, Alex, make a sailor's <b>knot</b> <b>round</b> it. Help me down first though--thank you. Fred, will you trim that branch into something like shape. You see how I mean. We must have a long drooping wreath of holly and ivy, to blend with the screen. How tough this ivy is! Thank you--that's it. Well, Mr. Franklin, I hope we shall get on in time." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{reached a}} certain well, planted round, in {{the taste of}} Labassecour, with an orderly circle of lime-trees: here a halt was called; on the green swell of ground {{surrounding}} this well, we were ordered to be seated, Monsieur taking his place in our midst, and suffering us to gather in a <b>knot</b> <b>round</b> him. Those who liked him more than they feared, came close, and these were chiefly little ones; those who feared more than they liked, kept somewhat aloof; those in whom much affection had given, even to what remained of fear, a pleasurable zest, observed the greatest distance.|$|R
60|$|Girty lay on {{a buffalo}} robe near a barred door. Beyond him sat Kate, huddled {{in one corner of}} the cabin. A long {{buckskin}} thong was <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> her waist, and tied to a log. Her hair was matted and tangled, and on her face and arms were many discolored bruises. Worse still, in her plaintive moaning, in the meaningless movement of her head, in her vacant expression, was proof that her mind had gone. She was mad. Even as an agonizing pity came over Joe, to be followed by the surging fire of rage, blazing up in his breast, he could not but thank God that she was mad! It was merciful that Kate was no longer conscious of her suffering.|$|R
60|$|Laying {{one hand}} on the low wall, Warwick vaulted over with a {{backward}} glance at Moor, who followed to the gateway, there to wait till the adieux were over. Very brief they were, and presently Warwick reappeared, evidently touched yet ill-pleased at something, for he both smiled and frowned as he paused on the threshold as if loth to go. A little white goat came skipping from the orchard, and seeing the stranger took refuge at Warwick's knee. The act of the creature seemed to suggest a thought to the man. Pulling off the gay handkerchief some grateful woman had <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> his neck, he fastened it about the goat's, having secured something in one end, then rose as if content.|$|R
60|$|Not {{another word}} was spoken. Noiselessly the little party {{made their way}} to the roof; there one end of the rope was quickly <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> the battlement. Archie grasped the good priest's hand, and kissed that of the girl; and then, {{swinging}} himself off the battlement, disappeared at once in the darkness. Not a sound was heard for some time, then the listening pair above heard a faint splash in the water. The priest laid his hands on the rope and found that it swung slack in the air; he hauled it up and twisted it again round his waist. As he passed the door of the cell he pushed it to and replaced the bars and bolts, and then with his charge regained the portion of the castle inhabited by the family.|$|R
60|$|There is a cry {{in answer}} to the peewits, echoing louder and {{stronger}} the lamentation of the lapwings, a wail which hushes the birds. The men come over the brow of the hill, slowly, with the old squire walking tall and straight in front; six bowed men bearing the coffin on their shoulders, treading heavily and cautiously, under the great weight of the glistening white coffin; six men following behind, ill at ease, waiting their turn for the burden. You can see the red handkerchiefs <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> their throats, and their shirt-fronts blue and white between the open waistcoats. The coffin is of new unpolished wood, gleaming and glistening in the sunlight; the men who carry it remember all their lives after the smell of new, warm elm-wood.|$|R
50|$|The kissar (also spelled kissir), or Gytarah barbaryeh, {{the ancient}} Nubian lyre, {{still in use}} in Egypt and Abyssinia. It {{consists}} of a body having instead of the traditional tortoise-shell back, a shallow, round bowl of wood, covered with a soundboard of sheepskin, in which are three small round sound-holes. The arms, set through the soundboard at points distant about the third of the diameter from the circumference, have the familiar fan shape. Five gut strings, <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> the bar and raised from the soundboard {{by means of a}} bridge tailpiece similar to that in use on the modern guitar, are plucked by means of a plectrum by the right hand for the melody, while the left hand sometimes twangs some of the strings as a soft drone accompaniment.|$|R
6000|$|The showman {{stood by}} the tent, a gaudy silk scarf <b>knotted</b> <b>round</b> his neck. My lean-breasted gipsy woman {{spangled}} there beside him, with her black hair looped round her narrow bony head, and her loose, dusty, puckered boots showing beneath her skirts. There was a clear lustre in the lamp-starred air; and the spectacle of man and woman, of resting wheel and cropping horse, meadow and hill, poured a livelong blessing into my heart. Even the cowed, enfeebled lion with the mange of age and captivity in his skin, seemed to drowse content, and the satin-skinned leopards--almost within pat of paw of the flaxen-haired girl in the white stockings who leaned idly against the wheel--paced their den as if in pride. It was the same old story: my heart could not contain it all. Yet to whom tell its secrets? ...|$|R
60|$|Dale {{stood near}} {{with a broad}} smile on his face. Helen was within earshot, {{watching}} {{from the edge of}} the park, and she felt so fascinated and frightened that she could not call out for Bo to stop. The little gray mustang was a beauty, clean-limbed and racy, with long black mane and tail, and a fine, spirited head. There was a blanket strapped on his back, but no saddle. Bo held the short halter that had been fastened in a hackamore <b>knot</b> <b>round</b> his nose. She wore no coat; her blouse was covered with grass and seeds, and it was open at the neck; her hair hung loose and disheveled; one side of her face bore a stain of grass and dirt and a suspicion of blood; the other was red and white; her eyes blazed; beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her cheeks. As she began to strain on the halter, pulling herself closer to the fiery pony, the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and strong.|$|R
