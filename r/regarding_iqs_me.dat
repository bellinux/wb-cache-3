Clinical psychologists generally <b>regard</b> <b>IQ</b> scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes. In a survey of 661 randomly sampled psychologists and educational researchers, published in 1988, Mark Snyderman and Stanley Rothman reported a general consensus supporting the validity of IQ testing.

Unfortunately, not much is known on the prognosis of CLRE; it is assumed to be somewhere between the benign course of many idiopathic epilepsies and the more malignant course of most symptomatic epilepsies. The risk of cognitive decline over time seems to be increased for children with epilepsy, but no data are available specifically for CLRE. This study was a systematic cross-sectional open clinical and non-randomized investigation, which included 68 children with CLRE, 24 children with symptomatic localization related epilepsy (SLRE) and 21 children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). One-way between-groups ANOVAs with Tukey post hoc testing were used to test differences in demographical variables and IQ between CLRE, SLRE and IGE and to test the influence of duration of epilepsy and other epilepsy factors on IQ. To test whether there were IQ differences between the three types of epilepsy regarding duration of epilepsy and other epilepsy factors, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used. In CLRE, intelligence is stable over time; IQ scores do neither improve nor deteriorate. Age at onset, seizure type, seizure frequency and the use of AED appeared to have no influence on intelligence in CLRE.

40|$|Introduction: Fluid {{intelligence}} {{is described as}} ability to rapidly solve novel problems and capacity to manage and easily adapt to new situations. Crystallized intelligence reflects ability to timely use lifetime-learned information and skills. Bearing in mind that {{intelligence is}} one of the impaired cognitive functions in psychosis, a question arises there are if any sex differences in patients, <b>regarding</b> total <b>IQ,</b> fluid or crystallized intelligence. Aim: To evaluate sex differences in psychosis and to analyze the differences between patients and sex, age and origin matched healthy controls. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated schizophrenia spectrum patients (F 20 - 29 based on ICD 10; n = 52, age = 29, 3 ± 5, 9 years, illness duration < 10 years) and controls (n = 51, age = 29, 8 ± 6, 3 years). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. Results: Analyzing sex differences in total IQ, fluid and crystalized IQ, it has been found that women exhibited lower crystallized intelligence scores both in the patient group (p = 0, 039) and in the control group (p = 0, 016). Among male patients, lower scores were found in comparison to the healthy male controls in all of the categories, while female patients scores in crystallized intelligence were not significantly different in comparison to female healthy group ((p = 0, 160). Conclusion: In the male subjects with psychosis, a deficit was found in both subdomains of intelligence, while in female subjects it was found in fluid intelligence only. Factors which could serve as protective from greater cognitive impairment in female patients need further evaluation, as a sign of potential mechanisms that could ameliorate the course and prognosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders...|$|R

METHODS: Teachers of nine public schools of Barão Geraldo, Campinas, Brazil completed a questionnaire. Two researchers had meetings with teachers, presenting the Global Campaign "Epilepsy out of the shadows", when the questionnaire was first completed by all attendees. Twenty teachers of these schools were motivated to attend a training course entitled "Epilepsy and Health" {{as part of their}} continuous education programme. Two years later the same questionnaire was again completed (post-test) by these 20 teachers. RESULTS: 100 teachers originally completed the questionnaire (97 women, mean age 42 years, 64 married). Forty-three percent of teachers said that they had enough knowledge regarding epilepsy and 20 % said that they had poor knowledge about the condition. <b>Regarding</b> the <b>IQ</b> of children with epilepsy, 45 % of teachers believed that they had average IQ, 18 % above average, six percent under average and 29 % did not know.

Visual perception, visuomotor integration (p≤ 0. 001), and executive functions (Rey figure copy: p= 0. 05) were also affected. Patients with CHD also had lower scores on all motor domains (p< 0. 02) except static balance. Psychological adjustment was affected only in the 'peer relationship' domain (p= 0. 05). Quality of life was similar to that of typically developing peers. INTERPRETATION: Adolescents with CHD may manifest persistent cognitive and motor impairments, while psychological adjustment and self-reported HRQoL are mostly typical. Thus, long-term neurodevelopmental evaluations are necessary to provide early educational and therapeutic support...|$|R

This study investigated empathy and facial expression recognition in offenders with intellectual disabilities in different levels of secure care. Thirty adult, male offenders with an intellectual disability participated, of whom 15 were recruited from low-secure units, and 15 were recruited from medium-secure units. All participants were administered the Basic Empathy Scale (BES; Jolliffe & Farrington, 2006) and the adult photos from the Receptive Facial Expressions Subtest of the Diagnostic Assessment of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA; Nowicki & Duke, 1994). Information <b>regarding</b> the participants’ <b>IQ</b> was obtained from their clinical files. There {{was no significant difference}} in empathy and facial expression recognition accuracy between offenders with intellectual disabilities in low-secure and medium-secure units. Within both groups, there was no significant association between empathy and IQ, and empathy and facial expression recognition accuracy. There was no significant association between facial expression recognition accuracy and IQ in the medium-secure group. However, a significant association was found between these variables in the low-secure group. Empathy and IQ were not significant predictors of facial expression recognition accuracy in either of the groups. The limitations and implications of the research are discussed, and suggestions are made regarding future empirical work in this area. University of Leiceste...|$|R
40|$|Mieloningocele ocorre em frequência aproximada de 0, 4 por 1000 nascidos vivos e está associada a hidrocefalia em 85 % a 90 %, sendo as avaliações sobre cognição esparsas na literatura. Quarenta e cinco crianças com hidrocefalia derivada e mielomeningocele foram analisadas quanto ao QI, que foi estatisticamente correlacionado com o nível motor, idade da primeira derivação, número de revisões, infecção e perímetro cefálico. A idade média foi 7, 5 anos (3 a 15 anos), 16 eram do sexo masculino e 29 eram do sexo feminino. Três (6, 6 %) obtiveram escore de QI > 110, 11 (24, 5 %) entre 100 - 110, 8 (17, 7 %) entre 85 - 100, 16 (35, 5 %) entre 70 - 85 e 7 (15, 5 %) entre 50 - 70. O QI correlacionou-se diretamente com o nível motor, sendo o resultado cognitivo melhor, em ordem decrescente, nos níveis sacral (t 0, 0055), lombar baixo (t 0, 0119) e lombar alto (t 0, 0226). Houve melhor desempenho cognitivo nas crianças operadas até 7 dias de vida (t 0, 0099), decrescendo progressivamente o resultado a partir do primeiro mês, não existindo diferença significativa entre 7 a 31 dias (t 0, 1013). Houve pior resultado no grupo que apresentou infecção do sistema de derivação (t 0, 0146). O prognóstico foi progressivamente pior de acordo com o número de revisões. O melhor resultado foi encontrado nas crianças com perímetro cefálico na média (t 0, 0115); resultado intermediário entre [...] 1 DP (desvio padrão) e a média (t 0, 0130) e entre a média e + 1 DP (t 0, 0256). Os piores resultados cognitivos foram encontrados nos extremos > 1 DP (t 0, 0269) e Myelomeningocele {{occurs in}} 0. 4 for 1000 {{neonates}} and {{is associated with}} hydrocephalus in 85 - 90 %, and reports on cognition are sparsely found in literature. Forty five children with treated hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele were studied in <b>regard</b> of <b>IQ,</b> and statistically correlated to functional motor level, age of the first shunt, number of revisions of shunt, infection of the shunt and circumference of the head. The medium age was of 7. 5 years (3 - 15 years), 16 males and 29 females. Three (6. 6 %) had a IQ score > 110, 11 (24. 4 %) had a score between 100 - 110, 8 between 85 - 100 (17. 7 %), 16 (35. 5 %) between 85 - 100 (17. 7 %) and 7 (15. 5 %) between 50 - 70. IQ directly correlated with motor level, having better cognitive results the children with minor functional motor disabilities. Cognition was best in children operated until the seven day of life (t 0. 0099), with progressive worse results in children operated after {{the first month of}} life, no significance was observed in children operated in the period 7 to 31 days (t 0. 1013). Worse results were observed in the group of patients with infection of shunts (t 0. 0146). Results were progressively worse with reoperations. The best results in relation of the circumference of the head were seen with children in the medium range (t 0. 0115); intermediate results were seen in patients between the medium range and- 1 SD (t 0. 00130) and medium range and + 1 SD. The worse results were seen in patients at the extremes of > 1 SD (t 0. 0269) and < 1 SD (t 0. 0042). According to cognitive results the surgical treatment of hydrocephalus have to be done until the first month of life, avoiding reoperations and infections that have unfavorable impact in IQ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} {{in a town}} of Brazil the knowledge, {{attitude and}} perception of epilepsy in teachers of elementary schools and to compare these before and after a training exercise. METHODS: Teachers of nine public schools of Barão Geraldo, Campinas, Brazil completed a questionnaire. Two researchers had meetings with teachers, presenting the Global Campaign "Epilepsy out of the shadows", when the questionnaire was first completed by all attendees. Twenty teachers of these schools were motivated to attend a training course entitled "Epilepsy and Health" {{as part of their}} continuous education programme. Two years later the same questionnaire was again completed (post-test) by these 20 teachers. RESULTS: 100 teachers originally completed the questionnaire (97 women, mean age 42 years, 64 married). Forty-three percent of teachers said that they had enough knowledge regarding epilepsy and 20 % said that they had poor knowledge about the condition. <b>Regarding</b> the <b>IQ</b> of children with epilepsy, 45 % of teachers believed that they had average IQ, 18 % above average, six percent under average and 29 % did not know. Teachers believed that children with epilepsy have a higher possibility of acquiring mental disease in the future (51 %); that epilepsy is a disease (68 %); that epilepsy is contagious (1 %); epilepsy is treatable (90 %). After the course, the teachers’ beliefs seem to have improved. DISCUSSION: This work with elementary school teachers identified difficulties related to epilepsy which, if addressed, may help promote better quality of life of people with epilepsy in the community and help to decrease stigma attached to the condition. Better informed teachers are likely to have a more positive attitude and this will be passed to others. Educational campaigns about epilepsy amongst teachers should be encouraged as this may improve the management of epilepsy, by helping to develop a well informed and tolerant community. OBJETIVO: Identificar atitudes e percepção dos professores do ensino fundamental a respeito da epilepsia, antes e depois de um curso específico sobre o tema. MÉTODO: Participaram da pesquisa professores de nove escolas da rede pública do ensino fundamental de Barão Geraldo, distrito de Campinas, SP. Dois pesquisadores reuniram-se com os professores e apresentaram a Campanha Global "Epilepsia fora das sombras", momento também em que os questionários foram aplicados. Vinte professores ficaram motivados para fazer o curso de extensão "Temas transversais: epilepsia e saúde". Após este curso, os questionários foram re-aplicados. RESULTADOS: Foram aplicados 100 questionários em professores das nove escolas, sendo que: noventa e sete professores eram do sexo feminino, idade média de 42 (D. P. 22 a 63) e 64 estavam casados. Quarenta e três professores declararam possuir conhecimento sobre epilepsia abaixo da média e 20, disseram possuir um pobre conhecimento sobre a condição. No que diz respeito à idéias sobre epilepsia, os professores acham que: as crianças com epilepsia tem QI igual (45 %), na média (18 %), abaixo da média (6 %) e não sabem opinar (29 %); crianças com epilepsia têm maior chance de terem doença mental no futuro (51 %); a epilepsia é uma doença (68 %); a epilepsia é contagiosa (1 %); a epilepsia é tratável (90 %). Após o curso, crenças e mitos sobre epilepsia dos professores mostraram diferenças significativas. DISCUSSÃO: Idéias errôneas sobre epilepsia podem ser mudadas através de cursos educacionais sobre epilepsia. Este trabalho, realizado com professores do ensino fundamental, visou a identificação das dificuldades relacionadas à epilepsia para promover a redução do estigma. É importante que professores sejam melhor instruídos sobre a epilepsia para consequentemente, ter atitudes mais positivas em relação às crianças com epilepsia. Acreditamos que professores mais capacitados melhoram a maneira de lidar e de se relacionar com crianças com epilepsia, para a construção de uma comunidade bem informada e mais tolerante para lidar com as diferenças...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 This {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} the work values of tenth grade girls {{and their relationship to}} the girls' aspirations and expectations for future education and marriage-career roles. The instrument employed for the value measurement was the Work Values Inventory of Super (1968). An original questionnaire was developed by the researcher to determine the subject's age, her aspirations and expectations, and the occupational status of both parents. Nine authorities composing a committee of judges reviewed the questionnaire for its technical aspects and passed upon the ability of this age group to understand the questions as worded. The Work Values Inventory and questionnaire then were pretested. After some revision of the questionnaire, both instruments were administered to 503 tenth grade girls within five randomly selected Oregon high schools. Usable responses were provided by 488 subjects. The conclusions that may be drawn from the descriptive and statistical treatment of the data are as follows: 1. Consistent with Super's (1970) report, the work values most important to girls of this grade level are Way of Life and Altruism. Values least emphasized are Management and Esthetics. 2. Some further education or training beyond high school is the wish of about two-thirds of the girls though the expectation of a slightly smaller percentage. Approximately three-fourths want to delay marriage a year or two after high school graduation in order to obtain such education or in order to be gainfully employed for this time. A slightly greater percentage expect to delay marriage for these reasons. Slightly over 90 percent wish to marry and plan to do so. All but about seven percent want and expect to have children, about half of the group desiring two children and anticipating that they will bear this number. In regard to future work outside of the home, almost 50 percent want to enter occupations in the professional-technical category and slightly over one-third anticipate that they will. The occupations of teacher and nurse account for about 20 percent of all desired occupations and only a slightly smaller percentage of those the girls expect to enter. Secretary is the single occupational title most often mentioned among either aspirations or expectations. Over 95 percent of the girls both want and expect to work outside of the home in the future, about 40 percent wishing to integrate such work with marriage and child-rearing responsibilities in a discontinuous work pattern and about an equal percentage planning to do so. 3. Results of analysis of variance indicate that scores for individual work values differ significantly (p <. 05) among girls who differ in regard to achievement-test scores, the fathers' current employment or unemployment, socioeconomic levels of the fathers' occupations; and either aspirations or expectations regarding future education, time of marriage, child-bearing, work outside of the home, and the integration of marriage and career roles. Individual work-value scores do not differ significantly among girls who differ in <b>regard</b> to age, <b>IQ</b> scores, mothers' employment or unemployment, or socioeconomic levels of the mothers' occupations. 4. Despite significant differences in the scores of individual work values among sub-groups examined, the calculation of Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance (W) revealed a high degree of overall consistency (p <. 01) in the work-value hierarchies of girls who differ in regard to age, intelligence or scholastic achievement, parents' employment and the socioeconomic levels of their occupations, and any aspirations or expectations considered. Values ranked as most important or least important by girls of the total sample remain so for those within most sub-groups. 5. Also reported are any relationship of the girls' aspirations and expectations to their age, intelligence or scholastic achievement, parents' current employment and socioeconomic levels of the parents' occupations...|$|R
