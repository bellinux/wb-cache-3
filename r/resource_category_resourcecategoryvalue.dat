Landsat digital classifications of large areas (3 ̆e 1 million hectares) were used to support collection of ground data on plant productivity and soils. This technique was effective where the inventory team {{had little or no}} previous knowledge of the area, and a very short summer field season to collect field data. Problems were encountered where <b>resource</b> <b>categories</b> differed from Landsat spectral classes across these large areas, due to regional differences in ecological condition. A means was required to break the survey area into smaller units so that <b>resource</b> <b>categories</b> could be locally described. Winter Landsat imagery was photo interpreted to stratify the survey areas into physiographic units. Images were selected from mid-winter, when the landscape is snow covered, and low sun angles provide enhancement of subtle topographic patterns. The physiographic units derived from winter Landsat imagery were digitized to serve as boundaries for stratification of a previously classified Landsat digital image. Spectral categories were then re-identified to a <b>resource</b> <b>category</b> within each stratum. An output image was produced and used as the base for preparing the final range inventory map.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of diabetes in North American is recognized {{to be higher}} in Aboriginal populations. The relative magnitude of health care utilization and expenditures between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations is uncertain, however. Our objective was to compare health care utilization and per capita expenditures according to Registered Indian and diabetes status {{in the province of}} Saskatchewan. Methods Administrative databases from Saskatchewan Health were used to identify registered Indians and the general population diabetes cases and two controls for each diabetes case. Health care resource utilization (physician visits, hospitalizations, day surgeries and dialysis) and costs for these individuals in the 2001 calendar year were determined. The odds of having used each <b>resource</b> <b>category,</b> adjusted for age and location of residence, was assessed according to Registered Indian and diabetes status. The average number of encounters for each <b>resource</b> <b>category</b> and per capita healthcare expenditures were also determined. Results Registered Indian diabetes cases were younger than general population cases (45. 7 ± 14. 5 versus 58. 4 ± 16. 4 years, p Conclusion Relative to individuals without the disease, both registered Indians and the general population with diabetes had substantially higher health care utilization and costs. Excess hospitalization and dialysis suggested that registered Indians with and without diabetes experienced greater morbidity than the general population. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there has been {{increased}} awareness and use of complementary/alternative therapies (CAM) in many countries without the health care infrastructure to support it. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine referred to the combining of mainstream medical therapies and CAM as integrative medicine. The creation of integrative health care teams will definitely result in redefining roles, but more importantly in a change in how services are delivered. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe a model of the necessary health care agency resources to support an integrative practice model. A logic model is used to depict the findings of a review of current evidence. Logic models are designed to show relationships between the goals of a program or initiative, the resources to achieve desired outputs and the activities that lead to outcomes. The four major <b>resource</b> <b>categories</b> necessary for implementing integrative care are within the domains of a) professional and research development, b) health human resource planning, c) regulation and legislation and d) practice and management in clinical areas. It was concluded that the system outcomes from activities within these <b>resource</b> <b>categories</b> should lead to freedom of choice in health care; a culturally sensitive health care system and a broader spectrum of services for achieving public health goals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} {{problems}} of access control for business processes. The {{subject of the}} paper is a specification of the Context-sensitive access control model for business processes (COBAC). In order to efficiently define and enforce access control for different business pro-cesses, the COBAC model {{is based on the}} RBAC (Role-based Access Control) model which is extended with the following entities: context, busi-ness process, activity and <b>resource</b> <b>category.</b> By using a context-sensitive access control it is possible to define more complex access control poli-cies whose implementation by existing access control models for business processes is not possible or is very complicated. The COBAC’s context model can describe rich context information and can be easily extended for specific cases. The introduction of business process and activity en-tities has facilitated the definition of access control policies for business processes. The categorization of resources enables the definition of ac-cess control policies for whole <b>resource</b> <b>categories,</b> and thus, potentially, reduces the number of policies which need to be defined. The COBAC model is applicable in different business information systems, and sup-ports the definition of access control policies for both simple and complex business processes. The model is verified by a case study on a real busi-ness process...|$|R
