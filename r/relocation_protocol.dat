40|$|Abstract — Sensor {{relocation}} protocols can {{be employed}} as a fault-tolerance approach to reduce or complement coverage loss caused by node failures. In this paper, we introduce a novel localized structure, information mesh, for publishing and retrieving distance-sensitive data like location information.

The proposed protocol maintains a sensor network’s overall sensing coverage by replacing failed sensors with nearby redundant ones using minimized time delay and balanced energy consumption. We show that MSRP is superior to the existing relocation protocols due to its localized message transmissions, optimal (constant) per node storage load, and its guaranteed nearby replacement node discovery and node replacing.

40|$|Abstract the problem, a <b>relocation</b> <b>protocol</b> by {{an object}} relo-Mobile Cache Protocol (MCP) was {{proposed}} as a re-location protocol of a replicated object in a widely dis-tributed object system. MCP has four basic features; relocating a replicated object, 2 optimistic update meth-ods, object reservation and object sharing. To calcu-late relocation function, MCP uses processing {{time of the}} object at a candidate sate and predicted network de-lay between the client and the candidate. Thus, a cli-ent observes network status to eliminate the ambiguity. But the observation of the entire network may cause overhand and undesirable traffic. This paper proposes some solutions for the problem, i. e., collecting process-ing time information of partial network and probing delay by preceding ping. Though designed for a dis-tributed object based system, MCP also {{can be applied to}} dynamic web caching. Evaluation using DEC web trace shows the effectiveness of these strategies. 1...|$|E
40|$|Replication {{can enhance}} the {{availability}} of the data files in a distributed environment. This paper introduces a method for managing replicated data files. Unlike many others, our method provides protocols and algorithms for a more complicated scheme of replication that supports replication with location-variant files and files with a variable degree of replication. We assume the existence of a dynamic file assignment algorithm as well as a block-oriented majority consensus voting approach. This paper investigates how to maintain consistency during relocation, if the current and the new file assignment differ not only in the location of the files but also in the number of replicas. We introduce the basic <b>relocation</b> <b>protocols</b> to preserve consistency during relocation and present the read- and write-block algorithms for accesses to data blocks of transient files. As a final result, we show that the interaction between the <b>relocation</b> <b>protocols</b> and these algorithms preserves consistency. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Suppose you got an {{excellent}} dynamic file assignment algorithm. But, {{how to proceed}} dynamically from the current to the optimal file allocation? Imagine replication of your files and some sort of voting strategy [...] - the question then is, how to maintain consistency if the current and the optimal file assignment differ {{not only in the}} location of the files but also in the number of replicas? This paper tries to answer these questions and introduces the basic <b>relocation</b> <b>protocols</b> which preserve consistency during relocation, as well as a priority-driven, storage capacity-based approach to bring the basic <b>relocation</b> <b>protocols</b> in an optimal sequence in order to move quickly and as close as possible towards the optimal file assignment. 1 Introduction We consider a mathematical model of an information network of jRj nodes, some of which contain copies of our jDj data files.

30|$|The {{third and}} final {{activity}} related to the community’s ability to relocate to land within their customary territory. The community was fortunate to have higher ground to move to within their land boundaries, making it an easier transition. According to the interviewees, this was a key reason for why the relocation, to date, has been considered successful—the village relocated to land owned by the same community {{and no one in}} the community contested the use of the new site on which to relocate the village. Because suitable resettlement sites will not always be possible in every <b>relocation</b> case, <b>protocols</b> and mechanisms must be established to facilitate the discussions between the communities that wish to relocate and customary land owners, which might involve some form of compensation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In mobile sensor networks, self-deployment and {{relocation}} are {{two different}} research issues, both of which involve autonomous sensor movement. They share in most cases a common goal, that is, to improve overall network sensing coverage. Under this circumstance, some self-deployment algorithms may be applied to solving relocation problem without modification. However, considering efficiency, {{they will not be}} a good option in the scenario with high sensor failure rate. Existing sensor relocation protocols are not quite practical because they rely on strong assumptions and/or have weakness in maintaining network topology. In this paper, we propose a distributed zone-based sensor <b>relocation</b> <b>protocol,</b> ZONER, for mobile sensor networks {{on the basis of a}} restricted flooding technique, i. e., ZFlooding. Requiring zero-knowledge about sensor field, the ZONER is able to effectively discover previously-deployed redundant sensors without being concerned with obstacles or network ununiformity, and it relocates them in a shifting way to replace failed nonredundant ones without changing network topology. At the end of the paper, we prove the correctness of the ZONER and point out our future work. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In mobile sensor networks, the {{coverage}} improvement problem, i. e., maximizing and/or maintaining overall sensing coverage, {{is a fundamental}} research issue attracting many researchers. Existing coverage improvement algorithms such as sensor self-deployment algorithms and sensor relocation protocols enhance coverage with limitations due to their specialized design purposes. In this paper, we propose an integrated self-deployment and coverage maintenance scheme, which solves {{the coverage}} improvement problem in a complete sense. The proposed scheme is an integration of four algorithms: a redundancy determination algorithm, a sensor <b>relocation</b> <b>protocol,</b> a sensor self-deployment algorithm, and a sensor replenishment protocol. By this scheme, redundant sensors are placed together with non-redundant ones in the target field at random; non-redundant sensors autonomously scatter to form a network with maximal coverage after initial placement; all the sensors collaborate to compensate coverage loss throughout network lifetime. Mentionably, we notice that no existing schemes besides ours {{take into account the}} impact on coverage from nodal sensing range diminishment. At the end of the paper, we briefly address some evaluation issues. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{freshwater}} mussels in the Ontario-Great Lakes Area are considered Species at Risk (SAR) {{and these are}} increasingly influencing planning, implementation, and monitoring of infrastructure projects near watercourses. In 2010, the City of London commissioned an on-line Stormwater Management Facility in the Stoney Creek watershed {{in the form of}} an Erosion Control Wetland. Design objectives included: creation of additional water storage in the floodplain, prevent erosion in the downstream watercourse, and reclaim natural heritage features lost during infrastructure development. Erosion and sediment controls were applied during construction; however, storm events in December 2011 washed out a section of bank that had separated Stoney Creek from the active construction site. The washout released streambed sediments and mussels, including the previously unrecorded SAR Rainbow mussel, into the work area. An emergency mussel <b>relocation</b> <b>protocol</b> was developed, through a collaboration between applicable agencies, to relocate the mussels during the winter months. Ultimately, 16 of 70 mussels collected during the winter relocations were SAR. The timing of the bank collapse and mussel relocations provided a unique situation where recapture and growth comparisons could be made between mussels relocated in extreme weather conditions to mussels relocated during optimal handling temperatures. The Stoney Creek project demonstrated construction delays and costs associated with SAR mussel discovery. The project highlights the importance of detailed environmental assessments prior to project planning so appropriate mitigation measures and environmental monitoring requirements are implemented during construction...|$|E
40|$|Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode is {{the most}} widely used {{multicast}} routing architecture. It builds a shared distribution tree centered at a Rendezvous Point and then builds source-specific trees for those sources whose data traffic warrants it. Current implementations of the protocol decide on the locations of the Rendezvous Point administratively, which leads to congestion and delays. An attractive solution would be dynamic relocation of the Rendezvous Point depending on the members of the multicast group. In this thesis we present a Rendezvous Point calculation and <b>relocation</b> mechanism for <b>Protocol</b> Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper studies greenhouse-gas (GHG) {{emission}} controls {{in the presence}} of carbon leakage through international firm <b>relocation.</b> The Kyoto <b>Protocol</b> requires developed countries to reduce a certain amount of GHG emissions. Comparing emission quotas with emission taxes, we show that taxes coupled with lower trade costs facilitate more firm relocation than quotas, causing more international carbon leakage. Thus, if a country is concerned about global emissions, emission quotas would be adopted to mitigate the carbon leakage. The firm relocation entails a trade-off between trade liberalisation and emission regulations. Emission regulations may be hampered by trade liberalisation, and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Since 1981, {{intensive}} nest relocation {{has been}} used as the primary tool to minimize hatching disorientation by coastal lights in Broward County. It has always been recognized that nest relocation is a highly invasive, undesirable management tool but it was thought to be a necessity because only 5 of the 8 cities have lightning ordinances in place and at least 70 percent of Broward County beaches are brightly illuminated. In 2006, with the partial enforcement of coastal lightning ordinances, this policy was changed by mandate of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. No enclosed or open beach hatcheries were used and many more nests were left in situ. Preliminary evaluation of the disorientation incident reports from highly developed Fort Lauderdale, Lauderdale by the Sea, and Pompano Beach indicate that the number of disoriented hatchlings ranged between 16, 532 and 19, 255 in 2006. In 2005, estimated range was 7334 to 9400. Accounting for disoriented hatchling tracks that reached the water, the estimated number of missing hatchlings ranged from 13, 020 to 14, 447 in 2006 and from 5, 198 to 6, 382 in 2005. These numbers may be underestimates because hatchling tracks are often indistinct and are easily removed by rain and wind. Of the 45 nests left in situ on the Fort Lauderdale strip, 22 disoriented. Thirteen of these disorientations were inside cages. While the new management procedures {{may have contributed to the}} disorientation loss of about 8000 more hatchlings than in 2005, the new protocol also appear to to have increased live hatchling production rates of relocated nests, possibly due to wider nest spacing and shorter relocation times and transportation distances. Based on comparison of the increases in overall live hatchling production rates of in situ and relocated nests from 2005 to 2006, we estimate that the new <b>relocation</b> <b>protocol</b> may have contributed to a 12 percentage point increase in the production of relocated nests this year. Comparison of the estimated hatchling production of all nests in 2006 with the projected hatchling production if the old procedures had been used, suggests that the new methods may have contributed to the release of an additional 18, 500 hatchlings. This compares favorably with the increased loss estimate above. Further reduction of beachfront lighting, from increased enforcement of lighting ordinances and education, has the potential to greatly reduce hatchling disorientation losses and reduce the need for relocation even further...|$|E
