50|$|In 1883, Ottomar Anschütz (Germany) {{patented}} {{a camera}} with an internal <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> <b>shutter</b> mechanism, {{just in front}} of the photographic plate. Thus the focal-plane shutter in modern recognizable form was born. Goerz manufactured the Anschütz Camera (Germany) as the first production FP shutter camera in 1890. Francis Blake invented a type of focal plane shutter camera by 1889 that achieved shutter speeds of 1/2000 second, and exhibited numerous stop-action photographs. Note that a drop shutter-like mechanism with adjustable slit was used at the focal plane of an apparently one-off William England camera in 1861 and this is considered the first FP shutter of any kind.|$|E
5000|$|... 1891: A. D. Loman Reflex Camera (Netherlands): first {{focal-plane shutter}} SLR. Had mirror rise {{synchronized}} {{with the release}} of a <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> <b>shutter,</b> with speeds from ½ to 1/250 second, internally mounted in front of the focal plane, instead of the previously normal unsynchronized, external accessory in front of the lens. An internal camera-mounted traveling-slit FP shutter's main advantage over the competing interlens leaf shutter was the ability to use a very narrow slit to offer up to an action stopping 1/1000 second shutter speed at a time when leaf shutters topped out at 1/250 sec. - although the available contemporaneous ISO 1 to 3 equivalent speed emulsions limited the opportunities to use the high speeds.|$|E
5000|$|After {{their first}} aircraft, the T.1, Saunders did not build another landplane until 1928 when the Saunders A.10 single-seat fighter appeared. The {{original}} design {{was a private}} venture, its distinguishing feature its four-gun armament {{at a time when}} two machine guns were standard. Because of this the A.10 was sometimes referred to as the [...] "Multi-gun"; because by the time the A.10 was ready to fly S.E.Saunders Ltd had been bought out by A.V. Roe and John Lloyd it is sometimes known as the Saunders/Saro A.10 or the Saro A.10. Air Ministry specification F.20/27 was issued during the design process and Saunders decided to submit the A.10 even though that specification only called for two guns and suggested the use of the radial Bristol Mercury rather than the inline Rolls-Royce F.XIS that designer Harry Knowler had chosen. [...] The Air Ministry provided an unsupercharged F.XI engine and the A.10 first flew on 27 January 1929. It was a compact single bay sesquiplane with a duraluminum airframe, fabric covered throughout apart from the forward fuselage. The fuselage was largely built from tubular members, bolted together. The pilot sat with the upper wing at eye level to optimise the view both above and below, helped by cut-outs in the lower plane roots and a thinner aerofoil in the upper centre section. The breeches of all four guns were accessible to him, with two in the forward decking and two in the fuselage sides. The water-cooled engine's chin radiator sat behind a <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> <b>shutter,</b> close to the twin-bladed propeller. The simple single axle undercarriage was mounted on a pair of inverted V-struts joining the fuselage ahead and aft of the lower wing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outline design}} of the F24 camera {{was carried out by}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and it was {{introduced}} in 1925. Detailed design, and most production, was by Williamson Manufacturing Company Ltd of Willesden Green, London NW.10. The F24 was designed to be lighter and smaller than the F8 camera of 1919, but the F8 continued to be used in less demanding installations. The main component units of the F24 are a body with <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> focal plane <b>shutter,</b> gearbox, film magazine, and lens cone. Image film format is 5"×5", on 5" [...] wide roll film, with magazine capacity up to 250 exposures (the F8 offered images up to 8"×7.5" [...] on 9" [...] wide film). Shutter speed is preset between 1/100s and 1/1000s.|$|R
40|$|Fixed {{external}} shading devices, such as louvres, {{are widely}} used to combat solar gains {{that can lead to}} excessive overheating. External <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> common in mainland Europe, are rarities in the UK. External <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> are retractable shading devices formed of horizontal slats that roll up into a casing above a window opening. They are a well developed technology with distinct advantages over fixed external shading devices. Appropriate design and applications of external <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> have the potential to improve the sustainability of buildings. This paper reports on a proof of concept trial that demonstrates the effect of external <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> on the internal thermal environment under UK climate. An external <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> was installed in a test room and its impact on internal mean radiant temperature was compared to an internal venetian blind in a control room. Real time monitoring was carried out over the summer in 2011. A computer thermal model was established to model the test room and to simulate the impact of the external <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> on the cooling load. This paper concludes that external <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> have the potential to reduce summertime mean temperature by 1. 8 ºC and lower peak temperature by 3. 5 ºC.

40|$|Fixed {{external}} shading devices, such as louvers, {{are widely}} used to combat solar gains {{that can lead to}} excessive overheating. External <b>roller</b> <b>blinds,</b> although commonly used in mainland Europe, are rarities in the UK. External <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> are retractable shading devices formed of horizontal slats that roll up into a casing above a window opening. They are a well-developed technology with distinct advantages over fixed external shading devices. When fully extended the blinds block solar radiation externally reducing heat gain in summer, in the winter they add thermal resistance and reduce heat loss through windows. Appropriate design and applications of external <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> have the potential to improve the sustainability of buildings. This paper reports on an on-going applied research project that investigates the effect of external <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> on the internal thermal environment and potential advantages to the sustainability of retrofitting office buildings in the UK. The first part of the paper describes a proof of concept study in which an in-situ external <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> was installed in a ‘test’ room and its summertime thermal performance was compared with that of a ‘control’ room under the same external climatic conditions. Dynamic thermal analysis was carried out to establish the annual thermal performance of the blind, including impact on cooling and heating energy requirements. Associated annual carbon dioxide emissions were established and the blind was discovered to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2 e) by 15 % annually, majority of which is reduction in requirement for heating. The life cycle impact of the blind was investigated. Individual process contributing to the production, manufacture, decommissioning and transport of the blind were assessed in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions. Under the conditions of the concept study scenario and taking into account the recycle of the components, the external <b>roller</b> <b>blind</b> in operation is estimated to take approximately six months to save enough to compensate the embodied greenhouse gas emissions mainly due to the manufacturing process. The results have demonstrated there is significant potential of using external <b>roller</b> <b>blinds</b> to reduce the operational and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of buildings in the United Kingdom...|$|R
