40|$|AbstractSafety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> {{tubes are}} {{important}} components of fast reactor cores for ensuring safe reactor operation. Their failure or considerable changes of their size {{may lead to}} safety rod wedging that is unacceptable. Two guide tubes, one each from BN- 350 and BOR- 60, were examined post-irradiation to determine {{the reasons for their}} deformation and loss of functionality. These tubes were constructed from high-nickel alloy EP- 150 and austenitic 18 Cr 9 Ni, respectively. It is found that various forms of deformation of safety <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tubes occur due to non-uniform swelling along the tube height, perimeter and across-wall thickness. The swelling gradients can lead to bowing and ovality, and can be accompanied by significant internal stresses within the tube material. The latter can lead to size reduction of guide tube dimension in some directions due to irradiation creep. High levels of swelling-induced residual stresses, in combination with a swelling-induced embrittlement of the tube material, can lead to the tube failure {{even in the absence of}} any external loading...|$|R
50|$|The {{gas block}} in the AKM {{does not have a}} {{cleaning}} rod capture or sling loop but is instead fitted with an integrated bayonet support collar that has a cleaning <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> hole. The forward sling loop was relocated to the front handguard retainer cap. The handguard retainer also has notches that determine the position of the handguards on the barrel. The AKM’s laminated wood handguards have lateral grooves that help securely grip the rifle.|$|R
30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston <b>rod,</b> <b>guide</b> sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston <b>rod</b> and <b>guide</b> sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R

50|$|Commonly, a breech-end {{extension}} tube, {{known as}} a bore <b>guide</b> or <b>rod</b> <b>guide,</b> is also {{used in conjunction with}} the cleaning rod to prevent cleaning solvent from spilling out into the receiver, and to keep the rod supported and centered inside the bore in order to minimize potential damage to riflings. Similarly, a muzzle guide or muzzle guard might be used if the cleaning rod is to be inserted from the muzzle end of the firearm {{in order to protect the}} crown of the muzzle from mechanical damage.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} is a one-piece {{tube with}} a screwed in match barrel. Goncz Armament utilized heat treated 4130 solid chrome alloy for the receiver tube. On the Goncz GA and Claridge T and L models, and all rifles, it also {{acts as a}} barrel shroud. The receiver tube houses the bolt, <b>guide</b> <b>rods</b> and <b>guide</b> springs.

50|$|The SKS {{is easily}} field {{stripped}} and reassembled without specialized tools and the trigger group and magazine {{can be removed}} with an unfired cartridge. The rifle has a cleaning kit stored in a trapdoor in the buttstock, with a cleaning rod running under the barrel, in the same style as the AK-47. The cap for the cleaning kit {{also serves as a}} cleaning <b>rod</b> <b>guide,</b> to protect the crown from being damaged during cleaning. In common with some other Soviet-era designs, it trades some accuracy for ruggedness, reliability, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and low manufacturing cost.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt <b>guide</b> <b>rod</b> assembly <b>guides</b> the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding {{the upper and lower}} receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a hinge pin immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Crack {{detection}} in {{the region}} of the weld root for control rod nozzles installed in the reactor pressure vessel cap, is difficult due to limited accessibility. For ultrasonic testing, probe coupling is possible only at the inner surface of the engine <b>rod</b> <b>guide</b> tube. There is a water gap of 2 to 3 mm between guide tube and control rod nozzle. Investigations were preformed to determine ultrasonic inspection parameters best suited to crack detection across a water gap. Measurements across a water gap were carried out on planar, convex and concave surfaces specimens. Test reflectors (spark eroded notches) were introduced at different depths for the respective specimen. The notches had different positions and orientations in relation to the weld. After detection of test reflectors, sizing tolerances were reviewed. Measurement data were post processed by means of reconstruction technique using SAFT. Measurement and analysis results are presented...|$|R

30|$|In this study, a {{new type}} of single-axle bogie of {{straddle-type}} monorail vehicle is designed. The tumbler structures are adopted in the vertical suspension system. One end of the tumbler is fixed to the framework, while the other end supports the framework via air springs. In addition, the lateral suspension utilizes the suspender way, with longitudinal force transmitted via single pull <b>rods.</b> <b>Guide</b> wheels and steady wheels are connected to the end support arms of the framework through spindles around the horizontal direction. Rubber springs, the pre-compressed magnitudes of which could be adjusted, are set between the spindles and support arms. The multi-body dynamics software UM is adopted to construct a dynamic model and simulate related dynamic performance. The results of the simulation indicate that this new kind of bogie has a favorable performance when passing through curves and has a greater riding stability. The flexibility factor equation of this new monorail vehicle is deduced, with its flexibility factor obtained.|$|R

We consider a hypothetical scenario with stratified (metal layer atop) melt pool in the lower plenum. Effective Convectivity Model (ECM) and Phase-Change ECM (PECM) are developed for the modeling of molten metal layer heat transfer. The PECM model takes into account reduced convection heat transfer in mushy zone and compositional convection that enables simulations of noneutectic binary mixture solidification and melting. The ECM and PECM are (i) validated against relevant experiments for both eutectic and noneutectic mixtures and (ii) benchmarked against CFD-generated data including the local heat transfer characteristics. The PECM is then applied to the analysis of heat transfer in a stratified heterogeneous debris pool taking into account CRGT cooling. The PECM simulation results show apparent efficacy of the CRGT cooling which can be utilized as Severe Accident Management (SAM) measure to protect the vessel wall from focusing effect caused by metallic layer...|$|R
