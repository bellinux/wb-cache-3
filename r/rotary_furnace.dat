The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace,</b> with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E

50|$|The MIM Holdings Board of Directors {{approved}} {{the construction of}} an ISASMELT plant at Britannia Refined Metals, the company’s lead refinery at Northfleet in the United Kingdom, for commercial recovery of lead from battery paste to supplement the existing plant, which used a short <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace</b> to produce 10,000 t/y of lead. The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991. The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony lead bullion from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55-65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace</b> when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated. The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h. The plant was shut down in 2004 when Xstrata Zinc, which took over the MIM Holdings lead operations, decided to leave the lead recycling business.|$|E

The salt is separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation, accompanied by washing of the granules, and is dried in a <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace</b> and sieved before packaging.

The kiln is made up of four 1.6 metre long, 1 metre outer diameter retort sections bolted together. The 6 to 8 cm thick walls of the kiln are designed to withstand small detonations.

The flights also provide charge separation for the in-process materials, and discourage sympathetic detonations and scattering of materials. The kiln is equipped with a variable speed drive, which allows varying rotation speeds and material residence time.|$|E

40|$|Straw fiber {{is a waste}} {{obtained}} by jet milling after extracting valuable substances form corn straw through steam explosion-washing-mechanical carding process. At the same time, {{it is also a}} clean and renewable reducing agent. In this study, physical and chemical characteristics of straw fiber were investigated firstly. The usage of straw fiber in <b>rotary</b> hearth <b>furnace</b> process for direct reduced iron production was then discussed. The results show that on one hand, fixed carbon content in straw fiber is low, which is unfavorable for the productivity of direct reduced iron; on the other hand, ash and sulfur content is also low, which improves the quality of direct reduced iron. Besides, the fibrous structure is conducive to improving the pelletizing performance of carbon-containing pellets, thus reducing an additional amount of binder. Compared with common reducing agents, straw fiber provides better reduction effect, and straw fiber carbon-containing pellets possess higher compressive strength and larger volumetric shrinkage, which is beneficial to increase the thickness of the whole material layer in <b>rotary</b> hearth <b>furnace.</b> In addition, these carbon-containing pellets also have advantages of lowering C/O ratio and shortening reduction time.
