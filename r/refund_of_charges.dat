50|$|The Guide to Bank Charges was {{introduced}} in 2014 to provide a standardize means <b>of</b> bank <b>charges</b> on all products and services between customers and DMBs in the country.

40|$|The {{intermodality}} is main {{an element}} of economic competitiveness and basic tool for support of the Trans-European Network- Transport (TEN-T) development. This paper offers {{the analysis of the}} promising innovative approaches to synthesis of the intermodal traffic systems including inland navigation. Inland waterways are the powerful tool for the further development of intermodality. Waterborne transport is the oldest mode of the cargoes haulage and the passengers’ travels. Now this environment-friendly transport mode gets main importance again, that requires innovative changes in the inland vessels, pushers, barges and its service systems. It is connected by that the combined transport, namely rail/road using along the main traffic corridors of the TEN-T is currently struggling with high external costs, including costs of environment renewal, congestion consequences and <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents <b>charges.</b> Experience <b>of</b> some EU countries has shown, that innovative approaches to the organization of inland navigation as element of integrated transport systems could help to solve these problems including elimination of “bottlenecks ” in transport chains. For this purpose, first of all, it is required to the interconnected coordination between various modes for interoperability with inland waterborne transport, & secondly to focus decision-makers attention to creation of cost-effective intermodal chains...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>refunding</b> {{environmental}} <b>charges.</b> Taxes are often resisted by polluters because they imply both abatement and tax costs. When charges are refunded, the incentives for abatement are {{essentially the same as}} for a tax {{as long as there are}} many producers. The incidence and distribution of costs is however different. Lower net tax payments reduce resistance from the polluters and make refunded emissions payments politically easier to implement at a sufficiently high charge level to have significant abatement effects. We describe and examine the refunded emissions payment scheme as a policy instrument and compare it with taxes and permits with regard to allocative properties, distribution of costs, property rights, and, consequently, the politics of implementation. As an empirical example, the Swedish charge on nitrogen oxides is analyzed...|$|R

The policy, under which the charge revenues are refunded back to the regulated firms in proportion to energy output, was explicitly designed to affect investment in NOx-reducing technologies. The results indicate that a higher net NOx charge liability, i. e. a reduction in tax liabilities net <b>of</b> the <b>refund</b> due to the new technology, {{increases the likelihood of}} adoption, but only for end-of-pipe post-combustion technologies. We also find some indication that market power considerations in the heat and power industry reduce the incentives to abate emissions through investment in postcombustion technologies. Adoption of post-combustion technologies and the efficiency improving technology of flue gas condensation are also more likely in the heat and power and waste incineration sectors, which is possibly explained by a large degree of public ownership in these sectors...|$|R
