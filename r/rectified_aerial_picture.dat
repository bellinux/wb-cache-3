The performance of our approach has been tested on real world high resolution <b>aerial</b> <b>pictures,</b> and the obtained results demonstrated its effectiveness compared to those presented in the literature...|$|R

40|$|A {{framework}} is presented for {{the interpretation of}} a urban landscape based on the analysis of <b>aerial</b> <b>pictures.</b> This method has been designed {{for the use of}} a priori knowledge provided by a geographic map in order to improve the image analysis stage. A coherent final interpretation of the studied area is proposed. It relies on a graph based data structure to modelize the urban landscape, and on a global uncertainty management to evaluate the final confidence we can have in the results presented. This structure and uncertainty management tend to reflect the hierarchy of the available data and the interpretation levels. Key words: urban scene interpretation, symbolic data fusion, geographic map and <b>aerial</b> <b>picture</b> analysis. 1. INTRODUCTION <b>Aerial</b> <b>pictures</b> are widely used in a lot of applications {{for the study of the}} landscape. They provide indeed an easily available and updated source of information. The automatic interpretation of this kind of picture has therefore become a field of inte [...] ...|$|R

40|$|UAV-based <b>aerial</b> <b>pictures</b> {{processed}} with Structurefrom- Motion algorithms {{provide an}} efficient, low-cost and rapid framework for remote monitoring of dynamic environments. This methodology is particularly suitable for repeated topographic surveys in remote or poorly accessible areas. The {{aim of the}} study is to assess differential movement of surface material within a landslide located in the northern foothills of the Swiss Alps based on a time series of digital surface models derived from the UAVSfM framework. Based on two digital surface models reconstructed with <b>aerial</b> <b>pictures</b> taken within a 6 -months time interval, first results show that {{the central part of the}} landslide is very dynamic with horizontal movements up to several meters...|$|R
