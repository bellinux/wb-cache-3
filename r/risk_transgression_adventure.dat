40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the values {{reflected}} in Internet advertising. To achieve this, a content analysis which identifies the values reflected by advertisements on web sites targeting teenagers, has been performed. Analysis {{results show that the}} most frequent values are related to <b>transgression,</b> <b>adventure,</b> materialism, competitiveness and power. The study also reveals a relationship between the target audience and the type of values. Campaigns aimed at youth have a significant presence of <b>transgression,</b> <b>adventure,</b> materialism, power, competitiveness and personal success values, while campaigns aimed at both targets (adults and youth simultaneously) have a significant presence of normative values...|$|R
30|$|The {{observed}} transgressions {{seemed to}} differ {{according to the}} moment of crossing, {{the time of the}} day and the adopted trajectory, which were directly or indirectly associated with different demographic profiles of pedestrians. The links between moment of <b>transgression</b> and other <b>risk</b> factors are described in the following paragraphs, representing thus findings informing on three potential key at <b>risk</b> <b>transgression</b> patterns adopted by pedestrians, users of the Cleveland rail line.|$|R
40|$|Users of Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) {{are among}} the fastest growing {{criminal}} groups on the internet. Seto’s (2013) Motivation-Facilitation Model predicts that crossover to contact offending is dependent on motivational aspects (e. g., a sexual interest in children) and facilitative aspects (e. g., anti-sociality). The current study was aimed at refining {{the impact of a}} lack of inhibitions and impulsivity on these <b>risk</b> <b>transgressions,</b> by analysing data collected through interviews, psychometric assessments and a computerised assessment of sexual interest (The Explicit and Implicit Sexual Interest Profile; EISIP; Banse, Schmidt & Clarbour, 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} radio host Kyle Sandilands, {{which is one of}} intended confrontation. However, the genre of radio to which his performance is associated is not talkback. It is chat-based programming, which relies on three tenets: orientation to the personal, use of wit, and <b>risk</b> of <b>transgression.</b> This paper {{examines the}} question: To what extent is Kyle Sandilands performance of authenticity oriented to the genre format? This paper argues that the overall success of Sandilands is supported by his mastery of the chat-based genre...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To verify whether {{subjects}} with celiac disease (CD) {{have a different}} locus of control (LoC) compared with healthy subjects, and to evaluate the relationship between LoC and compliance with a prescribed gluten-free diet (GFD) {{and quality of life}} (QoL). STUDY DESIGN: We studied 156 subjects on a GFD (mean age, 10 years) and 353 healthy controls (mean age, 12 years). All subjects completed tests on the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale; the {{subjects with}} CD also completed a questionnaire to measure compliance with dietary treatment and the disease's impact on QoL. RESULTS: There was no difference in LoC values between patients with CD and controls. Subjects with CD with good dietary compliance had a more internal LoC compared with those who were not compliant (P =. 01). Patients who reported a satisfactory QoL had a more internal LoC compared with those who reported negative affects on QoL due to CD (P =. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the usefulness of the LoC concept for identifying those patients who might be at <b>risk</b> for dietary <b>transgression.</b> Given the enhanced, psychological, and social well being that can result from adherence to a GFD, educational and psychological support can help internalize the LoC in those patients at <b>risk</b> for dietary <b>transgression...</b>|$|R

30|$|Cannon Hill was {{associated}} with transgressions before the gates have started closing (Moment 1). Transgressions in the first moments were predominantly observed in morning peak hours, {{in front of an}} approaching train and by school children. School children were likely to be seen crossing alone and so were in general transgressors observed in the morning peak hours. Contrary, to previous findings the location of the train station externally to the rail tracks {{was associated}} with a lower number of transgressions compared to the other two LCs. However, looking into the adopted trajectories a strong pattern of transgressions was identified, corresponding to the crossing of multiple tracks to access the station (City train service platform), including crossing the road and going out of a middle island. In fact, among the three LCs, only Cannon Hill {{was associated with}} just crossing the road or exiting the middle platform, trajectories corresponding to the emplacement of the train station at this particular site externally to the rail tracks. While the existing over bridge linking the middle island platform and the train station could have contributed to decrease transgressions, the separation of the third track from the passenger services tracks could potentially be associated with an increased level of <b>risk</b> during <b>transgressions</b> as pedestrians crossing through the passenger services corridor are obliged to cross both tracks at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} among scholars {{in the concept of}} edgework to examine voluntary risk-taking behavior. Parkour is an emerging sport that finds a nexus between <b>transgression,</b> <b>risk,</b> and accessibility that may represent a unique form of edgework. Few scholars have examined sport as an edgework pursuit, and fewer still have attempted to portray the lived and embodied experiences of edgeworkers. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to expand sport and edgework research by qualitatively examining the lived, sporting experiences of parkour practitioners. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with 11 (9 male, 2 female) intermediate-to-advanced traceurs (parkour practioners) ranging from 18 to 33 years old. Two dimensions emerged: bodily experience and interactive experience. Several supporting themes also emerged, including play, movement, and risk within the bodily experience dimension, and community, public, and world within the interactive experience dimension. The findings of this study provide new perspectives on the experiences and meanings associated with participating in parkour and freerunning...|$|R
30|$|Transgressions at Wynnum Central were {{associated}} with crossing in the last moment of controls’ activation, {{with the presence of}} a visible—stopped or passing train (i.e. the majority observed behind a stopped at station train) and with afternoon peak hours. At this site, pedestrians crossing right after the train has passed the LC (City train) could still catch it from the station. Such transgressions behind a stopped train and after the gates are closed were also associated with younger adults. Moreover, in the afternoons more transgressions were observed in groups. Wynnum Central stood out as the LC where most variability was observed in the adopted trajectories towards the station. A large number of transgressors came from the large shopping Centre side and crossed on diagonal or even through the centre of the LC. Crossing on diagonal could be explained by the motivation to avoid waiting to cross at a nearby intersection with four pairs of pedestrian traffic lights connecting the different sides of the road (Fig.  3). The large number of transgressions from either side of the crossing could be associated with catching the City Train service (i.e. if crossing behind a stopped train). For those transgressing from the Centre side of the LC, being in a hurry to catch the City train implies crossing through the Outbound track. If pedestrians are familiar with such crossing situation, they can easily assume that even if there is an approaching second train (coming from the City) it will stop at station before reaching the LC platform. However, in reality an express train could be approaching anytime at full speed. Consequently, {{it can be argued that}} the simultaneous regulation of pedestrian traffic on both sides of a middle island could lead people to underestimate the risk of second train arrival even it is visible. Such risk could potentially be avoided if pedestrians were to use the existing over bridge that provides access to the platforms from the car park. However, pedestrians might be unlikely to cross the overbridge given its distant location from the main road, which is a main adopted trajectory if coming from the shopping centre. Consequently, a more adequate location of the over bridge or a separate regulation of both tracks at this LC could potentially minimise the <b>risk</b> of <b>transgressions</b> and especially—in front of a second train.|$|R
40|$|This dissertation, {{based on}} 14 months of {{fieldwork}} {{carried out in}} central, northern and north-eastern Thailand, focuses on laypeople's demands on contemporary Thai Theravada sangha. In {{the aftermath of the}} economic breakdown in 1997, an intense discussion concerning the moral status of the sangha took place. The religious interests and demands clearly differ between different groups. What still seems to unify these groups or classes of Buddhists, however, is their concern for the sangha's compliance with a few vinaya-rules such as observing the chastity vow and not keeping donations obtained in merit making for personal use. In an attempt to move beyond the obvious, this dissertation applies an exchange theory to problematize the above. Two separate but intimately related spheres exist in modern Thai society; a short-term sphere where profit making, individual success, vitality and consumption of luxury goods are tolerated and even spoken for, and a long-term sphere concerned with the reproduction of social and cosmic systems. While the latter sphere is regarded as morally positive, the former is, if not negative, at least morally ambiguous. If surplus (money, food and other gifts) is transferred from the short-term sphere to the other sphere, however, it is not only considered a morally positive act, but also as constituting an exchange of creativity. This exchange is attributed to the separation of the spheres, which implies that if distinctions that reify them are blurred, reactions will not be absent. The monk's concern with his non-laypeople behaviour makes him more or less a negation of the male gender. Moreover, while these regulations certainly make the monk's gender different from the layman's, they also make it dangerously similar to the female gender ? and <b>risks</b> of category <b>transgressions</b> are usually countered with taboos. When discussing sex- and money monks, the Thai Buddhists did not only question the moral status of the sangha. They also, indirectly, held it responsible for the economic crisis. The status of the sangha is thus linked to the status of the nation. While this certainly highlights the habitus of the monks, it simultaneously draws attention to the laypeople which, like Eve, provided the sangha with the apple that kicked humanity out of Eden. The Wat Phra Dhammakaya controversy could arguably be seen in this context. The majority of the movement's followers consist of affluent middleclass people; a section of Thai society dominated by the ethnic Chinese. Consequently, the questioning of the sangha {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the economic crisis, could be seen as religiously as well as politically motivated...|$|R
