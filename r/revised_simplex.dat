The proposed method is based mainly upon <b>revised</b> primal dual <b>simplex</b> algorithm (RPDSA).

50|$|Because the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> {{method is}} mathematically {{equivalent}} to the simplex method, it also suffers from degeneracy, where a pivot operation does not result in a decrease in , and a chain of pivot operations causes the basis to cycle.

50|$|The <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> {{method is}} mathematically {{equivalent}} to the standard simplex method but differs in implementation. Instead of maintaining a tableau which explicitly represents the constraints adjusted {{to a set of}} basic variables, it maintains a representation of a basis of the matrix representing the constraints. The matrix-oriented approach allows for greater computational efficiency by enabling sparse matrix operations.|$|E
50|$|Dantzig-Wolfe {{decomposition}} {{relies on}} delayed column generation {{for improving the}} tractability of large-scale linear programs. For most linear programs solved via the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> algorithm, at each step, most columns (variables) {{are not in the}} basis. In such a scheme, a master problem containing at least the currently active columns (the basis) uses a subproblem or subproblems to generate columns for entry into the basis such that their inclusion improves the objective function.|$|E

In the absence of degeneracy, a pivot operation always results in a strict decrease in [...] Therefore, if the problem is bounded, the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> method must terminate at an optimal vertex after repeated pivot operations because there are only a finite number of vertices.|$|E
50|$|The {{criss-cross}} algorithm {{works on}} a standard pivot tableau (or on-the-fly calculated parts of a tableau, if implemented like the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> method). In a general step, if the tableau is primal or dual infeasible, it selects one of the infeasible rows / columns as the pivot row / column using an index selection rule. An important property is that the selection is made on the union of the infeasible indices and the standard version of the algorithm does not distinguish column and row indices (that is, the column indices basic in the rows). If a row is selected then the algorithm uses the index selection rule to identify a position to a dual type pivot, while if a column is selected then it uses the index selection rule to find a row position and carries out a primal type pivot.|$|E

40|$|Parallelizing sparse simplex {{algorithms}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging problems. Because of very sparse matrices and very heavy communication, the ratio of computation to communication is extremely low. It becomes necessary to carefully select parallel algorithms, partitioning patterns, and communication optimization to achieve a speedup. Two implementations on Intel hypercubes are presented in this paper. The experimental results show that a nearly linear speedup can be obtained with the basic <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> algorithm. However, the basic <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> algorithm has many fill-ins. We also implement a <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> algorithm with LU decomposition. It is a very sparse algorithm, and it is very difficult to achieve a speedup with it. 1 Introduction Linear programming is a fundamental problem in the field of operations research.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{feasible}} direction {{method for}} solving Linear Programming (LP) problems, {{followed by a}} procedure for purifying a non-basic solution to an improved extreme point solution have been embedded within an otherwise simplex based optimizer, The algorithm {{is designed to be}} hybrid in nature and exploits many aspects of sparse matrix and <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> technology. The interior search step terminates at a boundary point which is usually non-basic. This is followed by a series of minor pivotal steps which lead to a basic feasible solution with a superior objective function value. It is concluded that the procedures discussed in this article are likely to have three possible applications, which are Ci) improving a non-basic feasible solution to a superior extreme point solution, (ii) an improved starting point for the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> method, and (iii) an efficient implementation of the multiple price strat-egy of the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> method. 1...|$|E

As linear programming techniques find applications in more diverse fields, {{the problem of}} solution time becomes increasingly important. A variation of the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex</b> algorithm, in which the constraints are added in a step-by-step fashion, is investigated as a potentially faster solution technique.

40|$|Linear {{programming}} {{is not a}} new field in mathematical problem solving. Until today, various methods and approaches have been invented for solving linear programming problems. One of the methods normally used is the <b>revised</b> <b>simplex.</b> For complex problems, solved manually using <b>revised</b> <b>simplex,</b> it requires time and understanding of matrices in addition to its complexity in calculation. At the same time, due to number of iterations that has to be done, the probability of error is high. Consequently, a new method for solving linear programming problems called the Comparison of slopes was designed. Generally, this method makes comparison of the slopes of the constraints and the objective function. As a start, the scope of this study only encompasses problems of two variables...|$|E
