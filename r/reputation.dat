5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the <b>reputation</b> system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a faction, their <b>reputation</b> with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a loss of <b>reputation.</b> The type of <b>reputation</b> the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good <b>reputation</b> might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; a bad <b>reputation</b> may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E

40|$|Although a users' opinion or a live {{voice is}} a very useful {{information}} for text mining of the business, {{it is difficult to}} extract good and bad <b>reputations</b> of users from texts written in natural language. The good and bad <b>reputations</b> discussed here depend on users' claims, interests and demands. This paper presents a method of determining these <b>reputations</b> in commodity review sentences. Multi-attribute rule is introduced to extract the <b>reputations</b> from sentences, and four-stage-rules are defined in order to evaluate good and bad <b>reputations</b> step by step. A deterministic multi-attribute pattern matching algorithm is utilized to determine the <b>reputations</b> efficiently. From simulation results for 2, 240 review comments, it is verified that the multi-attribute pattern matching algorithm is 63. 1 times faster than the Aho and Corasick method. The precision and recall of extracted <b>reputations</b> for each commodity are 94 % and 93 % respectively. Moreover, the precision and recall of the resulting <b>reputations</b> for each rule are 95 % and 95 % respectively.

40|$|Reputational career {{concerns}} provide {{incentives for}} short-lived agents to work hard, {{but it is}} well known that these incentives disappear as an agent reaches retirement. This paper investigates the effects of a market for firm <b>reputations</b> on the life cycle incentives of firm owners to exert effort. A dynamic general equilibrium model with moral hazard and adverse selection generates two main results. First, incentives of young and old agents are quantitatively equal, implying that incentives are "ageless" with a market for <b>reputations.</b> Second, good <b>reputations</b> cannot act as effective sorting devices: in equilibrium, more able agents cannot outbid lesser ones in the market for good <b>reputations.</b> In addition, welfare analysis shows that social surplus can fall if clients observe trade in firm <b>reputations.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of <b>reputation</b> in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of <b>reputation,</b> whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of <b>reputation</b> unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of <b>reputation.</b>|$|E

30|$|To {{resolve the}} {{abovementioned}} problems and challenging issues, the user <b>reputations</b> {{in social media}} need to be estimated upon concrete user features. Moreover, previous works hint that writing styles of social media users can be such objective features (Koppel et al. 2009). Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic approach that adopts the writing styles of users as objective features for estimating user <b>reputations</b> in social media. Nevertheless, following research gaps are identified through the literature reviews: first, no study has been made on an automated classification of user <b>reputations</b> in social media by using writing style analysis; second, when a way of defining user <b>reputations</b> into Good and Bad classes is given, it is unclear which writing style feature and classification technique will be better for this study; third, there is no reference on how to define the classes of user <b>reputations</b> in social media for the better performance.|$|R
40|$|A repeated-purchases {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to explore the}} fundamental economic factors that lie behind the choice of different quality assurance systems and their associated degrees of stringency by firms. Differences in the quality discoverability of a sought-after attribute, market structure, attractiveness of a market, nature of <b>reputations,</b> and the value placed in the future are among the factors contributing {{to the implementation of}} widely diverse systems across participants in different markets. Close attention is paid to the role of <b>reputations</b> in providing the incentives for firms to deliver high-quality goods. We model three different scenarios - monopoly, duopoly with firm-specific <b>reputations,</b> and duopoly with industry-wide <b>reputations</b> - and compare the resulting welfare of processors and their customers. We also provide a rationale for the branding efforts of many firms to distinguish their products along the supply chain. quality assurance, <b>reputations,</b> repeated purchases, product quality, supply chain, value-added agriculture, imperfect information, Marketing,...|$|R
30|$|The {{entrepreneurial}} {{nature of}} this configuration allows professionals to utilize their personal networks and <b>reputations</b> without being restricted by firm rules. Most PSFs that accept lateral hires welcome professionals with strong client relationships and personal <b>reputations.</b> At firms following an entrepreneurial governance model, the eat-what-you-kill remuneration system allows these professionals to profit directly from their human capital. The strong growth of Greenberg Traurig derived in large part from its ability to attract senior professionals who had already developed strong <b>reputations</b> and valuable client relationships.|$|R

Jessica angrily confronts him and the two unexpectedly kiss. Later, at a party they almost consummate their relationship before being discovered by other party-goers. Dain coldly departs, assuming Jessica invited the others to force him to honorably marry her, leaving her angry that he would leave her <b>reputation</b> in tatters so casually.|$|E

Moreover we establish that the timescales for the buildup and decay of <b>reputations</b> in the case of private information are much longer that those involving public information. This provides a plausible explanation for the rather sudden increase and collapse of <b>reputations</b> in a number of much publicized cases...|$|R
