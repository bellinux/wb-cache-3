25|$|In July 2008, {{the local}} {{ownership}} sold {{the paper to}} <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> chairman of Fox News, who named his wife Elizabeth as the new publisher. The paper has since altered its editorial content substantially, generating local controversy.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Roger</b> Eugene <b>Ailes</b> (May 15, 1940– May 18, 2017) was an American {{television}} {{executive and}} media consultant. [...] He was the Chairman and CEO of Fox News and the Fox Television Stations Group, {{from which he}} resigned in July 2016 following allegations that he sexually harassed female colleagues. Ailes was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, and for Rudy Giuliani's first mayoral campaign. In 2016, after he left Fox News, he became {{an adviser to the}} Donald Trump campaign, where he assisted with debate preparation.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 the Ailes {{family also}} {{purchased}} the Putnam County Courier, {{when it was}} shut down by Journal Register Co. (The first issue after publication resumed listed <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes</b> as owner and chairman, but Elizabeth Ailes has since been identified as the owner). The Courier was first established as the Putnam County Democrat in 1841.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005, the 33-year-old Murdoch {{abruptly}} resigned {{as an executive}} at the News Corp. The unexplained departure apparently dashed News Corp. Chief executive Rupert Murdoch's hopes that his son would one day take over as CEO of the global media empire, which includes the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, the Fox television network, several satellite broadcasters, and newspapers in Britain, Australia, and the United States. <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> the chairman of Fox News Channel, was named chairman of News Corp's group of television stations to succeed Murdoch junior. Media speculated that his brother, James Murdoch, {{the chief executive of}} UK satellite TV company BSkyB may succeed Rupert Murdoch. During his time as an executive at News Corp, Murdoch was the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of News Corporation (now 21st Century Fox). He had oversight of HarperCollins and the company's lines of business in Australia, including REA. He also served on the Board of Foxtel and as Chairman of Fox Television stations and was the publisher of the New York Post. He was appointed to the News Corp board in 1996.|$|E
500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} season began, Nixon focused his efforts on the [...] "big seven" [...] states: California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. He hired <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> whom he had first encountered during an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show, to produce one hour television programs to advertise the campaign in strategic regions. The campaign also continued to use televised town hall segments throughout the campaign, which aired live, featuring real voters whom were instructed to ask tough questions, following the campaign's belief that Nixon would respond well to such questions. Starting the ground campaign tour, during his first stop in Springfield, Illinois, he discussed the importance of unity, stating that [...] "America [...] needs to be united more than any time since Lincoln." [...] He then traveled to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania before returning to New York, meeting with Governor Rockefeller. In those Gallup polls following the convention, Nixon led Humphrey 45% to 29% and topped McCarthy 42% to 37%. At {{the end of the}} month, Hubert Humphrey narrowly won Democratic presidential nominee over McCarthy at the Democratic convention, which was filled with protest and riots. Analysts saw the Democrat's split, along with lacking [...] "law and order" [...] at the convention, positioning Nixon well. Shortly before the convention and throughout {{the general election}}, Nixon received regular briefings from President Johnson on developments in the Vietnam War. The President made it clear to Nixon {{that he did not want}} the war to be politicized, to which Nixon agreed, although questioning Humphrey's eventual compliance.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2017, Hannity paid {{a tribute}} to <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes</b> after his death. Hannity called him [...] "a second father" [...] and said to Ailes's [...] "enemies" [...] that he was [...] "preparing to kick your a** in the next life". Ailes had the year before been fired from Fox News {{after a number of}} women alleged that he sexually harassed them.|$|E
2500|$|Ailes died on May 18, 2017, in Palm Beach, Florida, {{after falling}} and hitting {{his head at}} his home the {{previous}} week. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner attributed his death to a subdural hematoma, aggravated by hemophilia. His wife, Elizabeth, announced his death in a statement on the Drudge Report: [...] "I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> passed away this morning".|$|E
2500|$|Two other weeklies are the Putnam County Times (historically Times & Republican) and Putnam County Press, {{virtually}} identical {{except that the}} former is distributed free. Both have been owned since 1958 by Don Hall. Hall and <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> though both Republicans, are bitter rivals. Hall had long derided Ailes as a part-time resident. When Ailes faced harassment allegations, leading to his ouster from Fox News, his Putnam County connection contributed to his being featured {{on the front pages}} of the Times and Press.|$|E
2500|$|After Fox News {{executive}} <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes</b> was {{the subject}} of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former Fox News coworker Gretchen Carlson, O'Reilly said in July 2016 that Ailes was a [...] "target" [...] as a [...] "famous, powerful or wealthy person" [...] and called him the [...] "best boss I ever had." [...] After Ailes was fired and the network settled the lawsuit with Carlson, O'Reilly declined to comment further, saying that [...] "for once in my life, I'm going to keep my big mouth shut." ...|$|E
2500|$|After leaving KCSB, Hannity {{placed an}} ad in radio {{publications}} presenting himself as [...] "the most talked about college radio host in America." [...] Radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama (part of the Huntsville market), then hired {{him to be the}} afternoon talk show host. From Huntsville, he moved to WGST in Atlanta in 1992, filling the slot vacated by Neal Boortz, who had moved to competing station WSB. In September 1996, Fox News co-founder <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes</b> hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title Hannity and LTBD ("liberal to be determined"). Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as Hannity & Colmes.|$|E
2500|$|In The Political Report of the Free Congress Foundation: [...] "September {{turned out}} to be a crucial month for the (Swindall) {{campaign}} since an experienced manager, Robb Austin, was hired. Austin shook up the organization and the campaign embarked on a strategy designed to 'smoke out' Levitas by presenting him as a big spender and too liberal for the district." [...] Austin developed an attack-oriented strategy and began tying Levitas' liberal votes to those of New York Democratic Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro (Vice Presidential running mate of Walter Mondale). Austin produced and created the campaign's newspaper and radio advertising with media consultant <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> currently President of the Fox News Channel, producing the campaign’s television spots.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1996 O'Reilly {{was hired}} by <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes,</b> {{chairman}} and CEO of the then startup Fox News Channel, to anchor The O'Reilly Report. The show was renamed The O'Reilly Factor, after his friend and branding expert John Tantillo's remarks upon the [...] "O'Reilly Factor" [...] {{in any of the}} stories he told. The program was routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming. The show was taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and aired every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00p.m. Eastern Time and was rebroadcast at 11:00p.m.|$|E
2500|$|Turner's {{most notable}} {{position}} {{was president of}} Multimedia Entertainment, a division of media conglomerate Multimedia, Inc., from 1991 to 1995. He created The Jerry Springer Show., he oversaw the production of The Phil Donahue Show and The Sally Jesse Raphael Show, and launched the Rush Limbaugh show on television. Jerry Springer recalled that he and Turner had a friendly, businesslike relationship though their politics differed. Turner shelved several Springer show episodes as inappropriate but kept the show on the air despite heavy criticism and calls from Congress to regulate the show's raunchy content. Limbaugh recalled of Turner: [...] "it was Bob Turner that chased <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes</b> and me down one night at 21 {{with the idea of}} doing a show. He was a great guy. He is a great guy. And he has the perfect temperament(...) and he was as loyal as the day is long." [...] Multimedia Entertainment was sold to Gannett Corporation for $2.1 billion in 1995 with Turner helping to orchestrate the sale. Gannett ended Rush Limbaugh's television show and Turner's 24-hour news talk station, the All-Talk Channel. In 1996, Multimedia Entertainment was sold to MCA/Universal Studios ...|$|E
2500|$|Letterman had {{initially}} wanted O'Brien {{to be in}} the promo as well, but he turned it down: [...] "No fucking way I'm doing that. It's not a joke to me—it's real." [...] O'Brien was sure his agreement prohibited television appearances for several months, but gathered NBC would be only too happy to allow him a one-time reprieve for the ad, as it was to improve Leno's image. O'Brien, by this point, was planning a live tour with his staff that would take him on the road, and had also created a Twitter account, which flourished (NBC closely monitored the account for anti-Leno sentiments). After about one hour online, O'Brien's number of Twitter followers had rocketed past the 30,000 followers of the official Jay Leno account, and he held over 300,000 followers in under 24 hours; he surpassed the one million mark in May 2010. Many speculated that O'Brien would sign a deal with Fox for a late-night program; Comedy Central and HBO had also expressed interest in O'Brien. Fox's deal moved slowly and they eventually withdrew their offer due to station resistance, the daunting financial investment and opposition from <b>Roger</b> <b>Ailes.</b>|$|E
