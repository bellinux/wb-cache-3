25|$|When Bond flies the new Gilbert XF-120 fighter, {{he finds}} {{dangerous}} structural problems that threaten its imminent acceptance by the Air Force. However, nobody <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> {{his claim that}} he did not subject the fighter prototype to stresses beyond its design specifications, especially H. G. Gilbert (Ralph Moody), the head of the company that built the fighter. When the general tries to replicate Bond's maneuvers, nothing untoward happens. Afterward, Bond sees Banner nearly collapse in the locker room, but Banner shrugs off the incident.|$|E
500|$|On May 27, {{the website}} Talking Points Memo posted a {{handwritten}} letter by Sestak to candidates declaring his intent {{to run for}} Senate. Sestak did not dispute {{the authenticity of the}} letter, but told the press he wanted to discuss the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice should be with the voters of Pennsylvania rather than the president. Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in his native Delaware County. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as [...] "a consistent liberal who <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called [...] "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay. Producer William Packer read the script and signed on; executive producers for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, Beyoncé, Mathew Knowles, Damon Lee and Loughery, while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively. Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To me, that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to make an issue of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we never really know how she's developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E

She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to.

2500|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{was mentioned}} throughout {{the second season}} of Larry David's HBO program Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, the Emmy award-winning success of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the CBS sitcom The New Adventures of Old Christine led many {{to believe that she}} had broken the curse. In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, [...] "I'm not somebody who <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> in curses, but curse this, baby!" [...] The show was on the air for five seasons starting March 13, 2006 before its cancellation on May 18, 2010; the series produced enough episodes to air in reruns in syndication for several years, something the other shows didn't achieve. The Saturday Night Live episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Louis-Dreyfus went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President Selina Meyer in HBO's comedy series Veep.|$|E
2500|$|Louis-Dreyfus also {{received}} considerable critical acclaim for her {{performance on the}} show, with Brian Lowry of Variety stating that Louis-Dreyfus broke the [...] "Seinfeld curse" [...] "with {{one of the best}} conventional half-hours to come along in a while." [...] Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times asserted that Louis-Dreyfus' performance on the series proved she is [...] "one of the funniest women on network television." [...] Louis-Dreyfus additionally earned the 2006 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance in the first season. Referring to the curse, she stated in her acceptance speech, [...] "I'm not somebody who <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> in curses, but curse this, baby!" [...] Throughout the course of the series, she received five consecutive Emmy Award nominations, three consecutive Satellite Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and a nomination for a Golden Globe Award.

2500|$|In Long Kesh in the mid-1970s, writing {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} [...] "Brownie" [...] in Republican News, Adams called for increased political activity among republicans, especially at local level. The call resonated with younger Northern people, {{many of whom}} had been active in the Provisional IRA but few of whom had been active in Sinn Féin. In 1977, Adams and Danny Morrison drafted the address of Jimmy Drumm at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown. The address was viewed as watershed in that Drumm acknowledged that the war would be a long one and that success depended on political activity that would complement the IRA's armed campaign. For some, this wedding of politics and armed struggle culminated in Danny Morrison's statement at the 1981 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in which he asked [...] "Who here <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> we can win the war through the ballot box? But will anyone here object if, with a ballot paper in one hand and the Armalite in the other, we take power in Ireland?" [...] For others, however, the call to link political activity with armed struggle had already been defined in Sinn Féin policy and in the presidential addresses of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, but this had not resonated with young Northerners.|$|E

2500|$|Leo Steinberg's {{controversial}} The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion {{points out}} that, [...] "Renaissance Art ... {{became the first}} Christian art in a thousand years to confront the Incarnation entire, the upper and the lower body together, not excluding even the body's sexual component." [...] He goes on to reference several works in which Christ's genitals are {{the focal point of}} the image, intentionally, so as to counter a heresy denying Christ's humanity. [...] He indicates that the sexuality of Christ – of God – is indeed within the canon of Catholicism itself. This controversy continues into the contemporary Catholic religion as well, revealing still a deep-seated uneasiness over how fleshly an imagination is too fleshly an imagination. [...] Greeley makes this point:The propensity to protect God from profanation, at the heart of the dialectical imagination, is very strong even among Catholics because official Catholicism has yet to make up its mind whether it <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> that sexual passion is not in itself lewd or lustful.Postmodern artists and artists today, influenced by the Catholic imagination, who are using aspects of the body to pose their questions to society, are frequently working out of the inherently complex contradictions of sacramental vision.|$|E
