25|$|The {{cab roof}} is {{reinforced}} {{to take the}} weight of two personnel and has a <b>roof</b> <b>hatch</b> and provision for a machine gun installation over an observer's platform inside the cab. For maintenance the cab can be hydraulically tilted forward 50°.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{dimensions}} {{and weight of}} the BMD-3 are diminutive in comparison to its counterparts. The crew consists of a driver, a vehicle commander, and a gunner and holds four passengers. There are seats for mounted infantrymen {{in the middle of}} the hull, with one stowage rack for three 9M111 or 9M113 ATGMs. There are also three racks for ammunitions boxes and a filter-ventilation unit. The commander's seat is on the right of the turret and has a cupola with a hatch cover that opens forward, while the gunner's seat is on the left and has a single-piece hatch cover that opens to the front. Of the four passengers, two are seated at the front with the other two near behind the turret. A firing port is provided on each side of the BMD-3. Additional infantry can be seated for short distances to the immediate rear of the turret with the <b>roof</b> <b>hatch</b> open. The seats of the combat crew are fastened to the roof of the combat compartments to improve protection from IEDs and mines. The engine compartment is located towards the rear of the BMD-3 consisting of a 450hp (horsepower) 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine, main clutch, gearbox, final drives and brakes. A collective NBC protection system was provided by over-pressurization of the combat compartment via a filter-ventilation unit to insure the survivability of the crew in an environment contaminated by nuclear fallout.|$|E
500|$|The {{prototype}} {{required a}} crew of five men; the hull contained the engine bay to the rear, with the driver and radio operator, who doubled as the hull machine gunner, seated at the front-left and front-right, respectively. In the turret, the tank commander sat beneath his <b>roof</b> <b>hatch,</b> while the gunner was situated {{to the left of}} the gun breech and the loader to the right. The turret was offset [...] {{to the left of the}} chassis center line, while the engine was moved [...] to the right. This allowed the torque shaft to clear the rotary base junction, which provided electrical power to turn the turret, while connecting to the transmission box mounted in the hull between the driver and radio operator. Due to the asymmetric layout, the right side of the tank contained the bulk of its stowage volume, which was taken up by ready-use ammunition lockers.|$|E
5000|$|Type B531 or Type 63-I (1981) - Improved {{version with}} {{stronger}} suspension, additional firing ports and two additional <b>roof</b> <b>hatches.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was quite}} elegant, slender, oval {{in cross section}} and smoothly metal skinned. [...] The cockpit was enclosed, but there were open gunners' positions at nose and tail. [...] Like the cockpit, the long main cabin was heated and soundproofed. [...] There was a large hatch in the floor for heavy loads with an integral hoist mounted above it, plus a smaller <b>roof</b> <b>hatch</b> through which loads could be lowered by crane. [...] The biplane tail unit had conventional fabric covered endplate fins and rudders, but the tailplanes were an unusual sesquiplane type. [...] The upper tailplane and elevator was strut mounted above the fuselage and the much narrower chord lower part fixed to the lower fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up on six spruce longerons, with bulkheads (formers) of spruce and three-ply. [...] Rather {{than the usual}} half round deck {{on the top of}} the fuselage, the Wee Bee's decking was concave as it reached the flat fuselage sides, making for a better view from the two tandem cockpits. [...] These were positioned at the leading edge and just behind mid-chord, fitted with dual controls. [...] Both cockpits were semi-enclosed and faired neatly into the upper fuselage/ wing surface. [...] The front one was entered by lifting up a small hinged part of the leading edge, which was locked down for flight; this gave excellent visibility with the help of the [...] "hollow ground" [...] decking. [...] The aft cockpit had a <b>roof</b> <b>hatch</b> with a transparent celluloid window in the upper wings, with good views though openings in the sides below the wing. [...] The 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub flat twin [...] engine was hung from a duralumin sheet bracket fixed to the engine bulkhead and positioned below with a pair of duralumin tubes, themselves braced to the lower longerons with steel tubes. [...] It was enclosed in a smooth, streamlined cowling, with the upper cylinder heads protruding for cooling.|$|E
2500|$|The Mamba is [...] in length, [...] in width, and has {{a height}} of [...] The four-wheeled vehicle can carry up to 10 passengers, {{excluding}} the driver. A <b>roof</b> <b>hatch</b> allows a gunner to use the weapon mount, which can be equipped with a 12.7 mm machine gun. A large door {{at the rear of}} the vehicle provides access to the passengers and crew. The Mk3 features better ballistic protection over the Mk2 – the latter can withstand impacts from up to 7.62×51mm NATO rounds, while the former is capable of handling 5.56×45mm NATO impacts. The Mk3 is also lighter, more stable, has lower operating costs and comes with an 8-speed transmission compared to the 4-speed transmission of the Mk2. However, the Mk3 has a range of only [...] whereas the Mk2 has a range of [...] The Mamba also provides protection against mines of up to [...] It has four-wheel drive capability, and can achieve a top speed of [...] Apart from the APC role, the vehicle may also be used as an ambulance, a command vehicle, a VIP transport, or a logistics vehicle. The newest Mamba, the Mk5, is manufactured by N4-Trucks in South Africa, and delivers 240hp (176Kw) from a water-cooled Iveco engine, a range over 600km, over 4,500kg payload, and a B7 ballistic protection versus previous B6 capabilities of the Mk1-Mk3.|$|E

50|$|Turret-down is the {{position}} in which the vehicle's crew can observe forward from <b>roof</b> <b>hatches,</b> but the vehicle is completely hidden (usually a few metres further back from a hull-down position). This can also apply to vehicles without turrets.|$|R
50|$|The Terrex's layout is conventional: {{the driver}} sits front {{left and the}} power pack is to the right. This leaves {{the rest of the}} vehicle clear for the troop compartment, which is {{provided}} with a power-operated ramp and <b>roof</b> <b>hatches.</b>|$|R

50|$|Parallel to the hopper and {{brake gear}} {{modifications}} a new arrangement of <b>roof</b> <b>hatches</b> was trialled. The early wagons were {{fitted with a}} pair of individual flip-open lids, while later wagons were fitted with a single, much longer rooftop hatch mounted on six hinges.|$|R
5000|$|Classical - M113 {{equipped}} with reactive armor and armored shields around <b>roof</b> <b>hatches.</b> It {{was introduced in}} the mid-1990s and saw action in the Southern Lebanon security zone. The added weight of the armor led to limited mobility and reliability problems and the vehicle was eventually removed from service.|$|R
5000|$|Finland's Jäger battalions {{operated}} Soviet-built BTR-60R-145BM [...] "Chaika" [...] vehicles. These were {{upgraded to}} BTR-60PUM standard between 1996 and 1997. In 1991, seven conscripts of the Karelia Brigade drowned when their BTR-60 sank at Taipalsaari during an amphibious exercise because the vehicle was loaded incorrectly (top-heavy) and the <b>roof</b> <b>hatches</b> opened.|$|R
