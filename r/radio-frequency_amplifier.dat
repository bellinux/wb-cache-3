50|$|A {{modulation}} transformer is an audio-frequency transformer {{that forms}} {{a major part}} of most AM transmitters. The primary winding of a modulation transformer is fed by an audio amplifier that has about 1/2 of the rated input power of the transmitter's final amplifier stage. The secondary winding is in series with the power supply of that final <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage, thereby allowing the audio signal to lower and raise the instantaneous DC supply voltage of the power amplifier (PA) tube or transistor. Considering that the PA device is operated as a class-C amplifier, i.e. as a switch, the modulation transformer is responsible for the amplitude modulation (AM) of the transmitter.|$|E

40|$|Components {{and systems}} for the scalable, very {{large-scale}} integration (VLSI) of thousands of microfluidic devices into Micro Total Analysis Systems (μTAS) are the fo-cus of much ongoing research. Most solutions to date have focused on either a) the scal-ing and modification of conventional pneumatically-driven elastomer microfluidics or b) the development of electrically or magnetically addressable fluidic components and sys-tems. Although these technologies have each solved the integration problem partially, they still leave something to be desired such as lack of on-chip power or degradation in chip performance due to cross contamination. This thesis presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of an electrostati-cally actuated user-reconfigurable elastomer microfluidic system intended for VLSI mi-crofluidics. Capacitor plates form top (deformable) {{and bottom of the}} micro chan-nel/chamber, facilitating gap-closing actuation. Device fabrication followed standard mi-cromaching process. We also present experimental results of flow and pressure data for valves, pumps and demonstrate various multi-component configurations of the system. The presented technology is compatible with standard polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mi-crofluidics, has actuation voltages low enough to be driven by commercial CMOS IC’s and can be used to displace aqueous, gaseous and lipid phases. By adding thin film metal flexures into the PDMS polymer, individual elastomer channels were made to self-close without the use of pneumatics via the application of 10 – 20 V, 5 MHz signals synthesized digitally by a microcontroller and a <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> IC. These valves were integrated into discrete micro valve and three-valve peristaltic micro pumps. A single valve was able to hold 6 psi pressure, and the peristaltic pump had a flow rate 4. 4 valve-volume/min (1 - 2 nL/min), depending on the actuation frequency and device configuration. Further, these valves were arranged into hexagonal or quadricular arrays with 75 % fill factor. During use, valves were selected to be permanently closed, permanently open or addressable; this allowed for the on-the-fly determination of channels, valves and pumps.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis sets out to investigate improvements to the power amplifier design cycle {{through the use of}} recently developed radio-frequency waveform measurement and characterisation systems. One key objective of this work is to improve the overall efficiency of the modern wireless communication system by focusing on the <b>radio-frequency</b> power <b>amplifier</b> stage. More specifically, the direct utilisation of waveform-engineering techniques in the development of methodologies for the design and realisation of efficiency enhanced <b>radio-frequency</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> was targeted. In developing these power amplifier design methodologies, work has also led to significant advancements into the possibilities of 'first-pass-design' success. Through the direct import of captured waveform data into a computer-aided design environment, along with efficiency-optimised multi-harmonic and intermediate-frequency impedance information, a stable and highly efficient power amplifier has been realised. This direct implementation of waveform measurements completely by-passes any involvement with potentially unreliable nonlinear device models. Hence this has eliminated the need for multiple iterations of matching networks, resulting in a dramatically more time-efficient design process. Waveform-engineering-based designs completed in this research have been demonstrated with both very high-efficiency (70 - 80 %), narrowband modes of operation, as well as a high-efficiency (60 - 70 %) broadband mode covering almost an octave bandwidth.

50|$|This type of tetrode was {{developed}} to correct deficiencies in the triode tube which became apparent when {{attempts were made to}} use triodes as small-signal <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> In the triode, the control grid was next to the plate. Capacitance between these two electrodes caused instability and oscillation when both anode and grid were connected into tuned resonant circuits, {{as was the case in}} early radios, or in any application where the anode circuit presented an inductive reactive load to the valve. Oscillation could only be avoided by using very small stage gain at frequencies above about 100 kHz, and at frequencies above 1 MHz, triodes are virtually useless in tuned amplifiers in which both anode and grid circuits are tuned to the same frequency. A second advantage of the tetrode, which also arose from reduced anode-grid capacitance, was that, when the anode voltage was in a certain range, changing its value had much less effect on the anode current than was the case with triodes. This corresponds to an increased anode slope resistance, and allowed much higher voltage gain by permitting a larger external load resistance. At the time of the introduction of screen-grid valves (around 1927) a typical small triode used for small-signal amplification had an anode slope resistance of 20kOhms or less, and a grid-anode capacitance of 1 to 5pF, while the corresponding figures for a typical screen grid valve were 1MOhm and 0.004pF - in some cases much less capacitance.|$|R
