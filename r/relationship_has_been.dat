5|$|Andy's and Red's <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{described}} as a non-sexual love story between two men, that few other films offer, where the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.|$|E
5|$|Grissom and Sidle's <b>{{relationship}}</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the subject}} of intense debate {{in the press and}} on-line forums, between fans of the romantic relationship and those who believe the romance detracts from what was once a show devoted mainly to mysteries and a forensics laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is one of}} 19 species in the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original spiny lobster genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the rise.|$|E
5|$|Michel Roux is {{the brother}} of Albert Roux. Michel has a son named Alain Roux, while Albert's son is Michel Roux, Jr.. When Alain was ten years old, Michel and his wife divorced, with his wife taking British born Alain and his two sisters to France. Alain would visit during the school {{holidays}} and work with Michel in the kitchens and decided {{at the age of}} fourteen that he wanted to become a chef like his father. Michel met his second wife, Robyn Joyce, after being set up on a blind date with her by former apprentice Leigh Stone-Herbert in Sydney, Australia. The <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> credited with opening the door to Australian chefs being trained by the Roux brothers.|$|E

25|$|In the Aeneid of Vergil, Nisus, a Trojan soldier, is in a {{relationship}} with Euryalus, a younger Trojan soldier.

25|$|The biblical text {{does not}} {{explicitly}} depict {{the nature of}} the relationship between David and Jonathan.
