40|$|The {{economic}} problems {{the world is}} currently facing have caused severe cost pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturing. Revalidation of manufacturing processes and equipment comprises a significant cost to the industry. Maintaining a validated status is a regulatory requirement. Technical issues, patient risk, and business considerations impact the organizational approach to revalidation. This discussion addresses the need for revalidation with particular attention to business considerations. Strategies to prioritise revalidation among systems and how to decide on what, how, and when <b>to</b> <b>revalidate</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Alternative approaches when revalidation is not possible are suggested. Costs associated with revalidation <b>are</b> described. Activities <b>to</b> {{reduce the need for}} revalidation including statistical process control are discussed. Business models for approaching revalidation including in-house and outsourcing are considered. Change management is a key component of a revalidation program. Also key is a structured approach to validation maintenance as time-based and eventbased. Considerations in these discussions do not compromise patient safety and product quality. Business factors only determine the order in which the systems <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>revalidated.</b> Under no circumstances would the product of a manufacturing process that <b>is</b> not validated <b>to</b> regulatory expectations <b>be</b> released <b>to</b> the marketplace.

40|$|Abstract. As XML schemas evolve {{over time}} or as {{applications}} are integrated, it <b>is</b> sometimes necessary <b>to</b> validate an XML document known {{to conform to}} one schema with respect to another schema. More generally, XML documents known to conform to a schema may be modified, and then, require validation with respect to another schema. Recently, solutions have been proposed for incremental validation of XML documents. These solutions assume that the initial schema to which a document conforms and the final schema with which it must be validated after modifications are the same. Moreover, they assume that the input document may be preprocessed, which in certain situations, may be computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we describe how knowledge of conformance to an XML Schema (or DTD) may <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> determine conformance to another XML Schema (or DTD) efficiently. We examine both the situation where an XML document is modified before it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>revalidated</b> and the situation where it is unmodified. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} general notion of robust {{controller}} specification and {{a mechanism for}} sequentially composing them. These specifications form tubular abstractions of the trajectories of a system in different control modes, and are motivated by the techniques available for certifying the performance of low-level controllers. The notion of controller specification provides a rigorous interface for connecting a planner and lower-level controllers that are designed independently. With this approach, the planning layer does not integrate the closed-loop system dynamics and {{does not require the}} knowledge of how the controllers operate, but relies only on the specifications of the output tracking performance achieved by these controllers. The control layer aims at satisfying specifications that account quantitatively for robustness to unmodeled dynamics and various sources of disturbance and sensor noise, so that this robustness does not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>revalidated</b> at the planning level. As an illustrative example, we describe a randomized planner that composes different controller specifications from a given database to guarantee that any corresponding sequence of control modes steers a robot to a given region while avoiding obstacles.

40|$|Technological {{innovation}} is {{the hallmark of}} the computer hardware industry. Keeping pace with this {{innovation is}} a major challenge for software engineering: new hardware makes new resources available, but to take advantage of them the software must be migrated (or ported) to the new hardware platform. This is not trivial. An idealistic approach of developing and validating new software from scratch for every (significant) improvement in hardware is impractical in view of deadlines and budgetary constraints. For example, it <b>is</b> infeasible <b>to</b> rewrite all of the existing sequential software {{to take full advantage of}} the new multi-core CPUs. At the same time, it <b>is</b> dangerous <b>to</b> directly reuse software written for one platform on another. A new platform changes the underlying assumptions and requires the software <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>revalidated,</b> at great cost. This is particularly a problem in safety-critical domains that depend on complex software with lifetimes spanning decades and several major technological changes. In the rest of this position, we call the problem of deciding whether an existing system behaves correctly under a new set of environmental assumptions the revalidation problem...|$|R

40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} trait relevance to a specific task on people's projection of their characteristics onto a cooperative partner. We either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2) the relevance of a trait to a specific cooperative task. In both studies, participants first rated themselves {{on a list of}} traits. Then they imagined completing a cooperative task with an unknown partner. Finally, they rated the partner on the same list of traits. In Study 1, we found partner <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively influenced by self ratings and the idiosyncratic measure of trait relevance. In Study 2, participants rated the self and the partner on competence and warmth traits while completing an intellectual or a social task. We found partner <b>ratings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively influenced by self ratings more on competence than on warmth in the intellectual task, but more on warmth than on competence in the social task. These results suggest that people project onto others in a way that maximizes their chances to succeed in cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

A few clinical trials {{have shown that}} approximately 40  % of chronic phase CML patients who achieved and sustained a deep molecular response could stop administration of TKI and maintain treatment free remission (Mahon et al. 2010; Ross et al. 2013). Thus, accurate and reproducible molecular monitoring is essential for treatment management in CML, {{and the lack of}} standardization may lead to a diagnostic misclassification. Nonetheless, it is not widely understood that the RT-qPCR technique potentially produces highly variable quantitative data which may affect the validity of results and decision on treatments (Zhang et al. 2007). Establishment of the laboratory-specific CF, which has been used for standardization based on the IS is lengthy, costly, and not realistic for many clinical laboratories, because of the limited number of reference laboratories, currently only Mannheim and Adelaide, with which to exchange samples (Cross et al. 2008). Furthermore, the CF <b>is</b> recommended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>revalidated</b> on a yearly basis or in case of changing reagents for RT-qPCR at a local laboratory (Muller et al. 2010).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of soliciting a rating on the actual outcome of bank ratings. Using two sample banks (one rated by Fitch and one rated by S&P), I find evidence that unsolicited <b>ratings</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower than solicited ones, after accounting for differences in observable bank characteristics. This downward bias does not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{explained by the fact}} that better-quality banks self-select into the solicited group. Rather, unsolicited <b>ratings</b> appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower because they are based on public information and are therefore dependent on the quantity of public information disclosed by the banks. As a result, unsolicited <b>ratings</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more conservative than solicited ratings, which incorporate both public and non-public information. While the latter result is also consistent with the fact that credit rating agencies may blackmail low-disclosure firms, the findings suggest that blackmailing-if it is actually used-is ineffective in making these firms start to pay for a rating. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
