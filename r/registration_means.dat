30|$|In this review, {{we focus}} on the point {{features}} used in medical image registration, because points are the most commonly used features in clinical applications. Point-feature-based <b>registration</b> <b>means</b> that the geometrical transformation between two images is only obtained through the characteristics of the feature points. The geometrical transformation can be classified into the rigid transformation and the non-rigid transformation according to whether there are feature deformations or not. Rigid geometric transformations are often used in the registration of rigid structures, such as bones. Another important application of a rigid transformation is to obtain a rough pre-registration result before a more complex and precise geometric transformation. Non-rigid geometrical transformations are usually used to finalize the precise registration or the registration of structures accompanied with deformations.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} optimisations to {{a three-dimensional}} (3 D) face recognition method the authors published in 2011. The optimisations concern handling and estimation of motion {{from a single}} 3 D image using the symmetry of the face, fine registration by selection of the maximum score for small variations of the registration parameters and efficient training using automatic outlier removal where {{only part of the}} classifier is retrained. The optimisations lead to a staggering performance improvement: the verification rate on Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) v 2 data at false accept rate = 0. 1 % increases from 94. 6 to 99. 3 % and the identification rate increases from 99 to 99. 4 %. Both are, to the authors' knowledge, the best scores ever published on the FRGC data. In addition, the registration time was reduced from about 2. 5 to 0. 2 – 0. 6 s and the number of comparisons has increased from about 11 000 to more than 50 000 per second.

40|$|Finding a {{coordinate}} {{transformation is}} a fundamental task in diverse fields of mathematical applications. In this thesis, we propose new techniques of computing coordinate transformations for two different applications. In the first application, the transformations are computed to generate adaptive meshes that are suitable for solving time-dependent partial differential equations in two or more spatial dimensions. For the second application, the transformations are developed for an elastic image registration. <b>Registration</b> <b>means</b> establishing a coordinate transformation between two or more images taken, for example, at different times or from different viewpoints. The transformations are formulated based on solving the optimal mass transport problem, {{also known as the}} Monge [...] Kantorovich problem. This problem concerns finding the best way of moving a pile of material from one site to another with minimum transportation cost. Two different methods are described to compute the transformations for each application. In the first method, the solution of the problem is obtained as the steady-state solution of a parabolic partial differential equation. The second method is a velocity based method in which a velocity field is obtained using the fluid dynamics formulation of the $L^ 2 $~Monge [...] Kantorovich problem. The optimal mass transport approach for computing coordinate transformations has a number of useful features. The existence and uniqueness of the transformation are guaranteed from the Kantorovich theory. Moreover, it can be characterized as the gradient of a convex function, i. e., it is rotation free. A number of theoretical issues for computing these transformations are addressed. Several numerical experiments are presented to show the performance of the proposed approach for both adaptive grid generation and image registration for medical applications...|$|E

Workers in the chancellery enter data on specific items into data bases, according to the expactations of the Records Management Ordinance. Existing data are being extended by specific data helpful for registry workers to implement records disposal. A dossier is accompanied by orientational retention period, and each file by specific retention period expressed by years of retention or by particular date. Records planned to be disposed are followed by syntetical and analitical disposition lists. According to the analitical list it is possible to implement records disposal with precision at a file level, including all documents inside the file, and not, as up to now, at a class level. Insight into the file gives an information on its disposition status: it confirms if the file is archived, showing its retention period, or it shows that the file is disposed, indicating a date of its destruction.

40|$|Background Calculation of {{accumulated}} dose in fractionated radiotherapy based on spatial mapping of the dose points generally requires deformable image registration (DIR). The {{accuracy of the}} {{accumulated dose}} thus depends heavily on the DIR quality. This motivates investigations of how the registration uncertainty influences dose planning objectives and treatment outcome predictions. A framework was developed where the dose mapping {{can be associated with}} a variable known uncertainty to simulate the DIR uncertainties in a clinical workflow. The framework enabled us to study the dependence of dose planning metrics, and the predicted treatment outcome, on the DIR uncertainty. The additional planning margin needed to compensate for the dose mapping uncertainties can also be determined. We applied the simulation framework to a hypofractionated proton treatment of the prostate using two different scanning beam spot sizes to also study the dose mapping sensitivity to penumbra widths. Results The planning parameter most sensitive to the DIR uncertainty was found to be the targetD 95. We found that the <b>registration</b> <b>mean</b> absolute error needs to be ≤ 0. 20 cm to obtain an uncertainty better than 3 % of the calculated D 95  for intermediate sized penumbras. Use of larger margins in constructing PTV from CTV relaxed the registration uncertainty requirements to the cost of increased dose burdens to the surrounding organs at risk. Conclusions The DIR uncertainty requirements should be considered in an adaptive radiotherapy workflow since this uncertainty can have significant impact on the accumulated dose.

40|$|PURPOSE: To objectively {{evaluate}} treatment {{outcomes in}} oral and maxillofacial surgery, pre- and post-treatment 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{photographs of the}} patient's face can be registered. For clinical use, it is of great importance that this registration process is accurate (< 1 mm). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the accuracy of different registration procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen volunteers (7 males, 8 females; mean age, 23. 6 years; range, 21 to 26 years) were invited to participate in this study. Three-dimensional photographs were captured at 3 different times: baseline (T(0)), after 1 minute (T(1)), and 3 weeks later (T(2)). Furthermore, a 3 D photograph of the volunteer laughing (T(L)) was acquired to investigate the effect of facial expression. Two different registration methods were used to register the photographs acquired at all different times: surface-based registration and reference-based registration. Within the surface-based registration, 2 different software packages (Maxilim [Medicim NV, Mechelen, Belgium] and 3 dMD Patient [3 dMD LLC, Atlanta, GA]) were used to register the 3 D photographs acquired at the various times. The surface-based registration process was repeated with the preprocessed photographs. Reference-based registration (Maxilim) was performed twice by 2 observers investigating the inter- and intraobserver error. RESULTS: The <b>mean</b> <b>registration</b> errors are small for the 3 D photographs at rest (0. 39 mm for T(0) -T(1) and 0. 52 mm for T(0) -T(2)). The <b>mean</b> <b>registration</b> error increased to 1. 2 mm for the registration between the 3 D photographs acquired at T(0) and T(L). The <b>mean</b> <b>registration</b> error for the reference-based method was 1. 0 mm for T(0) -T(1), 1. 1 mm for T(0) -T(2), and 1. 5 mm for T(0) and T(L). The <b>mean</b> <b>registration</b> errors for the preprocessed photographs were even smaller (0. 30 mm for T(0) -T(1), 0. 42 mm for T(0) -T(2), and 1. 2 mm for T(0) and T(L)). Furthermore, a strong correlation between the results of both software packages used for surface-based registration was found. The intra- and interobserver error for the reference-based registration method was found to be 1. 2 and 1. 0 mm, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surface-based registration is an accurate method to compare 3 D photographs of the same individual at different times. When performing the registration procedure with the preprocessed photographs, the registration error decreases.

Factors associated with increased waitlist mortality were older age, female gender, blood type 0, diabetes, no HCC and transplant region (p< 0. 001). OLT recipient characteristics associated with increased risk for post OLT mortality were female gender, age, diabetes, race (p< 0, 0001), and allocation MELD (p = 0. 005).
