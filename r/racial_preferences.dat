25|$|In Bakke, the Court {{held that}} racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that {{educational}} institutions could legally use race {{as one of}} many factors to consider in their admissions process. In Grutter and Gratz, the Court upheld both Bakke as a precedent and the admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. In dicta, however, Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, <b>racial</b> <b>preferences</b> {{would no longer be}} necessary. In Gratz, the Court invalidated Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school's policy, which treated race as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.|$|E
25|$|Between 1966 and 1968, Northwestern {{increased}} African American enrollments {{from less}} than 50 to 160. After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, African American students on campus began expressing increasingly militant and separatist views demanding the administration increase recruitment activity and provide separate facilities for black students. After the university rejected their demands, on May 3, 1968 a group of 100 African American students identifying themselves as For Members Only and the Afro-American Student Union barricaded themselves the Bursar's Office and began a sit-in, demanding the university implement an admissions quota, increase financial aid, construct an all-black dorm and student center, create a Black Studies curriculum, and desegregate the university's real estate holdings in Evanston. In light of controversy surrounding the student protests at Columbia and Berkeley that spring, negotiations between Dean of Students Roland Hinz and AASU leader James Turner led to the sit-in dispersing peacefully after 38 hours. Although the administration rejected demands for <b>racial</b> <b>preferences</b> in admissions and financial aid, it made several concessions regarding desegregation, increasing student participation in policy matters, and developing a Department of African-American Studies.|$|E

However, children change their <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> across the requests. Two interpretations {{of these changes}} are offered.

500|$|During the 1950s, racial {{discrimination}} was common throughout America and {{the auto industry}} was not immune. [...] African-Americans were typically offered only the lowest paying jobs or were outright denied employment as employers openly advertised for [...] "white only" [...] applicants. [...] Workplace discrimination was not universal, but it was widespread {{and it was not}} until 1955 that listing <b>racial</b> <b>preferences</b> in job advertising became illegal under Michigan law. [...] Still, hiring practices varied according to the individual plant managers, so some factories were relatively integrated while others had virtually no black employees. [...] African-Americans had made up 15 percent of the auto manufacturing workforce in 1945 increasing only slightly to 16 percent by 1960, even while blacks outnumbered whites in the city of Detroit.

The concepts that constitute African-centered consciousness [...] namely racial awareness, racial identity, and <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> [...] are defined. The psychological states that result whenever a mass media communication successfully or potentially disparages racial awareness, racial identity, or <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> are identified as psychological misorientation and mentacide (as defined in the Azibo Nosology). These two psychological states form the bedrock of the criteria such that any mass media communication that can potentially or does actually engender psychological misorientation or mentacide is seen to vitiate or actually deplete African-centered consciousness.

2500|$|The Court's {{majority}} ruling, {{authored by}} Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, {{held that the}} United States Constitution [...] "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." [...] The Court held that the law school's interest in obtaining a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students was indeed a [...] "tailored use". O'Connor noted that sometime in the future, perhaps twenty-five years hence, racial affirmative action {{would no longer be}} necessary in order to promote diversity. It implied that affirmative action should not be allowed permanent status and that eventually a [...] "colorblind" [...] policy should be implemented. The opinion read, [...] "race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time." [...] "The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of <b>racial</b> <b>preferences</b> as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of <b>racial</b> <b>preferences</b> will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today." [...] The phrase [...] "25 years from now" [...] was echoed by Justice Thomas in his dissent. Justice Thomas, writing that the system was [...] "illegal now", concurred with the majority only on the point that he agreed the system would still be illegal 25 years hence.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{investigation}} into the behavioral and attitudinal consequences of constrained <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> {{in the context of an}} affirmative action plan. Given that hiring managers may often be constrained by organizational policy to show hiring preference to members of a minority group in order to implement an affirmative action program, this study examined the effect of such race-conscious selection decisions on subsequent selection decisions which are not similarly constrained by <b>racial</b> <b>preference.</b> It was predicted that the effects of race-conscious selection decisions would not be isolated to the individual selection of a job applicant. A compensatory model was proposed in which the effects of constrained <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> would be carried over to interact with subsequent selection decisions concerning other job applicants, resulting in a reduced probability that Black applicants would be hired in subsequent hiring decisions. ^ Seven hypotheses were tested, examining the effects of applicant race, job-related qualifications, fairness perceptions, and affirmative action hiring policy on the evaluation of job applicants and the probability that Black applicants would be hired. Results indicated a relative decrease in the number of Black applicants hired across selection trials. Further, post hoc analyses indicated that subsequent selection decisions demonstrated adverse impact against Black applicants. The role of fairness perceptions was only partially supported. Limitations of the present study and directions for future research are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Minorities {{are often}} {{suspected}} beneficiaries (e. g., Heilman, 1994) {{of affirmative action}} [...] that is, they are individuals who attribute or perceive that others attribute their selection for a job or admission to a school, in part, to preference given to race or gender status. Experimental {{research has shown that}} suspected beneficiaries experience negative self-evaluations, yet little research has focused on performance outcomes. I draw upon attribution theory (e. g., Kelly, 1972) and stereotype threat theory (C. M. Steele & Aronson, 1995) to extend the literature by examining the emotions and academic performance of freshmen college students who are suspected beneficiaries. I hypothesize that racial minorities are more likely than are Whites, and women are more likely than are men, to be suspected beneficiaries of <b>racial</b> and gender <b>preference,</b> respectively. These attributions lead to decreased academic self-efficacy and increased evaluation apprehension and anxiety, which ultimately decrease academic performance. Additionally, I pose research questions to explore factors that mitigate the effect of attributions on these outcomes. I use structural equation modeling to test my hypotheses. The results suggest that racial minorities and women are more likely than Whites and men, respectively, to be suspected beneficiaries. Further, attributions of <b>racial</b> and gender <b>preference</b> lead to the hypothesized negative outcomes. I find that past academic performance moderates the relation between attributions of gender preference and anxiety, such that students who scored higher on the SAT and (perceive that others) attribute their admission to gender preference experience more anxiety than do students who scored lower on the SAT and (perceive that others) attribute their admission to gender preference. Additionally, social support moderates the relation between attributions of <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> and evaluation apprehension, such that students who receive high levels of social support and (perceive that others) attribute their admission to <b>racial</b> <b>preference</b> experience less evaluation apprehension than do students who receive low levels of social support and (perceive that others) attribute their admission to <b>racial</b> <b>preference.</b> Overall, the results support the perception that uncertainty in the selection process can lead to attributions of preferential selection and harmful consequences for racial minorities and women...|$|R
