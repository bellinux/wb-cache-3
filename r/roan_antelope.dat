5|$|In 1846, the Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Jakob Sundevall {{moved the}} bluebuck and its closest relatives to the genus Hippotragus; he had originally named this genus for the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> (H. equinus) in 1845. This revision was commonly accepted by other writers, {{such as the}} British zoologists Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas, who restricted the genus Antilope to the blackbuck (A. cervicapra) in 1899. In 1914, the name Hippotragus was submitted for conservation (so older, unused genus names could be suppressed) to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) with the bluebuck as type species. However, the original 1845 naming of the genus with the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> as single species was overlooked and later suppressed by the ICZN, leading to some taxonomic confusion. In 2001, the British ecologist Peter J. Grubb proposed that the ICZN should rescind its suppression of the 1845 naming and make the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> the type species of Hippotragus, since too {{little is known about}} the bluebuck for it to be a reliable type species. This was accepted by the commission in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope.</b> After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Klein {{studied the}} fossils of Hippotragus species in South Africa. Most {{of these were}} found to {{represent}} the bluebuck and the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope.</b> The fossil record suggested that the bluebuck occurred in large numbers during the last glacial period (nearly 0.1million years ago), and was more common than sympatric antelopes. The bluebuck could adapt to more open habitats than could the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope,</b> a notable point of difference between these species. Fossils of the bluebuck {{have been found in}} the Klaises River and the Nelson Bay Cave (near Plettenberg Bay) and Swartklip (to the west of the Hottentots Holland mountains). Faith et al. 2013 noted that the western and southern CFR were separated by biogeographical barriers, such as the Cape Fold Belt and afromontane forests. A 2011 study suggested that low sea levels facilitated migrations for large mammals; therefore the rise in sea levels with the beginning of the Holocene would have led to fragmented bluebuck populations and distanced many populations from the western coast (fossils dating to this period are scarce in the western coast but have been recorded from the southern coast). Thus, a mass extinction could have taken place, leaving behind mainly the populations that remained in the resource-rich western CFR. The causes of the drastic decline in bluebuck populations just before the 15th and 16th centuries have not been investigated; competition with livestock and habitat deterioration could have been major factors in its depletion.|$|E
50|$|Other {{wildlife}} includes elephants, buffaloes, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> kob antelopes and warthogs. The West African giraffe {{is currently}} {{not found in}} the W National Park, but further north in Niger, where it has its last relict population.|$|R
50|$|Kainji Lake National Park (KNLP) (headquarters Wawa) is {{situated}} 560 km north of Lagos, {{close to the}} border with the Republic of Benin. It comprises two sectors, Borgu Game Reserve and Zugurma Game Reserve, which are separated by Kainji Lake. The abundant wildlife in the game preserves include baboons, duikers, hippopotami, hyenas, kobs, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> and warthogs.|$|R
50|$|Mammals include elephants, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> duikers, hartebeest, baboons, warthog, bushbuck, patas monkeys, {{and green}} monkeys. There {{are at least}} 177 species of birds, {{including}} migrants and residents.The park is important for species such as the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the Abyssinian ground-hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus) which are rare {{in other parts of}} Nigeria.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the small}} range of the bluebuck {{at the time of}} European {{settlement}} of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 years ago, but the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also {{have played a role in}} the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times.|$|E
5|$|The Copperbelt {{strike of}} May 1935 was a strike by African mineworkers in the Copperbelt Province of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) on 29 May 1935 to protest taxes levied by the British colonial administration. The strike {{involved}} {{three of the}} province's four major copper mines: those in Mufulira, Nkana and <b>Roan</b> <b>Antelope.</b> Near the latter, six protesters were killed by police and the strike ended. Although it failed, the strike was the first organized industrial agitation in Northern Rhodesia and is viewed by some as the first overt action against colonial rule. It {{caught the attention of}} a number of African townsmen, leading to the creation of trade unions and African nationalist politics, and is seen as the birth of African nationalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of large deposits of copper sulfide during the 1900s encouraged large mining companies {{to invest in}} Northern Rhodesia. South Afric{{an interest in the}} region was led by the Anglo American Corporation, which gained an interest in the Bwana Mkubwa Company in 1924 and acquired a one-third interest in Mufulira in 1928. That year, Anglo American acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American; shareholders included the United States, South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company. As the BSAC purchased shares in Rhodesian Anglo American, the latter became a major shareholder in BSAC. By 1930, Chester Beatty's Rhodesian Selection Trust and Ernest Oppenheimer's Anglo-American Corporation controlled most of the region's mining. The <b>Roan</b> <b>Antelope</b> and Nkana mines began commercial production in 1931.|$|E
50|$|Game species {{range from}} African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus), <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes</b> (Hippotragus equinus), eastern black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis michaeli), Rothschild's giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi), oribis (Ourebia ourebi), cape buffalos, Lelwel hartebeests (Alcelaphus buselaphus lelwel), olive baboons, Bohor reedbucks (Redunca redunca), hyenas, servals (Leptailurus serval), topis (Damaliscus korrigum), honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) and vervet monkeys among others.|$|R
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes</b> and oryxes.|$|R
50|$|Nkasa Rupara forms a {{corridor}} for all large mammal species moving between Namibia and Botswana, particularly African elephant and buffalo. There are about 1 000 buffalo in Nkasa Rupara, the largest concentration in Namibia. Around 560 hippopotami and 500 crocodile {{occur in the}} park’s rivers and channels. Rare antelope species include sitatungas, pukus, red lechwe, reedbucks and oribis. Mammals of this park as well as reptiles feature elephants, Katanga lions, Namibian cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyenas, Cape wild dogs, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> impala, kudus, warthogs, baboons, spotted-necked otters, rock monitor lizards and water monitor lizards.|$|R
5|$|The strike {{involved}} {{three of}} the province's four major copper mines: the mines at Mufulira, Nkana and <b>Roan</b> <b>Antelope.</b> On the morning of 21 May 1935, police at Mulfulira announced that taxes were raised from 12 to 15 shillings a year. The strike was spontaneous, with morning-shift miners refusing to go underground. It was led by three Zambians from the Northern Province: William Sankata, Ngostino Mwamba and James Mutali at the Mufulira mine. The other African miners refused to report to work, shouted slogans against the authorities and threw stones at them and non-supportive Africans. At the other two mines, the strike was less spontaneous than at Mufulira (where the tax increase was received with disbelief) and police arrested leaders as a precautionary measure. News of the Mufulira strike spread {{to the other two}} mines with the inflow of miners from Mufulira. Beni dancers, who developed the dance form during the colonial era and who mimicked military and colonial administration with music and aesthetic expression, were instrumental in structured communication during the strike. African workers went on strike in Nkana on 27 May, but it failed and ended the following day due to poor leadership. The strike at <b>Roan</b> <b>Antelope,</b> where some tribal leaders participated, turned violent. On 29 May, a large crowd gathered around the compound containing police, officials, clerks and elders; protesters began throwing stones and shouting slogans. The police panicked and fired, leading to the deaths of six protesters and injuring 17 others. Shocked at the shootout, the strikers called off the strike. According to a UNESCO International Scientific Committee report, organized demonstrations were held on 22 May at the Mulfra mine and spread to Nkana on 26 May and the Luansha mines on 28 May. Casualties were reported as 28 killed or injured, with an unspecified number of arrests.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope,</b> the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression (1929–35) {{led to a}} fall in European copper prices which {{severely}} damaged {{the economy of the}} Copperbelt. In February 1931 the Mkubwa mine was shut down, followed {{over the next few months}} by the Chamishi, Nchanga and Mulfira mines. Construction work at the <b>Roan</b> <b>Antelope</b> and Nkana mines was nearing completion at this time, leading to large-scale unemployment; the mines employed 31,941 people during in 1930, and 6,677 by the end of 1932. Many unemployed African workers remained, instead of returning to their rural homes. During the period between 1931 and 1932, the European population in the region reduced by 25 per cent. In 1935, the Northern Rhodesian administration doubled urban taxes and reduced them in rural areas to counter the depression and related losses incurred by the closure of one of the region's four mines. The provincial commissioner implemented the tax in May (retroactive to 1 January) after the signing of the Native Tax Amendment Ordinance, and was aware of the latter.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} for its wildlife; mammals in the park include Crawshay's zebras, bushbucks, reedbucks, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> elands, klipspringers, duikers, and warthogs. Also present are {{carnivores}} including jackals, hyenas and leopards. There are also many birds and endemic butterflies, chameleons, frogs and toads (e.g., Nyika dwarf toad), and also for its orchids. All of the plateau is protected, by Malawi's large Nyika National Park and the much smaller Nyika National Park, Zambia. The only settlement on the plateau is Chelinda, the headquarters and accommodation site for the Malawian park.|$|R
5000|$|Ruma National Park is {{the only}} {{terrestrial}} park in Kenya's Nyanza Province. Dubbed the [...] "Last Retreat of the Roan Antelope", the park protects the only indigenous population of rare <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes</b> within Kenya. At present, the population {{is on the verge}} of extinction with individual populations numbering approximately 40. The park was established in 1966 as Lambwe Valley Game Reserve. It was later renamed “Ruma” after one of Kenya’s most powerful wizard, the much feared Gor Mahia who lived around the park (affiliated to Gor Mahia F.C.). The park is located in the vast Lambwe Valley.|$|R
25|$|Katavi National Park, {{having an}} area of , is Tanzania’s third largest {{national}} park in the remote southwest of the country. Its geographic setting is in a truncated arm of the East African Rift that terminates in Lake Rukwa. It {{is an integral part}} of the riverine and palustrine wetland ecosystem. The Katuma River and associated floodplains, marshy lakes, and brachystegia woodland are part of its habitat. Eland, sable and <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes</b> are found in substantial numbers, and its marshy lakes have Tanzania's densest population of hippopotamus and Nile crocodile. Elephant, lion, spotted hyena, African buffalo, giraffe, zebra, impala, and reedbuck are a common sight during the dry season.|$|R
5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and impala are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, impala, wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident impala. In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and impala. In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, impala, giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E
25|$|Other paddocks on {{the west}} side of the zoo support grazing herds of Grévy's zebras, sitatunga, Kirk's dik-diks, eastern bongo, and <b>roan</b> <b>antelope.</b>|$|E
25|$|Antelopes can be found, {{including}} Grant's gazelles, impalas, duikers and Coke's hartebeests. The plains {{are also}} home to the distinctive Masai giraffe. The large <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> and the nocturnal bat-eared fox, rarely present elsewhere in Kenya, can be seen within the reserve borders.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} consists {{mainly of}} Miombo woodland with grassy river channels, {{known locally as}} Dambos. A number of rivers flow through the park, notably the Dwanga and the Lingadzi and its tributary, the Lifupa, which creates an important spot for hippo surveyal in the park at the Lifupa Lodge. Kasungu {{is known for its}} population of elephants although is threatened by poaching. Other animals native to the park include Sable <b>antelopes,</b> <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> kudus, impala and hartebeest and plains zebra and Cape buffaloes. Predators in Kasungu National Park include, hyenas, Cape wild dogs and servals. The South African cheetah was thought to be extinct in the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The fauna is diverse. The grasses, {{shrubs and}} trees sustain many large mammals {{including}} black rhinos, buffalo, elephants, and antelopes such as elands, sable <b>antelopes,</b> <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> Lichtenstein's hartebeests, and the swamp-dwelling antelopes. Large carnivores include lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and side-striped jackal (Canis adustus). There are also many primates in the woodlands, {{particularly in the}} Congo and Uganda, including yellow baboons and chimpanzees. Indeed, the famous Gombe Stream National Park chimpanzee reserve is in this ecoregion. The only endemic mammals are Monard's dormouse (Graphiurus monardi), another mouse, Rosevear's lemniscomys (Lemniscomys roseveari), Ansell's shrew (Crocidura ansellorum) and the Upemba shrew (Crocidura zimmeri).|$|R
5000|$|The park lacks management, facilities, and roads. There is no {{accommodation}} and no towns nearby, visitors must {{be completely}} self-sufficient. (The Zambia Tourism website {{does not even}} mention the park.) It is reached by a dirt track from the main road to the park gate and base at Jivundu in its south-west. The lack of water and thickness of the forest has kept the human population low in the region, and despite some poaching {{and the absence of}} protection, the forest is believed to be still fairly rich in wildlife. Smaller forest mammals such as duiker and bushpigs live there, and recent reports also mention puku, hippopotami, Nile crocodiles, vervet monkeys, and yellow baboons. The game guards say there are buffalo, <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> sable antelopes, Lichtenstein's hartebeests, impalas, elands, and elephants.|$|R
25|$|The zoo {{has been}} {{involved}} in reintroducing wild horse, golden lion tamarin, <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> and scimitar oryx to the wild. The oryx was extinct in the wild, but more than 200 calves have been born and reared at the zoo since 1972 and many of these have been released back to the Sahara with animals from Whipsnade Zoo and Edinburgh Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Elephant are faring {{increasingly}} {{well and}} several breeding herds and bachelor bulls traverse {{the park and}} the surrounding game management area. Several of the plains like Chikufwe are home to common reedbuck, buffalo, sable antelope and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, which are often encountered in the dry season. A small population of plains zebra occurs in the park. <b>Roan</b> <b>antelope,</b> defassa waterbuck and Sharpe's grysbok occur but are rare and seldom seen, whereas warthog numbers are increasing and they are commonly sighted.

500|$|The bluebuck (Afrikaans: bloubok [...] ) or blue {{antelope}} (Hippotragus leucophaeus) is an {{extinct species}} of antelope {{that lived in}} South Africa until around 1800. It is congeneric with the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> and sable antelope (belonging in the genus Hippotragus), but was smaller than either. It was sometimes considered a subspecies of the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope,</b> but a genetic study has confirmed it as a distinct species.|$|E
500|$|In 1974 the American {{biologist}} Richard G. Klein showed (based on fossils) {{that the}} bluebuck and <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> occurred sympatrically on {{the coastal plain}} of the southwestern Cape from Oakhurst to Uniondale during the early Holocene, supporting their status as separate species. In 1996 an analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bluebuck specimen in Vienna showed that it is outside the clade containing the roan and sable antelopes. The study therefore concluded that the bluebuck is a distinct species, and not merely a subspecies of the <b>roan</b> <b>antelope</b> as was supposed.

50|$|Among the mammals, {{the bulk}} of the prey for adults are antelopes. In particular, the genus Kobus is often amongst the most {{vulnerable}} because it forages primarily in wetland areas and seeks to evade more prolific mammalian predators (such as hyenas, lions, etc.) by traveling along waterways. In some cases in Kruger National Park, antelope have been driven into water while being pursued by packs of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), who hunt by endurance engaging prey in a grueling chase until it is exhausted (a very successful hunting style), only to be killed by opportunistic crocodiles. While not as extensively aquatic as the Kobus genus, the reedbucks and the impala (Aepyceros melampus) have both shown a partiality for grasslands adjoining wetlands and riparian zones and so are also very commonly recorded prey items. In Kruger National Park, over the course of 22 years of discontinuous observation, 60% of the large game kills observed as perpetrated by crocodiles consisted of impala, while more than 15% of observed kills were made up of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), the largest of the Kobus genus at more than 200 kg in weight. Elsewhere, the waterbuck appears to be the most significant mammalian prey for large adult crocodiles, such as in Uganda and Zambia (although due to more sporadic general ungulate populations in those countries, ungulates are less common as prey than in some other countries) as well as in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. Other antelopes recorded as prey including gazelles, bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), eland (Taurotragus oryx), gemsbok (Oryx gazella), sable (Hippotragus niger) and <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes</b> (Hippotragus equinus), up to a half dozen types of duiker, topi (Damaliscus lunatus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus) and both species of wildebeest (Connochaetes sp.).|$|R
50|$|The {{adult male}} bluebuck in Leiden is 119 cm tall at the withers, and is {{possibly}} the largest known specimen. According to Sclater and Thomas, the tallest specimen {{is the one}} in Paris, a male that stands 45 in at the shoulder; the specimen in Vienna, on the other hand, is the shortest, a 40 in tall female.

40|$|Unlike {{the usual}} game {{reserves}} and national parks, Namibian conservancies allow residents to continue economic {{activities such as}} livestock and cattle farming and {{they are allowed to}} add wildlife use and tourism to their daily pursuits. Kathryn Fuller, president of the United States section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), presented President Nujoma a 'Gift to the Earth' certificate for Namibia's conservancies scheme. Previous awards have essentially related to the protection of ecosystems and animals and efforts to combat global warming. Namibia is the first country to receive the award for a programme which has people at its heart. Namibia's Conservancy Programme opens the way for communal area farmers to manage, protect and benefit from wildlife and other natural resources. President Nujoma recently presented four new communally-run conservancies with certificates of registration. These areas together cover around 1. 7 million hectares. The Nyae-Nyae, Salambala, Torra and Khoadi Hoas conservancies are home to many elephants, buffaloes, rhinos, and sable and <b>roan</b> <b>antelopes</b> as well as 15, 000 local people. Another 16 conservancies are in development. According to environment Minister Philemon Malima, over the past year more than N$ 1 million (approximately euros 180, 000) has flowed directly to community members in the conservancies. In addition, the scheme allows for local communities to decide for themselves in which ways money raised by activities such as game hunting and ecotourism is to be used.
