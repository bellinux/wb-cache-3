30|$|One of the {{fundamental}} questions {{that must be addressed}} in the effective design and operation of pipeline lubrication of heavy oil is; “how much time will be needed to restart a blocked core annular flow (CAF) line after shutdown due to fouling or pump failures”, if the pipe is to be cleaned using water only. In this work, laboratory results of shutdown and restart experiments of high-viscous oil conducted in a 5.5 -m-long PVC horizontal pipe with internal diameter of 26  mm are first presented. A new correlation for the prediction of the <b>restart</b> <b>time</b> of a shutdown core annular flow line is then formulated. The predictive capabilities of the correlation are checked against measured <b>restart</b> <b>time</b> and pressure drop evolution data. Somewhat high but still reasonable predictions are obtained. The <b>restart</b> <b>time</b> correlation, together with the associated correlations formulated as well, can be of practical importance during the engineering design of high-viscous oil pipeline transportation facility for predicting restart process.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFailure free {{execution}} {{will become}} {{rare in the}} future exascale computers. Thus, fault tolerance is now an active field of research. In this paper, we study the impact of decomposing an application in much more parallelism that the physical parallelism on the rollback step of fault tolerant coordinated protocols. This over-decomposition gives the runtime a better opportunity to balance workload after failure without the need of spare nodes, while preserving performance. We show that the overhead on normal execution remains low for relevant factor of over-decomposition. With over-decomposition, restart execution on the remaining nodes after failures shows very good performance compared to classic decomposition approach: our experiments show that the execution time after restart can be reduced by 42 %. We also consider a partial restart protocol {{to reduce the amount}} of lost work in case of failure by tracking the task dependencies inside processes. In some cases and thanks to over-decomposition, this partial <b>restart</b> <b>time</b> can represent only 54 % of the global <b>restart</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E

40|$|Randomized {{algorithms}} sometimes {{employ a}} restart strategy. After {{a certain number}} of steps, the current computation is aborted and restarted with a new, independent random seed. In some cases, this results in an improved overall expected runtime. This work introduces properties of the underlying runtime distribution which determine whether restarts are advantageous. The most commonly used probability distributions admit the use of a scale and a location parameter. Location parameters shift the density function to the right, while scale parameters affect the spread of the distribution. It is shown that for all distributions scale parameters do not influence the usefulness of restarts and that location parameters only have a limited influence. This result simplifies the analysis of the usefulness of restarts. The most important runtime probability distributions are the log-normal, the Weibull, and the Pareto distribution. In this work, these distributions are analyzed for the usefulness of restarts. Secondly, a condition for the optimal <b>restart</b> <b>time</b> (if it exists) is provided. The log-normal, the Weibull, and the generalized Pareto distribution are analyzed in this respect. Moreover, it is shown that the optimal <b>restart</b> <b>time</b> is also not influenced by scale parameters and that the influence of location parameters is only linear...|$|E
