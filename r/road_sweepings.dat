60|$|It is {{not easy}} to escape from a big city. An entire {{continent}} was waiting to be traversed, and, for that reason, we lingered in New York till the city felt so homelike that it seemed wrong to leave it. And further, the more one studied it, the more grotesquely bad it grew--bad in its paving, bad in its streets, bad in its street-police, and but for the kindness of the tides would be worse than bad in its sanitary arrangements. No one as yet has approached the management of New York in a proper spirit; that is to say, regarding it as the shiftless outcome of squalid barbarism and reckless extravagance. No one is likely to do so, because reflections on the long, narrow pig-trough are construed as malevolent attacks against the spirit and majesty of the great American people, and lead to angry comparisons. Yet, if all the streets of London were permanently up and all the lamps permanently down, this would not prevent the New York streets taken in a lump from being first cousins to a Zanzibar foreshore, or kin to the approaches of a Zulu kraal. Gullies, holes, ruts, cobbles-stones awry, kerbstones rising from two to six inches above the level of the slatternly pavement; tram-lines from two to three inches above street level; building materials scattered half across the street; lime, boards, cut stone, and ash-barrels generally and generously everywhere; wheeled traffic taking its chances, dray versus brougham, at cross roads; sway-backed poles whittled and unpainted; drunken lamp-posts with twisted irons; and, lastly, a generous scatter of filth and more mixed stinks than the winter wind can carry away, are matters which can be considered quite apart from the 'Spirit of Democracy' or 'the future of this great and growing country.' In any other land, they would be held to represent slovenliness, sordidness, and want of capacity. Here it is explained, not once but many times, that they show the speed at which the city has grown and the enviable indifference of her citizens to matters of detail. One of these days, you are told, everything will be taken in hand and put straight. The unvirtuous rulers of the city will be swept away by a cyclone, or a tornado, or something big and booming, of popular indignation; everybody will unanimously elect the right men, who will justly earn the enormous salaries that are at present being paid to inadequate aliens for <b>road</b> <b>sweepings,</b> and all will be well. At the same time the lawlessness ingrained by governors among the governed during the last thirty, forty, or it may be fifty years; the brutal levity of the public conscience in regard to public duty; the toughening and suppling of public morals, and the reckless disregard for human life, bred by impotent laws and fostered by familiarity with needless accidents and criminal neglect, will miraculously disappear. If the laws of cause and effect that control even the freest people in the world say otherwise, so much the worse for the laws. America makes her own. Behind her stands the ghost of the most bloody war of the century caused in a peaceful land by long temporising with lawlessness, by letting things slide, by shiftlessness and blind disregard for all save the material need of the hour, till the hour long conceived and let alone stood up full-armed, and men said, 'Here is an unforeseen crisis,' and killed each other in the name of God for four years.|$|E

40|$|Biogas {{production}} from leaf litter (<b>road</b> <b>sweepings</b> of MSW) is difficult under normal conditions requiring longer retention time {{due to the}} complex chemistry involving interlinking structures of lignin and cellulose where in lignin is considered recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions while also limiting access to the cellulose and hemicelluloses. Pre-treatment of biomass with single enzymes system is expensive and uneconomic and an alternative option has been tried. P. florida ``ready-to-fruit'' bags were sprinkled with biogas digester liquid (BDL) from a plug-flow reactor (PFR) type biogas plant fed with leaf litter. Spraying BDL not only increased the mushroom yields from 1. 6 to 2. 3 kg/kg substrate but also gave around similar to 85 ml of leachate rich in lignocellulolytic enzymes. Analysis of this enzyme cocktail at various stages of mushroom growth showed that on the 8 d a combination of lignocellulolytic enzymes rich in peroxidase (46. 67 U/gTS) and laccase (204. 38 U/gTS) and low in cellulase (8. 87 U/gTS) could be obtained {{which can be used}} for various industrial applications such as softening of biomass for higher biogas production and/or bioethanol production. In this study the enzyme cocktail was used for softening paddy straw, a typical lingo-cellulosic biomass, for increasing biogas yields. This type of an enzyme treatment for paddy straw increased biogas yields by 29 % and also enhanced sustainability by recycling end product of one process (mushroom cultivation) in softening biomass for higher biogas production and thereby overall system efficiency.

40|$|From {{research}} on PM 2. 5 and PM 10 in 2007 / 2008 in the Netherlands, {{it was concluded}} that the coarse fraction (PM 2. 5 - 10) attributed 60 % and 50 % respectively, to the urban-regional and street-urban increments of PM 10. Contrary to Scandinavian and Mediterranean countries which exhibit significant seasonal variation in the coarse fraction of particulate matter (PM), in the Netherlands the coarse fraction in PM at a street location is rather constant during the year. Non-exhaust emissions by road traffic are identified as the main source for coarse PM in urban areas. Non-exhaust emissions mainly originate from re-suspension of accumulated deposited PM and road wear related particles, while primary tire and brake wear hardly contribute to the mass of non-exhaust emissions. However, tire and brake wear can clearly be identified in the total mass through the presence of the heavy metals: zinc, a tracer for tire wear and copper, a tracer for brake wear. The efficiency of <b>road</b> <b>sweeping</b> and washing to reduce non-exhaust emissions in a street-canyon in Amsterdam was investigated. The increments of the coarse fraction at a kerbside location and a housing façade location versus the urban background were measured at days with and without sweeping and washing. It was concluded that this measure did not significantly reduce non-exhaust emissions. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to {{develop an understanding of}} the brushing process for a road sweeper so that a theoretical model of the process can be developed. The brush model has been confined to the kerb operating channel brush that usually sweeps about 80 % of the debris on the road in the region of the kerb. The other 20 % is swept by a roller brush beneath the vehicle. This has not been included in the study. A concept for a semi-autonomous <b>road</b> <b>sweeping</b> vehicle has also been proposed in order to sweep debris efficiently with minimum fatigue for the vehicle driver, although the debris sensing and control system have not been developed in this thesis. The metal tines of <b>road</b> <b>sweeping</b> brushes are usually rectangular in section (unlike cleaning brushes which are circular in section), giving rise to two commercial brush types. These are the flicking brush (major axis in the radial direction) and cutting brush (major axis in the tangential direction). A theoretical steady-state model of these two brushes has been developed which allows the calculation of brush axial loads, torques and tine deflection geometry as the brush rotates. The theoretical model has been validated experimentally within acceptable limits although this does require an experimental choice of the co-efficient of friction between the tines and the ground, usually between 0. 6 and 0. 7 for commercial brushes sweeping on concrete and tarmacadam surfaces. A dominant feature of the brush characteristics is the tine wear, as the brush stiffness increases over 120 % as the tine shortens by 40 %, which is the recommended minimum length taking into account brushing efficiency and damage to the road surface. The model can also be used as a tool to design new brushes so that, for example, by rotating the tine by 30 to 40 ° from the cutting brush configuration a 20 % improvement in mechanical efficiency is predicted. In order to assess the mechanism of debris removal from the road and its subsequent collection by the vacuum unit, the brush model has been incorporated into a brush sweep-gear linkage used by commercial vehicles to track the edge of the kerb. It has been shown that a constant brush contact arc on the road can be maintained by adjusting the brush angle of attack and brush height and that this relationship is independent of the vehicle speed and brush linkage with respect to the kerb. Under these contact conditions efficient sweeping may be expected. In the case of the Johnston 600 sweeping vehicle the brush contact arc angle is 150 °. This parameter is used as the output criterion for automatic control schemes that have been proposed to improve brushing efficiency and reduce driver fatigue. These will require the development of an on-line brush height sensor that can also measure brush wear...|$|R

40|$|Resuspended road dust has, {{during the}} last years, {{proved to be a}} contributive cause to high {{concentrations}} of inhalable particles (PM 10) in ambient air. The connection of PM 10 to negative health effects has lead to an environmental quality standard which will be in force from 1 st of January 2005. This calls for local and road authorities to investigate if the standard is reached and if so, what measures have to be taken to reduce concentrations. This study aims at investigating what methods and strategies are in use in Swedish municipalities, their awareness concerning the dust mitigating effectivity of measures taken and to investigate the knowledge on <b>road</b> dust and <b>sweeping</b> in our neighbouring countries. The method was a questionnaire to 103 municipalities and 7 regional road authorities as well as literature and contacts with various road authorities in Norway, Denmark, Finland and California. The results show that dusting from road are considered a large problem among road authorities and that the problems are worst during spring. The main cause to sweeping is comfort and sanitary concerns followed by safety and health concerns. Wet sweeping is the most common method and today no methods are in use especially intended for reducing PM 10 concentrations. Only 10 % of the respondents plan to improve methods or strategies. In Helsinki the road dust problem is mainly blamed on winter sanding and has been addressed since the late 80 s. An ambitious sweeping method consisting of four co-operating units is used. In Oslo, road dust is blamed on studded tyres and the efforts have been focused on reducing studded tyre frequency. Sweeping methods has been evaluated and the results have been implemented in <b>road</b> and street <b>sweeping.</b> Neither in Helsinki nor in Oslo have the sweeping methods and strategies yet proved to reduce PM 10 concentrations. In California the "Rule 1186 ", demanding sweepers to be PM 10 efficient, has resulted in some development, e. g. regenerative air sweepers and vacuum assisted dry sweepers. All in all this report shows that the knowledge about the contribution of road dust to PM,o and assumed possibilities for more efficient sweeping to reach the environmental standard is low among local and road authorities. In combination with the lack of PM 10 data for Swedish municipalities and the near compliance with the environmental quality standard, this is a potentially large problem...|$|R

He was said also to have the gift of prophecy, which was accounted for in the following peculiar manner, referring entirely to the elfin superstition:--As True Thomas (we give him the epithet by anticipation) lay on Huntly Bank, a place on the descent of the Eildon Hills, which raise their triple crest above the celebrated Monastery of Melrose, he saw a lady so extremely beautiful that he imagined it must be the Virgin Mary herself. Her appointments, however, were rather those of an Amazon or goddess of the woods. Her steed was of the highest beauty and spirit, and at his mane hung thirty silver bells and nine, which made music to the wind as she paced along. Her saddle was of royal bone (ivory), laid over with orfeverie--i.e., goldsmith's work. Her stirrups, her dress, all corresponded with her extreme beauty and the magnificence of her array. The fair huntress had her bow in her hand, and her arrows at her belt. She led three greyhounds in a leash, and three raches, or hounds of scent, followed her closely. She rejected and disclaimed the homage which Thomas desired to pay to her; so that, passing from one extremity to the other, Thomas became as bold as he had at first been humble. The lady warns him that he must become her slave if he should prosecute his suit towards her in the manner he proposes. Before their interview terminates, the appearance of the beautiful lady is changed into that of the most hideous hag in existence. One side is blighted and wasted, as if by palsy; one eye drops from her head; her colour, as clear as the virgin silver, is now of a dun leaden hue. A witch from the spital or almshouse would have been a goddess in comparison to the late beautiful huntress. Hideous as she was, Thomas's irregular desires had placed him under the control of this hag, and when she bade him take leave of sun, and of the leaf that grew on tree, he felt himself under the necessity of obeying her. A cavern received them, in which, following his frightful guide, he for three days travelled in darkness, sometimes hearing the booming of a distant ocean, sometimes walking through rivers of blood, which crossed their subterranean path. At length they emerged into daylight, in a most beautiful orchard. Thomas, almost fainting for want of food, stretches out his hand towards the goodly fruit which hangs around him, but is forbidden by his conductress, who informs him these are the fatal apples which were the cause of the fall of man. He perceives also that his guide had no sooner entered this mysterious ground, and breathed its magic air, than she was revived in beauty, equipage, and splendour, as fair, or fairer, than he had first seen her on the mountain. She then commands him to lay his head upon her knee, and proceeds to explain to him the character of the country. [...] "Yonder right-hand path," [...] she says, [...] "conveys the spirits of the blessed to Paradise; yon downward and well-worn way leads sinful souls to the place of everlasting punishment; the third road, by yonder dark brake, conducts to the milder place of pain from which prayer and mass may release offenders. But see you yet a fourth <b>road,</b> <b>sweeping</b> along the plain to yonder splendid castle? Yonder is the road to Elfland, to which we are now bound. The lord of the castle is king of the country, and I am his queen. But, Thomas, I would rather be drawn with wild horses, than he should know what hath passed between you and me. Therefore, when we enter yonder castle, observe strict silence, and answer no question that is asked at you, and I will account for your silence by saying I took your speech when I brought you from middle earth." ...|$|R

It involved an overall modernisation of the centre, renovated Coles and Safeway supermarkets plus a Fresh Food market (Colonial Fresh Markets), new Big-W and Target (replacing K-Mart), refurbished Myer, new David Jones, a Borders store, many new mini majors such as JB Hi-Fi, Dick Smith Electronics, a larger 9 screen Village Cinemas, dubbed [...] "Our World's Best Cinema" [...] by Village, a black label Fitness First Gym which replaced the old Donacster library, now located in Precinct One, a new food court known as the Drum located {{on the corner of}} Williamsons and Doncaster <b>Roads</b> which has <b>sweeping</b> views of Melbourne, new restaurants on the rooftop level, a new bus interchange and over 1500 extra parking spaces, mostly undercover, in a new 6 level parking lot with an LED system indicating free spaces. This unfortunately for Doncaster residents showed the start of paid parking, but at a very low price (first 3 hours free). The number of stores was doubled to 400, which makes it the 5th biggest shopping centre in Australia and 3rd biggest in Victoria in terms of stores. It also made the centre the 10th biggest shopping centre in Australia and 4th biggest in Victoria according to gross lettable area. It was finished on 16 October 2008.|$|R
