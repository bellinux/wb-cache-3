The increase of the doping level x causes the melting of the G-type (and C-type) orbital order, prior to or concomitantly with the MIT, due partly to the doped-hole motion and partly to the <b>ramdom</b> potential arising from the quenched disorder.

The coefficients of dispersion (s^ 2 /x^￣ [...] . x^￣ : mean number of larveae in a rice stock, s^ 2 : variance of it) change ramarkably with the growth of larvae elapsed. For example, they were 37. 983 at the infant larvae period, 10. 885 at the young larvae period and 2. 666 at the ful lgrown larvae period (Table 3). By these facts, following conclusion can be deduced that the distribution of this larveae is not <b>ramdom</b> on each growth period. Mean value of the number of larvae observed in a rice plant increases in proportion with the increase of the number of stalks in each rice plant (Fig 3 and 4). Namely, each plant in the field shows differential attractiveness to the larvae. It is considered that the cause of such difference among the plants is due to the complex, both the tendency of the insect itself and the heterogeneity of the environ-mental conditions. ...|$|E

Therefore, {{the research}} on the burden and the impact of bad habits is needed, not only the information of prevalence, badness, and medical treatment, but also the impact toward life quality. Aim : This research is aimed to discover the impact of bad habits towardoral health related quality of life preschool students of Aisyiyah kindergarten Gonilan Kartasura. Method : The design of this research is cross sectional that measure risk factor and impact factor at the same time. Non <b>Ramdom</b> sampling was conducted with Quota Sampling method. To identify the bad habits, structured interview was conducted with clinical checkand life quality measurement using Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS). The parents were invited to schoolto fulfill the questionnaire. From the 120 students, there were 62 students have bad habits, 37 have one bad habits, and 25 students have more than one bad habits. The data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney method to know its influence by comparing the result of life quality among the students who have one bad habit and who have more than one bad habits. Result : The result of Mann-Whitney test shows that there are differences score of life quality among the children’s group who have one Bad Habit with the children who have more bad habits. Statistically it has a significant result. The result is p= 0, 000. Conclusion : This research concludes that bad habits influence to the life quality, where the life quality of group who has one bad habit is better than the other group who has more than one bad habi...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess the effect of recent admixture on the evaluation of DNA evidence. We develop an admixture model based on the distribution of individual admixture proportion in the population and allow us to relax the assumption of <b>ramdom</b> mating. Genetic disequilibrium depends on the variance and other higher moments of the distribution of individual admixture proportion. Although between locus disequilibrium is reduced by a half after each random mating, change in the mating pattern can lead to increase in the disequilibrium. Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to estimate important parameters such as population admixture proportions and allele frequencies in the parental populations. This is important especially for analysis of the New Zealand Maori population since allele frequencies for the ancestral population cannot be estimated directly. Simulation showed that the estimation algorithm is robust to the specification of the prior distributions. The gentoype frequency can be evaluated conditional on the individual's family history and the posterior density of observing the genotype at the crime scene can be estimated using importance sampling. This posterior predictive probability is equivalent to the match probability commonly used in forensic casework. We compare the match probability estimated under the admixture model and that under the substructure model using simulation and data from the New Zealand DNA database. Equivalent coancestry coefficient the value of θ which can be used in the substructure match probability to obtain a similar estimate compare to the admixture model, can be estimated. We show that the distribution of equivalent coancestry coefficient can be used to determine a value of θ which can be used to provide conservative estimate of the match probability under both population strucutres...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacteria}} on {{the surface}} of a farmhouse smear-ripened cheese at four stages of ripening (4, 16, 23, and 37 days) from inoculated (i. e., deliberately inoculated with Brevibacterium linens BL 2) and noninoculated (not deliberately inoculated with B. linens BL 2) cheese were investigated. The results show that, contrary to accepted belief, B. linens is not a significant member of the surface flora of smear cheese and no microbial succession of species occurred during the ripening of the cheeses. Of 400 isolates made, 390 were lactate-utilizing coryneforms and 10 were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. A detailed analysis of the coryneforms was undertaken using phenotypic analysis, molecular fingerprinting, chemotaxonomic techniques, and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. DNA banding profiles (<b>ramdom</b> amplified polymorphic DNA [RAPD]-PCR) of all the coryneform isolates showed large numbers of clusters. However, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of the isolates from the cheeses showed that all isolates within a cluster and in many contiguous clusters were the same. The inoculated and noninoculated cheeses were dominated by single clones of novel species of Corynebacterium casei (50. 2 % of isolates), Corynebacterium mooreparkense (26 % of isolates), and Microbacterium gubbeenense (12. 8 % of isolates). In addition, five of the isolates from the inoculated cheese were Corynebacterium flavescens. Thirty-seven strains were not identified but many had similar PFGE patterns, indicating that they were the same species. C. mooreparkense and C. casei grew at pH values below 4. 9 in the presence of 8 % NaCl, while M. gubbeenense did not grow below pH 5. 8 in the presence of 5 to 10 % NaCl. B. linens BL 2 was not recovered from the inoculated cheese because it was inhibited by all the Staphylococcus isolates and many of the coryneforms. It was concluded that within a particular batch of cheese there was significant bacterial diversity in the microflora {{on the surface}}...|$|E
