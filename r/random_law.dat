40|$|Abstract. Pursuit-evasion games, such as {{the game}} of Cops and Robbers, are a {{simplified}} model for network security. In these games, cops try to capture a robber loose on the vertices of the network. The minimum number of cops required to win on a graph G is the cop number of G. We present asymptotic results for the game of Cops and Robbers played in various stochastic network models, such as in G(n, p) with non-constant p, and in <b>random</b> power <b>law</b> graphs.

30|$|In the {{following}} sections, and in queuing theory in general, the Poisson-exponential distribution {{plays a key}} role. There are {{arguments in favor of}} it which try to show {{that it is not a}} restrictive assumption. One strong argument in favor of exponential inputs is that the limit of a binomial distribution with small probability of success (e.g. entering the system) and defined over a large set of elements or individuals (population) is Poisson. In the second place, one characteristic of a Poisson process is that the moments of time when events occur are uniformly distributed over time (see Ross 1989, p. 224; Law and Kelton 1991, p. 393). Thus, the Poisson-exponential distribution implies that any moment of time is equally likely to have an arrival. Third, there is an additional argument from information theory which says that the exponential distribution provides the least information and is, therefore, the most <b>random</b> <b>law</b> which can be used and, thus, provides a reasonably conservative approach. The Poisson-exponential distribution therefore represents the most random specification of the stochastic nature of demand and service processes. Relaxing this assumption leads to more deterministic processes (Daniel 1995).|$|E

Plenty of {{studies have been conducted}} on compact routing, and quite a few universal compact routing schemes have been designed for arbitrary network topologies. However, it is generally believed that specialized compact routing schemes for peculiar network topologies can have better performance than universal ones. Complex network research has uncovered that most real-world networks have degree distributions exhibiting power law tails, i. e., a few nodes have very high degrees while many other nodes have low degrees. High-degree nodes play a crucial role of hubs in communication and networking. Based on this fact, we put forward two highest-degree landmark based compact routing schemes, namely HDLR and HDLR[*]+[*].
