40|$|The {{short term}} {{frequency}} stability of masers {{equipped with an}} external feedback loop to increase the cavity quality factor was studied. The frequency stability of a hydrogen and a <b>rubidium</b> <b>maser</b> were measured and compared with theoretical evaluation. It is shown that the frequency stability passes through an optimum when the cavity Q is varied. Long term fluctuations are discussed and the optimum mid term frequency stability achievably by small size active and passive H-masers is considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a quartz bulb-quartz cavity type <b>rubidium</b> <b>maser</b> is described, and the results obtained with two of these masers are presented. The tuning characteristics, medium term stability, and short term stability are reported. It is concluded that {{the stability of the}} masers in the short term region is superior to any of the oscillators presently existing. On this basis it is believed that future development of the masers to reduce their size and improve their medium term stability is well justified...|$|E
40|$|Bonding of {{an element}} {{comprising}} sapphire, ruby or blue sapphire to another element of such material with a eutectic mixture of aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide is discussed. The bonding mixture may {{be applied in}} the form of a distilled water slurry or by electron beam vapor deposition. In one embodiment the eutectic is formed in situ by applying a layer of zirconium oxide and then heating the assembly to a temperature above the eutectic temperature and below the melting point of the material from which the elements are formed. The formation of a sapphire <b>rubidium</b> <b>maser</b> cell utilizing eutectic bonding is shown...|$|E

The system was used in connection with relaxation experiments on hydrogen and <b>rubidium</b> <b>masers</b> and was found to operate well. The use of a computing counter in the systems gives the possibility of making averages on several experiments and obtaining the standard deviation of {{the results from the}} mean.

40|$|The design, development, and {{characteristics}} of a <b>rubidium</b> 87 <b>maser</b> are discussed. The design of a receiver capable of locking a crystal oscillator to the maser signal is reported.

50|$|Products {{included}} hydrogen <b>masers,</b> <b>rubidium</b> and cesium atomic standards, {{temperature and}} oven controlled crystal oscillators, miniature and chip scale atomic clocks, network time servers, network sync management systems, cable timekeeping solutions, telecom synchronization supply units (SSUs), and timing test sets.|$|R
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} {{frequency}} measuring systems are described: frequency comparison, phase comparison, and time comparison. With {{the help of}} the portable cesium clock in determining the time delay between two stations, a time synchronization, experiment was conducted using the Symphonie satellite. A result with an accuracy of 30 ns and an uncertainty of about 10 ns was obtained. Another experiment, applying the television pulse technique for time synchronization, yielded a result with an error of about 0. 5 mu s in 24 hours. In order to measure the short term frequency stability of crystal oscillators or other frequency sources, a <b>rubidium</b> <b>maser</b> atomic frequency standard was developed as well as a short term stability measuring system...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Rubidium</b> <b>Maser</b> Frequency Standard is a {{precision}} frequency source with excellent short-term stability. A type PBR-II Rb maser frequency standard {{was developed by}} the Beijing Institute of Radio Metrology and Measurement (BIRMM). The time-domain frequency stability (two-sample variance) of this frequency standard is less than 1 / 5 times 10 to the 13 th power for t= 10 ms yields 1. 0 s, fh= 1. 0 KHz. Two PBR-II frequency standards were used as reference frequency sources in a frequency stability measurement system. Some important system characteristics for the PBR-II Rb maser frequency standard such as phase noise and frequency stability transfer characteristics are discussed. Furthermore, the design of the frequency standard for optimum frequency stability of the output signal; the choice of a voltage controlled crystal oscillator for the frequency standard; the design of the phase-locked loop; and the frequency stability test results on the PBR-II are discussed...|$|E
40|$|G 1 K 7 P 4, Canada We {{report the}} {{operation}} of a 87 Rb maser in the self-oscillating mode, using a laser diode as the optical pumping source. The maser uses a TE 021 cavity surrounding a cell containing the atoms and 11 Torr of N 2 as the buffer gas.

50|$|A radio clock {{receiver}} may combine multiple time {{sources to}} improve its accuracy. This is what is done in satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System. GPS, Galileo and GLONASS satellite navigation systems have one or more caesium, <b>rubidium</b> or hydrogen <b>maser</b> atomic clocks on each satellite, referenced to a clock or clocks on the ground. Dedicated timing receivers can serve as local time standards, with a precision better than 50 ns. The recent revival and enhancement of LORAN, a land-based radio navigation system, will provide another multiple source time distribution system.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{operation}} of a ^ 87 Rb maser in the self-oscillating mode, using a laser diode as the optical pumping source. The maser uses a TE_ 021 cavity surrounding a cell containing the atoms and 11 Torr of N_ 2 as the buffer gas. The optical pumping is accomplished by using a commercial laser diode frequency-locked on the linear absorption line of an external <b>rubidium</b> cell. The <b>maser</b> output power is maximized when the laser spectrum is spread by modulating its frequency through the variation of its injection current. The maser output power is also presented for various modulation waveforms and frequencies. We find that the spurious sidebands induced by the modulation can be minimized. Finally, the linear dependence between the laser and maser frequencies is shown. We find that the relative maser frequency pulling from the laser is about 4. 6 Ã— 10 ^- 3...|$|R
40|$|This work {{attempts}} {{to convey a}} broad understanding of the physical principles underlying the workings of these quantum-based atomic clocks, with introductory chapters placing them in context with the early development of mechanical clocks {{and the introduction of}} electronic time-keeping as embodied in the quartz-controlled clocks. While the book makes no pretense at being a history of atomic clocks, it nevertheless takes a historical perspective in its treatment of the subject. Intended for nonspecialists with some knowledge of physics or engineering, The Quantum Beat covers a wide range of salient topics relevant to atomic clocks, treated in a broad intuitive manner with a minimum of mathematical formalism. Detailed descriptions are given of the design principles of the <b>rubidium,</b> cesium, hydrogen <b>maser,</b> and mercury ion standards; the revolutionary changes that the advent of the laser has made possible, such as laser cooling, optical pumping, the formation of "optical molasses," and the cesium "fountain" standard; and the time-based global navigation systems, Loran-C and the Global Positioning System. Also included are topics that bear on the precision and absolute accuracy of standards, such as noise, resonance line shape, the relativistic Doppler effect as well as more general relativistic notions of time relevant to synchronization of remote clocks, and time reversal symmetry. This edition retains the essentially didactic approach to the treatment of the development of atomic clocks in the first edition, but brings up to date the extraordinary developments in recent years, culminating in clocks based on quantum resonance at optical frequency in individual ions confined in miniature electromagnetic traps. These, together with advances in the generation of wide-band coherent frequency combs spanning the spectrum as far as the optical range, has made possible the direct measurement of phenomena occurring at optical frequencies! As a result of these recent advances, in addition to the time-based GPS and LORAN C navigation systems treated in the first edition, other important applications of a fundamental scientific interest have become feasible. These include satellite-borne tests of the theory of general relativity and the equivalence principle on which it is based. As with the first edition, the book is intended for students and non-specialists; hence the material is not rigidly formal, is mostly self-contained, and presented in a broad intuitive manner with a minimum of mathematical formalism...|$|R
