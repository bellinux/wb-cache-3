40|$|Bibliography: leaves 330 - 342. In 1985, {{the writer}} joined the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as an export trade advisor in the Western Cape Regional Office. The {{function}} of {{this position is}} to encourage companies to export and to assist companies <b>registered</b> as <b>exporters</b> with their export endeavours. In this capacity, the writer {{came into contact with}} more than 1, 000 companies covering a wide range of products, problems, attitudes and situations. It became apparent to the writer {{that a large number of}} these companies lacked a marketing orientation in their export activities. There also appeared to be a poor success rate among these exporters in that probably as many as half of the number of <b>registered</b> <b>exporters</b> never achieved any export sales and of the remaining exporters only a few obtained substantial, ongoing and profitable sales abroad. The writer believed that if these companies approached their export activities in a more marketing orientated fashion, their success rate would be significantly improved. This begged the question as to whether a relationship actually exists between export marketing orientation and export success. It is the abovementioned relationship that this study primarily addresses. It was decided to keep the scope of this study confined to manufacturing companies in the Western Cape <b>registered</b> as <b>exporters</b> with the DTI...|$|R

5000|$|In the European Union, debate {{regarding}} {{the export of}} e-waste {{has resulted in a}} significant amendment to the WEEE directive (January 2012) with a view to significantly diminishing the export of WEEE (untreated e-waste). During debate in Strasburg, MEPs stated that [...] "53 million tonnes of WEEE were generated in 2009 but only 18% collected for recycling" [...] with the remainder being exported or sent to landfill. The Amendment, voted through by a unanimous 95% of representatives, removed the re-use (repair and refurbishmet) aspect of the directive and placed more emphasis upon recycling and recovery of precious metals and base metals. The changes went further by placing the burden upon <b>registered</b> <b>exporters</b> to prove that used equipment leaving Europe was [...] "fit for purpose".|$|R
50|$|The {{waterfront}} is {{the wealthier}} part of Karşıyaka {{and it is}} here that residents of long date are generally concentrated. The neighbourhoods located along the slopes are poorer, with slum-type residences in parts, and these continue receiving flows of immigration, especially from Turkey's Eastern Anatolia Region. The district counts a total of 11,570 enterprises, 207 of which are identified as industrial firms, and 3,180 categorised under commerce. Nine industrial companies have full or partial foreign capital and 143 commercial establishments in Karşıyaka are <b>registered</b> <b>exporters.</b> There are eighteen banks providing services through 61 branches in Karşıyaka, and a handful of hotels with a total bed capacity of 180. There is one teacher for 24 students and one doctor for 1,127 patients overall. The literacy rate is very high at 92 per cent. An environment of urban consciousness also favoured the foundation of a high number of professional organisations in varied fields in Karşıyaka, ranging from trade (such as KASİAD, BESİAD, BOGİAD) to education, usually centred on teachers or alumni of the district's rooted institutions.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} nonparametric test {{in order to}} {{establish}} the level of accuracy of the foreign trade statistics of 17 Latin American countries when contrasted with the trade statistics of the main partners in 1925. The Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Ranks test is used to determine whether the differences between the data <b>registered</b> by <b>exporters</b> and importers are meaningful, and if so, whether the differences are systematic in any direction. The paper tests for the reliability of the data registered for two homogeneous products, petroleum and coal, both in volume and value. The conclusion of the several exercises performed is that we cannot accept the existence of statistically significant differences between the data provided by the <b>exporters</b> and the <b>registered</b> by the importing countries in most cases. The qualitative historiography of Latin American describes its foreign trade statistics as mostly unusable. Our quantitative results contest this view.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the programs delivered by the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) on export performance by Canadian firms. We draw on a unique set of microdata created by linking three separate firm-level databases: Statistics Canada’s <b>Exporter</b> <b>Register</b> and its Business Register, which provide information on export activity and firm characteristics, and the TCS client management database maintained by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, which contains details on trade promotion services provided to Canadian firms. We apply the treatment effects analytical framework to isolate the effects of public sector trade promotion. We find that TCS programs have a consistent and positive impact on Canadian exporter performance. Exporters that access TCS services export, on average, 17. 9 percent more than comparable exporters that do not. Furthermore, we also find that TCS assistance benefits exporters in terms of product and market diversification. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the stylized facts {{from the}} {{literature}} on international activities of heterogeneous firms is {{the existence of a}} positive exporter productivity premium - on average, exporting firms are more productive than firms that sell on the national market only. In this paper, the authors look at the productivity distribution of both exporting and non-exporting firms in German manufacturing industries. They recognize that it is potentially important to condition on firm fixed effects for estimation of this exporter premium. They apply a new unconditional quantile estimation technique for panel data to condition on firm fixed effects while estimating the exporter premium throughout the entire productivity distribution. They find that the premium is positive for all productivity levels, but highest at the lowest quantiles. These results support theoretical models which suggest that there is a division in productivity between <b>exporters</b> and non-exporters. <b>Mean</b> regression is incapable of detecting this dimension of firm heterogeneity. exporter productivity premium, quantile regression, fixed effects, unconditional quantile treatment effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{software}} industry is booming in Sri Lanka. Many software development companies are {{emerging in the}} market. However most of them failed to grow and become large-scale players in the industry. The software development companies do not properly value their businesses. These companies are facing issues in estimating the value of business to determine offering prices for mergers, joint ventures and alliances. Investors who {{want to invest in}} software business ventures look at traditional factors such as book value, past performance. There is a lack of knowledge on which factors needs to be evaluated before investing. There are many valuation methods practiced in the business world. However software development companies in Sri Lanka are facing a problem of lack of information to support for such calculations. Objectives of this research is to, identify what factors to be considered in determining the value of a software development business venture, identify significance of each factor in valuing value of the business and to develop a model which accurately measures the value of a software business venture. It was considered the size of revenue, revenue growth, profitability, novelty of technology used, level of process maturity, associated risk level and accessibility to markets, staff attrition rate and quality of engineering and professional service staff are the key factors affecting for business value of a software company. If these factors are favorable for the company, then the worth of company will increase. The research under this context will consider all the software development companies <b>registered</b> under Software <b>Exporters</b> Association of Sri Lanka and in operations for more than 3 years. It was found that revenue growth, size of the revenue and profitability are key factors affecting the business value of a software company...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} and analyze: how International trade relations are between Indonesia and the United States, especially in the export-import of goods, particularly non-oil exports; how the value is obtained from the export-import of goods between Indonesia-United States, whether Indonesian exports to the United States greater than Indonesian import from the United States; who gets the surplus of trade between the two countries; and how big the export-import growth rate is, whether Indonesia tends to become exporter or importer. Data {{used in this study}} were a time series of the year 2008 - 2012. The analytical method used was the growth formula and Trade Specialization Index. Based on the trade balance, the value of Indonesian exports, both oil and non-oil, the United States has a surplus and vice versa. In other words, the United States includes a country of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s main export, in addition to Japan and China.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{examines the}} effects of al-ternative price interventions by <b>exporters</b> on the <b>mean</b> level of prices and price instability. While several different price policies {{can be used by}} an exporter to protect producers of a commodity, each policy has unique ffects on mean prices and variability. Using free trade as a point of comparison, five policy options, ranging from fixed prices in the exporter to export subsidies, are compared. These compar-isons should be useful as multilateral trade negotiations proceed. Over the next several years, major trading nations will discuss one another's trade policies {{under the auspices of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In a recent paper, Tangermann discusses approaches to the upcoming negotiations that have the po-tential for liberalizing the functioning of world markets. One major recommendation is that the negotiations shift their focus from quantity measures of intervention to price measures. In the case of export subsidy negotiations, discussions would cease to focus on the con-cept of "equitable " market shares, but rather would focus on price intervention. Tanger-mann believes that such a change in emphasis would set the stage for meaningful discussions to liberalize trade rather than to manage trade. This paper compares {{the effects of}} various forms of price intervention by exporting coun-tries on the mean level of price and on price variability. At issue is a comparison of various forms of price intervention should the GATT negotiations move in the direction suggested by Tangermann. Previous research as focused on the impacts of policies by importing nations while this paper examines policies by exporting countries. The first section of the paper pro-vides more background on the nature and motive of Tangermann's proposal. In the sec...|$|R
