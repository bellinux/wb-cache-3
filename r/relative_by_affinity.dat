50|$|Following the April 2004 elections, the Ministry of Justice reintroduced its Reform Bill. On 2 March 2005, the National Assembly {{passed the}} Korean Family Law Reform Bill, which came into effect on 31 March {{of the same}} year. Among the {{amendments}} to Korean family law included a reformed version of Article 809:Marriage may not be allowed between parties whose relationship of blood relative exists within the eighth degree (including the blood relatives for the real-adopted child kept before real-adoption).Marriage may not be allowed between parties if either of them is or was the spouse of blood relative within the sixth degree of relationship, or if either of them is or was the blood relatives within sixth degree of relationship of the spouse, or if either of them is or was the spouse of blood <b>relatives</b> <b>by</b> <b>affinity</b> within fourth degree of relationship of the spouse.Marriage may not be allowed between parties whose relationship of blood relative existed within the sixth degree of adoptive parents lineage and within the fourth degree of adoptive parents affinity.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), the Church {{recognized}} {{two additional}} forms of affinity. Firstly, {{when a man}} married a widow, her relatives {{as well as those}} of her former husband were considered the man's relatives and treated as if they were his blood relatives. Secondly, if the woman's first husband had been a widower then the blood relatives of his first wife became the woman's <b>relatives</b> and <b>by</b> her subsequent marriage, were also the new husband's <b>relatives</b> <b>by</b> <b>affinity.</b> Also, a woman's children by a deceased husband as well as the children of her husband by a deceased wife were considered related <b>by</b> <b>affinity.</b> So the subsequent marriages of stepsiblings carried the same prohibitions as if they were related by blood. The principle established was [...] "affinity begot affinity." [...] The Fourth Lateran Council removed the second type of affinity rule and new axiom became: [...] "affinity does not beget affinity", which is the principle followed in the modern Catholic church. It also limited both affinity and consanguinity prohibitions to the fourth degree, but retained the same method of calculating, counting back to a common ancestor. The Council of Trent (1545-1563) limited the impediment to marriage on account of affinity when the affinity is created out of marriage (e.g., by force or extra-matrimonial intercourse) to the second degree of affinity.|$|R

Only when this fails and when there are no requests by the child's extended family to adopt him / her does adoption by an unrelated person become considered.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The general {{topic of}} this review is protein-based {{underwater}} adhesives produced by aquatic organisms. The {{focus is on}} mechanisms of interfacial adhesion to native surfa-ces and controlled underwater solidification of natural water-borne adhesives. Four genera that exemplify {{the broad range of}} function, general mechanistic features, and unique adaptations are discussed in detail: blue mussels, acorn barnacles, sandcas-tle worms, and freshwater caddisfly larva. Aquatic surfaces in nature are charged and in equilibrium with their environment, populated by an electrical double layer of ions as well as adsorbed natural polyelectrolytes and microbial biofilms. Surface adsorption of underwater bioadhesives likely occurs by exchange of surface bound ligands by amino acid sidechains, driven primarily <b>by</b> <b>relative</b> <b>affinities</b> and effective concentra-tions of polymeric functional groups.

40|$|Mig 1 and Mig 2 are {{proteins}} {{with similar}} zinc fingers {{that are required}} for glucose repression of SUC 2 expression. Mig 1, but not Mig 2, is required for repression of some other glucose-repressed genes, including the GAL genes. A second homolog of Mig 1, Yer 028, {{appears to be a}} glucose-dependent transcriptional repressor that binds to the Mig 1 -binding sites in the SUC 2 promoter, but is not involved in glucose repression of SUC 2 expression. Despite their functional redundancy, we found several significant differences between Mig 1 and Mig 2 : (1) in the absence of glucose, Mig 1, but not Mig 2, is inactivated by the Snf 1 protein kinase; (2) nuclear localization of Mig 1, but not Mig 2, is regulated by glucose; (3) expression of MIG 1, but not MIG 2, is repressed by glucose; and (4) Mig 1 and Mig 2 bind to similar sites but with different <b>relative</b> <b>affinities.</b> <b>By</b> two approaches, we have identified many genes regulated by Mig 1 and Mig 2, and confirmed a role for Mig 1 and Mig 2 in repression of several of them. We found no genes repressed by Yer 028. Also, we identified no genes repressed by only Mig 1 or Mig 2. Thus, Mig 1 and Mig 2 are redundant glucose repressors of many genes...|$|R
