40|$|Purpose: Human {{resource}} {{issues are}} one of the most significant problems in the management of international joint ventures (IJVs). This study aims to investigate the possible impacts of interpersonal relationships between Chinese employees and foreign employees in China’s Sino-foreign joint ventures on employees’ work performance. At first, this study examines the possible influences of interpersonal relationships between people from different cultural backgrounds on group processes. Then, the probable effects of group processes on the performance of intellectual decision-making <b>work</b> and <b>repetitive</b> manual <b>work</b> are investigated. Methods: Primary data is collected in this study. Self-report questionnaires for employees and telephone interviews with supervisors are used as the methods of collecting data. In total, 51 employees (including 28 Chinese employees and 23 foreign employees) and 5 Chinese supervisors from Sino-foreign joint ventures in China participate in this study. Findings: This study reveals that interpersonal relationships have significant influences on several group processes and some group processes influence the performance of intellectual decision-making <b>work</b> and <b>repetitive</b> manual <b>work</b> significantly. Overall, this study finds that employees working with their foreign friends tend to perform both intellectual decision-making <b>work</b> and <b>repetitive</b> manual <b>work</b> better than employees who work with their foreign acquaintances.

40|$|Abstract. The unified {{modeling}} language (UML) {{was introduced}} to describe {{the model of the}} general framework of the professional image processing system (PIPS). The required functions, basic components and working principle of the general framework were discussed and given in the UML. The traditional mode and the novel mode based on the general framework were compared to develop a representative image processing system. Results demonstrate that the amount of person-months of the human resource of various ability levels can be reduced by at least 50 %. Compared with traditional mode, the novel mode can improve efficiency, reduce risk and benefit to teamwork by making researchers only focus on the development of kernel modules rather than the other inefficient and <b>repetitive</b> <b>works.</b> This mechanism is also applicable to other similar systems...|$|R

Muscles biopsies were taken from the trapezius muscle at baseline, after work and after 10 weeks intervention. The main findings are that the capacity of carbohydrate oxidation was reduced in myalgic compared with healthy muscle. <b>Repetitive</b> stressful <b>work</b> increased mRNA content for heat shock proteins and decreased levels of key regulators for growth and oxidative metabolism.

40|$|As {{information}} technologies advance, the data amount {{gathered on the}} Internet increases at an incredible rapid speed. To solve the data overloading problem, people commonly use web search engines to find what they need. However, as search engines become an efficient and effective tool, plagiarists can grab, reassemble and redistribute text contents without much difficulty. In this paper, we develop an intelligent system to reduce such misapplication of search engines. Specifically, suspicious documents are extracted and verified through the collaboration of our plagiarism detection system and search engines. With a proper design, extracted text segments are given different priorities when sending them to search engines as the ascertainment of plagiarism. This greatly reduces unnecessary and <b>repetitive</b> <b>works</b> when performing plagiarism detection. Moreover, our approach is robust at detecting suspicious documents with multiple content sources. Empirical studies show that our system is with high recall and precision rates. In general, the plagiarism documents and thus the malicious users can be precisely identified in a very efficient way by utilizing of our detection system. 1...|$|R

40|$|The built {{environment}} is moving towards sustainable {{development and the}} number of green buildings increased worldwide in recent years. Green buildings are environmentally, socially and economically desirable; however the certification of green buildings is often expensive and labor-intensive. The document preparation and review process for green building certification is iterative in nature and requires the collaboration of many project participants, certification organizations and third party engineering consultants. This paper aims at developing a system framework that can assist the green building certification process. Different certification standards have been studied and their scope and credit calculation were compared to understand the requirements of the system framework. Based on the study, the required features were designed as follows, (1) role-based access control, (2) document manager and related document discovery, (3) workflow manager, (4) credit manager, and (5) knowledge manager. The features of the system provide a collaborative environment and reduce <b>repetitive</b> <b>works</b> commonly occurring in manual processes. The features of the system framework are discussed and illustrated considering the Hong Kong BEAM Plus standard.

40|$|<b>Repetitive</b> and {{monotonous}} <b>work</b> {{is frequently}} associated with neck and shoulder pain and negative psychosocial factors inducing stress reactions. The present thesis concerns {{the relations between}} psychophysiological and subjective stress reactions, muscle activity measured by surface electromyography (SEMG) in the trapezius muscle, and neck and shoulder pain in women performing <b>repetitive</b> and monotonous <b>work.</b> In Study I cardiovascular and subjective stress reactions were investigated during computer work in a laboratory setting. The findings indicated that heart rate variability is a more sensitive and selective measure of mental stress compared with blood pressure recordings. Study II explored the relations between stress reactions and muscle activity during supermarket work. The results showed that perceived negative stress reactions may have a specific influence on muscle activity in the neck and shoulder region, which can be of importance for work-related musculoskeletal disorders in <b>repetitive</b> and monotonous <b>work.</b> In Study III the association between SEMG activity patterns and neck and shoulder pain was investigated during cash register work. It was found that pain-afflicted women had a different muscle activation pattern (more static, more co-contraction, less muscle rest) compared with pain-free women. Study IV was a follow-up study evaluating the introduction of job rotation among female cashiers. The results indicated positive effects on diastolic blood pressure, muscle activity, and partly on neck and shoulder pain, although perceived stress was unchanged. It was concluded that job rotation {{seems to have a}} limited effect on chronic neck and shoulder pain, but may be an effective preventive measure. The empirical findings are particularly relevant for women who, compared with men, more often perform <b>repetitive</b> and monotonous <b>work</b> and are also more often affected by neck and shoulder pain...|$|R
