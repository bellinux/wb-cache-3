5|$|Self-referencing is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford contends that Kiarostami's films {{do not contain}} <b>references</b> <b>to</b> the work of other directors, but do include a myriad of <b>references</b> <b>to</b> his own work. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several <b>references</b> <b>to</b> women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit <b>references</b> <b>to</b> women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E

5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent <b>references</b> <b>to</b> texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent <b>references</b> <b>to</b> works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These <b>references</b> <b>to</b> works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
