40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the influence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induction on post-myocardial infarction (MI) remodeling, especially in relation to the inflammatory response and myocardial fibrosis. BackgroundGranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor modifies wound healing by promoting monocytopoiesis and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into injured tissue; however, the effect of GM-CSF induction on the infarct healing process and myocardial fibrosis is unclear. MethodsA model of MI was produced in Wistar rats by ligation of the left coronary artery. The MI animals were randomized to receive GM-CSF inducer (<b>romurtide</b> 200 μg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days) (MI/Ro) or saline (MI/C). ResultsEchocardiographic and hemodynamic studies on day 14 revealed increased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension, decreased fractional shortening, elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, and decreased LV maximum rate of isovolumic pressure development in MI/Ro compared with MI/C. Immunoblotting showed that expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 in the infarcted site on day 3 after MI was decreased in MI/Ro compared with MI/C. In the infarcted site, TGF-β 1, collagen type I and type III messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression on day 3, and collagen content on day 7 were reduced in MI/Ro compared with MI/C, in association with marked infarct expansion. In MI/Ro, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 mRNA level and the degree of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages (ED- 1 -positive) were greater in the infarcted site on day 7 than those in MI/C. ConclusionsThe GM-CSF induction by <b>romurtide</b> facilitated infarct expansion in association with the promotion of monocyte recruitment and inappropriate collagen synthesis in the infarcted region during the early phase of MI...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the synergistic effects of <b>romurtide</b> (MDP-Lys [L 18]) and cefmenoxime (CMX) {{in the treatment}} of experimental Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. Mice were infected with 1 x 10 (4) CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhalation of aerosol bacterial suspension. About 90 % of untreated animals died within a week; however, the mortality rate of animals treated with CMX alone at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day was 60 % at 7 days after the infection. When one or two doses of L 18 were administered before or after the infection concomitantly with CMX, a remarkable improvement in the survival rate was observed. There was no significant improvement in the survival rate of animals treated with L 18 alone before or after infection. Histopathological sections of the lungs of mice treated with CMX and L 18 showed slower progression of infection than those of mice treated with CMX alone. Significant differences were also found in quantitative cultures of viable bacteria in the lungs 1 to 4 days after the infection. Although viable bacterial counts in the lungs of the control and CMX-treated groups showed a rapid increase 24 to 48 h after the infection, they remained lower than the initial counts (x 10 (4)) in the lungs of mice treated with combination regimens. From these results, it can be concluded that L 18 is a useful biological response modifier {{in the treatment of}} acute pulmonary bacterial infections...|$|E
