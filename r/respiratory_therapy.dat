Scrushy divorced his wife, with whom he had two children, and took a position teaching at Wallace State Community College in Dothan, Alabama. While teaching at Wallace State, Scrushy met and married his second wife, Karen Brooks. The two had four children before they divorced in 1996. In early June 1997, Scrushy married Leslie Anne Jones in Jamaica, with guests such as Martha Stewart attending.

40|$|OF THE BACHELOR'S THESIS Author: Petra Mandovcová Supervisor: Mgr. Martina Havlová Opponent: Title of bachelor's thesis: Techniques of Respiratory Physiotherapy in {{inhalation}} Therapy of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Abstract: This {{paper is}} focused on the techniques of <b>respiratory</b> physical <b>therapy</b> in inhalation therapy of chronic pulmonary diseases. The paper is divided into two parts - theoretical and practical. The aim of the theoretical part is to briefly describe anatomy and physiology of respiration. Next, the theoretical part deals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and possibilities of its treatment. The emphasis is put on the inhalation therapy and the description of particular techniques of <b>respiratory</b> physical <b>therapy</b> which are used in the therapy of chronic pulmonary diseases. The practical part includes two case histories of patients who are being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To evaluate the state of the patient, spirometry testing and the MMRC dyspnea scale are used. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the influence of <b>respiratory</b> physical <b>therapy</b> on efficacy of inhaled medicine concerning the patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. Key words: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhalation <b>therapy,</b> <b>respiratory</b> physical <b>therapy,</b> instrumental technique...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} effect of NIPPV {{combined}} with <b>respiratory</b> stimulant <b>therapy</b> on serum markers in COPD patients with mild pulmonary encephalopathy. Methods: A total of 102 cases of COPD patients with mild pulmonary encephalopathy who were hospitalized in our hospital from November 2012 to February 2015 were selected as research subjects and divided into observation group 51 cases and control group 51 cases according to the different clinical treatment they received. Control group received <b>respiratory</b> stimulant <b>therapy</b> alone, observation group received NIPPV combined with <b>respiratory</b> stimulant <b>therapy,</b> and then differences in arterial blood gas, serum AngⅡ, CPK, LDH, IL- 6, IL- 8 and IL- 10 levels, S- 100 β, NSE, MBP, T-SOD and MDA levels as well as T 3, T 4 and TSH levels were compared between two groups. Results: PH value and PaO 2 value of observation group after treatment were {{higher than those of}} control group, and PaCO 2 level was lower than that of control group; serum AngⅡ, CPK, LDH, IL- 6, IL- 8 and IL- 10 levels of observation group after treatment were lower than those of control group; serum S- 100 β, NSE, MBP and MDA levels of observation group after treatment were lower than those of control group, and T-SOD level was higher than that of control group; serum T 3, T 4 and TSH levels of observation group after treatment were higher than those of control group. Conclusion: NIPPV combined with <b>respiratory</b> stimulant <b>therapy</b> for COPD patients with mild pulmonary encephalopathy can effectively optimize respiratory function and equilibrate body fluid environment, and it has active clinical significance. ...|$|R

A preliminary ‘repeated measures’ experimental study was conducted. Seventeen participants with cystic fibrosis were recruited from out-patient clinics.
