The effect of these modifications is that for non-POW media, the rules are identical for UDF 2. 50 plus 2. 50 errata and UDF 2. 60 plus 2. 60 errata. POW stands for Pseudo OverWrite. A Major benefit from this is that an implementer can use the UDF 2. 60 documents to implement both UDF 2. 50 and 2. 60, instead of going through the UDF 2. 50 spec and all 2. 50 errata DCNs for implementing UDF 2. 50. The only thing that a UDF 2. 50 implementer needs to know when implementing UDF 2. 50 from the UDF 2. 60 documents is that Pseudo OverWrite and pseudo-overwritable partitions are not allowed for UDF 2. 50 and that the UDF <b>Revision</b> <b>field</b> in Domain Entity Identifiers and UDF Entity Identifiers must have a value # 0250 instead of # 0260 (see 2. 1. 5. 3).

This research was conducted through development steps consisting of preliminary study, planning, preliminary product development, preliminary test, main product <b>revision,</b> <b>field</b> test, final product revision and product dissemination. The product was tested by some experts of learning multimedia, digital engineering, e-learning and instructional design. To find out the validity of the developed hypothetical model, a Delphi technique was used based on the consensus accepted by the experts. The consensus included the aspects of (1) identification of the problem through a needs analysis, (2) determination of priority (type and products manufacture), (3) determination of program objectives, and (4) determination of the problem solution. The next step was tryout of the model to 10 instructors and 25 students of the Electrical Engineering Department. This test was used to determine the learning impact and the subjects’ perception of the implementation of the products in a practical activity. The final consensus of the validity obtained from the experts and the perception of the subjects of the research was analyzed using the percentage method. Meanwhile, the determination of learning impact was done using the different average scores of the subjects. This research has developed an online teaching model and its supporting resources for digital technique practicum. This result could be implemented with more flexible and low cost to support the practicum in higher education. The learning resources obtained are the Virtual Laboratory Portal ([URL] A Manual for an Online Learning Model for Practicum, Lessons Plan for Digital Technique, Digital Technique Textbook, A Manual for Breadboard Simulator, A Manual for Online Practicum for Lecturers/Instructors/Students, and A Manual for Digital Technique Practicum with the guided inquiry method.

40|$|Deception Island (Antarctica) is {{the southernmost}} island of the South Shetland Archipelago in the South Atlantic. Volcanic {{activity}} since the eighteenth century, {{along with the}} latest volcanic unrest episodes in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, demonstrates that the volcanic system is still active and that future eruptions are likely. Despite its remote location, the South Shetland Islands are an important touristic destination during the austral summer. In addition, they host several research stations and three summer field camps. Deception Island is characterised by a Quaternary caldera system with a post-caldera succession and {{is considered to be}} part of an active, dispersed (monogenetic), volcanic field. Historical post-caldera volcanism on Deception Island involves monogenetic small-volume (VEI 2 – 3) eruptions such forming cones and various types of hydrovolcanic edifices. The scientific stations on the island were destroyed, or severely damaged, during the eruptions in 1967, 1969, and 1970 mainly due to explosive activity triggered by the interaction of rising (or erupting) magma with surface water, shallow groundwater, and ice. We conducted a detailed <b>revision</b> (<b>field</b> petrology and geochemistry) of the historical hydrovolcanic post-caldera eruptions of Deception Island with the aim to understand the dynamics of magma-water interaction, as well as characterise the most likely eruptive scenarios from future eruptions. We specifically focused on the Crimson Hill (estimated age between 1825 and 1829), and Kroner Lake (estimated age between 1829 and 1912) eruptions and 1967, 1969, and 1970 events by describing the eruption mechanisms related to the island’s hydrovolcanic activity. Data suggest that the main hazards posed by volcanism on the island are due to fallout, ballistic blocks and bombs, and subordinate, dilute PDCs. In addition, Deception Island can be divided into five areas of expected activity due to magma-water interaction, providing additional data for correct hazard assessment on the island. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Entirely representative of these traits are Field's 18 nocturnes and associated pieces such as Andante inedit, H 64. These works were some of the most influential music of the early Romantic period: they do not adhere to a strict formal scheme (such as the sonata form), and they create a mood without text or programme. These pieces were admired by Frédéric Chopin, who subsequently made the piano nocturne famous, and Franz Liszt, who published an edition of the nocturnes based on rare Russian sources that incorporated late <b>revisions</b> by <b>Field.</b> Liszt's preface to the said edition was an extensive eulogy for Field and his nocturnes.|$|R

The research instrument used is the expert assessment sheet material, sheet media expert assessment, questionnaire responses of teachers, and questionnaire responses of students. Through research and development in the first year obtained the following conclusions: 1) Has generated Application of “Science for Kids on Android” as a science learning media that can be accessed through the Android gadget, 2) Application of “Science for Kids on Android” declared eligible {{to be used as a}} learning media from the perspective of content and strategy of presentation of the material, as evidenced from the results of the expert (lecture) and practitioners (teachers) assessment in the category of "very good". While the students' response to the product in the category "Good"...|$|R
40|$|Comparative housing {{research}} {{encompasses a}} broad range of strategies and foci, which has promoted the exchange of information, catalysed policy development and encouraged theoretical debate. This presentation briefly outlines the different purpose (policy description, evaluation, strategic understanding and theoretical explanation), logical strategy (hypothesis testing, interpretation, model building and <b>revision),</b> multiple <b>field</b> of focus (locality, tenure, institution, household, individual, social relations, financial arrangements, organisations, welfare regimes, state’s role and neo-liberalism) and diverse contribution to theoretical debates made by comparative housing research in the 2000 s. It summarizes recent progress, emerging from a range of social science disciplines, which has contributed towards key debates concerning shifts in housing institutions and governance, divergent housing regimes and welfare systems, unitary, integrated and dualist rental markets, social exclusion and neighbourhood decline, forms of housing tenure and their rise and fall, organisational behaviour and networks, local responses to globalisation, the nature of home and socially constructed housing experiences. This presentation encourages researchers to reflect on these differences and developments and contribute towards progress in the coming decade of comparative housing research.

40|$|This {{research}}  was {{conducted to}} produce inquiry-based science virtual laboratory that was eligible for developing students' thinking skills in science learning, and  {{to determine the}} effectiveness of a virtual laboratory to develop students' thinking skills. The research method was Research and Development (R & D), by pointing to Four D models and Borg & Gall Model. There were 4 main phases (define, design, develop, disseminate) and additional phases (preliminary field testing, main product <b>revision,</b> main <b>field</b> testing, and operational product revision).   Research subjects were junior high school students of 7 rd class. The instruments used included product validation questionnaire, observation sheet of thinking skill, and test. For the validation of data and student response data were analyzed descriptively; and test results were analyzed by paired-t test. The results showed that the inquiry-based science virtual laboratory product was considered as excellent by expert and teacher and it was appropriate to use in science learning. Its effectiveness to increase students' thinking skills was showed by by significant  value= 0, 000 from t-paired test. ...|$|R
