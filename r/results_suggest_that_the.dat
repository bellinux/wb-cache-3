5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> posterior parietal cortex is a key neural locus of our impoverished mental representation of the visual world.|$|E

25|$|The Y-chromosomal {{data has}} also {{revealed}} a common Finno-Ugric ancestry for the males {{of the neighboring}} Balts, speakers of the Indo-European Baltic languages. According to the studies, Baltic males are most {{closely related to the}} Finno-Ugric-speaking Volga Finns such as the Mari, rather than to Baltic Finns. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been settled by Finno-Ugric-speaking tribes since the early Mesolithic period.|$|E
25|$|These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four MBTI scales can be {{incorporated}} within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension). Emotional stability (or neuroticism) is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.|$|E
25|$|For example, when {{climate model}} {{simulations}} {{of the last}} century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.|$|E

40|$|The {{collateral}} {{effects of}} response blocking were evaluated while treating stereotypic {{behavior in a}} woman diagnosed with autism. Blocking stereotypic behavior (head and tooth capping) was associated with decreases in leisure-item interaction and increases in another stereotypic response (hand wringing). <b>Results</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reduction in item interaction was due to adventitious punishment. Prompts to access an alternative source of reinforcement attenuated the side effects somewhat, but <b>results</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> undesirable effects of response blocking may be fairly durable...|$|R

25|$|The RBE of {{different}} types of heavy particles on CNS function and cognitive/behavioral performance was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The relationship between the thresholds for the HZE particle-induced disruption of amphetamine-induced CTA learning is shown in figure 6-4; and for the disruption of operant responding is shown in figure 6-5. These figures show a similar pattern of responsiveness to the disruptive effects of exposure to either 56Fe or 28Si particles on both CTA learning and operant responding. These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> RBE {{of different}} particles for neurobehavioral dysfunction cannot be predicted {{solely on the basis of}} the LET of the specific particle.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males {{were randomly assigned}} to females to create half-sib families to determine the heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers found that there was additive genetic variance in the timing of spermatophore removal by females. These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E
25|$|MMP-3 {{also does}} {{damage to the}} blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), the {{functional}} equivalent of the blood-brain barrier, after spinal cord injury (SCI). In a similar study conducted using MMP-3 WT and KO mice, MMP-3 was shown to increase BSCB permeability, with the WT mice showing greater BSCB permeability than the KO mice after spinal cord injury. The same study also found decreased BSCB permeability when spinal cord tissues were treated with a MMP-3 inhibitor. These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of MMP-3 serves to increase BSCB permeability after SCI. The study showed that MMP-3 accomplishes this damage by degrading claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 (another tight junction protein), similar to how MMP-3 damages the BBB.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with evaluating {{the performance of the}} model and algorithm in [7] for detecting lateral gene transfers events. Using a Poisson process to describe arrival times of transfer events, a simulation is used to generate “synthetic ” gene and species trees. An implementation of an efficient algorithm in [7] is used to estimate the minimum number of transfers necessary to explain disagreements between the generated gene and species trees. Our first <b>result</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> algorithm can solve realistic size instances of the problem. Our second <b>result</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mean error and variance are low when saturation does not occur. Additionally, certain plausible evolutionary events allowed by our model of evolution used to generate gene and species trees but not detectable by the algorithm occur rarely implying the framework should work well in practice. Our third surprising <b>result</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of optimal scenarios is on average low for realistic input sizes. ...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{literature}} of environmental determinism, the tsetse {{has been linked to}} difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent. A 2012 study used population growth models, physiological data, and ethnographic data to examine pre-colonial agricultural practices and isolate the effects of the fly. A [...] "tsetse suitability index" [...] was developed from insect population growth, climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly's population steady state. <b>Results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tsetse decimated livestock populations, forcing early states to rely on slave labor to clear land for farming, and preventing farmers from taking advantage of natural animal fertilizers to increase crop production. These long-term effects may have kept population density low and discouraged cooperation between small-scale communities, thus preventing stronger nations from forming.|$|E
