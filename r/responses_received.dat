500|$|A third {{programme}} {{of expansion}} was initially mooted in 2008. The {{aim of this}} programme was to expand the stadium into an all-embracing [...] "sports village", replete with an ice rink, indoor golf course, restaurants and shops. Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development. A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009. A report to Council in December 2009 noted {{that there had been}} [...] "a reasonable level of interest at the preliminary stage" [...] from private investors, but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted, which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds. The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village, the ice rink, may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village. The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to [...] "stimulate the market". A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 <b>responses</b> <b>received</b> were in favour of the amended proposal. As a result, notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received.|$|E

2500|$|Buses first {{appeared}} on this route in the mid-1920s during the so-called [...] "bus wars" [...] when private bus operators decided to take {{on one of the}} Board's most lucrative services. Once the Board had seen off the competition on this route, it was not until 1930 that buses again made an appearance. The local council wanted to re-lay Main North Road, along which the tram line ran down one side, and gave the Board several options: to re-lay the tramline {{down the middle of the}} road, to double-track the line, or to remove the line. [...] The Board could not countenance the re-laying of the line because of the cost and opted to abandon the tram service to Northcote. [...] When permission to terminate the tram service without a plan for a replacement bus service was denied, the Board sought expressions of interest from private bus operators to run a feeder service to the terminus of its tramline in Papanui after rejecting other suggestions including that it should establish a trolley bus service on the route. [...] None of the <b>responses</b> <b>received</b> were to the Board's liking, so it decided to run the service itself. [...] On this basis, permission was granted to terminate the Northcote tram service and the Board's replacement bus service commenced the following day. [...] It was never popular, with the necessity of having to transfer between buses and trams at Papanui being a common complaint, and after several service reductions were made in line with falling demand (including a short-lived Sunday service), the Board abandoned the route altogether in 1932 after coming to an arrangement with a private operator to take over the service.|$|E

30|$|Comprehension {{accuracy}} was operationalized as {{test scores}} based on correct answers. Each correct <b>response</b> <b>received</b> one point, and each incorrect <b>response</b> <b>received</b> no point. The score {{range of the}} test was thus 0 to 39. The researcher used WINSTEPS version 3.80. 1 to conduct data analysis with the Rasch dichotomous model. Both raw scores and logits were reported as descriptive statistics. Inferential statistics were performed with SPSS 16.0. Unless stated otherwise, Rasch-calibrated measures were used for statistical analyses. In cases where the assumptions underlying certain parametric procedures were not met, alternative non-parametric procedures were used. Finally, following Taguchi (2008), the interview data were qualitatively analyzed {{with a focus on}} the strategies and processes involved in interpreting the implied meaning encoded through the three types of implicature.|$|R
