40|$|Previous {{reports have}} shown that {{axillary}} sentinel lymph node (ASLN) radiodetection allows accurate axillary staging for patients with early breast cancer. Radioguided surgery implies {{the use of a}} gamma-probe to count the emitted radioactivity of marked ASLNs. Several gamma-probes are commercially available, each with its own properties. The clinical impact of the type of gamma-probe used for ASLN radiodetection remains to be evaluated. METHODS: Three commercially available gamma-probes were evaluated: a scintillator with a bismuth germanate crystal (probe A), a semiconductor with a cadmium telluride crystal (probe B), and a semiconductor with a cadmium zinc telluride crystal (probe C). Two hundred patients with early breast cancer were prospectively enrolled to undergo ASLN <b>radiodetection</b> <b>and</b> axillary lymphadenectomy. ASLN mapping consisted of injecting (99 m) Tc-sulfur-colloid around the tumor. For each patient, sentinel lymph nodes were counted successively with the 3 probes and the sensitivity of each gamma-probe was determined from ASLN residual activity. The results of detection rates and false-negative rates for each probe were compared. RESULTS: Mean residual ASLN activity was 52 kBq (range, 0. 07 - 189 kBq). Sensitivity was compared among the 3 probes and found to be best for probe A. The detection rate of probe A was significantly better than that of probe B (93 % vs. 86 %, P = 0. 05) but not different from that of probe C (93 % vs. 90 %). No differences in false-negative rates were observed among the 3 probes. CONCLUSION: ASLN detection rate depends on the type of gamma-probe used. Because failure to detect the ASLN leads to complete axillary lymphadenectomy, involving local morbidity and other sequelae, the type of gamma-probe must be considered important for sentinel lymph node radiodetectio...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis, investigating two novel optical fibre sensor systems, was carried out as part of industrially sponsored (<b>Radiodetection</b> Ltd) <b>and</b> supported applied research project. The first sensor determines the longitudinal position of acoustic disturbances acting on an extended length of optical fibre cable and the second system locates the lateral position of a buried dielectrically-sheathed fibre cable. The second system {{is believed to be}} the first optically-based sensor for the location of buried fibre optic cables. An RF electromagnetic field, emitted from above the cable, radiates through the ground and modulates the polarisation state of the light guided by the optical fibre, via the Faraday effect. The lateral position of the buried cable can then be inferred by observing the peak in the amplitude of modulation as the locator is traversed across the buried position of the fibre allowing, for the first time, dielectrically-sheathed optical cables to be located non-intrusively...|$|R
