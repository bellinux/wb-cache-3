40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a fully 1 D and of a 1 D-multiD integrated approach for the simulation of complex muffler configurations. The fully 1 D approach aims to model the muffler recurring to an equivalent net of 1 D pipes. An expansion chamber with offset inlet and outlet pipes was modeled with this preocedure and the resuts compared to CFD simulations, pointing out some critical aspects in the TL prediction. The HLLC Riemann solver and its extension to the second order were implemented both in the 1 D and multiD models and exploited to handle the interface between the calculation domains. The integrated 1 D-multiD approach was used afterwards to predict the transmission loss of more complex geometries such as series chambers with extended inlet and outlet pipes and with flow reversals. A new procedure has been adopted to calculate the transmission loss, imposing a pressure impulse at the inlet and evaluating the response of the muffler. This method, along with the adoption of more accurate numerical schemes improved considerably the accuracy of the result and shortened the comuptational time. The results pointed out a better prediction of the coupled approach if compared to the results of the 1 D simulations. Moreover, a real engine configuration has been adopted to predict the acoustic performance of the <b>reverse</b> <b>chamber</b> under realisic operating conditions, in which pressure perturbations have finite amplitude and mean flow is present...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays a great {{attention}} is paid to the level and quality of noise radiated from the tailpipe of intake and exhaust systems, to control the gas dynamic noise emitted by the engine as well as the characteristics of the cabin interior sound. The muffler geometry can be optimized consequently, to attenuate or remark certain spectral components of the engine noise, according to the result expected. Evidently the design of complex silencing systems is a time-consuming operation, which must be carried out by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. In particular, 1 D and multiD linear/non-linear simulation codes can be applied to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domain. This paper describes the development of a 1 D-multiD integrated approach for the simulation of complex muffler configurations such as reverse chambers with inlet and outlet pipe extensions and perforated silencers with the addition of sound absorbing material. The 1 D-multiD integrated approach is exploited to validate the transmission loss prediction of <b>reverse</b> <b>chamber</b> configurations with inlet and outlet extensions. Results have pointed out the capability of capturing transversal resonances at high and mid frequencies. Moreover a non linear approach is proposed {{to take into account the}} presence of the sound absorbing material into the conservation equations of a multidimensional solver. The properties of the sound absorbing material exploited have been taken form correlation adopted in the literature for 1 D models. The momentum and energy conservation equations have been modified to take into account the interaction between the gas and sound absorbing material. Both the integrated 1 D-multiD approach and the fully 3 D model have been exploited for validation. The validation has been carried out considering two different geometries: an expansion chamber with an extended outlet pipe, with the sound absorbing material placed between the pipe extension and the canning, and a perforated pipe whose cavity has been completely filled with sound absorptive metallic wool. The results obtained both with the fully 1 D analysis and the intergated approach are in agreement with the measured muffler preformances...|$|E

40|$|Flow {{reversal}} chambers {{are mainly}} used {{to accomplish a}} compact silencer design needed on a vehicle. Generally in this configuration the inlet and outlet ports {{are on the same}} face and the flow direction is reversed. During many years different authors have tried to develop 1 D and 3 D models for evaluating the acoustic performance of circular and rectangular <b>reversing</b> <b>chambers.</b> Ih [1] categorizes four methods for evaluating the acoustic performance of the <b>reversing</b> <b>chamber.</b> The first involves utilizing analysis techniques for other types of muffler elements having similar acoustic performances [2]. Analysis techniques for extended inlet/outlet expansion chambers may be used to approximate the behavior of a <b>reversing</b> <b>chamber</b> in which the length-to-diameter ratio is large. When the length-to-diameter ratio is small, the <b>reversing</b> <b>chamber</b> approximates the behavior of a short expansion chamber. In this case, exact predictions of the acoustic performances cannot be made and, moreover, the method itself is a trial-and-error one. The second is a mode-matching method at the discontinuities [3 - 5], but this is tedious to formulate and the transmission matrix for this type of muffler has not been obtained. A simplified version (third method) of this method has been developed for plane wave propagation, in which the sound pressures and particle velocities at the area discontinuities are matched [6, 7]. However, this method is restricted to a very small frequency range below the cut-off frequency of the first asymmetric mode, i. e., the (1, 0) mode, and the peaks of the transmission loss curves are not correctly predicted due to the disregard of the higher order modes. Furthermore, when the length-to-diameter ratio is small, the actual acoustic performance deviates appreciably from the theoretical transmission loss predicted by this one-dimensional analysis method. The fourth method involves using numerical methods such as finite element analysis [8] and the finite difference method [9], or possibly, the boundary element method. These numerical techniques have some merits in the treatment of more complicated geometries, such as that of an elliptic cross-section and/or a chamber with a pass tube [10], but a great many mesh points or mesh elements are required to deal with the high frequency range, so that the execution time for computation is long and the costs are high. It is also difficult to describe the total exhaust system by incorporating the transmission matrix of each silencer element. Lindborg et al. [11] modeled the flow reversal chamber by two port method. The system under study is broken down into a set of linear subcomponents that are described individually and then assembled in a network. Each component is treated as a black box that is defined at the inlet and outlet ports where plane waves are assumed. This is an efficient tool, but for complicated geometries such as the flow reversal chamber the decomposition into subcomponents is not obvious. Three different approaches are used for the two port modeling of a flow reversal [11]; 1 - Large quarter wave resonator 2 - More detailed representation consisting of cones and quarter wave resonators 3 - A simplification of the second approach into a simple Pipe 6 From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the acoustic characteristics of shallow flow reversal chambers can be modeled, with engineering precision, up to cut on frequency of the first higher order mode using simple two-port elements. Good results were achieved modeling the flow reversal chamber as a simple straight duct connecting the inlet and the outlet. Munjal [12] devised a numerical collocation method. This method is easily applicable to rectangular as well as circular expansion chambers, but is limited to integer multiple area expansion ratios due to its inherent concept of discrete geometrical partitioning. Analytical methods have been introduced over the years. These methods fall into two main groups, one-dimensional and three-dimensional models. However as Ih [13] has mentioned, if the length of the chamber is much shorter than its width, then a large number of modes should be counted for calculating transmission loss even for the very low frequency range and this fact, arising mainly from the higher order acoustic modes generated at area discontinuities which do not fully decay before they reach the counterpart port, because the inlet and outlet are very close to each other. This leakage phenomenon means that the one-dimensional models are quite far from the actual performances even in the low frequency region. Three-dimensional models provide a very simple and exact approach to theoretical prediction of acoustical performance of plenum and <b>reversing</b> <b>chambers.</b> A three-dimensional mathematical formulation for mufflers with circular or rectangular cross-section with arbitrary location of inlet/outlet is derived by using the Eigen function expansion technique by Ih [13, 14]. The same problem is solved by the use of Green's function by Kim and Kang [15] for circular chambers and by Venkatesham et al. [16] for rectangular chambers. These methods take into account the effect of higher order modes which is necessary for successful analysis of a flow reversal chamber. The basic idea for these models {{stems from the fact that}} these chambers are in general regular in shape, which permits the use of series of orthogonal eigenfunctions. However, mufflers used in industry are not exactly rectangles or cylinders. Usually they are a bit curved at the edges to increase the stiffness. It is of interest for industry to know how this difference can alter the TL curve. This problem can be solved by FEM, however this method would be expensive and time consuming. One purpose of this thesis work is to investigate other methods for predicting TL of such chambers. One method could be to approximate the chamber which is curved at the edges with one which has sharp edges and then use the available theoretical models like the Green's function method to get TL curve. In the present study we want to find out how to do this approximation. The other possible method can be Neural Network. However this method needs some training data to train the neural network. Data for training can be obtained either through experiment or FEM. The effect of mean flow velocity is not studied here; However it has been found to be of negligible effect when Mach number is smaller than about 0. 03 [17]. Besides, when the mean flow velocity is smaller than about M = 0. 1, the convective contributions can be considered as negligible second order quantities and flow-generated noise may often be neglected. Further, if the mean flow velocity is small, the flow-generated 7 noise as well as pressure losses can be greatly reduced without degradation of the acoustic performance by streamline guidance: i. e., by using special l/O connecting geometries such as bell mouths and perforated bridges with high perforation ratios over 20 % [14]...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the Finite Elements Method for stress and strain analysis of the hot water boiler structure. The {{aim of the research}} was to investigate the influence of the boiler scale on the thermal stresses and strains of the structure of hot water boilers. Results show that maximum thermal stresses appear in the zone of the pipe carrying wall of the first <b>reversing</b> <b>chamber.</b> This indicates that the most critical part of the boiler are weld spots of the smoke pipes and pipe carrying plate, which in the case of significant scale deposits can lead to cracks in the welds and water leakage from the boiler. The nonlinear effects were taken into account by defining the bilinear isotropic hardening model for all boiler elements. Temperature dependency was defined for all relevant material properties, i. e. isotropic coefficient of thermal expansion, Young’s modulus, and isotropic thermal conductivity.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{silencers}} for internal combustion (I. C.) engines {{is a key}} issue to attenuate or emphasize certain spectral components of tailpipe noise. The optimization of complex shape silencing systems is generally a time-consuming operation, which {{must be carried out}} by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. This paper describes the development and application of different non-linear models: a coupled 1 D-multiD model and a coupled 1 D-quasi- 3 D model, to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domains. Second order time and space discretization were adopted in the 3 D and quasi- 3 D approaches, whereas specific coupling strategies were developed to realize the interface between them and the 1 D model. In particular, since the 3 D relies on a collocated grid discretization, a Riemann solver based method was developed to realize the coupling with the 1 D code while a cell overlapping procedure was exploited to interface the 1 D code with the quasi- 3 D method in order to fit with the pseudo staggered grid arrangement. Both a white noise and a single impulse boundary conditions have been imposed upstream of the pipe system to excite the wave motion. The integrated 1 D-multiD and the quasi- 3 D approaches were applied to predict the transmission loss of reactive and dissipative mufflers in which the pressure waves can be significantly non-planar, to point out the influence of higher order modes on the acoustic performance. <b>Reverse</b> <b>chambers</b> with extended inlet and outlet and perforates have been investigated, showing the potential of both the hybrid 1 D- 3 D code and the quasi- 3 D code with respect to a simple, fully 1 D model.

40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} the {{capabilities}} of engine simulation {{and the ability to}} accurately pre-dict both performance and acoustics has lead {{to the development of a}} generic 3 D acoustic cell element. This is designed to model the acoustics of intake and exhaust system compo-nents used in internal combustion engines. Models of components are built using a network or grid of 3 D cells based primarily on the geometry of the system. This means that these models can be built without fundamental knowledge of acoustically equivalent systems making their range of application larger as well as making them simpler to construct. Due to the 3 D nature of these models it is also able to predict higher order modes and improve the accuracy of models at higher frequencies compared to conventional plane wave approaches. The solution of the 3 D cell is based on a staggered grid approach. The equations of mass and energy are solved at cell centres and the momentum equation at cell connections or bounda-ries. The 3 D acoustic cell has been validated by comparing the predicted transmission loss to measured values for a number of standard configurations found in intake and exhaust sys-tems.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} test the {{efficacy}} of a passive elastic containment device to <b>reverse</b> chronic <b>chamber</b> remodeling and adrenergic down-regulation in the failing heart, yet still maintaining preload reserve. BackgroundProgressive cardiac remodeling due to heart failure is thought to exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction. In a pressure–volume analysis, we tested the impact of limiting progressive cardiac dilation by an externally applied passive containment device on both basal and adrenergic-stimulated function in failing canine hearts. MethodsIschemic dilated cardiomyopathy was induced by repeated intracoronary microembolizations in six dogs. The animals were studied before and {{three to six months}} after surgical implantation of a thin polyester mesh (cardiac support device [CSD]) that surrounded both cardiac ventricles. Pressure–volume relations were measured by a conductance micromanometer catheter. ResultsLong-term use of the CSD lowered end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes by − 19 ± 4 % and − 22 ± 8 %, respectively (both p < 0. 0001) and shifted the end-systolic pressure–volume relation to the left (p < 0. 01), compatible with reverse remodeling. End-diastolic pressure and chamber diastolic stiffness did not significantly change. The systolic response to dobutamine markedly improved after CSD implantation (55 ± 8 % rise in ejection fraction after CSD vs. − 10 ± 8 % before CSD, p < 0. 05), in conjunction with a heightened adenylyl cyclase response to isoproterenol. There was no change in the density or affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors. Diastolic compliance was not adversely affected, and preload-recruitable function was preserved with the CSD, consistent with a lack of constriction. ConclusionsReverse remodeling with reduced systolic wall stress and improved adrenergic signaling can be achieved by passive external support that does not generate diastolic constriction. This approach may prove useful in the treatment of chronic heart failure...|$|R

On 22 April 2008 the Appeals Chamber Judges found that Kubura took the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent certain acts of plunder committed by those under his command in Vareš in November 1993 and <b>reversed</b> the Trial <b>Chamber’s</b> charges for this conviction, his sentence was reduced from two and a half years imprisonment to two years imprisonment by the Appeals Chamber; however Kubura had already served his sentence.|$|R
40|$|An electro-osmotic {{actuation}} mechanism is explored for micropump applications where self contained, low power, miniaturized pumps are necessary. The principle of electro-osmosis through a cation selective membrane {{is used to}} develop a differential pressure {{which is used to}} deflect a pump membrane. In an electro-osmotic cell, there are electrolyte filled chambers on either side of an ion specific membrane. Hydrated cations migrate in an applied electric field, effectively pulling water molecules to the cathodic chamber. In such a setup, the polarity of the current can be periodically <b>reversed</b> causing the <b>chambers</b> to alternately fill and discharge. Since the chemical reactions are reversible, an operating window can be defined so that the electrodes do not degrade and gas bubbles do not form. Using data from the characterization of an ion specific membrane such as Nafion, design parameters were developed {{that could be used to}} build and operate a micropump using standard MEMS based fabrication and packaging technology. The design is compatible with a silicon substrate which could contain fluidic channels and chambers. Upper layers could be fabricated using laser cut plastic, Nafion membranes and elastomeric membranes. Characterization of the materials was done with an acrylic test cell that could be disassembled and reused [1]. Recommendations for the miniaturization and integration of the micropump were developed. Measurements of Nafion water transport properties were used to determine operating current requirements. Recommendations for the minimization of energy consumption is provided as related to chamber geometry. Possible explanations for anomalous effects observed during experimentation were explored through simulation...|$|R
40|$|Spray drift {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} issues facing aerial applicators. Material not applied to the target crop or pest is a financial loss for the farmer and a potential liability for the applicator. Off-site drift also represents an environmental liability, particularly as habitat and water quality concerns demand greater attention with larger buffer and/or no-spray zones. Current practice delivers liquid material through a nozzle, under pressure, and utilizes air shear for at least a portion of the atomization, creating a range of droplets with those less than 200 microns, known as fines, particularly susceptible to off-site drift. As airspeed increases, so does the effect of air shear on the spray leaving the nozzle, resulting in further shatter/fracture of droplets producing even more fines, leading to more off-site drift. Control of the nozzle environment allows for control of air velocity where atomization occurs, reducing the production of driftable fines and reducing off-site movement of spray material. Control of nozzle environment is accomplished using a chamber having three sections, called a <b>Reverse</b> Venturi Atomization <b>Chamber</b> (RVA). Air enters the first section (diffuser), with a restricted opening, and flows into a larger area (settling chamber) where air velocities are reduced, the nozzle is located, and where atomization occurs. The atomized spray and air then travel through the third chamber section (constrictor) where they are accelerated to match the aircraft’s air speed. By reducing the air speed were atomization occurs, the atomization profile demonstrates fewer fines, leading to less drift. Data to date, using the prototype RVA, water as the test medium, and a selection of commercially available nozzles, we have demonstrated up to a 74 % reduction in fines at 100 mph and 58 % reduction in fines at 150 mph air speed...|$|R
