40|$|A quick-connect {{fastener}} of a relatively-simple straightforward {{design is}} arranged with a tubular body adapted {{to be engaged}} against an attachment fitting in coincidental alignment with an opening in that fitting. A tubular collet having flexible finger projecting from its forward end is arranged in the fastener body to be shifted forwardly by an elongated expander member coaxially arranged within the tubular collet for advancing the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting. Biasing means are arranged between the elongated expander member and a <b>rotatable</b> <b>actuator</b> which is threadedly mounted within the tubular collet {{so as to be}} rotated for urging the expander member into engagement with the collet fingers. A first coupling member is arranged on the <b>rotatable</b> <b>actuator</b> to be accessible from outside of the fastener so that a second coupling member on the distal end of a flexible shaft can be introduced into the fastener body and coupled to the first coupling member to enable a typical actuating tool coupled to the shaft outside of the fastener body to be operated for advancing the outwardly-enlarged ends of the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting and thereafter rotating the actuator member to expand the fingers to that attachment fitting. Upon expansion of the collet fingers, the biasing means impose a biasing force on the expander to releasably retain the fingers in their latching positions...|$|E
