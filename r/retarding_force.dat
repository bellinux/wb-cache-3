2500|$|Section 112 of the Canadian Rail Operating Rules states [...] "when {{equipment}} is left {{at any point}} {{a sufficient number of}} hand brakes must be applied to prevent it from moving" [...] and [...] "the effectiveness of the hand brakes must be tested” before relying on their <b>retarding</b> <b>force.</b> The engineer tests the hand brakes by seeing if the train budges when trying to push and pull the train with locomotive power. If a train is left on an incline, the number of handbrakes needed to hold the train increases. It takes 2–3 minutes per car to set the hand brakes. The track from Nantes to Lac-Mégantic is downhill on a 1.2% grade. Nantes is [...] above sea level, Lac Mégantic is [...] lower at [...] The MMA claimed that its braking policy required the activation of hand brakes on the five locomotives and 11 freight cars, or 20.5% of the total train. However, the TSB confirmed evidence in the criminal charges citing MMA procedures requiring nine brakes to hold a 70–79 car train. The TSB concluded that a minimum of 17 and possibly as many as 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train, depending on the amount of force with which they had been applied. Transport Canada does not validate the special instructions of a railway company or give any specific guidance on how many brakes must be applied for parked freight trains. While Transport Canada had repeatedly reprimanded MMA from 2004 to 2009 and in 2011 and 2012 for violations of CROR Section 112 handbrake requirements on parked trains in Nantes, no fines had been issued for the infractions.|$|E

Your {{objection}} is {{answered with}} an ease which is nearly in {{the ratio of}} its apparent unanswerability.--As regards {{the progress of the}} star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it. There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb.

50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff spring arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring arm against the cam exerts a <b>retarding</b> <b>force</b> on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the <b>retarding</b> <b>force</b> it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the <b>retarding</b> <b>force</b> gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that for the case of two neutral but {{electrically}} polarizable atoms the consideration or not of retardation effects on the dispersive van der Waals force between them leads essentially to different power laws for the forces; while the <b>retarded</b> <b>force</b> is proportional to $ 1 /r^ 8 $, where $r$ is the distance between the atoms, the non-retarded force is proportional to $ 1 /r^ 7 $. Here we consider the (repulsive) dispersive force between an electrically polarizable atom and a magnetically polarizable one and show that, in contrast to the previous case, a quite unexpected result appears, namely: while the <b>retarded</b> <b>force</b> is still proportional to $ 1 /r^ 8 $, the non-retarded force is proportional to $ 1 /r^ 5 $.

The stationary phase in strict sense includes the medium (paper) together with the polar solvent (water). The mobile phase or propelling force includes both polar and non-polar solvent.

50|$|Rowing is a cyclic (or intermittent) form of {{propulsion}} {{such that}} in the quasi-steady state {{the motion of the}} system (the system comprising the rower, the oars, and the boat), is repeated regularly. In order to maintain the steady-state propulsion of the system without either accelerating or decelerating the system, the sum of all the external forces on the system, averaged over the cycle, must be zero. Thus, the average drag (<b>retarding)</b> <b>force</b> on the system must equal the average propulsion force on the system. The drag forces consist of aerodynamic drag on the superstructure of the system (components of the boat situated above the waterline), as well as the hydrodynamic drag on the submerged portion of the system. The propulsion forces are the forward reaction of the water on the oars while in the water. Note also that the oar can be used to provide a drag force (a force acting against the forward motion) when the system is brought to rest.|$|E

Air in contact with a body will stick to the body's surface and that layer will tend to stick to the next layer of air and that in turn to further layers, hence the body is dragging some amount of air with it. The force required to drag an [...] "attached" [...] layer of air with the body is called skin {{friction drag}}. Skin friction drag imparts some momentum to a mass of air as it passes through it and that air applies a <b>retarding</b> <b>force</b> on the body. As with other components of parasitic drag, skin friction follows the drag equation and rises with the square of the velocity.|$|E

Special attention is drawn {{to the impact of}} the electrolyte ionic strength and counter-ion nature, chosen within the alkali-metal series, on HS electrophoretic mobility. Taylor-Aris dispersion analysis provides insights into the hydrodynamic radius (RH) distributions of HS. The smallest characterized entities are of nanometric dimensions, showing neither ionic strength- nor alkali-metal-induced aggregation. These results are compared with the entities evidenced in dynamic light scattering measurements, the size of which is two order of magnitude higher, ca. 100 nm. The extended Onsager model provides a reasonable description of measured electrophoretic mobilities in the ionic strength range 1 - 50 mM, thus allowing the estimation of limiting mobilities and ionic charge numbers for the different HS samples.
