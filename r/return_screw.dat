50|$|In the meantime, after a {{hiatus of}} over twenty years, {{original}} writer Earl Mac Rauch and director W.D. Richter have begun new adventures for Buckaroo Banzai {{in the form}} of a comic book produced by Moonstone Books. The new story, the three issue mini-series <b>Return</b> of the <b>Screw,</b> which was published on September 15, 2007, picks up where the film left off. It has since been collected in trade-paperback.|$|R

5000|$|As {{the school}} struggled, former Andover {{resident}} John Proctor, {{the inventor of}} the threaded wood <b>screw,</b> <b>returned,</b> in 1857, to build up the town. By the 1870s Proctor helped to return the school to Andover, debt-free, as well as build a new dormitory on the site of modern-day Gannett House. In 1879, the Unitarian Church sought to purchase the Andover school {{in order to create a}} school [...] "free from...theological dogmatizing and unnatural religious methods." [...] Andover was a hotbed of Unitarian thought, which helped to facilitate the sale of the school. In 1881, the school was opened as Proctor Academy in honor of John Proctor's contributions to the school.|$|R
40|$|In {{an eight}} year period, 31 {{patients}} with proximal femoral fractures resulting from sports accidents were treated by implantation of either a Gamma nail or a dynamic hip <b>screw.</b> <b>Return</b> {{to work or}} sports and the time to bone healing did not differ very much between the treatments. Gamma nailing was clearly the best with regard to stability and time to full mobilisation (4. 5 days), but required 39 minutes to perform compared with insertion of a dynamic hip screw (27 minutes). The incidence of complications and malalignments did not differ very much between the two, although, when Gamma nailing was first used in the authors' clinic, more intraoperative complications occurred than with the dynamic hip screw. Stable pertrochanteric fractures may be treated with a dynamic hip screw. Unstable pertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures are treated with a Gamma nail at the authors' institution...|$|R
50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the <b>screw).</b> <b>Returned</b> to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
50|$|On 22 April the Anglo-French fleet arrived off Odessa, and lay offshore. At 5 a.m. {{the first}} {{division}} (Descartes, Sampson, Tiger and Vauban) sailed in, {{and opened fire}} on the Russian positions {{from a range of}} about 2000 yd, though with little effect. Vauban was hit by a red-hot shot that started a fire aboard and was obliged to temporarily withdraw. She soon <b>returned,</b> bringing the <b>screw</b> corvette Caton with her. The second division (Furious, Terrible, Retribution and Mogador) then joined the attack, while Arethusa, Highflyer and Sans Pareil remained further offshore as a reserve. The attacking ships now anchored closer in, and it was not long before a shot from Terrible hit a magazine on the Imperial Mole, which exploded causing great damage. About 24 Russian ships in the military port were set on fire, and several British and French merchant ships detained there took advantage of the confusion to escape. Meanwhile, the rocket-boats set fire to the dockyard storehouses. Late in the action the Arethusa, under the command of Captain William Robert Mends, engaged batteries {{on the south side of}} the Quarantine Mole, until recalled. As numerous fires were now threatening the town, the attack was ended at 5.30 p.m., and the squadron withdrew.|$|R
5000|$|After {{participating}} in various Fleet exercises, Wadleigh arrived at Pensacola, Florida, on 17 August, to commence {{four weeks of}} plane-guard duty for [...] She rescued three downed aviators from the Gulf of Mexico during this tour. Next, the destroyer sailed north for an overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard—during which time the ship received a battery of 3 inch guns—replacing the older 40-millimeter mounts.On 3 May 1954, Wadleigh departed Newport, bound via the Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam for the Western Pacific (WestPac), and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 7 June 1954. After initially operating in the Philippine Islands, the destroyer shifted to the waters off {{the east coast of}} Korea, assisting in monitoring the Armistice Agreement reached at Panmunjom the year before.While in Subic Bay, Wadleigh was put on alert and ordered to rendezvous with Task Group 70.2 (TG 70.2). Once she joined with the group, TG 70.2 proceeded to the southern coast of Formosa in a precautionary move by the United States to forestall possible Chinese communist intentions towards the American-supported Nationalist Chinese regime on the island. While en route to Formosa, the ship struck an underwater object which inflicted minor damage to both <b>screws.</b> <b>Returning</b> to Subic Bay, the ship repaired the damage and sailed to rejoin the group. Once back on station, she spent 20 tense but uneventful days on patrol off Formosa and, soon thereafter, proceeded back to Sasebo, Japan, to prepare to return to the United States.|$|R
40|$|Background: Bioabsorbable {{interference}} screws {{are used}} frequently for graft fixation in ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction. The resorption properties of many available screws that are marketed as bioabsorbable {{are not well}} defined. The CALAXO (Smith & Nephew Endoscopy) and MILAGRO (DePuy Synthes) bioabsorbable screws contain polymers of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) plus additives to encourage osseointegration over time. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) properties and compare patient-reported outcomes at a minimum of two years of follow-up after ACL reconstruction using CALAXO or MILAGRO bioabsorbable interference screws. Methods: A cohort of patientswhounderwent ACL reconstruction inwhich the fixation usedwaseither CALAXOorMILAGROscrews returned for repeat radiographs for evaluation of tunnel widening, repeat MRI for evaluation of graft integrity and screw breakdown, and completion of the pain and symptom items of the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire. Results: At a mean of three years (range, 2. 5 to 4. 0 years) after surgery, thirty-one patients with sixty-two CALAXO screws and thirty-six patients with seventy-twoMILAGRO <b>screws</b> <b>returned</b> for repeat evaluation. Two blinded, independent reviewers found no significant differences between the two screw types when comparing radiographs for tibial or femoral tunnel widening or MRIs for graft integrity, tibial and femoral foreign body reactions, or femoral screw degradation. Both reviewers found a significant difference between the two screw typeswhen comparing tibial screw degradation properties (p < 0. 01). All analyzed CALAXO screws were rated as partially intact or degraded; the MILAGRO screws were more likely to be rated a...|$|R
40|$|I have {{recently}} described (Chambers, 1922, b) an apparatus for {{the manipulation of}} micro needles and micro pipettes under the highest magnifications of the microscope. This apparatus is an improvement on Barber's Pipette Holder (Barber, 1914) because of its simpler construction and the greater accuracy with which one can control its movements. An additional advantage consists {{in the existence of}} certain devices for bringing the pipette or needle, quickly into position before starting actual operation. The working principle of the apparatus (which is being pat-ented) is imustrated in figure 1. It consists in the use of bars of rigid metal connected at their ends to form a Z like figure by resilient metal acting as spring hinges. The bars are forced apart by <b>screws</b> and <b>return</b> when the <b>screws</b> are reversed. By these means arc movements are imparted to the tip of a pipette which is attached to one of the bars. As the radius of each arc is {{about two and a half}} inches, the fine movements imparted to the tip of the pipette are practically in straight lines because the excursion never exceeds one millimeter. The instrument can be used by itself for one needle or pipette, or with a companion apparatus when two needles, or a needle and a pipette are to be used simultaneously. When a pair is used, one is a left handed and the other a right handed appara-tus, both being clamped to the front of the microscope stage. For the isolation of bacteria, one instrument is sufficient. It may be clamped on the left side of the microscope stage, figure 2, so that the pipette projects into the moist chamber from th...|$|R
