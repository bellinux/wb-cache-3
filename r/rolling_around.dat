25|$|The {{seeds of}} Pop's stage persona were sown {{when he saw}} The Doors perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and {{antagonism}} displayed by singer Jim Morrison. Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were Mick Jagger and James Brown. Pop was the first performer to do a stage-dive, which he started at a concert in Detroit. Pop, who traditionally performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as <b>rolling</b> <b>around</b> in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.|$|E

Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman.

She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now.

500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and I thought I did sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was <b>rolling</b> <b>around</b> going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E

The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin.

As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while <b>rolling</b> <b>around</b> the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E
