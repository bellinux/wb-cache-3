5|$|The Parrett Navigation Act {{allowed the}} proprietors, of whom 25 were named, to raise £10,500 in shares and £3,300 by mortgage, {{with which to}} make {{improvements}} to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport, to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport, and to continue the improvements as far as Thorney. The <b>River</b> <b>Isle,</b> which joined the Parrett at Muchelney, was to be improved for its first mile, and then the Westport Canal was to be constructed from there to Westport. Locks were planned at Stanmoor, Langport, and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney. An extra lock was added at Oath, when tests revealed that the depth of water would not meet that specified in the Act without it. Costs were considerably higher than expected, and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839, to allow an extra £20,000 to be raised. The lock at Oath has since {{been replaced by a}} sluice gate to control flooding.|$|E
