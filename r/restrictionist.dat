50|$|The {{original}} <b>restrictionist</b> legislation also posed {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} Victorian Liberal tradition of free movement for the peoples of Britain. As part of their free trading policy, the Liberal government believed that Britain should be {{a safe haven for}} those suffering persecution. When the Liberal government returned to power in 1906, many Conservatives feared that the Aliens Act would be removed. Considered to be a ‘law of the land’, however, this <b>restrictionist</b> legislation was not removed. The Liberals amended the act by increasing its flexibility {{in order to make it}} less restrictive and easier for people to enter the country. The Liberals disagreed with the Conservative restrictionism and this demonstrates the contested political response in Britain regarding the effects of anti-Jewish Pogroms in Tsarist Russia.|$|E

40|$|During the 2008 election, President Barack Obama promised Latino voters that, if elected, {{he would}} deliver {{comprehensive}} immigration reform including a legalization plan for many {{if not all of}} the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States. However, this reform would require an act of Congress, and Obama failed to deliver during his first term. Yet Obama won an even larger share of the Latino vote in 2012 than he had in 2008. How was this possible? We argue that the Obama administration maintained and expanded its support from Latino voters by exploiting legal possibilities for executive action through four different initiatives, though the first two were unsuccessful and aimed at persuading immigration <b>restrictionists</b> to support {{comprehensive immigration reform}}. First, in an effort to build trust with some members of Congress, Obama sought to demonstrate his enforcement of immigration law by increasing deportations over those of his predecessor, George W. Bush. Second, the Obama administration sought to show to <b>restrictionists</b> an increase in the moral worthiness of the undocumented immigrants eligible for legalization by focusing deportations on undocumented persons who had committed crimes. Third, Obama turned his attention to Latino voters, and used executive action to counteract a statutory provision that kept undocumented spouses of U. S. citizens separated for months or years while attempting to adjust to legal status. Last, and most importantly, the administration created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children (and met other criteria) to receive work permits and be temporarily exempted from deportation. We explain the legal authorization that allowed these actions, their political context, and their ultimate consequences—most notably the continued support Latino voters offered Obama despite his limited progress on statutory immigration reform and reliance on executive action...|$|R
40|$|Well {{known in}} Australian history are the arrivals of Greeks.

Coincidentally their arrival coincided with the establishment of the Greek community of Melbourne and the emergent politics of Australian nationbuilding. As a group of semi-nomadic, questionably “Greek” migrants they were treated in contradictory ways. They received charitable assistance from some settlers while others — predominantly immigration <b>restrictionists</b> and the Greek-Melbournians — regarded them as a burden to colonial progress. How and why the Greek community of Melbourne chose to discredit these people was linked to the colonial ideal of respectability, which fostered the social traits of independence and permanent settlement.

These quotas remained in place with minor alterations until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

40|$|Joseph P. Fishman’s Creating Around Copyright {{advances}} {{a provocative}} thesis: some restrictions on creativity can spur {{the development of}} additional creative solutions, and (some level of) copyright {{might be one of}} those restrictions. If Picasso was right that “forcing yourself to use restricted means is the sort of restraint that liberates invention,” then being forced by law to use restricted means might do the same thing, ultimately leading to more varied and thus more valuable works. At the outset, it’s important to know the baseline against which we ought to evaluate Fishman’s claims. Most copyright <b>restrictionists,</b> of whom I count myself one, don’t want to eliminate all copyright law. Fishman’s argument is directed at creators who want to take an existing work and do something with it — incorporate parts of it into a new creative work or make a derivative work based on it. Because the question is the proper scope of copyright as applied to these works, the comparison should not be to a world without copyright, but should instead focus on the marginal effects of expanding or contracting copyright’s definitions of substantial similarity and derivative works. Once the question is properly framed, I have concerns about the major analogies Fishman uses — patent law and experimental evidence about other types of constraints on creativity — as well as his model of the rational creator...|$|R
40|$|The Real ID Act, {{passed on}} May 11, 2005, {{is the first}} post-September 11 antiterrorism {{legislation}} specifically to target a group of vulnerable individuals to whom the United States has historically granted protection: asylum seekers. The passage of the Real ID Act led asylum advocates to wring their hands in despair and immigration <b>restrictionists</b> to clap their hands in glee. This Article argues that {{both sides of the}} debate may have been justified in their reactions, but not because of the immediate chilling impact on asylum that they seem to expect. With regard to requirements for establishing asylum eligibility, the Real ID Act, rather than imposing new, onerous restrictions on asylum, codifies case law upon which adjudicators, advocates, and government attorneys have been relying for decades. However, several areas of poor drafting, combined with legislative history mischaracterizing the asylum system as a haven for terrorists and suicide bombers, may result in the denial of bona fide asylum applications. This Article provides concrete guidance for adjudicators, advocates, and government attorneys applying the Real ID Act to asylum cases. It examines the case law upon which some of the provisions are based and offers interpretations for unclear provisions. Overall, this Article emphasizes that it is the duty of adjudicators, advocates, and government attorneys to protect victims of persecution...|$|R
40|$|Historians {{generally}} {{refer to}} the years between 1890 and 1917 as the Progressive Era. They describe it as a time when Americans began to identify the problems of their increasingly urbanized and industrialized nation, tried to determine their causes, and attempted to work out acceptable solutions. Called reforms, the latter included an income tax, government regulation, referendum and recall, and prohibition. A movement for greater restriction of immigration occurred at the same time, yet only a few historians consider it a progressive reform. Most associate it with either late-nineteenth century reaction or First World War nationalism. The activities of those engaged {{in the struggle to}} enact legislation to restrict immigration defy easy attachment to either trend. In the early 1890 s, they decided a literacy test, requiring each adult immigrant to demonstrate his or her ability to read and write, was the most practical method of reducing the number of annual arrivals. Its proponents first used clearly reactionary arguments. They contended the literacy test would reduce the migration of southern and eastern Europeans. When this assertion failed to convince enough lawmakers to vote for the measure, supporters changed tactics. They identified foreign newcomers with America 2 ̆ 7 s social and economic maladies. The literacy test, therefore, would help provide a solution. It took <b>restrictionists,</b> those who supported greater statutory exclusion, many years to achieve success.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{seeks to}} advance our {{understanding}} of local government ordinances on issues related to unauthorized immigrant residents including day labor markets, housing, unlicensed businesses, and cooperation with federal immigration authorities. We attempt {{to answer the question}} of why such ordinances are considered, passed, or fail to pass in some areas and not others. Some factors expected to explain the consideration and passage of <b>restrictionist</b> ordinances were demographic changes, labor market outcomes, and political factors. One of the strongest explanations for <b>restrictionist</b> versus “pro-immigrant ” proposals is the proportion of Republicans and Democrats in the county. Controlling for demographic characteristics, Republican areas {{are twice as likely to}} propose <b>restrictionist</b> ordinances, and one-fourth as likely to propose “pro-immigrant ” ones. Even stronger effects can be found for the actual passage of such legislation. Other factors, such as the growth of the Latino population and the size of linguistically-isolated Spanish-speaking households, were not associated with a greater likelihood of proposing or passing <b>restrictionist</b> legislation. Thus, demographic factors are not as important as political factors in accounting for ordinances passed by local governments related to unauthorized immigration, either pro or con...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} Mark McKenna’s Testing Modern Trademark Law’s Theory of Harm as {{an important}} step forward in challenging trademark expansionism, going back to basics and asking us to assess for truth value several propositions that now seem so self-evident to lawyers and judges as to not require any empirical support at all. Like McKenna, the author believes that if the law looked for the evidence behind present axioms of harm, it would not find much there. McKenna and the author share an interest in empirical evidence on marketing {{and a desire to}} bring its insights to trademark law. But how did today’s theories of harm resulting from any kind of confusion, even confusion over unrelated goods, become “common sense” to judges, particularly when Mark Lemley asserts that modern Lanham Act jurisprudence represents “the death of common sense”? McKenna has traced the history of the harm argument in the courts, but figuring out exactly why that argument became persuasive—so persuasive, in fact, that courts now take it as factual beyond debate—is difficult. Common sense, often employed in legal reasoning, tends to hide its empirical and normative judgments in ways that make analysis difficult. McKenna, like other trademark <b>restrictionists,</b> tries to push back against today’s common sense with facts that will, as a whole, constitute a new (or even an old) common sense. His project limits trademark more tightly to protection against competition, with extensions only where necessary to avoid actual harm. The author briefly examines the role of common sense inferences, and how courts might deploy these inferences differently in trademark litigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{commonly}} argued that immigration policies in advanced democracies are consistently {{more liberal than}} the <b>restrictionist</b> preferences of publics. In this article, I challenge this view by examining the opinion-policy relationship at the stage of policy implementation, rather than legislative choice. Bureaucrats, in fact, regularly encounter local publics {{who are opposed to}} the strict enforcement of migration control measures. These pressures, I argue, reflect a shift in public attention between the stages of policy design and policy implementation, from the benefits of restriction to the harsh costs of control. As implementation makes these costs visible, public opinion threatens the capacity of bureaucrats to implement <b>restrictionist</b> legislative mandates. The article specifies the conditions under which bureaucrats ’ enforcement strategies can enhance their capacity to produce policy outcomes that are more <b>restrictionist</b> than public preferences. Drawing on extensive interview data, the article empirically tests this argument by examining the implementation of deportation policy in Germany. 2 Migration control is a fundamental expression of the state's monopoly over the legitimate means of coercion (Weber, 1979). By regulating the movement of noncitizens across nationa...|$|E
40|$|Between 1990 and 2000 the {{foreign-born}} {{population in}} the United States increased by 57 %, compared to a 13 % increase in the native-born population. This growth has fueled considerable media attention, and has fomented some anti-immigrant sentiments. Although a number of authors have charted changes in support for <b>restrictionist</b> immigration policies, few have examined their determinants. In this paper we focus on region of residence, and use data from a 2004 telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of 1888 adults {{to test the hypothesis}} that rural Americans are more likely to support restrictive immigration policies than individuals in urban and suburban communities. In a series of regression analyses, this hypothesis is confirmed; rural residents hold the most <b>restrictionist</b> views. Additional analyses indicate that this effect of rural residence on policy attitudes is mediated by attitudes toward multiculturalism, the perceived traits of immigrants, and perceptions about the costs of immigration. Ultimately, the analyses indicate that the perceived cost of immigration is the single strongest predictor of support for restrictive immigration policies, and that it best accounts for rural residents ’ more <b>restrictionist</b> views...|$|E
