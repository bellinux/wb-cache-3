The heavier phase, {{poor in the}} entrainer (benzene or cyclohexane), is stripped of the entrainer and recycled to the feed—while the lighter phase, with condensate from the stripping, is recycled to the second column. Another early method, called extractive distillation, consists of adding a ternary component that increases ethanol's <b>relative</b> <b>volatility.</b> When the ternary mixture is distilled, it produces anhydrous ethanol on the top stream of the column.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} (put) moneyness is fixed-strike moneyness, where M=K, and {{the simplest}} call moneyness is fixed-spot moneyness, where M=S. These are {{also known as}} absolute moneyness, and correspond to not changing coordinates, instead using the raw prices as measures of moneyness; the corresponding volatility surface, with coordinates K and T (tenor) is the absolute volatility surface. The simplest non-trivial moneyness is the ratio of these, either S/K or its reciprocal K/S, which {{is known as the}} (spot) simple moneyness, with analogous forward simple moneyness. Conventionally the fixed quantity is in the denominator, while the variable quantity is in the numerator, so S/K for a single option and varying spots, and K/S for different options at a given spot, such as when constructing a volatility surface. A volatility surface using coordinates a non-trivial moneyness M and time to expiry τ is called the <b>relative</b> <b>volatility</b> surface (with respect to the moneyness M).|$|E
2500|$|This rough {{classification}} can {{be quantified}} by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money {{or out of the}} money with respect to the strike – or conversely how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset. This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the <b>relative</b> <b>volatility</b> surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike, ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to test to what extent a {{benchmark}} real and monetary business cycle model can account for some basic stylized facts with a particular emphasis on monetary variables. We calibrate the model on German data using the method proposed by Cooley and Prescott (1995). First we will analyze the dynamic properties of the models, the Impulse Response Functions and propose a variance decomposition (for the monetary BC Models). We find that even though money is not neutral in the short run, the effect of a monetary shock is only marginal compared to the productivity shock, i. e. the share of the variance of the monetary shock in the total variance of the forecast error is small and decreases rapidly. We simulate the models and compare the properties of the model economies with those of the observed data. The evidence suggests that the benchmark RBC model can account for some stylized facts in Germany. The general pattern of the <b>relative</b> <b>volatilities</b> of investment, output and consumption is replicated by the model. Nevertheless, the overall volatility is too high and the level of the <b>relative</b> <b>volatilities</b> is not well reproduced.

40|$|Consumption <b>volatility</b> <b>relative</b> {{to output}} <b>volatility</b> is {{consistently}} higher in emerging economies than in developed economies. One natural {{explanation is that}} emerging economies {{are more likely to}} face borrowing constraints and, as a consequence, find it more difficult to use international capital markets to smooth consumption. The author investigates how much this mechanism alone can account for the <b>relative</b> consumption <b>volatility</b> differential between emerging and developed economies. His theoretical approach relies on a standard dynamic general-equilibrium model of a small open endowment economy that is subject to an endogenous borrowing constraint. The borrowing constraint makes the small economy exactly indifferent between two options: (i) repaying its external debt, or (ii) defaulting and having to live in financial autarky in the future. The model for the constrained economy is calibrated to match Brazilian data during the period 1980 - 2001.

40|$|Reactive Distillation (RD) {{is by now}} a well {{established}} operation that combines reaction and distillation in a single unit to offer enhancement in the overall performance of the process. It leads to enhancement in conversion for reversible reactions and selectivity or yield improvement {{in the case of}} multiple reaction schemes. The main underlying principle in application of RD for selectivity engineering is to facilitate the separation of selected components and favorably manipulate the composition profiles in the reactive zone to expedite the desired reaction. In this work, a geometric approach of attainable region (AR), which is already developed for conventional reactor network, is extended further to include representative RD configurations. A model reaction with Van de Vusse scheme (A -> B -> C and 2 A -> D) was studied and an algorithm is developed to obtain the attainable reaction for the given kinetics, feed composition and <b>relative</b> <b>volatilities.</b> The AR should be convex with newly defined RD composition vectors on the boundaries should always point inward.

5000|$|Salt-effect {{distillation}} is {{a method}} of extractive distillation in which a salt is dissolved in the mixture of liquids to be distilled.

50|$|The above {{forms of}} the Fenske {{equation}} can be modified {{for use in the}} total reflux distillation of multi-component feeds.

50|$|The {{addition}} of a Material Separation Agent, such as benzene to an ethanol/water mixture, changes the molecular interactions and eliminates the azeotrope. Added in the liquid phase, the new component can alter the activity coefficient of various compounds in different ways thus altering a mixture's <b>relative</b> <b>volatility.</b> Greater deviations from Raoult's law {{make it easier to}} achieve significant changes in <b>relative</b> <b>volatility</b> with the {{addition of}} another component. In azeotropic distillation the volatility of the added component {{is the same as the}} mixture, and a new azeotrope is formed with one or more of the components based on differences in polarity. If the material separation agent is selected to form azeotropes with more than one component in the feed then it is referred to as an entrainer. The added entrainer should be recovered by distillation, decantation, or another separation method and returned near the top of the original column.|$|E
