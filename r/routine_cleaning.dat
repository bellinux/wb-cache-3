25|$|The Philippines and the United States had no {{previous}} cases of Ebola infection, and upon further isolation, researchers concluded {{it was another}} strain of Ebola, or a new filovirus of Asian origin, which they named Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) after {{the location of the}} incident. Reston virus (RESTV) can be transmitted to pigs. Since the initial outbreak it has since been found in nonhuman primates in Pennsylvania, Texas, and Italy, where the virus had infected pigs. According to the WHO, <b>routine</b> <b>cleaning</b> and disinfection of pig (or monkey) farms with sodium hypochlorite or detergents should be effective in inactivating the Reston ebolavirus. Pigs that have been infected with RESTV tend to show symptoms of the disease.|$|E

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of <b>routine</b> <b>cleanings.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Teeth {{cleaning}} {{is part of}} {{oral hygiene}} and involves the removal of dental plaque from teeth {{with the intention of}} preventing cavities (dental caries), gingivitis, and periodontal disease. People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened deposits (tartar) not removed by <b>routine</b> <b>cleaning.</b> [...] Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{vaccines}} against canine distemper exist for dogs (ATCvet code: [...] and combinations) and domestic ferrets (...) , which in many jurisdictions are mandatory for pets. Infected animals should be quarantined from other dogs {{for several months}} owing {{to the length of}} time the animal may shed the virus. The virus is destroyed in the environment by <b>routine</b> <b>cleaning</b> with disinfectants, detergents, or drying. It does not survive in the environment {{for more than a few}} hours at room temperature (20–25°C), but can survive for a few weeks in shady environments at temperatures slightly above freezing.

50|$|The Lewis lamp design {{proved to}} have several flaws. To begin, {{it was really}} an {{inferior}} version of the Argand lamp. The reflector was made of copper with an interior silver plating to reflect light; however, the thin copper would warp under {{the heat of the}} lamps to become more spherical than parabolic. Also, the silver plating was of poor quality and would be scratched off during <b>routine</b> <b>cleanings.</b> Adding to the problem was poor draft for the combustion gases, so that soot would build up on the components, decreasing any alleged improvement. In particular, there was a green lens, which ostensibly improved the visibility, but which was prone to being covered in soot. The sooting became such a problem that the lenses were removed from the lamps.|$|R
2500|$|As to the {{frequency}} of cleaning, research on this matter is inconclusive. That is, it has neither been shown that more frequent cleaning leads to better outcomes nor that it does not. A review of the research literature on the question concluded [...] "he research evidence is not of sufficient quality to reach any conclusions regarding the beneficial and adverse effects of routine scaling and polishing for periodontal health and regarding the effects of providing this intervention at different time intervals". Thus, any general recommendation for a frequency of <b>routine</b> <b>cleaning</b> (e.g. every six months, every year) has no empirical basis. Moreover, as economists have pointed out, private dentists (or other dental professionals) have an economic incentive to recommend frequent cleaning, because it increases their revenues.|$|E
