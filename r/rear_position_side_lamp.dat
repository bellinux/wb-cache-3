50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, front and <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>side</b> marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R

50|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to {{automotive}} lighting in centre high mount stop lamps (CHMSL), {{beginning in the}} late 1980s. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal are all realised with LEDs. The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, <b>position</b> and <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for the}} <b>position</b> and <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|R
5000|$|The (still current) Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations of 1989 {{tightened}} the requirements further. Lighting-up time is retained as the required period {{for use of}} motor vehicle headlights on roads without lit streetlights, but with that exception, all vehicles must now keep conspicuity lights lit during the longer period of sunset to sunrise (unless parked, either in a designated parking place or facing {{the same way as}} adjacent traffic and more than 10 m from the nearest junction on a road with a speed limit not exceeding 30 mph). The conspicuity lights required are [...] "front and <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps" [...] (<b>side</b> and tail lights) plus, for large vehicles, <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> and end-outline marker lamps and, for motor vehicles, rear number plate lights. (Different rules apply to bicycles; RVLR states that [...] "Lights (and reflectors) are required on a pedal cycle only between sunset and sunrise. Lights (and reflectors) are not required when the cycle is stationary or being pushed along the roadside. When they are required, the lights and reflectors listed below must be clean and working properly.) ...|$|R
50|$|A later job of {{the guard}} was the {{provision}} of <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> on brake vans, see picture where all three <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> are visible. The white lamp is the tail lamp, whilst the grey <b>lamps</b> are the <b>side</b> <b>lamps,</b> along with the standard tail lamp (showing red to the rear and sides) required on the rear of every train. The <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> showed a white light towards the front and a red light to the side/rear. The front-facing lamps were an indication to the locomotive crew that the train was still complete, whilst the provision of extra red lights to the rear was an additional safety measure. Due to the very low chance of all three lights being out at once, it was stipulated that a freight train passing without any lamps on the rear had split and that the rear portion was potentially running away. These <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> were used on passenger trains before the adoption of continuous brakes on such trains.|$|R

25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. <b>Rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (<b>rear</b> <b>position)</b> modes, so that a vehicle displaying <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called side marker lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments. It was determined whether cars equipped with <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> are detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than cars without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps,</b> viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The results indicate that <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> increase both lateral conspicuity and recognizability suggesting that <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> may be effective i...|$|R

40|$|One {{of major}} sources of air {{pollution}} {{is the result of}} combustion exhaust gases of automotive engines. As it is known that the process of fuel combustion from motor fuel produces exhaust gases which theoretically containÂ elements of CO, NO x, HC, CO 2, H 2 O and N 2, where many of which are polluting the surrounding environment in theÂ form of air pollution. Â The use of LPG fuel for gasoline engine can be done by adding a piece of equipment called a conversion kit. Â In this study the fuel in the LPG gas injected in the intake manifold with some variation of spin injection with 3000 Â rpm, 4500 rpm and 6000 rpm for each transmision rate (Neutral s / d Gear 4).
