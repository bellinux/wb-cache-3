Five years later, {{it has become clear}} that this law needs to be revised.

Due to improvements in medical sciences the number <b>of</b> successful <b>organ</b> transplants has increased significantly on a global level in the last twenty-five years (Hoy, Alexander and Frith, 2011).

There are three types <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> donation offered by the NHSBT service, these are: following brain stem death after a severe brain injury, where there is no further potential for regaining consciousness or breathing independently again, circulatory death which follows cardiac arrest or the irreversible loss of function of the heart and lungs, or planned withdrawal of treatment within an intensive care unit (ICU) or Emergency Department, living donation involve the donation <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> such as the kidneys, small sections of the liver or part of bones which would otherwise be discarded following knee or hip replacement as well as donation of the placenta following birth (NHSBT, 2016). The issue <b>of</b> consent for <b>organ</b> donation must be addressed prior to the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> and therefore the organ donor register is available for the decision to donate organs to be communicated to the NHSBT team, consent can also be gained from the patient following their own discussion with a friend or relative prior to hospital admission about the individual’s wishes to donate, this may then be communicated to the team caring for the patient in the emergency setting...|$|R

A recent report (Mackay-Sim and Rose, 1986) concluded that deficits in mating behavior in female hamsters could be caused either by <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the vomeronasal <b>organ</b> or by suture of the nasopalatine ducts. In the experiments reported here, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the vomeronasal <b>organs</b> produced severe deficits in about 40 % of sexually naive male hamsters, supporting previous conclusions (Meredith, 1986) that vomeronasal organ damage before sexual experience is particularly debilitating for male hamsters.

25|$|Most {{dissection}} {{involves the}} careful isolation and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>organs,</b> called the Virchow technique. An alternative more cumbersome technique involves the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the entire <b>organ</b> body, called the Letulle technique. This technique allows a {{body to be}} sent to a funeral director without waiting for the sometimes time-consuming dissection <b>of</b> individual <b>organs.</b> The Rokitansky method involves an in situ dissection <b>of</b> the <b>organ</b> block, and the technique of Ghon involves dissection of three separate blocks <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> - the thorax and cervical areas, gastrointestinal and abdominal organs, and urogenital <b>organs.</b> Dissection <b>of</b> individual <b>organs</b> involves accessing the area in which the organ is situated, and systematically removing the anatomical connections <b>of</b> that <b>organ</b> to its surroundings. For example, when removing the heart, connects such as the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava are separated. If pathological connections exist, such as a fibrous pericardium, then this may be deliberately dissected along with the organ.|$|R
25|$|The first {{transplant}} in {{the modern}} sense – the implantation <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> tissue in order to replace an organ function – was a thyroid transplant in 1883. It was performed by the Swiss surgeon and later Nobel laureate Theodor Kocher. In the preceding decades Kocher had perfected the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> excess thyroid tissue in cases of goiter to an extent {{that he was able}} to remove the whole organ without the person dying from the operation. Kocher carried out the total <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organ</b> in some cases as a measure to prevent recurrent goiter. By 1883, the surgeon noticed that the complete <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organ</b> leads to a complex of particular symptoms that we today have learned to associate with a lack of thyroid hormone. Kocher reversed these symptoms by implanting thyroid tissue to these people and thus performed the first organ transplant. In the following years Kocher and other surgeons used thyroid transplantation also to treat thyroid deficiency that appeared spontaneously, without a preceding organ removal.|$|R
