5|$|Because of the {{strength}} and commitment of these survivors and their families, the long silence has finally been broken and the shadow has been lifted... Instead of being forgotten, because of their testimony, the <b>Rosewood</b> story is known across our state and across our nation. This legislation assures that the tragedy of <b>Rosewood</b> will never be forgotten by the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of <b>Rosewood</b> had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black <b>Rosewood</b> resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in <b>Rosewood.</b> Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in <b>Rosewood.</b> The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as a {{survivor}} during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in <b>Rosewood</b> in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the <b>Rosewood</b> Family Scholarship Fund for <b>Rosewood</b> descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Rosewood</b> massacre, {{the ensuing}} silence, and the {{compensation}} hearing were {{the subject of}} the 1996 book Like Judgment Day: The Ruin and Redemption of a Town Called <b>Rosewood</b> by Michael D'Orso. It was a New York Times bestseller and won the Lillian Smith Book Award, bestowed by the University of Georgia Libraries and the Southern Regional Council to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works.|$|E

50|$|On Sunday, March 8, 2009, one of <b>Rosewood's</b> vacant {{buildings}} {{was destroyed}} by fire. The building had previously been approved for demolition, so firefighters allowed the building to burn rather than attempt to put it out. The Maryland State Fire Marshal investigated the fire as possible arson.|$|R
5|$|Originally, the {{compensation}} total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each {{person who could}} prove he or she lived in <b>Rosewood</b> during 1923, and provide a $500,000 pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in <b>Rosewood</b> during the same time. The four survivors who testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Rosewood</b> {{massacre}} was {{a racially}} motivated massacre {{of black people}} and destruction of a black town that {{took place during the}} first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida. At least six black people and two white people were killed, though eyewitness accounts suggested a death toll as high as 150. The town of <b>Rosewood</b> was abandoned and destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States, reflecting the nation's rapid social changes. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black males in the years before the massacre, including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} Dalbergia are {{important}} timber trees, valued for their decorative and often fragrant wood, rich in aromatic oils. The {{most famous of}} these are the <b>rosewoods,</b> so-named because of {{the smell of the}} timber when cut, but several other valuable woods are yielded by the genus.|$|R
50|$|The forests contain {{deciduous}} and semi evergreen trees like teak, <b>rosewoods,</b> terminalias, sandalwoods, jacarandas, mangoes, jamun, tamarind, banyans, sacred fig, plumerias, royal poinciana, kino tree, bamboos, and {{the only}} South Indian conifer, Nageia wallichiana. The medicinal gloriosa lily grows in the park. The endemic flora includes Habenaria periyarensis and Syzygium periyarensis.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the numerous shapes Ritter basses take, the bodies, body tops, necks and fingerboards are made from a large variety of woods and materials including various maples, ebonies, <b>rosewoods,</b> snakewood, kingwood, camphor, ash, amboina, aoplar and more. Jens is known to seek out and experiment with unusual materials for his basses like 9000-year-old bog oak.|$|R
5|$|Carved {{designs in}} lacquerware and designs glazed onto {{porcelain}} wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity {{to those in}} painting. These items {{could be found in}} the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade, ivory, and cloisonné. The houses of the rich were also furnished with <b>rosewood</b> furniture and feathery latticework. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} {{news coverage}} in both {{white and black}} newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the <b>Rosewood</b> survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal exportation of endangered <b>rosewood</b> from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of <b>rosewood</b> logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a spike in bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E
50|$|Vauquelinia, {{commonly}} known as the <b>rosewoods,</b> is a genus of the rose family Rosaceae. It consists of two species of shrubs found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The genus was named for French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763-1829). The nectar provided by these plants is commonly fed on by wasps such as Polistes instabilis.|$|R

5|$|Illegal logging of {{precious}} hardwoods, such as <b>rosewood</b> and ebony, {{has become one}} of the greatest threats to the silky sifaka's habitat, especially since the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Its two largest protected areas, Masoala National Park and Marojejy National Park, have been the hardest hit. The disturbance caused by selective logging increases the likelihood of forest fires, helps invasive species take root, impairs habitat, and causes the loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|James Carrier, Sylvester's {{brother and}} Sarah's son, had {{previously}} {{suffered a stroke}} and was partially paralyzed. He left the swamps and returned to <b>Rosewood.</b> He asked W. H. Pillsbury, the white turpentine mill supervisor, for protection; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier, and tortured him {{to find out if}} he had aided Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict. After they made Carrier dig his own grave, they fatally shot him.|$|E
5|$|The State of Florida {{declared}} <b>Rosewood</b> a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2004 {{and subsequently}} erected a historical marker on State Road 24 that names {{the victims and}} describes the community's destruction. Scattered structures remain within the community, including a church, a business, and a few homes, notably John Wright's. Robie Mortin, the last survivor, died on June 12, 2010 at age 94 after a brief illness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{figure of}} a {{particular}} piece of wood is, in part, due to its grain and, in part, due to the cut, or to innate properties of the wood.

25|$|Hardwoods {{are still}} being {{harvested}} from protected areas across the island and exported from most of Madagascar's ports. The most significant activity has been occurring in the SAVA Region, and particularly in Masoala National Park and the eastern and northeastern portions of Marojejy National Park—both part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana, a World Heritage Site. The terrain in both parks is very rugged, and with only one park ranger per , {{it is impossible to}} fend off the loggers. The parks are being targeted because all the rare <b>rosewoods</b> and ebonies outside of Masoala and Marojejy national parks have already been logged.|$|R
50|$|Under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 the {{exportation}} {{of lumber}} products from wild harvested D. latifolia is illegal. There exists an international high demand and {{price for the}} wood due to its excellent qualities of having a long straight bore, its strength, and its high density. However, the tree is slow-growing; Javanese plantations were started {{in the late nineteenth}} century, but, due to its slow growth, plantations have not expanded beyond Java and India. Many once popular uses for D. latifolia wood have now been replaced with Dalbergia sissoo wood and engineered <b>rosewood's,</b> for economic purposes in cottage industries.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the city has a rich tropical evergreen forest with commercially significant trees such as teak, sandalwood, <b>rosewood</b> and bamboo. The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red loamy soil is also found.

5|$|The {{original}} hotel tower had 680 rooms, {{and each}} featured {{a room with}} one wall which was fully mirrored from floor to ceiling. The hotel featured an 800-seat theatre restaurant and three public dining areas, two health clubs, an epicurean room, a convention hall of up to 2000 people and 20 separate halls and committee rooms, accommodating up to 5000 people in total. Marble was imported from Italy, <b>rosewood</b> from Brazil, with gold leafing throughout the place.|$|E
5|$|An {{open and}} spacious ground floor {{respected}} the same traditional layout exemplified in Besakana and other Merina homes, including {{the presence of}} hearth stones in their customary corner. Following traditional construction practices, the roof three stories above was supported by an enormous andry (central pillar) that was given the name Volamihitsy ("Genuine Silver"). According to popular legend, this was made of a single <b>rosewood</b> tree trunk transported from the eastern rain forests. Recent archaeological excavations of the site during reconstruction have since disproved this account as the pillar {{was found to be}} a composite of fitted <b>rosewood</b> pieces rather than a single solid post. According to custom, the north-eastern corner pillar was the first to be erected. Its length necessitated the use of a pulley designed by Jean Laborde, the principal architect, to haul the trunk into place. When an accident occurred during the operation, the queen designated a Malagasy carpenter to manufacture a crane to complete the task. Thousands of the queen's subjects were forced to labour on the building's construction in lieu of paying cash taxes pursuant to a tradition called fanampoana. One historic source claimed that 25,000 subjects participated in the raising of the building's corner posts alone. The harsh working conditions were said to have been the cause of many deaths, although precise figures are unknown.|$|E

40|$|Illegal {{selective}} logging of tropical timber is of increasing concern worldwide. Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot {{and home to}} some of the world's most sought after tropical timber species. Malagasy <b>rosewoods</b> belong to the genus Dalbergia (Fabaceae), which is highly diverse and has a pantropical distribution, but these timber species are among the most threatened as a consequence of intensive illegal {{selective logging}} and deforestation. Reliable identification of Dalbergia species from Madagascar is important for law enforcement but is almost impossible without fertile plant material, which is often unavailable during forest inventories or when attempting to identify logged trees of cut wood. DNA barcoding has been promoted as a promising tool for species identification in such cases. In this study we tested whether DNA barcoding with partial sequences of three plastid markers (matK, rbcL and trnL (UAA)) can distinguish between Dalbergia from Madagascar and from other areas of its distributional range, and whether Malagasy species can be distinguished from one another. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Malagasy Dalbergia species studied form two monophyletic groups, each containing two subgroups, only one of which corresponds to a single species. We characterized diagnostic polymorphisms in the three DNA barcoding markers that allow rapid discrimination between Dalbergia from Madagascar and from other areas of its distribution range. Species identification success based on individual barcoding markers or combinations was poor, whereas subgroup identification success was much higher (up to 98 %), revealing both the value and limitations of a DNA barcoding approach for the identification of closely related Malagasy <b>rosewoods...</b>|$|R
