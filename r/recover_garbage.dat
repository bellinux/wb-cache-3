2500|$|At first, the families, {{referred}} to as [...] "los Bravos" [...] or the [...] "Heralds of Peace", lived under trees, but they soon dug themselves [...] shelters, covering them with automobile hoods <b>recovered</b> from <b>garbage</b> dumps outside the cities of Casa Grande and Eloy.|$|R
5000|$|Deraa {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{responsible}} for the abduction of scores of Sunnis whose bodies have been <b>recovered</b> from a <b>garbage</b> dump at Al-Sada, a lawless wasteland near Sadr City.|$|R
50|$|The second novel, Anomalous Thrust, {{finds the}} crew {{stranded}} {{on a world}} boycotted by civilisation for its human colonists' enslavement of the local sentient species. Here, they find they can only escape by {{taking part in a}} solar sail race to <b>recover</b> valuable alien <b>garbage</b> jettisoned by a moon-sized vessel making a periodic tour of multiple galaxies - a trope inspired by Rendezvous with Rama.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Washburn {{talks to}} the impound cop (Patton Oswalt) and {{eventually}} convinces him to give him and Belle the cab back. They realize that the gang always robs banks just before the garbage collection is due. The robbers take the money, {{put it in the}} trash and the garbage man collects it. However, because of constantly disobeying orders, he is fired. Later that night, Belle teaches him to drive with [...] "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)" [...] playing on the radio. They discover the garbage collector on the bank route has been performing collections for the gang because they have kidnapped his wife. They trace the kidnapper and <b>recover</b> the <b>garbage</b> collector's wife and all the loot.|$|R
50|$|The damaged {{ring was}} <b>recovered</b> from the <b>garbage</b> {{disposal}} {{and was taken}} to a jeweler for an appraisal. Immediately before the ring was dropped into the garbage disposal it had an aggregate fair market value of $1,010. The total aggregate fair market value of the ring immediately after being placed in the garbage disposal was $30. Subsequently, William purchased a ring for $169.50 and gave the ring to Nancy.|$|R
50|$|At the hospital, Julien enters Lisa's {{room and}} has the guards {{disarmed}} while he retrieves his wife. They return to the hotel room, where Lisa is reunited with Oscar. The family then leaves France and arrives at Liège Airport in Belgium. Back at a police precinct, Julien's mind map is reassembled from the <b>garbage</b> <b>recovered,</b> but detectives decide {{it is too late}} to continue their pursuit, as the Auclers have fled to San Salvador, El Salvador, Central America.|$|R
50|$|Unlike C, C++, or Pascal, {{there is}} no {{explicit}} representation of pointers in Java. Instead, more complex data structures like objects and arrays are implemented using references. The language does not provide any explicit pointer manipulation operators. It is still possible for code to attempt to dereference a null reference (null pointer), however, which results in a run-time exception being thrown. The space occupied by unreferenced memory objects is <b>recovered</b> automatically by <b>garbage</b> collection at run-time.|$|R
50|$|In his lawsuit, Anderson {{stated that}} after the museum fire, the fire area was roped off {{immediately}} and the only people allowed inside were museum employees and emergency personnel. When the fire investigation ended and the displays that could be <b>recovered</b> were removed, <b>garbage</b> trucks were sent in {{to pick up the}} remaining debris. Anderson claimed that the burned debris and ashes were being discarded by the museum, so anything within these would be considered forfeited and unclaimed, and therefore public property.|$|R
50|$|Waste {{compaction}} is {{the process}} of compacting waste, reducing it in size. Garbage compactors and waste collection vehicles compress waste so that more of it can be stored in the same space. Waste is compacted again, more thoroughly, at the landfill to conserve valuable airspace and to extend the landfill's life span. A side effect of this is that important items, like evidence in a crime, may be difficult to <b>recover</b> from the <b>garbage.</b> Due to reduced oxygenation, biodegradation of organic waste is also slowed.|$|R
50|$|Five {{people were}} killed in total: the three aircrew members, a company {{security}} guard on the flight, and the man in the parking lot. In the minutes following the crash, police were alerted to a fire at NW 72nd Ave, only to discover it was a plane crash. For nearly 45 minutes, mixed reports claimed the plane was a passenger flight, but within the hour the control tower at MIA confirmed it was Fine Air Cargo Flight 101. FAA Security Special Agents working out of an office on airport property (at that time) responded to the scene and simultaneously to the Fine Air Cargo offices where they took possession of the flight documentation. Some relevant documentation were <b>recovered</b> from <b>garbage</b> receptacles causing a criminal investigation to be opened and ultimately leading to charges including destruction and covering up of evidence. Fine Air and their ground handling agent Aeromar Airlines plead guilty to several of the charges and were fined approximately $5 million.|$|R
40|$|I {{present the}} problem of client object cache lockup in a {{distributed}} object-oriented database system where storage is <b>recovered</b> by <b>garbage</b> collection. If garbage collection is augmented {{with the ability to}} discard reachable unmodified versions of persistent objects, cache lockup is greatly reduced. I outline some remaining questions about this technique for managing an object cache. 1 Introduction In a distributed object-oriented database system, server machines store persistent objects shared by applications running on client machines. When an application invokes an operation on a persistent object, that operation must run on either the server or client. I consider the case where objects are moved or copied to the client for at least the duration of the client transaction. A number of existing object-oriented databases work partially or entirely in this mode of executing operations on the client machine: examples are O 2 [1], GemStone [2, 9], and Orion [7]. 2 Complicating factors The [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{records of}} Brassicaceae in archaeological sites of Emilia Romagna Region are rather scarce at Roman Period, while {{increasing}} in the Middle Ages (10 th – 15 th cent. AD). Indeed, many seeds of Brassica sp. pl. (approximately from 10 to 1500 seeds per liter) were <b>recovered</b> from <b>garbage</b> of kitchen, garden or craft activities (unpublished data) from two urban sites (Ferrara and Lugo, near Ravenna). Archeobotanical seeds were identified (Brassica cf. juncea, B. napus, B. nigra, B. cf. oleracea, B. rapa) and then analyzed {{to find any}} traces of aDNA (by Simona De Felice during PhD of Aberystwyth University, UK) using several precautionary measures to prevent exogenous contamination: a) seeds with unbroken integument were treated with UV light to break and immobilize any contaminant DNA present on seed coat surface; b) DNA extractions were made on internal seed tissues that had been isolated from their surrounding seed coat under a sterile dissecting microscope; c) DNA extractions and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) were performed under sterile conditions (sterilized laminar flow hood), using pipettes with filter tips and in a different building from that where modern Brassica samples were routinely analysed. In total DNA of 325 seeds was extracted an approximately a third (98) of such samples were able to generate sequences. The results of genetic analysis confirm the Brassica genus to 97 %, with a dominance of B. nigra...|$|R
5000|$|For {{environments that}} print {{confidential}} or secret documents, a dye-sublimation printer {{is a potential}} security risk that must be handled carefully. Due to the mechanism of printing, a perfect color-separated negative image of the printed page is created on the supply roll color panels, and the [...] "waste roll" [...] of dye panels can be unrolled to see everything that has been printed with the printer. For such environments, the waste roll should be shredded or incinerated onsite rather than simply being discarded in the trash. Also, for home users, the waste roll from a photo printer can be similarly <b>recovered</b> from the <b>garbage</b> and used to see everything that has been printed. Since the supply roll is plastic, the lifespan of a used roll can be years or decades long, permitting image recovery long after disposal.|$|R
