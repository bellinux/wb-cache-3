40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{revolving}} restaurant perceived as an optical device, where the attributes of elevated view combined with mechanical motion evoke a cinematic experience. By tracing the revolving restaurant’s cine-dream and panoramic desire through a genealogy of the moving and projected image, the 360 -degree <b>revolving</b> <b>view</b> is proposed as “readymade cinema” or cinéma trouvé—a specific cinematic experience outside the normative cinematic apparatus. The thesis will start with excavating {{the roots of the}} moving and projected image, from the Italian vedutas, the Claude glass and the picturesque gardens of the early 18 th century through the development of immersive image practices such as the Panorama and Diorama and the coming of modernism with urbanization, ferro-vitreous architecture and the development of the railway and tourism. This leads up to various moving image experiments and the early days of film production, including panorama films and immersive viewing practices, media architecture and postindustrial control. Ultimately, this is a reflection on basic questions in relation to moving images, noopolitics and visual perception. The intension is to open up a possible strand of resistance in the increasingly dominant audio-visual culture of our time...|$|R

Of these, 172 news items were inductively analysed into themes, in order to examine in more detail how weekend reporting functions in British newspapers. Findings suggest ongoing differences in the reporting of female and male athletes, particularly in photographic representations of women in sport. Publishing news and photographs of women not related to sport is an original dimension to this investigation, and specific to weekend sports reporting. Moreover, results indicate that Sunday newspapers promote 'the weekend' as a male entity which <b>revolves</b> around <b>viewing</b> sports with other men.

40|$|Is musical meaning {{reducible}} {{to knowledge}} {{of the structure of}} the music, and is this to be conveyed in logocentric or logogenic terms— assuming that its meaning is conducive to verbal description— or should we conceive of musical meaning in musicogenic terms, with music having properties that refer mainly to the music (Tagg, 2013) ? Is music- structural knowledge to be equated with pre- existing concepts and labels that are assigned to the sonorous unfolding, or should we rely on moment- to-moment experience of the unfolding through time? It is the main distinction between the lexico- semantic and the experiential approach, which has its conceptual grounding in the discrete/continuous dichotomy. Much research on musical meaning has focused rather narrowly on the lexico- semantic dimensions of conceptualization, equating sense- making with a logocentric view on music cognition. It is the goal of this chapter to argue against this narrow view and to consider music knowledge construction from an enactive point of <b>view.</b> <b>Revolving</b> around perception- action loops and sensorimotor couplings, it offers a theoretical framework that is grounded in the concept of circularity between an organism and its environment in an attempt to provide a descriptive and explanatory theory in which the role of functional significance in knowledge construction is emphasized on the basis of deictic, enactive, ecological, and biosemiotic claims. Music knowledge construction, in this view, must go beyond a conception of passive information pickup in favor of a definition of the listener as an adaptive device that generates appropriate behavior in reaction to the continuous changes in its internal and external state. As such, it stresses the role of adaptive knowledge construction in a way that perception and action are linked in a continuous process of sense- making and interaction with the environment. These interactions can be manifest— as in processes of sensorimotor integration (such as playingn instrument or singing) —or virtual (with movements simulated merely at the level of imagery) with a gradual shift from presentational immediacy to symbolic representation of the sounds. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} lower {{secondary}} teachers‟ beliefs about {{and awareness of}} their own use of varieties of English related to their classroom practices. The study also <b>revolves</b> around teachers‟ <b>views</b> on students‟ language production related to English varieties. This was investigated through a survey, interview and observation, where respectively 89, seven and two teachers participated. The reason for choosing this topic was that the current curriculum The Knowledge Promotion does not explicitly address {{the large amount of}} varieties of English that exists with respect to what is expected of either teachers or students. The purpose of this thesis was therefore to gain an insight into how lower secondary school teachers‟ handle the many existing „Englishes‟ related to their own language use and their classroom practices. The data material from the survey and the interviews formed a solid basis for saying something about teachers‟ use of and views on English varieties. The teachers who participated in my research project are not fully consistent in their language production with respect to spelling and choice of words. In other words, they incorporate elements from more than one language norm when communicating in English. Yet they want their students to be consistent both when speaking and writing English – with an emphasis on written English, which suggests that teachers themselves are not sufficiently aware of their own switching between different language norms. The teachers acknowledge that their first language is a natural part of their second language too, but the majority of them characterize their English as close to either British English, American English or a combination of these two. It seems that the teachers want their students to choose the variety of English they are going to practice themselves, but the tendency is that the choice is limited to either British English or American English. The teachers recognize that the main goal of teaching English is that the students should learn to communicate in English in a comprehensible way. Meanwhile, they want to reduce the influence the Norwegian language has on students‟ English pronunciation, where students‟ Norwegian dialects are particularly described as problematic...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Marketing Management) Abstract: The {{growth of}} {{self-service}} technologies within {{the airline industry}} has been a prominent trend within the global airline industry with continued investment in the area. The growth of self-service technologies {{in the airline industry}} has been driven jointly by rising passenger demand for improved services and by the potential value they provide relating to cost saving, reduced waiting times, and reduced space requirements. The value provided by self-service technologies from a cost saving and service point of <b>view</b> <b>revolves</b> around the removal of the service employee from the service process, which allows the airline industry to experience cost efficiencies and provide a superior level of service. This service enhancement is manifested in self-service technologies’ ability to make the consumer a productive resource in the service delivery process, where self-service technologies can be designed specifically to meet the changing needs of consumers. Self-service technologies within the airline industry have traditionally manifested in the form of self-check-in kiosks and online websites, but recent trends have seen a shift towards the implementation of airline mobile applications. This shift has been widespread with over 95 percent of airports investing in mobile application technology. These mobile applications can provide a whole host of service options previously not available to passengers such as electronic boarding passes, live flight status updates, and baggage tracking. Despite the widespread investment in airline mobile applications and the numerous benefits they provide, consumer adoption has been a major concern. An understanding of passengers’ readiness to adopt and perceptions towards airline mobile applications is important when developing the technology and designing communication strategies that can overcome the current barriers to adoption. This study investigated passengers’ current levels of technology readiness, and perceptions of usefulness and ease of use towards airline mobile applications using the updated technology readiness and acceptance model (TRAM 2. 0). The primary research objective was thus to determine passengers’ level of technology readiness, and their perceptions of mobile applications in the airline industry and their adoption thereof. An exploratory research design was used in the study where data was collected using a predetermined questionnaire. Respondents who were current South African citizens and who had travelled on a commercial airline in the last 12 months were {{invited to participate in the}} study.

Vare sig det handlar om vad du ska äta till lunch eller huruvida en storhamn skall byggas vilar detta handlande på ett bakomliggande beslut. Studien syftar till att undersöka beslutet kring att bygga en ny hamn utanför Nynäshamn. Studiens utgångspunkt stöptes i intresset för rationalitetsbegreppets varande eller icke varande i stora infrastrukturprojekt som påverkar hela samhällen. Angreppssättet som använts för att delge förståelse kring hur beslutsprocessen gått till är en kvalitativ textanalys, närmare bestämt argumentationsanalys enligt Lennart Hellspongs definition. Vidare har studien diskuterat ämnet i en teoretisk diskussion som kretsar kring begreppet rationalitet i olika former. Den teoretiska referensramen består av rationalitet inom beslut och organisationer diskuterat av Simon, March och Cyert, handlingsrationalitet och beslutsrationalitet enligt Brunsson, institutionell teori, groupthink och samhällsplanering.

40|$|Age at the {{initiation}} of puberty and at menarche are key maturational indicators. They reflect health both within and between populations; in that a declining average age is associated with improving health, nutrition, and socio-economic conditions. Knowledge of the timing of pubertal development and menarche is important as earlier development within a population, in particular, has been linked with {{an increased risk of}} negative sequelae including overweight and obesity, development of risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and insulin resistance, and engagement in risk behaviours such as early sexual debut and substance abuse. The main aims of this study were to investigate the timing of, and the early life factors (such as body composition and growth velocities) associated with pubertal development and age at menarche in Black and White urban South African adolescents. Mixed-longitudinal data (n = 401) from the Birth to Twenty (Bt 20) birth-cohort study, initiated in 1990 and set in SowetoJohannesburg, South Africa were used. Median age at the initation of puberty and at menarche was derived by fitting logistic curves to cumulative frequency plots. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the early life predictors of the timing of puberty and menarche. Data were also collected from adolescents and Bt 20 staff (n = 72) using focus groups to explore views on the pubertal development questionnaire used in the Bt 20 study. Median age at {{the initiation}} of genitalia development was 10. 4 years (95 % Cl = 8. 4, 12. 4) for Black boys and 9. 8 years (95 % Cl = 9. 4, 10. 2) for White boys. Median age for {{the initiation of}} pubic hair development for Black males was 10. 8 years (95 % Cl = 9. 6, 12. 0) compared to White males, which was 10. 2 years (95 % Cl = 8. 4, 12. 0). Median age at the initiation of breast development in Black females was 10. 1 years (95 % Cl = 9. 3, 10. 9) compared to White females which was 10. 2 years (95 % Cl = 8. 2, 12. 2). Median age for the initiation of pubic hair was 10. 3 years (95 % Cl = 9. 3, 11. 3) and 10. 5 years (95 % Cl = 8. 7, 12. 3) for Black and White girls, respectively. Results from logistic regression showed that a greater weight and height velocity in late childhood significantly increased the odds of achieving early breasU genitalia development. Furthermore, a low socio-economic status (SES) index at 9 / 10 years significantly reduced the odds of achieving early breasUgenitalia development. A greater weight, height, body mass index (BM I), and growth rate during infancy and childhood significantly increased the odds of achieving early pubic hair development. Median age at menarche for Black females was 12. 4 years (95 % Cl = 12. 2, 12. 6) and 12. 5. years (95 % Cl = 11. 7, 13. 3) for White females. Average menarcheal age for Black girls has declined by 0. 56 years per decade and 0. 32 years for White girls in South Africa, when comparing the current study findings with those from previous studies. Results from logistic regression showed that being taller, fatter and heavier in late childhood significantly increased the odds of achieving earlier menarche. The focus groups provided a range of opinions relating to the Bt 20 pubertal development questionnaire and procedure. The majority of views were positive and included the ease of understanding and completion of the tool. Negative <b>views</b> <b>revolved</b> around the language used and privacy issues. These qualitative results provided a unique insight into the way in which pubertal development data are assessed and how these methods can potentially be improved to enhance the reliability and accuracy of pubertal development data collection. The results from this study provide the most recent estimates of age at the. initiation of puberty and age at menarche for urban Black and White South African adolescents. This is particularly important given the social, nutritional, and economic transition currently occurring in this country as these key maturity indicators reflect population health. This study has also added to our knowledge of the factors that are associated with pubertal development, showing that proximate rather than distal factors are the most sensitive indicators in this urban transitioning environment. In addition, the results from the focus groups provided a unique insight into how pubertal development data are assessed and how these methods could be improved. The negative health outcomes which have been associated with earlier pubertal development and age at menarche are major public health concerns, particularly in the South African context given the HIV/AIDS epidemic and rising levels of obesity. This study highlights the need for renewed research and resources for intervention strategies and policy programmes which target appropriate sex and obesity education in urban South African children.

G drafts a will with the following clause in order to protect his property and S from her creditors: I bequeath my entire estate to my spouse on the condition that should she be an unrehabilitated insolvent at my demise, I bequeath my entire estate to my administrators in trust until such time that she is rehabilitated. G passes away while S is still an unrehabilitated insolvent. The question arises if an insolvent heir {{is in a position to}} repudiate an inheritance, as the repudiation will result therein that the inheritance will not form part of the assets in the insolvent's estate. The aim of this study is twofold. The legal position of the testator, the heir and creditors will firstly be analysed critically. Thereafter the possible measures available to a testator, which will ensure that he will be able to satisfy the needs of his heirs, will be highlighted. In order to attain the aims of the study, focus is placed on the following aspects: * Freedom of testation: Although a testator has freedom of testation, this right is not absolute. Care should therefore be taken that due consideration be given to the limitations on his freedom of testation, be it statutory or by common law. * Vesting of rights: The nature of the right acquired by an heir on the death of the testator has been the object of much debate in South African case law. The conflicting <b>views</b> <b>revolve</b> around the question whether any right is acquired and if so whether such right can only be qualified as a contingent right. It is suggested that the correct position is that an heir does require a right to an inheritance, but that the nature of the right is contingent. * Conditions and terms: The testator is able to postpone dies cedit andlor dies venit. He achieves this by imposing conditions on his bequests or by fixing terms. Conditions and terms may be suspensive or resolusive. The resolusive condition and term result therein that rights which have been acquired fall away with retrospective effect. The nudum praeceprum, as a veiled resolusive condition, has no legal force and should be avoided at all costs by the testator. * Adiation and repudiation: Although no person can be forced to accept an inheritance, it is trite law that adiation is automatic unless the bequest is subject to a modus. Furthermore it is also accepted that adiation is not a prerequisite for the vesting of rights. * Legislation and case law: The relevant provisions of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 are sections 2, 20 and 26. Section 2 defines property as, inter alia, contingent interests in property, with the exclusion of the contingent interests of fideicommissary heir or legatee. Furthermore disposition is defined inter alia as an abandonment of rights to property. The effect of section 20 is that an insolvent is divested of his estate on the granting of a sequestration order, whereafter the estate will vest in the trustee. Disposition without value may be set aside on application in terms of section 26. It is submitted that the provisions of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 are wide enough to cover the repudiation of an inheritance by an insolvent heir. Accordingly such repudiation should therefore be a disposition without value which may be set aside. South African courts had the opportunity on numerous occasions to decide whether an inheritance falls in an insolvent's estate or not. Conflicting judgments were put to a rest by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Wessels v De Jager 2000 4 SA 924. The court decided that an heir does not have a right to adiate or repudiate an inheritance. The heir merely exercises an ability to dispose of the inheritance and as such the provisions of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 have no application. The decision of the court is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, but will stand as the law of the land until similar facts are decided but the Supreme Court of Appeal or until the legislator intervenes. The South African Law Commission in consultation with various parties have proposed a draft Insolvency Act. The proposed amendments of value for this study are that contingent interest of fideicommissary heirs and legatees will no longer be excluded from the definition of property and that the court will be endowed with a discretion to decide if an insolvent acted to the detriment of creditors. When the position of S in the hypothesis is analysed it may be concluded that the bequest is subject to a nudum praeceptum and the resolusive condition should be disregarded. In line with the decision in Wessels v De Jager 2000 SA 934 (SCA), S will be able to repudiate the inheritance. This course of action is unsatisfactory in that the aims of the testator are frustrated, S derives no benefit from her action and similarly creditors are denied the benefit of an additional asset in the insolvent estate. Alternative estate planning measures are available to the testator. The trust, be it a testamentary discretionary trust or a trust inter vivos, is preferable to a fideicommissum. The matrimonial property regime adopted by spouses before marriage can also have a positive influence on estate planning. In conclusion it is submitted that intervention by the legislator is required to attain a balance between the rights of the testator, insolvent heirs and creditors. Through estate planning-methods it will be within the power of the testator to avoid conflicting interests of the testator, the insolvent heir and creditors. Master...|$|R
40|$|Väitöskirja on ensimmäinen tutkimus, jossa kirjailija Lassi Nummen runotuotanto on kokonaisuudessaan tarkastelun kohteena. Aineistona on 21 runokokoelmaa ja kolme yhteisnidettä. Tutkimus keskittyy Nummen runojen puukuvastoon. Puukuvaston avulla käsitellään kaikkia Nummen tuotannon keskeisiä teemoja. Runojen puut taipuvat niin ajan kokemisen, kuoleman jäsentämisen kuin metafyysisen oivalluksen vertauksiksi. Toisinaan puu esitetään esimerkiksi inhimillisenä. Taustalla on myös tunnistettavaa puuaiheista symboliikkaa Raamatusta ja antiikin kirjallisuudesta. Nummen runoissa on kerroksellinen ja monisyinen viittausverkosto esimerkiksi taiteeseen ja mytologiaan. Poliittisten allegorioiden puut sitovat runon aiheen historialliseen viitetapahtumaan. Väitöskirjan tavoite on selvittää, mitä eri tehtäviä puun käytöllä on runoissa ja miten puukuvasto rakentuu näihin tehtäviin sopivaksi. Näkökulmia saadaan esimerkiksi ympäristöestetiikasta, uskontotieteistä tai ajan filosofisista pohdinnoista sen mukaan, mitä puu kulloisessakin esiintymisyhteydessä kuvaa. Kielikuvien analyysillä osoitetaan merkityksenmuodostumisen keinot sekä muotoillaan tulokset tulkinnoiksi. Keskeiset teoriat ja menetelmät liittyvät metaforisuuteen. Tutkimuksen työkaluksi hahmotellaan uusi semanttisen yhteisalueen käsite. Semanttinen yhteisalue pohjautuu metaforisissa ilmauksissa tapahtuvaan merkitysten limittymiseen ja sen kautta syntyvään mielikuvaan samankaltaisuudesta. Metodina semanttinen yhteisalue palvelee sekä puukuvaston rakenteen erittelyä että merkityksenmuodostumisen analyysia. Lisäksi sen kautta voidaan perustella temaattisia tulkintoja. Semanttisen yhteisalueen mallia on mahdollista hyödyntää laajemminkin kielikuvien tutkimisessa. Branching meanings. Tree {{imagery in}} the poetic works of Lassi Nummi My {{doctoral}} thesis {{is the first}} one to examine the poetic works of Lassi Nummi, a Finnish modern poet, as a whole. My source material consists of 20 poetic works and three volumes of collected poems, in which the works are included with minor alterations. In my study, I shall focus on such poems in Nummi´s works in which trees either are a central theme or appear otherwise. Selecting tree imagery as the object of my study is justified by the frequency of how often trees appear in the source material: they are a repeating theme and stand out in Nummi´s lyric poetry. All the central themes of Nummi´s works are dealt with tree imagery. Trees often occupy a central role in building up the poems´ theme and meaning. The tree imagery entails the concrete occurrences of trees in the description of landscape or scenery, various tropes of trees, and the symbolic dimension associated with trees. My research problem is to identify the different functions the use of trees occupies in Nummi´s poems and to analyse how the tree imagery is structured to match these functions. The goal of my thesis is to explain the network of meanings trees possess in Nummi´s poetic works. By analysing tropes, it is possible to identify how the meaning builds up from individual components. Based on the results, it is possible to both identify the meanings and to formulate the actual interpretations based on the meanings. The key concepts of my study are tied with the metaphorical properties of language and their manifestations. I begin by looking at the history of research into metaphorical expressions as well as the central issues of each approach. I then proceed to formulate the concept of common semantic ground for the purposes of my study based on the various scientific views on metaphors. In formulating the concept of common semantic ground, I have paid attention to both how the concepts are argumented and how they relate to earlier views. Additionally, I have exemplified how my concept can be structured into graphical representations. Based on these definitions, I have then proceeded to apply my concept in a more detailed analysis of the source material. The common semantic ground is based on both the overlapping fields of meanings in the metaphorical expressions and on the idea of similarity, which is established through analogies in the contrasted phenomena. A well-established paradigm about the relationship between the vehicle and tenor exists in the study of metaphor, but there have been few attempts to establish patterns of analysis in the study of metaphorical properties of a language. The vehicle and tenor are conjoined by their overlapping fields of meanings, which I call the common semantic ground. This common ground contains those elements from both the source and target domains that enable a both meaningful connection and the mapping between the two domains. For example, in the expression "puu ojennetuin käsin"(cf. "a tree with outstretched arms"), the metaphor connects tree and man and the common semantic ground is the set of properties shared by both concepts that enable the connection. As metaphorical items, the boughs of a tree and the arms of a man are portrayed as analogous. As a method the common semantic ground serves not only the closer representation of the use of tree imagery, but also the analysis of constructing metaphor´s meaning. Additionally, it can also be used as a means to argument thematic interpretations via the different layers of the component parts in the imagery. Although the goal of my thesis is not theoretical- methodological, {{it is likely that the}} concept of common semantic ground can also be applied more extensively in the analysis of tropes. The theoretical foundation of my study draws from multiple, comparatively different disciplines. The central sources draw from literature studies and linguistics as well as from theme-specific sources. The theme-specific sources are chosen based on the way trees in the source material form a figurative expression which spans to structure multiple themes. Consequently, relevant views can also be gained from environmental aesthetics, studies of religious and spiritual, and the philosophies contemporary to Nummi based on what trees symbolise in each particular context. My study is organised into themes. The disposition stems from the source material: the poems have been divided into thematical sections based on the meanings and contents the trees convey in each theme. These themes are the various functions of trees as part of the landscape (e. g. as the poem´s point of spatial reference, pointer of geographical location, and as the structuring agent of observation hierarchy), tree as an image of man, the spiritual and metaphysical meanings, the metaphors used to concretise time and death as well as the esthetical, political and national dimensions of the tree imagery. One of the key findings is that the number and frequency of how often the tree imagery occurs in the various collected works as well as the ways of usage vary between the different poetic works. There can also be considerable variation inside each works. Additionally, the poems may also carry conventional meanings associated with trees in earlier literature and other cultures. The tree imagery in Nummi´s poems lends itself to metaphorical expressions of experiencing time, understanding death, and expressions of metaphorical perceptions. Also conventional tree symbolism can be identified in the background. This introduces its own dimension into the various meanings of the poems. Meanings stemming from different origins can for example juxtapose each other or form multiple layers in the imagery. In a number of cases, the tree imagery has its roots in the trees familiar to us from the Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman traditions. The poems have a layered and multidimensional network of references to for example arts, history and mythology. In Nummi´s later works, trees often coexist simultaneously as parts of the physical nature and the metaphysical dimension. At times, the tree imagery gains cumulating layers of meanings. This is the case in the ekphrasis-poems, in which a visual tree portrayed in a painting also becomes the foundation of the poem´s metaphor. The various motives stemming from the work of art may reside only as components of the description of the physical world, or deepen into the seed image of the poem´s metaphors. Innovative uses of tree imagery are for example the walk towards the birch woods: the steps across the meadow deepen into a spiritual-metaphysical life´s journey, or the trees of political allegories which tie the poem to a concrete event in history. In many of Nummi´s poems, the way of perceiving the trees has a central role in their description. At times, trees are portrayed through an unusual experience as e. g. animalistic or cognitive. The lyrical self judges and applies subjective interpretations to observations and builds a subjective mental landscape based on the observations. Descriptions of nature and scenery deepen into new kind of seeing: themes <b>revolving</b> around world <b>views,</b> emotional states and different meditations are reflected in the landscape that deepens into metaphysical. Some of the poems are purely visual recordings of feelings and impressions of nature. In places, the tree forms the central theme for poems sharing common imagery, or it joins several themes into a coherent set. It is not possible to clearly separate the tree imagery into concrete flora or trees used metaphorically. Images following each other inside the same poem shift between the concrete and abstract layers. The same tree can alternatively or simultaneously be a physical tree, a component of a new metaphorical phrase, or a conventional symbol. The different layers of imagery do not necessarily exclude each other, even if one of the layers was to gain a dominant role in their interpretation. The metafictional analysis of tropes is manifested in different ways. Some of the tropes contain clichéd verbal imagery that is perhaps used in a parodical sense, and which both seeks playfully bombastic tones and tries to convey an image of spontaneous experience. Some poems identify alternative interpretations for the metaphorical expressions or deny the meaning of conventional expressions altogether. Tropes are also named, and analysing their themes introduces a new metalyrical layer in the poem. Additionally, the poems can contain explicit commentary on the limitations of conventional metaphors while suggesting new, alternative meanings. I conclude with an observation that very different means of metaphorical expression can revert back to certain basic components. These can be for example linguistic associations, parallels of individual properties, or direct identification. Poems with similar expressional structure produce different contents; same phrases gain different meanings and selecting different vehicles can still represent the same tenor. Additionally, joint metaphorical variants, which conjoin two or more metaphorical expressions, are constructed. All of the above results in a rich and complex set of metaphorical connections in the tree imagery...|$|R
