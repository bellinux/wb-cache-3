5|$|Paragon {{implemented}} additional {{changes in}} preparation for the game's publication in the United Kingdom by its European distributor, Empire Software. On the basis of criticism generated upon the game's initial release, the user interface was <b>retooled</b> to provide the player with greater ability to control the game with a mouse and the realistic inertia-based thrust model of spaceship flight was replaced.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} sign coveted free agents Deron Williams and Steve Nash, the Mavericks <b>retooled</b> their roster by {{letting go of}} Jason Kidd, Jason Terry and Brendan Haywood, and {{acquiring}} younger players such as O. J. Mayo, Darren Collison, as well as veteran big men Chris Kaman and Elton Brand. Nowitzki plans to play out {{the remainder of his}} 4-year, 80 million dollar contract that expires in 2014. Nowitzki underwent knee surgery in October 2012 and missed the first 27 games of the season. He returned on December 23, 2012, in a game against San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was designed for}} mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed {{over the course of}} four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately <b>retooled</b> into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|E
5|$|<b>ReTool</b> {{bought and}} sold used tools. Winmark opened the first <b>ReTool</b> on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of <b>ReTool's</b> goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that many people did not sell tools they did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at <b>ReTool.</b> Winmark sold <b>ReTool</b> around 2002.|$|R

40|$|Application of robot {{simulation}} and off-line {{programming for}} <b>retooling</b> of flexible production lines in car manufacturing. An efficient CAD/CAM-based <b>retooling</b> of robot production cells requires suitable concepts for industrial utilisation, for the CAD/CAM-system and its simulation models. The utilisation {{of this new}} technology for <b>retooling</b> of robot cells is described. The CAD/CAM-System ensures a continous usage of data by an integrated CAD/CAM-data base and by extendable system functionalities. The described model concept realises precise simulation results by controller specific models...|$|R
5|$|George {{was invited}} to meet with Grey's Anatomy {{executive}} producers after the show's casting agents saw her in the 2008 television drama, In Treatment. The actress' original contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances in season five, {{with the possibility of}} becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic foil for Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), but the role was <b>retooled</b> after the former departed in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were <b>retooled</b> to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E
5|$|Angel of Darkness was {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team <b>retooled</b> the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E

5|$|The Dalton {{character}} {{was created for}} All That Glitters, a planned spin-off series from Knight Rider, and a backdoor pilot aired as a second-season episode of that series in 1984. The character, originally a suave government agent, was <b>retooled</b> as a lone drifter for a new pilot, which aired as the television movie Code of Vengeance, to surprise ratings success in June 1985. A subsequent series, to be called Dalton, was ordered by NBC for midseason, then production was cancelled after just four episodes were completed. These aired {{in the summer of}} 1986 as a television movie titled Dalton: Code of Vengeance II and {{as a part of a}} fill-in series called Dalton's Code of Vengeance.|$|E
5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and <b>retooled</b> with a new paint facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{commissioned}} by Warner Bros. Television in 2007 as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes. Alex O'Loughlin, Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were cast in the lead roles, and Rod Holcomb was hired as director. David Greenwalt joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer with Joel Silver; however, health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series. All of the original actors, apart from the male lead role, were recast in June 2007, and Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a <b>retooled,</b> full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot.|$|E

5|$|The studio {{released}} Meet the Robinsons in 2007, {{its second}} all-CGI film, earning $169.3 million worldwide. That same year, DisneyToon Studios was also restructured {{and began to}} operate as a separate unit under Lasseter and Catmull's control. Lasseter's direct intervention with the studio's next film, American Dog, resulted in the departure of director Chris Sanders, {{who went on to}} become a director at DreamWorks Animation. The film was <b>retooled</b> by new directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams as Bolt, which was released in 2008 and had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since Lilo & Stitch, and became a moderate financial success.|$|E
5|$|Within the Woods {{was later}} <b>retooled</b> by Raimi with a vastly higher {{production}} value and a full-length running {{time as the}} 1981 film The Evil Dead. The Evil Dead {{would go on to}} be the first installment of a film franchise spawning two sequels, Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992), both of which were directed by Raimi and featured Campbell as Ash Williams. A remake, known as Evil Dead, was released in 2013 with Raimi and Campbell as producers and creative consultants. In 2015, the Starz television network began airing the ongoing comedy horror series Ash vs Evil Dead, which features Bruce Campbell returning as an older Ash Williams.|$|E

5|$|Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a {{platforming}} and action-adventure {{video game}} developed by Westone {{as part of}} Sega's Wonder Boy series. It was published by Sega and released for the Sega Master System in 1989 and for the Game Gear in 1992 as Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. It was ported by Hudson Soft in 1991(1990 in North America) and was released for the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine under the name Dragon's Curse. It was also ported in 1993 by Brazilian company Tec Toy under the title Turma da Mônica em o Resgate, with the game <b>retooled</b> to include characters from Brazilian comic book series Monica's Gang (Turma da Mônica). A remake developed by Lizardcube and published by DotEmu, titled , was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|Dead Phoenix {{was going}} to be a 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been <b>retooled</b> as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E
5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was <b>retooled</b> to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E

5|$|Shonen Jump, officially stylized SHONEN JUMP and {{abbreviated}} SJ, is a shōnen manga anthology {{published in}} North America by Viz Media. It debuted in November 2002 {{with the first}} issue having a January 2003 cover date. Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, Shonen Jump is <b>retooled</b> for English readers and the American audience, including changing it from a weekly publication to a monthly one. It features serialized chapters from four manga series, and articles on Japanese language and culture, as well as manga, anime, video games, and figurines. Prior to the magazine's launch, Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote it and help it succeed where previous manga anthologies published in North America had failed. Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz to help fund the venture, and Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors became promotional partners in the magazine.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} {{has been}} compared to Sailor Moon due to both having female protagonists; five original team members with signature colors and powers, and similar plot lines. Tokyo Mew Mew received high ratings in Japan with extensive merchandizing tie ins and marketing events to promote the series. When 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime, heavily edited and localized, fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series. After previews of the <b>retooled</b> series were released, viewers were less disappointed, but still annoyed by the cultural shifting and still desired an uncut DVD release. Mew Mew Power became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids, becoming the highest rated 4Kids show {{at the start of the}} fall 2005 season, but it was never released to DVD in North America. The 4Kids dub, rather than original Japanese version, was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece, South Africa and Israel.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} renamed Moonlight when {{picked up by}} CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the upfronts. David Greenwalt, creator of Miracles and co-creator of Angel, joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and {{executive}} producer alongside Silver. CBS hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson, however health reasons forced {{him to leave the}} series, and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007. All of the original actors save for the lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a <b>retooled,</b> full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. To promote the series, Silver, {{along with the rest of}} the main cast, attended the Comic-Con International in San Diego on July 27, 2007, where the show was featured.|$|E
