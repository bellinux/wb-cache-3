50|$|The insurer {{also has}} a right to {{information}} and assistance from the insured, together with a right to preservation of the claim, which usually {{takes the form of a}} clause in insurance contracts which requires the insured to take the necessary steps to protect the insurer’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>subrogation</b> (even if the requirements for subrogation have not yet been met in full).|$|E
40|$|Subrogation is an {{important}} concept in insurance law. There are several reasons why an insurer that has paid for a loss {{should be allowed to}} recover from those legally responsible. First, the insured is prevented from recovering twice for the same loss, preserving the principle of indemnity. Second, the insurer is reimbursed for the payment it has made. Third, the tort-feasor, who is legally responsible, is prevented from receiving a windfall by being absolved of liability. 2 ̆ 2 Stated simply, subrogation is a creature of equity having for its purpose the working out of an equitable adjustment between the parties by securing the ultimate discharge of a debt by the person who in equity and good conscience ought to pay it. In Stetina v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the Nebraska Supreme Court restricted the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>subrogation</b> on payment of a loss to its insured. If the 2 ̆ 2 no subrogation against insured 2 ̆ 2 rule is interpreted to prevent an insurer from ever having subrogation rights against one insured by it, situations may occur in which the claimant insured is allowed double recovery or where the tort-feasor insured receives the windfall of being absolved of liability, both {{at the expense of the}} insurer...|$|E
40|$|I]f the assured is not {{entitled}} to retain an excess against the insurer, and the insurer … is not entitle to receive the excess from the assured, {{what happens to the}} excess?” This question, posed by Lord Justice Megaw in L. Lucas Ltd. v. Export Credits Guarantee Department, is bred by the juxtaposition of two subrogation rules. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>subrogation,</b> being in nature like restitution, entitles the holder of the right only to reimbursement and, under a contract of insurance, “the assured … shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified. ” The confusion that distribution of windfall profits in subrogation has brought to American and English courts derives from both the difficulty of the question and its rarity. Because insurance agreements are contracts of indemnity, the issue of which party is entitled to any possible excess once both the insurer and the insured have been indemnified has seldom been litigated. This comment will evaluate a subrogee’s right to recover more than it paid to the subrogor. The purpose of subrogation and insurance will be outlined, focusing on those few recent cases in England and the United States dealing with the profit-in-subrogation issue. Next, this Comment will examine the circumstances under which a windfall might accrue to the insurer and the possible justifications and consequences of such a windfall award. A flexible approach for courts confronted with allocating a windfall in an equitable subrogation suit will then be proposed. Finally the implications of choosing a flexible approach to windfalls in subrogation will be contrasted with the view that the windfall be awarded strictly to either the insured or the insurer...|$|E

40|$|The Study Group on a European Civil Code has {{presented}} {{a set of}} rules on personal securities. Personal securities for commercial transactions {{play an important role in}} world trade today and inde-pendent securities such as on demand guarantees and stand by let-ters of credit have gained in importance during the last decades. The proposed rules are tested on court cases from Denmark and Sweden. When applied to real cases, the results are very similar to those reached by applying already existing rules on independent securities. If the court found the guarantee to be independent, the same result was reached by applying the rules of DCFR. The weaker part of the proposed rules is the effects of the clas-sifications. The novel approach in DCFR not to establish explicit rules on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> reimbursement and <b>subrogation</b> <b>to</b> other secu-rities when the guarantee is independent, but rather to state that the rules on dependent personal securities should be applied with ap-propriate adaptations, is criticized as too vague...|$|R

5000|$|The {{question}} is what constitutes the [...] "same cause". In Gubisch Maschinenfabrik v Palumbo (1987) (Hartley: 1988) and The Tatry v The Maciej Rataj (1994), the test is whether the factual basis of the claim and the laws to be applied are the same {{with a view to}} obtaining the same basic outcome. The test cannot be formal. It must look to the substance of each claim so that technical or procedural differences cannot be used to justify invoking separate jurisdictions in different Member States. One difficulty has been in rem jurisdiction, e.g. as in shipping law, but the substance test looks behind the res and identifies who the parties are and identifies what their purpose or objects are in the litigation. The parties must also be the same although the roles may be reversed between plaintiff/claimant and defendant (Seatzu: 1999). However, in multi-party actions, the subsequent court is only obliged to decline jurisdiction between the same parties, i.e. new parties may intervene and be heard in subsequent proceedings. But the courts are careful to look at the substance of the relationship between each set of parties. Thus, because an insurer has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use <b>subrogation,</b> the insurer and the insured would be considered the same person since they are both interested in achieving the same outcome. Similarly, a wholly owned subsidiary company can be regarded as the same party as its parent.|$|R

40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} of subrogation. The doctrine of marshalling of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the <b>right</b> of <b>subrogation</b> <b>to</b> the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation. It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the right of subrogation vests in a person (other than a surety) who discharges a third party 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor. It also examines the right of subrogation of a surety who discharges the principal debtor 2 ̆ 7 s debt to the secured creditor. Chapter 5 examines the right of subrogation of a putative lender who purports to lend money to an ultra vires borrower who then uses the proceeds of the putative loan to discharge its intra vires debts. Chapter 6 discusses those situations where a third party payer does not have any <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be subrogated <b>to</b> the (former) <b>right</b> of the payee against the debtor...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 5614 This thesis {{attempts}} {{a thorough}} {{review of the}} law of subrogation as applied in Ireland and England, with reference to the law of other common law jurisdictions and to the views of certain civil law writers. It first introduces the topic and then considers the juridical basis of subrogation. It also attempts to sketch the historical origins and derivation of the modern law of subrogation. Subrogation is generally divided into two categories by civilian and American writers, namely legal subrogation and contractual subrogation. Irish and English courts have not always been careful to make it clear which category they were applying. This has led to considerable confusion and controversy as to the relevance of intention <b>to</b> <b>subrogation.</b> Some authors have laid down the broad proposition that subrogation is a remedy to reverse unjust enrichment and nothing more. This thesis disputes the universal application of the ?restitutionary hypothesis. ...|$|R
