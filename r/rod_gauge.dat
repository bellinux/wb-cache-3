60|$|The latter {{refinement}} cost me {{a separate}} heap of troubles {{on its own}} separate account. What corkscrews did I see the military power bring out against that Bottle; what gimlets, spikes, divining <b>rods,</b> <b>gauges,</b> and unknown tests and instruments! At some places, they persisted in declaring that the wine must not be passed, without being opened and tasted; I, pleading to the contrary, used then to argue the question seated on the Bottle lest they should open it in spite of me. In the southern parts of Italy more violent shrieking, face-making, and gesticulating, greater vehemence of speech and countenance and action, went on about that Bottle than would attend fifty murders in a northern latitude. It raised important functionaries out of their beds, {{in the dead of}} night. I have known half-a-dozen military lanterns to disperse themselves at all points of a great sleeping Piazza, each lantern summoning some official creature to get up, put on his cocked-hat instantly, and come and stop the Bottle. It was characteristic that while this innocent Bottle had such immense difficulty in getting from little town to town, Signor Mazzini and the fiery cross were traversing Italy from end to end.|$|R

2500|$|The {{beginning}} of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets {{are subject to}} use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as [...] "flat weaving". Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as loop weaving. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a <b>gauge</b> <b>rod,</b> creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} wake {{passing on the}} {{showerhead}} film cooling performance of a turbine blade has been investigated experimentally. The experiments were performed in an annular turbine cascade with an upstream rotating row of cylindrical <b>rods.</b> Nickel thin-film <b>gauges</b> {{were used to determine}} local film effectiveness and Nusselt number values for various injectants, blowing ratios, and Strouhal numbers. Results indicated a reduction in film effectiveness with increasing Strouhal number, as well as the expected increase in film effectiveness with blowing ratio. An equation was developed to correlate the span-average film effectiveness data. The primary effect of wake unsteadiness was found to be correlated by a streamwise-constant decrement of 0. 094. St. Steady computations were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental Nusselt numbers, but to overpredict experimental film effectiveness values. This is likely due to the inability to match actual hole exit velocity profiles and the absence of a credible turbulence model for film cooling...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} experimental/numerical {{method for}} determination of constitutive parameters in high strain-rate material models is presented. Impact loading, using moderate projectile velocities {{in combination with}} small specimens (sub mm) facilitate tensional strain rates {{in the order of}} 104 – 105 s− 1. Loading force is measured from one-dimensional wave propagation in a <b>rod</b> using strain <b>gauges</b> and deformation is monitored with a high-speed camera equipped with a microscope lens. A sequence of digital photographs is taken during the impact loading and the plastic deformation history of the specimen is quantified from the photographic record. Estimation of material parameters is performed through so called inverse modelling in which results from repeated FE-simulations are compared with experimental results and a best choice of constitutive parameters is extracted through an iterative optimisation procedure using the simplex method. Results are presented from a preliminary tension test of a mild steel (A 533 B) at a strain rate well over 104 s− 1. The sensitivity of the evaluated material parameters to errors in measured quantities is studied. The method, especially the optical technique for measurement of deformation will be further developed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} three new music controllers, each {{designed to be}} played by two players. As the intimacy between two people increases so does their ability to anticipate and predict the other's actions. We hypothesize that this intimacy between two people {{can be used as}} a basis for new controllers for musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid <b>rod</b> with strain <b>gauges</b> and position sensors to track the rod's position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players...|$|R
40|$|Drill rod noise {{has become}} a major noise source in percussive drilling. Generation of {{flexural}} waves, which seem to be responsible for most of the noise, is studied in a model with dynamic photoelasticity and in the real drill <b>rod</b> with strain <b>gauge</b> technique. The effect of the holder of the drill rod is investigated, and it is found, that the amplitudes of the flexural waves can be decreased by introducing visco-elastic damping material in the holder. It is also shown, that this will decrease the emitted noise. Generation and propagation of turbulent spots on a water table are studied. A new photographic technique is developed to register structures within the spot. Streaks elongated in the streamwise direction are found to penetrate the spot, and it is observed that undulations on the streaks lead to chaotic motion. Comparisons with theory show that the theory accounts fairly well for the spreading angle, whereas the propagation speeds are larger than the observed values. Tape-recordings of test subjects before and after a 5 -day voice training program are analysed to find objective measures of changes in the voice. Frequency analysis shows, that the fundamental frequency and the variation are increased. It is also shown that the amplitude of the formants above 1000 Hz are increased compared to those below 1000 Hz. Godkänd; 1983; 20070502 (ysko...|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets {{are subject to}} use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory {{about the origin of}} the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”. Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces soumak, and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a <b>gauge</b> <b>rod,</b> creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Typically, hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to derive an {{analytical}} model for a center of gravity (CG) measuring platform and examines its validity through experimental testing and Finite Element Modeling. The method uses a two-stage platform tilting process to first locate the planar CG coordinates and then find the third CG coordinate normal to the platform. An uncertainty model of the measuring platform was also developed, both CG and uncertainty models were implemented {{in the form of}} a MATLAB code. A load cell sizing task was also added to the code to assist the Integration Engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in selecting load cells to design their own version of the CG Platform. The constructed CG Platform for this project used an array of six strain gauges, four C 2 A- 06 - 062 LT- 120 Tee Rosettes and two C 2 A- 06 - 031 WW- 120 Stacked Rosettes. They were bonded onto the legs of three truss shaped bipods. Results from the Platform Tilting Tests could not be used to validate the CG model as the measured CG and weight values found from the experimental tests contained a considerable amount of error. The errors in the Platform Tilting Tests are believed to stem from the initial errors observed during the bipod <b>rod</b> and strain <b>gauge</b> calibration tests. As an alternative, an FE model of the CG measuring platform was created as another means of validation. The math model of the CG measuring platform was successfully validated by showing that there was less than a 0. 01 % different between the bipod loads predicted from the MATLAB code and the FE model. Using the FEM generated loads as inputs into the CG code to calculate a CG matched the initial point mass or CG created in the FE model within a 0. 01 % difference. To validate the CG model even further, another test should be performed using a CG Platform prototype instrumented with load cells to generate new experimental data and compare them with the results from the FE model...|$|R
40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{under this}} contract {{can be divided}} into two main areas: hypervelocity (in the range up to 7 km/s) and high velocity (less than 1 km/s). Work in the former was performed at NASA-MSFC using the Light Gas Gun Facility. The lower velocity studies were conducted at Auburn University using the ballistic gun. The emphasis of the project was on the hypervelocity phenomenon especially in the characterization of the debris cloud formed by the primary impact events. Special devices were made to determine the angular distributions of momentum and energy of the debris cloud as a function of impact conditions. After several iteration processes, it was decided to concentrate on the momentum effort. Prototype devices were designed, fabricated, and tested. These devices were based on the conservation of momentum. Distributions of the debris cloud formed were measured by determining the amount of momentum transferred from the debris cloud to strategically placed pendulum measurement devices. The motion of the pendula was monitored using itegrated opto-interrupters. The distribution of momentum in the debris cloud was found to be a strong function of the impact condition. Small projectiles at high velocities were observed to produce finely dispersed debris whereas large projectiles generated discrete particles in the debris. Results also show that the momentum in the forward direction was enhanced due to the impact. This phenomenon of momentum multiplication was also observed in other studies and in computer simulations. It was initially planned to determine the energy distribution using deformation energy in a <b>rod</b> with strain <b>gauges.</b> Results from preliminary studies show that this technique is acceptable but too tedious. A new technique was explored based on measuring the heating effect of the debris cloud using an IR camera. The feasibility and sensitivity was established at Auburn University. This type of energy distribution measurement method can easily be adapted to the gas gun facility at MSFC. The objective of the lower velocity studies at Auburn was to simulate the damage produced in advanced materials by the lower energy debris cloud...|$|R
