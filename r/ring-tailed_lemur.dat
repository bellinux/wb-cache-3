5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> can rear up {{and balance}} {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Family Lemuridae {{consists}} of the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur,</b> the brown lemurs, the bamboo lemurs and the ruffed lemurs. There are 21extant species and six subspecies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being listed as endangered in 2014 by the IUCN, the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> has been listed since 1977 by CITES under Appendix I, which makes trade of wild-caught specimens illegal. Although there are more endangered species of lemur, the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> is considered a flagship species due to its recognizability. As of 2017, only about 2,000 ring-tailed lemurs {{are estimated to be}} left in the wild, making the threat of extinction far more serious for them than previously believed.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, {{research}} {{has continued to}} illuminate {{the complexity of the}} lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur.</b> As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through operant conditioning using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species {{has been shown to be}} capable of learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> is an {{opportunistic}} omnivore primarily eating {{fruits and}} leaves, {{particularly those of}} the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known natively as kily. When available, tamarind makes {{up as much as}} 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur.</b> Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E

5|$|The first {{mention of}} the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> in Western {{literature}} came in 1625 when English traveler and writer Samuel Purchas described them as being comparable in size to a monkey and having a fox-like long tail with black and white rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion that}} lemurs are unintelligent has been perpetuated by {{the view that}} the neocortex ratio (as a measure of brain size) {{indicates}} intelligence. In fact, primatologist Alison Jolly noted early in her academic career that some lemur species, such as the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur,</b> have evolved a social complexity similar to that of cercopithecine monkeys, but not the corresponding intelligence. After years of observations of wild <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> populations at the Berenty Reserve in Madagascar and as well as baboons in Africa, she more recently concluded that this highly social lemur species does not demonstrate the equivalent social complexity of cercopithecine monkeys, despite general appearances.|$|E
5|$|In western Madagascar, {{sympatric}} ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) {{have been}} studied together. Little interaction takes place between the two species. While the diets of the two species overlap, they eat in different proportions since the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> has a more varied diet and spends {{more time on the}} ground.|$|E

5000|$|Madagascar, {{opened in}} 2008, is a {{walk-through}} exhibit which {{draws attention to}} the plight of endangered lemur species. The mixed exhibit features <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs,</b> collared lemurs, mongoose lemurs, crowned sifaka, Madagascar teal and radiated tortoise are also on show, and were brought into the collection especially for [...] "Madagascar". The breeding record of the lemur collection is very good with the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs</b> giving birth regularly since their introduction in 2009, and the red bellied lemurs also having bred successfully. Lemur feeding and talk is held daily at 12 noon.|$|R
5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur,</b> for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur,</b> have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.|$|E
5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E

5|$|The <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> {{has both}} native and {{introduced}} predators. Native predators include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the Madagascar ground boa (Boa madagascariensis). Introduced predators include the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), the domestic cat and the domestic dog.|$|E
5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern {{binomial}} nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He included three species under the genus Lemur: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur),</b> and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E

5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur,</b> ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|Other lemurs {{that do not}} exhibit {{dormancy}} conserve {{energy by}} selecting thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, and reducing exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling. Also, the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur,</b> ruffed lemurs, and sifakas are commonly seen sunning, thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of metabolic heat.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemur</b> may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{deterioration}} of teeth is common among modern humans, {{and has been}} suggested for some extinct primates. Dental erosion caused by acidic foods may also obscure microwear signals of mechanical food properties. <b>Ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs</b> at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar, display frequent severe tooth wear and subsequent tooth loss. In contrast, sympatric Verreaux 2 ̆ 7 s sifaka display far less tooth wear and infrequent tooth loss, despite both species regularly consuming acidic tamarind fruit. We investigated {{the potential impact of}} dietary acidity on tooth wear, collecting data on salivary pH from both species, as well as salivary pH from <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs</b> at Tsimanampesotse National Park, Madagascar. We also collected salivary pH data from <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs</b> at the Indianapolis Zoo, none of which had eaten for at least 12 hr before data collection. Mean salivary pH for the BMSR <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs</b> (8. 098, n= 41, SD= 0. 550) was significantly more alkaline than Verreaux 2 ̆ 7 s sifaka (7. 481, n= 26, SD= 0. 458). The mean salivary pH of BMSR (8. 098) and Tsimanampesotse (8. 080, n= 25, SD= 0. 746) <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs</b> did not differ significantly. Salivary pH for the Indianapolis Zoo sample (8. 125, n= 16, SD= 0. 289) did not differ significantly from either the BMSR or Tsimanampesotse <b>ring-tailed</b> <b>lemurs,</b> but was significantly more alkaline than the BMSR Verreaux 2 ̆ 7 s sifaka sample. Regardless of the time between feeding and collection of pH data (from several minutes to nearly 1 hr), salivary pH for each wild lemur was above the 2 ̆ 2 critical 2 ̆ 2 pH of 5. 5, below which enamel demineralization occurs. Thus, the high pH of lemur saliva suggests a strong buffering capacity, indicating the impact of acidic foods on dental wear is short-lived, likely having a limited effect. However, tannins in tamarind fruit may increase friction between teeth, thereby increasing attrition and wear in lemurs. These data also suggest that salivary pH varies between lemur species, corresponding to broad dietary categories...|$|R
