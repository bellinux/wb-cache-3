40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a simple}} neoclassical {{model of the}} investment decision of the firm in the volatile environment of the post-Soviet transition. Conditions favoring and limiting investment in fundamental restructuring are explored, where successful restructuring leads to {{a substantial increase in}} expected profitability. In particular, the impact of the availability of alternative uses for investment resources, the degree of uncertainty and volatility in the economic environment, and the cost of capital as affected by credit constraints and investment subsidy policies is modeled and analyzed. It is shown that subsidizing investment in the presence of significant outside opportunities for the use of those funds, particularly when such opportunities are lost with successful restructuring, can be counterproductive, delaying that restructuring. The paper also explores the interaction of <b>restructuring</b> <b>investment</b> with investment in capacity, and shows that shrinking capacity can be an optimal alternative to <b>restructuring</b> <b>investment</b> in an unfavorable environment, while successful restructuring is optimally exploited by expanding capacity. Finally, there is an "unrestructured," low capacity trap, with investment effort largely directed toward outside activities. These results highlight some {{of the reasons for the}} limited amount of <b>restructuring</b> <b>investment</b> in Russia and many of the other former Soviet Republics. ...|$|E

The methods include cash sales, a give-away scheme, and a participation contract where the government retains a sleeping fractional ownership in the firm. It is shown that with competitive bidding, the participation contract dominates cash sales because it generates both more private <b>restructuring</b> <b>investment</b> and a higher expected present value of revenue for the government. Under weak conditions the participation contract will induce more investment than the giveaway scheme, and it may even share the cash sales' virtue of incentive compatibility.

In view of the developments in the transition economies, we divide restructuring into defensive (related to cutting costs) and strategic (focused on increasing revenues). On the basis of formal model we apply a labour demand equation to test defensive restructuring and the extended investment equation for strategic restructuring analysis. Labour demand estimation confirms relatively slow defensive <b>restructuring.</b> <b>Investment</b> model estimations confirm credit rationing and bargaining hypothesis in all types of soft investment except in the case of training. Similarly, the proven accelerator model hypothesis implies that Slovenian firms started to behave similar as the firms from developed countries following profit maximization goal.

On the basis of an empirical investigation, we compare three subsets of enterprises namely the state-owned enterprises, those privatised and those privatised and including FDI in their capital ownership structure. Such a comparison is based on a data processing of a wide questionnaire filled up by 173 managers working in firms including more than 500 employees. This work takes part in the European Research Program INTAS-UKRAINE. First, we study how FDI upgrade transition economic growth then we examine the impact of FDI on <b>restructuring,</b> <b>investment</b> and performance.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{international}} framework to regulate sovereign debt <b>restructuring,</b> <b>investment</b> arbitration has recently been seen as a potential forum for holdout creditors and vulture funds to seek to enforce sovereign debt instruments. However, the system of investment arbitration was not designed to enforce financial obligations, and even less to provide an avenue for the claims of speculative hedge funds and non-cooperative creditors. To date, however, most investment tribunals have found jurisdiction over sovereign debt disputes. Notwithstanding a few arbitration decisions, the consideration of human rights issues in international investment arbitration has so far remained rather {{on the periphery of the}} international investment law regime. Given the deep and broad human rights implications of debt crises, the report of the Independent Expert argues that it would be a dangerous development if bilateral investment treaties became a forum for solving sovereign debt disputes. While the international community is making great efforts to prevent or minimize holdout litigation, investment arbitration may open a new door for such creditors to deploy disruptive strategies. The current system of investment arbitration may therefore impair economic recovery and undermine State funding for public services and State institutions that give effect to economic, social, cultural rights and the protection of civil and political rights...|$|E
40|$|The {{adjustment}} {{mechanisms of}} multinational firms {{are of interest}} {{in the context of the}} relaxation of barriers to inward investment in relatively low-wage economies. This paper provides new empirical evidence on the effects of overseas foreign direct investment on the structure of multinational firms ’ home-country operations. It also provides micro-level evidence on the home-country effects of outward investment for the UK. The paper focuses on plant exit, since plant closures and cross-border relocation are important adjustment margins for multinational firms. It presents evidence that UK multinationals investing abroad in low-wage economies are acting in line with the predictions of theories of vertical foreign direct investment. More specifically, it examines whether investment abroad in relatively low-wage economies is associated with plant closures in relatively low-skill, labourintensive industries at home; in line with low-skill intensive production being relocated to lowwage economies. The paper makes comparisons across industries and firms akin to a difference-in-differences analysis. It finds that plants in low skill-intensity sectors owned by UK multinationals investing in low-wage economies are significantly more likely to exit than those owned by UK multinationals that are not investing in low-wage economies, and importantly, that this difference is not mirrored for plants in high-skill sectors. The paper also confirms previous findings that multinational firms, either domestic or foreignowned, are more likely to shut down plants than non-multinational firms, and hence exhibit more flexibility in organisational <b>restructuring.</b> <b>Investment</b> abroad and adjustment at home: evidence from UK multinational firm...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{far-reaching}} banking sector {{reforms and}} {{a prolonged period}} of macroeconomic stability and strong economic growth, financial intermediation in Armenia has lagged behind other transition countries, and interest rate spreads have remained higher than in most Central and Eastern European transition countries. This paper examines the determinants of interest rate spreads and margins in Armenia using a bank-level panel dataset for the period 2002 to 2006. We find that bank-specific factors, such as bank size, liquidity, and market power, {{as well as the}} market structure within which banks operate, explain a large proportion of crossbank, cross-time variation in spreads and margins. The results suggest that there is a large potential to increase cost efficiency and competition in the banking system.

They find that simple design changes are necessary but not sufficient conditions for making the pension system sustainable. Partial funding is necessary to avoid large increases in future contribution rates. They investigate the impact of the old-age system and economic growth of a multipillar system that includes a modest mandatory tax-financed- basic benefit plus a mandatory fully-funded defined- contribution scheme. Implementation of a partially funded multipillar pensions system must go hand in hand with reform of the financial sector and <b>restructured</b> <b>investment</b> procedures that emphasize the"right"mix of competition, diversification, and regulation. Otherwise, China's pension reform will ultimately fail.

40|$|World wide the {{electricity}} industry {{is undergoing a}} substantial process of restructuring, {{with an emphasis on}} the introduction of competition in the generation sector. Competition is ostensibly going to lead to better incentives, both in the use of existing resources and in future investment decisions. One of the main drivers of this new environment will be the increased opportunity for energy sales between what had been, before the introduction of competition, fairly closed markets. These new opportunities may lead to new investments in generation and transmission capacity which will occur in order to take advantage of cost differentials between regions, one of the driving factors in the call for restructuring. Accounting for some of the underlying complexity of electricity systems, specifically equipment availability and load duration curves, this paper illustrates how uncertainty affects investment in generation. We offer a simple 2 -region model to analyse this problem, based on the linear programming model of Chaton (1997). Specifically, we analyse the case where one region has access to four generation technologies, differentiated by cost characteristics as well as construction lead times. A second (neighbouring) region has access to only one of the generation technologies, hence the necessary asymmetry between producing regions. Uncertainty is present in the demand for energy in the first market, {{as well as in the}} input fuel prices. Given this uncertainty, and the possibility of electricity sales between regions, we investigate and characterise optimal generation investment in the first market as a function of the problem parameters. The model is calibrated with data from Hydro-Québec and the northeastern United States. This application is particularly interesting and relevant, given the abundance of relatively cheap hydroelectric power in Québec, and Hydro-Québec’s self-proclaimed strategic interests in increasing its exports to the northeastern markets. The numerical example illustrates the importance of appropriately modelling the complexity of the electrical system when considering the impacts of restructuring.
