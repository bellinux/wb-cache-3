5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved rerouting Cardington Street over a burial ground; to avoid public outcry, the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further departure platforms (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along with a separate booking office on Drummond Street.|$|E
5|$|According to Pucar, the Prijedor Company was {{directed}} to attack Ljubija. On 30July, contrary to Stojanović's direct order, the insurgents attacked Veliko Palančište and rescued fifteen hostages held by the Ustaše. The insurgents then advanced toward Prijedor and developed a position facing the town, which was defended by Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and German forces. A front line stabilised {{after three days of}} fighting, leaving the Prijedor Company in control of seven villages. <b>Railway</b> <b>traffic</b> between Ljubija and Zagreb was disrupted, stopping the export of iron ore from Ljubija to Germany. The uprising in Kozara also involved the districts of Dubica and Novi. By mid-August, five detachments of Partisans had been formed within the territory held by the Kozara insurgents. These detachments, including the Prijedor Detachment commanded by Stojanović, together held the front line facing Kozarac, Prijedor, Lješljani, Dobrljin, Kostajnica, and Dubica.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became {{independent}} {{under the}} name Zambia. The railway company was divided, and the part belonging to Zambia was renamed Zambia <b>Railways.</b> <b>Traffic</b> between Zambia and Southern Rhodesia - which was called Rhodesia until 1979 - was suspended until {{the foundation of the}} state of Zimbabwe in 1980.|$|R
5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>traffic</b> {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E

50|$|The Mauriceville Post Office was {{accommodated}} in {{the station}} building and was staffed, by arrangement with the Chief Postmaster (Masterton), {{by members of the}} <b>railways</b> <b>Traffic</b> Department. This meant that the post office was not a full-time operation, with staff also having to attend to their railways work while on duty.|$|R
50|$|Tolcarn Junction was a {{triangular}} junction {{before the time}} of the Truro line; it was a legacy of the Cornwall Mineral <b>Railways</b> <b>traffic</b> from East Wheal Rose to Fowey. The spur avoiding Newquay was called Treloggan Curve, and the junction nearest Perranporth was Lane Junction; that nearest Par was Newquay Junction or Treloggan Junction; that nearest Newquay was Tolcarn Junction.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1848 {{as part of}} the Belfast & Ballymena Railway, which would {{ultimately}} become part of the Northern Counties Committee group of lines owned by the LMS. Following the nationalisation of the <b>railways,</b> <b>traffic</b> on the line was reduced until eventually the route between Belfast and Londonderry was diverted via the Lisburn-Antrim railway line, with the stations on the old route, including Templepatrick, closed. Templepatrick was closed in 1981.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{proposals}} for a Thames Estuary Airport is in the Isle of Grain area and the railway, given its gentle curvatures, could possibly be upgraded to support high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>traffic,</b> though this would probably involve electrification and double-tracking.|$|E
25|$|The law prohibits {{international}} {{air traffic}} and maritime traffic (except for the cases {{defined in the}} UN Convention on Maritime Law of 1982), <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> and international automobile transportation of cargo.

25|$|The road deck was re-opened {{only in a}} {{southbound}} (towards Gateshead) {{direction and}} carries only buses and taxis; the one-way operation is required because of width considerations after protection to the structural members was inserted. Pedestrians use the bridge freely. <b>Railway</b> <b>traffic</b> continues in full use of the bridge, {{although the majority of}} main line trains use the King Edward VII bridge for reasons of convenience.|$|E
25|$|The towns {{were linked}} by two bridges, built {{no more than}} 100 feet (30 m) apart. The older was a nine-arched stone bridge, built in 1771, the third to have been {{constructed}} on the site. Slightly upstream was Robert Stephenson's new High Level Bridge, completed five years previously in 1849, an ingenious double-decker design allowing <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> on the upper deck and road traffic on the lower.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{recovery}} {{and the end}} of petrol rationing led to rapid growth in car ownership and use. Vehicle mileage grew at a sustained annual rate of 10% between 1948 and 1964. In contrast, <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> remained steady during the 1950s but the economics steadily deteriorated, with labour costs rising faster than income and fares and freight charges repeatedly frozen by the government to try to control inflation. By 1955 income no longer covered operating costs, and things got steadily worse.|$|E
50|$|The LNWR and Furness Joint <b>Railway</b> divided <b>traffic</b> {{responsibilities}} so that {{passenger traffic}} through {{the station was}} usually worked by the Furness Railway.|$|R

25|$|It is the zonal {{headquarters}} of South Central Railway and the divisional {{headquarters of}} the Secunderabad Division. Secunderabad Railway Station is the busiest station after Vijayawada Junction Station. And the third biggest junction in SCR after Vijayawada and Guntakal junctions. To reduce the <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> at Secunderabad railway station the Railway Board had decided on a fourth main station for Hyderabad to regulate the increasing passenger traffic at Secunderabad. There are two proposals for the new terminal, Malkajgiri Railway Station and Moulali Railway Station.|$|E
25|$|The town {{became a}} major travel centre {{highlighted}} by the large Cornwallis Inn built at the town's centre by the railway. The town boomed during World War I and World War II with heavy wartime <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Dominion Atlantic and the training of thousands of troops at Camp Aldershot. Many residents fought overseas in the local West Nova Scotia Regiment {{as well as other}} branches of service. A Royal Canadian Navy minesweeper HMCS Kentville was named after the town and her crew often took leave in Kentville.|$|E
25|$|Railway {{signalling}} is {{a system}} used to control <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> safely to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed rails which generate low friction, trains are uniquely susceptible to collision since they frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop quickly or within the driver's sighting distance; road vehicles, which encounter {{a higher level of}} friction between their rubber tyres and the road surface, have much shorter braking distances. Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew. Not all methods require the use of signals, and some systems are specific to single track railways.|$|E
50|$|On 1 May 1846 {{the line}} was {{extended}} by {{the opening of the}} Stettin-Stargard section. The Berlin station in Stettin was transformed into a through station. The opening of the Prussian Eastern Railway’s Krzyż-Piła- Bydgoszcz line in 1851 benefited the Szczecin Railway as the two lines were connected via the extension of the Szczecin-Stargard line to Krzyż in 1848 (or 1849). After the opening of the Eastern Railway’s Krzyż-Kostrzyn-Frankfurt (Oder)-Berlin line in 1857, all of the Eastern <b>Railway’s</b> <b>traffic</b> to Berlin was transferred to that line.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shortage}} of capital caused the directors to prioritise the Aberdare route, which opened from Neath on 24 September 1851 for passenger traffic, goods and minerals following in December. The Vale of Neath Railway was the biggest contributor of mineral traffic to the South Wales Railway, but most of that was destined for Swansea docks, so that no long haul income {{was derived from the}} connection. (In fact for many years a single daily mineral train to London was adequate for all the South Wales <b>Railway's</b> <b>traffic.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the general}} growth in freight {{transport}} throughout the U.S., Guilford's growth remained stagnant due to poor management decisions, despite an initial growth spurt in the 1990s. With {{the creation of}} Pan Am <b>Railways,</b> <b>traffic</b> dropped considerably. A report issued by MaineDOT listed traffic on MEC as being 162,658 loads in 1972. As of 2008, Pan Am traffic over the remaining portions of MEC {{was estimated to be}} less than 69,000 loads. During the same time span, the Association of American Railroads estimates that freight traffic throughout the U.S. more than doubled.|$|R
25|$|In Shanghai, {{students}} {{marched on}} the streets on June 5, and erected roadblocks on major thoroughfares. Factory workers went on a general strike and {{took to the streets}} as well; <b>railway</b> <b>traffic</b> was also blocked. Public transport was also suspended and prevented people from getting to work. On June 6, the municipal government attempted clearing the rail blockade, but was met with fierce resistance from the crowds. Several people died from having been run over by a train. On June 7, students from major Shanghai universities stormed various campus facilities to erect biers in commemoration of the dead in Beijing. The situation gradually came under control without resorting to deadly force. The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.|$|E
25|$|For {{nearly ten}} years after its formation, the LMS had been run using a similar {{organisational}} structure to one of its constituents, the Midland Railway. In practice {{this meant that the}} commercial managers found themselves subservient {{to the needs of the}} operating departments. This changed in 1932 when a major restructuring was completed, replacing the traditional board of directors with an executive headed by a president, supported by vice presidents each with responsibility for a specific area. Ernest Lemon, who had briefly held the office of Chief Mechanical Engineer pending the arrival of William Stanier became Vice President (<b>Railway</b> <b>traffic,</b> operating & commercial), with separate chief operating and chief commercial managers of equal status reporting to him. Railway operations were directed by Charles Byrom, a veteran officer of the LNWR, while commercial activities were headed by Ashton Davies, formerly of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{steadily}} built up, although tolls were low, {{to offset}} the costs imposed on goods passing through Kingswood Junction to the Warwick and Birmingham Canal. On the southern section, coal was taken to Stratford, from where it was sold, or passed along the Upper Avon or the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. Modest dividends were paid to shareholders from 1824, and the total traffic carried in 1838 was 181,708 tons, on which profits of £6,835 were made. In 1845, the company agreed to sell the canal to the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, who were also keen to purchase the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. It was not until January 1856 that the transaction was finally completed, and another year before the railway company took over day-to-day running. Another change of ownership occurred in 1863, when the railway company was absorbed by the Great Western <b>Railway.</b> <b>Traffic</b> gradually decreased, but the fall in receipts was faster than the fall in tonnage, as the railway took the long-distance loads.|$|E
50|$|The {{colliery}} <b>railway's</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was largely}} seasonal {{as most of}} the colliery output was consumed locally. Around {{the turn of the century}} the mine owners began to search for additional traffic for the summer season. At the same time, new steam ships began bringing tourists to the remote Kintyre peninsula. This led to the formation of the Association of Argyll Railway Co. Ltd. which applied for an order under the Light Railways Act to build a railway connecting Campbeltown with Machrihanish, on the west coast of the peninsula.|$|R
5000|$|MMA {{responded by}} {{reducing}} its workforce to 275 employees and cut salaries by 40 percent. The {{decline of the}} {{pulp and paper industry}} as well as the lumber industry, which originally represented 60% of the <b>railway's</b> <b>traffic</b> base, had rendered a company worth $60 million in 2003 effectively worthless. Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec's accountants wrote that company's investment in MMA down to a nominal $1000 from 2008 onward. [...] MMA laid off additional workers in 2006 and in 2008 as the company struggled to become profitable.|$|R
