40|$|Abstract — Bandwidth {{utilization}} is {{an important}} factor to improve the network performance. For the effective utilization of bandwidth, pathloss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency should be measured. So that the application can adapt its send rate to the estimated bandwidth. To measure the path loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency between two nodes in a college campus network active measurement techniques are used. These techniques do not require prior knowledge about the network topology. The drawback of these techniques is that every device in the network must be configured to estimate the bandwidth measures like path loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency. In this paper, we propose an SDN framework for estimating the pathloss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency. This framework includes features such as detecting path loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> measuring the latency in a college campus network.

5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> in general does not intervene {{on the foreign}} exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low interest <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.
