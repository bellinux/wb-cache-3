40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the performance of fourteen manufacturing companies in Pakistan using financial accounting ratios. Data was collected from OSIRIS database sorted by total assets. The variables that will be used are: total assets; expenses; sales; profit before tax; and return on assets. Each variable will be compared and analysed during the 5 year-period, 2006 - 2010. ENGRO being the largest company by total assets over 3 years (2006, 2007 and 2008) had more expenses, low sales, low profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and return on assets compared to the other thirteen companies. FCC being the second largest company by assets showed high sales, profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and return on asset in 5 years (2006 - 2010). On the other hand, NRL being the fourth largest company showed the highest sales in five years, lowest expenditures in 2010 as compared to other thirteen listed companies but it has decreasing profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and return on asset over the years; lowest profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> in 2010. The financial position of other listed companies is mixed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to conduct an {{investigation}} into the link between cost efficiency and financial performance as it pertains to the hotel industry. This study employs DEA approach to estimate cost efficiency and uses three traditional financial indicators, such as the ratio of net operating profit <b>before</b> <b>taxes,</b> the ratio of earnings <b>before</b> <b>taxes,</b> and return on assets <b>before</b> <b>taxes,</b> to measure financial performance. Data were generated from 68 hotels in the international tourist hotels in Taiwan from 1997 to 2006. The major finding indicates that cost efficiency is insignificantly associated with the financial performance, whatever three above financial performance variables. The implications of the findings are discussed and the limitations of the study as well as future research directions are addressed...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, {{companies}} {{are permitted to}} report one pre-tax income number (also called income <b>before</b> <b>tax,</b> profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> or earnings <b>before</b> income <b>tax)</b> to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using income <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and current tax payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax. If the tax expense exceeds the current tax payable {{then there is a}} deferred tax payable; if the current tax payable exceeds the tax expense then there is a deferred tax receivable.|$|R
