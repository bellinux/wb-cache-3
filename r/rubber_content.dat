40|$|Rubber {{toughening}} of polyamide 6 (PA 6) /layered-silicate nanocomposites was investigated. Different {{systems were}} prepared via melt blending according to different formulations. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction and {{transmission electron microscopy}} analyses showed that the nanocomposites had an appreciable degree of exfoliation. A linear elastic fracture mechanics approach was applied to characterize the material fracture behavior in dry conditions, whereas, because of the considerable ductility exhibited by the samples in the wet state, an elastic–plastic approach based on the essential work of fracture methodology was employed. In the absence of rubber, the presence of silicate layers makes the material fracture resistance decrease relative to neat polymer, depending {{on the degree of}} humidity. The results showed that the toughening action of rubber strongly depends on the degree of humidity of the material, at least for the <b>rubber</b> <b>contents</b> considered in this study (lower than 10 wt %).

Statistical analysis using two-way ANOVA was conducted on the results to evaluate the significance of rubber contents and blending times. The rubberised asphalt binder was evaluated in terms of binder elasticity and rutting resistance at high temperature. The results indicate that the crumb <b>rubber</b> <b>content</b> had a significant effect on G*/ sin (Î´) at 76 Â°C.
