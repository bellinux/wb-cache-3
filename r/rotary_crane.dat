A typical <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> consists of a multiple degree-of-freedom platform for positioning a spherical pendulum with an attached payload. The crane operator positions the Payload by issuing a combination of translational and rotational commands to the platform as well as load-line length changes. Frequently, these pendulum modes are time-varying and exhibit low natural frequencies. Maneuvers are therefore performed at rates sufficiently slow {{so as not to}} excite oscillation. The strategy presented here generates crane commands which suppress vibration of the payload without a priori knowledge of the desired maneuver.

These cranes are usually operated manually. With the size of these cranes becoming larger and the motion expected to be faster, the process of controlling them has become difficult without using automatic control methods. In general, the movement of cranes has no prescribed path. Cranes have to be run under different operating conditions, which makes closed-loop control attractive. In this work a fuzzy logic controller is introduced with the idea of 2 ̆ 2 split-horizon 2 ̆ 2; that is, fuzzy inference engines (FIE) are used for tracking the position and others are used for damping the load oscillations. The controller consists of two independent sub-controllers: radial and rotational. Each of these controllers has two fuzzy inference engines (FIE). Computer simulations are used to verify the performance of the controller. Three simulation cases are presented. In the first case, the crane is operated in the gantry (radial) mode in which the trolley moves along the jib while the jib is fixed. In the second case (rotary mode), the trolley moves along the jib and the jib rotates. In the third case, the trolley and jib are fixed while the load is given an initial disturbance. The results from the simulations show that the fuzzy controller is capable of keeping the load-oscillation angles small throughout the maneuvers while completing the maneuvers in relatively reasonable times...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for {{the suppression of the}} sway of <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> payloads. In contrast to closed-loop control methods which encounter significant practical application problems, the proposed method is based simply on the preprocessing of all the commanded crane inputs by a properly designed finite impulse response (FIR) filter. A four-degrees-of-freedom (413017) model for the <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> system is considered, incorporating both the hoisting and the slewing motions and thus able to handle cases where hoisting can be simultaneously applied to the rotary motion. Although the resulting dynamic system is strongly non-linear and time varying, the method is shown effectively to suppress, in a quite robust, time and energy efficient way, both the transient as well as the residual sway of the payload. Moreover, additional advantages of the proposed method are that no dynamic modelling of the crane is required, and that the applicability of the method is quite easy and general, without the need for any additional instrumentation and control equipment...|$|E

Finally, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hence, the crane can be easily operated without sensor systems for measuring rope length, and consequently, the structure of the crane can be simplified and implementation cost can be reduced...|$|E

40|$|The rotary cranes {{are widely}} used in common {{industrial}} structures such as construction sites and automotive tracks to transfer loads and materials. The <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> controlling process is difficult without method because the motion expected to be faster. One of the current problems in industry and building construction is that rotary cranes became larger and higher. So {{they need to be}} faster to achieve acceptable transfer times. But unfortunately, rotary cranes with large structures that are moving at high speed are always associated undesirable payload oscillations resulting from the system dynamics. The purpose of controlling the <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> is transporting the load faster without causing any excessive swing at the final position. Rotary cranes have very strong structures in order to lift heavy payloads. The oscillations of the loads must be reduced to prevent hazards for people and equipment in the work place. In this work, two types of controllers are studied which is input shaping and PID controller. The input shaping controller and PID controller is developed to control the horizontal motion of pendulum and arm position in rotary cranes to reduce the sway angle of the rope to its set point during the transportation process and time response specification. It is developed to control the sway of load to correcting the radial and rotational motion of cranes and the oscillation damping PID controllers for damping the oscillation angles of the loads. LabVIEW and MATLAB software was used to develop input shaping and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller and to simulate the system response. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

Positioning of the payload is accomplished through the hub and boom angles and the load-line length.

40|$|Flexible {{structure}} systems {{arise in}} many important {{applications such as}} ground and aerospace vehicles, atomic force microscopes, rotating flexible spacecraft, <b>rotary</b> <b>cranes,</b> robotics and flexible link manipulators, hard disk drives and other nano-positioning systems. In control systems design for these flexible systems, {{it is important to}} consider the effect of highly resonant modes. Such resonant modes are known to adversely affect the stability and performance of flexible structure control systems, and are often very sensitive to changes in environmental variables. These can lead to vibrational effects which limit the ability of control systems in achieving desired levels of performance. These problems are simplified to some extend by using force actuators combined with colocated measurements of velocity, position, or acceleration. Using force actuators combined with colocated measurements of velocity can be studied using positive real systems theory, which has received a great attention since 1962. Using force actuators combined with colocated measurements of position and acceleration can be studied using negative imaginary (NI) systems theory. In this thesis, we provide a generalization and development of negative imaginary systems theory to include a wider class of systems. In the generalization of NI systems theory, we provide a new negative imaginary definition that allows for flexible systems with free body motion. Also, we provide a new stability condition for a positive feedback control system where the plant is NI according to the new definition and the controller is strictly negative imaginary (SNI). This general stability result captures all previous NI stability results which have been developed. This thesis also presents analytical tools for negative imaginary systems theory, which can be useful in the practical applications of the theory. Two methods that can be used for checking the negative imaginary property for a given system are presented. Also, methods for enforcing NI dynamics on mathematical system models to satisfy an NI Property are explored. A systematic method to design controllers for NI systems with guaranteed robust stability also is presented. A practical application of control system design for a three-mirror cavity locking system is presented in the end of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we develop}} {{a method for}} the model {{reference}} adaptive control (MRAC) of systems via Extremum Seeking (ES), where extremum seeking {{is used as a}} means of estimating parameters in adaptive control. This provides a new approach to adaptive control that unifies real time optimization with adaptive control, thereby giving the designer far greater freedom in the choice of both cost functions and controller structure. Furthermore, conditions for persistency of excitation (PE) are explicit in our adaptive system. This renders the possibility of providing explicit and predictable rates for convergence of parameters, when the PE conditions are satisfied. Finally, our method provides a unified approach to adaptation that can be applied to many linear and nonlinear system structures, without having to modify the adaptation scheme. ^ We show that our control/adaptation framework is extendable to a large class of nonlinear systems including adaptive backstepping and feedback linearization. As applications of our method, we apply it to the control of a two input, two output nonlinear model of a hypersonic vehicle in longitudinal plane, and the control of a <b>rotary</b> hydraulic <b>crane</b> with an underactuated mode. ^ This dissertation opens up many interesting theoretical and practical problems to be addressed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{modelling}} and control of <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> systems. The goal is to design a control system that assists the operator to move a cargo without oscillations and to correctly align the cargo at the final position. The control system is divided into two independent parts, one dealing with the alignment of the load {{with the aid of a}} power swivel or a cargo rotating device, and a second that deals with the elimination of load oscillations. Both design and implementation of the control algorithms on a full scale crane are considered. In the cargo alignment system a linear cascade controller is considered that is shown to have near time-optimal performance for a system with saturation in both the angle and the angular rate of the power swivel. In the second part a weakly coupled pair of state feedback controllers with a nonlinear compensator is used to eliminate the load oscillations in two dimensions. In the third part of the thesis a software tool for simulation and real time control is presented. The development of the program started as a spin-off to the crane projects.

40|$|The present work aims at the {{incorporation}} of control (or servo) constraints into finite-dimensional mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. In particular, we focus on underactuated systems, defined as systems in which the num-ber of degrees of freedom exceeds the number of inputs. The corresponding equations of motion can be written {{in the form of}} differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with a mixed set of holonomic and control constraints. Apart from closed-loop multibody systems, the present formulation accommodates the so-called rotationless formulation of multibody dynam-ics. The rotationless formulation has proven to be especially well-suited for the design of energy and momentum conserv-ing schemes which typically exhibit superior numerical sta-bility properties, see [1 - 3]. Subsequent to {{the incorporation}} of the servo constraints we deal with a reformulation of the underlying DAEs which is amenable to a direct numerical discretization. To this end, we apply a specific projection method to the DAEs in terms of redundant coordinates [4]. A similar projection approach has been previously developed in the framework of gener-alized coordinates by Blajer & Ko lodziejczyk [5]. Repre-sentative numerical examples will deal with underactuated multibody systems such as a 3 D <b>Rotary</b> <b>crane</b> and the 3 -link manipulator. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{and dynamic}} models of a <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> are derived. The crane system has fewer inputs {{than the number}} of the degrees of freedom. Consequently, several schemes commonly used in the control of robotic manipulators are not directly applicable to the crane. A controller which consists of two parts is proposed. The first part regulates the motor torques {{in order to make the}} joints of the crane follow the specified trajectories. The second part is a feedback law designed so as to prevent the load from swinging. Since in practice the parameters of the crane and the object are not known accurately, an adaptive controller is designed. It allows for consistent performance of the system in the presence of the unknown or uncertain parameters. The problem of the modelling and control of two cooperating cranes holding a rigid object is next addressed. The kinematic constraints of the closed-chain system are obtained. These constraints are used in conjunction with the Newton-Euler equations of motions to obtain a dynamical model for the system. A PID controller is designed to perform the desired task. All the control schemes described in this thesis have been tested by computer simulations to illustrate their performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> {{also known}} as a tower crane is widely being used in the {{construction}} of higher buildings. The crane is consists of a jib that rotates in a horizontal plane around a fixed vertical axis and a trolley that holds the load which can move linearly along the jib. This study only focuses on the linear motion of trolley along the jib. The challenging process in order to control the crane are to make sure the trolley stop at the desired position and to deal with swing phenomenon introduced by the trolley motion. But, for the beginning of this study, the position control issue needs to be considered. Since many controllers can be implemented in this system in order to control the position, thus the implementation of practical controller must be investigated. A practical controller known as a fuzzy logic controller with various types of membership functions is implemented to control the position of the trolley. Since fuzzy logic controller is known as non-model based controller, hence it will be less time consuming to design. The scope of this study is limited only for four types of membership function which are common triangular, gaussian, trapezoidal and generalized bell membership function due to their similarities of symmetry characteristics. The performance of fuzzy logic controller with those membership functions is recorded and compared by using Simulink (MATLAB) simulation...|$|E
40|$|Cranes {{used in the}} {{construction}} and transportation industries are generally devices with multiple degrees of freedom including variable load-line length, variable jib length (usually via a trolley), and variable boom angles. Point-to-point payload maneuvers using cranes are performed {{so as not to}} excite the spherical pendulum modes of their cable and payload assemblies. Typically, these pendulum modes, although time-varying, exhibit low frequencies. Current crane maneuvers are therefore performed slowly contributing to high construction and transportation costs. This investigation details a general method for applying command shaping to various multiple degree of freedom cranes such that the payload moves to a specified point without residual oscillation. A dynamic programming method is used for general command shaping for optimal maneuvers. Computationally, the dynamic programming approach requires order M calculations to arrive at a solution, where M is the number of discretizations of the input commands. This feature is exploited for the crane command shaping problem allowing for rapid calculation of command histories. Fast generation of commands is a necessity for practical use of command shaping for the applications described in this work. These results are compared to near-optimal solutions where the commands are linear combinations of acceleration pulse basis functions. The pulse shape is required due to hardware requirements. The weights on the basis functions are chosen as the solution to a parameter optimization problem solved using a Recursive Quadratic Programming technique. Simulation results and experimental verification for a variable load-line length <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> are presented using both design procedures...|$|E
40|$|Offshore crane {{operation}} {{is a complex}} task that demands the operator to control {{the position of the}} load, predict vessel motion and compensate for load sway, all at the same time. In this thesis an anti-sway, boom tip positioning and a wave following system is presented which purpose is to facilitate not automate the crane operation. Introducing such systems the operator has an extra set of tools to reduce risk of cargo damage and personnel injuries during operation. This is done by suppressing the sway angles and positioning the boom tip to a desired position with the anti-sway and boom tip positioning system, and {{be able to make the}} hook follow the heave motion of the vessel by using the wave following system. This thesis contains modeling, visualization, simulation and control of a <b>rotary</b> <b>crane</b> with spherical pendulum. Also models for a trolley with pendant load, vessel motion, and angular deflection of the wire and a wind model is presented. Lagrangian describes the dynamics of the crane models and the equation of motion is derived with Euler-Lagrange equations. The effect of measurement noise in the sensor signals has been reduced through the implementation of an adaptive Kalman-filter. Parameter estimation has been used to find unknown model parameters such as damping, frequency and bias in vessel heave motion model. Several suggestions of sensors to measure the swing angles of the hoist winch wire is presented. The 3 D visualization is developed using the V-Realm 3 D editor included in Simulink 3 D Animation toolbox. Results of the closed loop system shows that it is possible to control the load swing angles and boom tip position and still let the crane operator have the superior control of the crane. In case of stability it can be seen that since all friction terms is neglected in the mathematical model there is no dissipation of energy in the pendulum dynamics, meaning that the anti-sway controller causes any observed damping in the sway dynamics. </p...|$|E
