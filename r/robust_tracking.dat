40|$|Abstract—A <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> {{control design}} for wheeled ve-hicle systems with trailer, based on {{adaptive}} fuzzy elimination technique, is proposed in this study. A minimax control equipped with adaptive fuzzy elimination scheme {{is used to}} achieve a <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> performance, despite the system uncertainties and external disturbance. The design procedure {{is divided into three}} steps. First, a nominal wheeled vehicle control design is obtained via model reference tracking with desired eigenvalue assignment. Second, a fuzzy logic system is constructed, which is subsequently tuned to eliminate the nonlinear uncertainties as much as possible, in order to enhance the tracking robustness. Finally, a minimax control scheme is specified to optimally attenuate the worst case effect of the residue of fuzzy elimination on tracking error below a desired level to meet a <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> performance. An adaptive fuzzy-based optimization theory has been employed to solve the minimax problem. A simulation experiment of the wheeled vehicle with trailer is also presented in order to illustrate the tracking performance of the proposed design method.

40|$|Our {{participation}} in TREC 2003 aims {{to adapt the}} use of the DFR (Divergence From Randomness) models with Query Expansion (QE) to the <b>robust</b> <b>track</b> and the topic distillation task of the Web track. We focus on the <b>robust</b> <b>track,</b> where the utilization of QE improves the global performance but hurts the performance on the worst topics.

We define two information theory based functions, InfoDFR and InfoQ, predicting respectively the AP (Average Precision) of queries and the AP increment of queries after the application of QE. InfoQ is used to selectively apply QE.

40|$|This thesis has {{discussed}} {{the development and}} implementation of robust nonlinear tracking control for a parallel and serial topology Tetrahedral robot (Tetrabot), although the theoretical control strategy presented is applicable to any manipulator tracking problem. The design of <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> controllers involves deriving a tracking law for uncertain dynamic systems, such that the actual positions closely track desired trajectories. Two new schemes, a robust sliding mode control and a Lyapunov-based <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> control, have been presented for uncertain dynamical systems in the presence of model uncertainty and disturbances. The foci of this study are the concepts and techniques of robust nonlinear tracking control with a bias toward industrial applications.;The Tetrabot system structure, hardware, software and the results of implementation on the three degree of freedom parallel geometry have been studied. In order to implement <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> control laws, the Tetrabot system software has been further developed.;Most importantly, the results of implementation of a nonlinear tracking controller on the Tetrabot rig facility are also studied. To demonstrate the performance attainable by this control strategy, the trajectory involved movement across the primary working volume to the end-effect point which is the largest distance possible and involved the continuous motion; such a motion will invoke a wide range of possible nonlinear dynamic representations. The proposed control strategy is robust to variations in robot loading. The experimental results obtained for the closed-loop response indicate that compensation, which employs explicit off-line parameter estimation, can improve tracking accuracy significantly. Using the <b>robust</b> <b>tracking</b> controllers, the position errors were smaller than those obtained using the original PID controllers.
