40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to determine if}} herbaceous ornamentals would have differences in growth when fertilized with commercially available organic fertilizers and commercially available inorganic fertilizers applied at <b>label</b> <b>rates</b> and at equal nitrogen rates.

The study was conducted a t Longwood Gardens' experimental greenhouses and at the University of Delaware from January to April 1976. The plants studied were Coleus 'Glory of Luxembourg', and geranium, Pelargonium hortorum 'Cherie'. Fertilizers studied were cow manure (2 - 1 - 2), fish emulsion (5 - 1 - 1), a mixture of organic fertilizers (4 - 5 - 2), a dry chemical fertilizer (8 - 8 - 8), a liquid chemical fertilizer (15 - 30 - 15), and a slow release fertilizer (12 - 6 - 6). Commercially available inorganic fertilizers applied as directed on the label were found to produce plants with more vigorous growth, more attractive appearance and greater dry weights than commercially available organic fertilizers applied as directed. fertilizers also produced more growth when the fertilizer <b>label</b> <b>rates</b> were increased to equal nitrogen levels.

50|$|In Australia and New Zealand, {{an energy}} <b>rating</b> <b>label</b> or energy rating is a label affixed to various {{appliances}} prior to retail sale, which allows consumers {{to compare the}} energy efficiency of product and allows consumers {{to know how much}} power a particular model will use to run. They allow consumers to compare the energy consumption of similar products, and factor lifetime running cost into their purchasing decision. The energy <b>rating</b> <b>label</b> is a mandatory comparison label under Australian regulations for store sales but not for products sold online. The label comprises an energy consumption figure for the appliance and a star rating. The energy consumption figure is an estimate of how much energy (in kilowatt-hours or kWh) the appliance will use over a year, based on assumptions about “average usage”.|$|E

In relation to dwellings, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland states that [...] "A BER is an indication of the energy performance of a home. It covers energy use for space heating, water heating, ventilation and lighting calculated on the basis of standard occupancy." [...] A BER assessment and certificate may be compulsory to sell a building or shortly after its construction. Methods of calculations and legislations related to BER may be different from one country to another. BER was created as a tool to help monitoring and improving the overall building energy efficiency.|$|E

5000|$|The energy <b>rating</b> <b>label</b> usually {{incorporates}} {{an energy}} star label, {{which is an}} endorsement label that is not regulated by the Australian Government. It is an international standard for energy efficient consumer products that originated in the United States. Appliances and equipment that qualify to carry the energy star mark are generally in the top 25% most energy efficient products. In Australia, the label is used for office equipment and home electronics. New Zealand uses the energy star label for a much wider range of products such as whitegoods, lighting, heating, water heating and windows.|$|E
50|$|The term {{energy input}} {{labeling}} involved producers {{of goods and}} services determining how much energy is used to produce their product, and then including that information on their product packaging. Energy input labeling is sometimes known by the acronym EIL. Energy input labeling provides the advantage of knowing how much energy was used to produce a product, but it does not indicate how much energy a product uses to operate, such as the European Union energy label or the Energy <b>rating</b> <b>label</b> used in Australia and New Zealand, and is not in itself a standard for energy efficiency such as Energy Saving Trust Recommended or Energy Star.|$|E
25|$|Staining and {{labeling}} {{techniques are}} often used in microscopy to help identify specific structures in a cell.

Fluorophores, fluorescent molecules, may be directly attached or attached to an antibody in order to detect a specific target. In the case of dendritic spikes, staining and labeling are used to identify and quantify the presence of certain voltage-gated channels.
