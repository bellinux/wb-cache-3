40|$|Despite the {{well-documented}} side-effects {{and disadvantages}} of long-term use, the prevalence of benzodiazepine use stays high. The purpose of this intervention was to inventarise {{the number of patients}} in our practice who take benzodiazepines and to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> consumption. Therefore we registered all the patients who came to renew their prescription of their benzodiazepine during six months. Afterwards a letter and an information folder were sent to all those patients between 25 and 75 year, with chronic use of benzodiazepine in the practice who took it as a hypnoticum and who didn’t met the exclusion criteria, to motivate them to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> benzodiazepine consumption. 65 Patients were selected in this way. Three months after sending this letter, we called the patients who didn’t answer the letter by telephone to invite them for a consult in practice to talk about this problem and to offer them a discontinuation program if they didn’t succeed to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> dose by themselves. The main finding was that a minimal intervention {{in the form of a}} letter was effective for reducing benzodiazepine consumption. 32, 3 % of the patients <b>reduced</b> <b>their</b> consumption (16, 9 % stopped completely) More-intensive treatment afterwards with a discontinuation program in patients who couldn’t stop or <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> benzodiazepine use gave an additional effect of 32, 2 % (6 % stopped, 26, 2 % <b>reduced</b> <b>their</b> consumption) Conclusion: 58 % Of the selected patients <b>reduced</b> <b>their</b> consumption, 21 % stopped completely.

5|$|After the {{reinforcements}} {{had settled}} in, the Spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards the confederate positions. The first attack came on 26 October when Spanish guns {{opened fire on}} the confederate defences around the Round Tower, causing considerable damage. A French force carried out a simultaneous raid of Gibraltar's harbour, burning the bomb ship. Villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of the San Pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars, which managed to breach it. Among the casualties were the two feuding colonels, Fox and Nugent, who were killed on successive days. At the same time, an epidemic disease broke out among the Gibraltar garrison, <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> effective numbers to about 1,300 men.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E

They subsequently intervened during attempts by the Sanwi monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969, and again in 1970, when an unauthorised political group, the Eburnian Movement, was formed and Houphouët-Boigny accused its leader Kragbé Gnagbé of wishing to secede.|$|E
5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four jumpers {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> speed on the in-run.|$|E
5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E

5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy.
