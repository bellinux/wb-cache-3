Examples of employing Radiance as a simulation tool to predict the lighting performance of such solutions are shown, for a particular case study of a VNLS prototype displaying variations of a simplified view of overcast, clear, and partly cloudy skies. Measurement and simulation were conducted to evaluate the illuminance distribution on workplane level. The key point {{of this study is to}} show that simulations can be used to compare an actual VNLS prototype with a hypothetical <b>real</b> <b>window</b> under the same sky scenes, which was physically not possible, since the test room was not located at the building׳s façade. It is found that the investigated prototype yields a less rapidly drop illuminance distribution and a larger average illuminance than the corresponding <b>real</b> <b>window,</b> under the overcast (52 lx compared to 28 lx) and partly cloudy (102 lx compared to 80 lx) sky scenes. Under the clear sky scene, the <b>real</b> <b>window</b> yields a larger average illuminance (97 lx) compared to the prototype (71 lx), due to the influence of direct sunlight...|$|R

In {{situations}} where daylight is insufficiently available, virtual natural lighting solutions (VNLS), which are systems that artificially provide lighting and view {{comparable to those of}} <b>real</b> <b>windows</b> and skylights, can be promising. VNLS can turn currently unused floor space into space with daylight qualities. The space-gaining potential of VNLS in buildings can be predicted using computational building performance simulation. This paper describes the approach of modelling VNLS with a simplified view, using the Radiance tool to evaluate the lighting performance in a reference office. The VNLS are modelled as arrays of small light sources resembling the sky, the horizon and the ground. The simulation results show that VNLS with wide beam angles generally offer a better uniformity and a larger percentage of sufficiently lit workplane area compared to those obtained with <b>real</b> <b>windows</b> under overcast sky conditions, while the discomfort glare remains comparable to that received from <b>real</b> <b>windows...</b>|$|R

40|$|Natural {{light is}} highly {{variable}} and limited {{in time and}} space. In situations where it is not or insufficiently available, Virtual Natural Lighting Solutions (VNLS) can be promising. This paper presents research based on computer simulation to explore the space-gaining potential of VNLS in offices, healthcare facilities, and industrial halls. The models are developed and simulated using the Radiance lighting simulation tool. The space-gaining potential of the virtual windows is determined by comparing space availabilities, i. e. the percentage of space with workplane illuminance more than a certain level, in situations with either <b>real</b> <b>windows</b> or virtual windows only. Criteria concerning visual comfort glare indices and luminance ratios are also considered. The paper demonstrates a comparison of space availability and visual comfort in some building types with virtual windows, compared to those of <b>real</b> <b>windows</b> with CIE overcast sky. The building type with the largest space availability and relatively low glare indices will be considered as {{the one with the}} biggest potential...|$|R

The development of Virtual Natural Lighting Solutions (VNLS), which are systems that artificially provide natural lighting and view {{comparable to those of}} <b>real</b> <b>windows</b> and skylights, is steered by modelling them as arrays of small light sources resembling a simplified view of a blue sky and green ground. The lighting simulation tool Radiance is employed to predict the space availability, uniformity, ground light contribution on the ceiling, and probability of discomfort glare. The input variables are 2 ̆ 2 distance between windows 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 tilt angles 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 beam angles 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 total luminous fluxes of the sky elements 2 ̆ 2. Sensitivity analysis shows that the total luminous flux positively influences the space availability, the beam angle positively influences the uniformity; and negatively influences average ground light contribution on the ceiling and average probability of discomfort glare.

In this presentation, we will show two cases of RADIANCE application for {{the research and development}} of new, future solutions. In the first case, the model development of Virtual Natural Lighting Solutions (VNLS) is shown. A VNLS is expected to mimic the behavior of <b>real</b> <b>window</b> in spaces without actual windows. RADIANCE is employed to predict the lighting performance, i. e. gain of well-lit workplane area, uniformity, ground contribution on the ceiling, and probability of discomfort glare. Various configurations, tilt angles, beam angles, and total luminous fluxes are considered as input variables. The results show a comparison of the indicators with VNLS, relative to those with <b>real</b> <b>windows</b> under CIE overcast sky. In the second case, the measurement and simulation of irradiance distribution on a sample coated with photocatalyst are shown. A certain setting is required to assess the material’s ability to degrade pollutants, and incoming light on the material’s surface {{plays an important role in}} the process. Using the simulation model, more insight was provided into the distribution and the effects of the glass cover and reflection of the sample on the received irradiance, which initially could not be measured. Based on the simulations, the irradiance within the range of 400 - 570 nm on the catalyst sample can be mapped. The simulation results will serve as boundary conditions in further studies for predicting the degradation of pollutants in the reactor...|$|R

However, assuming no large visual/vestibular effects, a pilot cad often learn to use such a display very effectively. Important problems may arise, however, when display accuracy or consistency is compromised, and this can usually be related to geometrical discrepancies between how the synthetic visual scene behaves and how the visual scene through a window behaves.
