25|$|In healthy individuals, {{the lower}} urinary tract has two {{discrete}} phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine {{is stored in}} the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the <b>reflex</b> <b>system</b> is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, {{at which point the}} bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.|$|E

40|$|The {{projection}} of primary afferents onto spinal interneurons constitutes {{the first step}} in sensorimotor transformations performed by spinal <b>reflex</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite extensive studies on spinal somatotopy, uncertainties remain concerning the extent and significance of representational overlap and relation to spinal reflex circuits. To address these issues, the cutaneous projection from the hindpaw and its relation to the topography of lamina V neurons encoding withdrawal reflex strength ("reflex encoders") was studied in rats. Thin and coarse primary afferent terminations in laminas II and III-IV, respectively, were mapped by wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase and choleragenoid tracing. The functional weights of these projections were characterized by mapping nociceptive and tactile field potentials and compared with the topography of reflex encoders. Both anatomical and physiological data indicate that thin and coarse skin afferent input is spatially congruent in the horizontal plane. The representation of the hindpaw in the spinal cord was found to be intricate, {{with a high degree of}} convergence between the projections from different skin sites. "Somatotopic disruptions" such as the representation of central pads medial to that of the digits were common. The weight distribution of the cutaneous convergence patterns in laminas III-IV was similar to that of lamina V reflex encoders. This suggests that the cutaneous convergence and features such as somatotopic disruptions have specific relations to the sensorimotor transformations performed by reflex interneurons in the deep dorsal horn. Hence, the spinal somatotopic map may be better understood in light of the topography of such <b>reflex</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Premature {{infants with}} {{immature}} brains and <b>reflex</b> <b>systems</b> {{are at high}} risk for central sleep apnea syndrome, even if these babies are otherwise healthy. Premature babies who have the syndrome will generally outgrow it as they mature, provided that they receive careful enough monitoring and supportive care during infancy to survive. Because of premature infants' propensity toward central apnea, medications that can cause respiratory drive depression are either not given to them or administered to them only under careful monitoring, with equipment for resuscitation immediately available. Such precautions are routinely taken for premature infants after general anesthesia; administration of caffeine has been found not only to aid in maintenance of respiratory function after general anaesthesia but to reduce apnea for preterm infants regardless of context.|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a distinction between}} two types of markets and market coordination: those based on social networks and those based on a flow architecture. Flow architectures involve potentially global “scopic ” <b>reflex</b> <b>systems</b> (GRSs) that project market reality {{while at the same}} time carrying it forward and allowing it to flow. The argument is that some financial markets have undergone a transition from a pre-reflexive network market to a reflexively coordinated flow market manifest in the different organization of trading floors, changes in trading patterns and the emergence of a moving market that gets transferred from time-zone to time-zone with the sun. To understand these markets, temporal concepts are needed in addition to the social structural (relational) concepts with which we commonly work. Networks emerge from this analysis as historically specific, relationship-based forms of market coordination which in some markets are in the process of being replaced by more reflexive temporal forms of coordination...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between blink startle and cardiac defense, two protective reflexes that {{are said to be}} elicited by the transient and the sustained components, respectively, of high intensity stimuli. Three groups of participants were presented with three intense long lasting noise stimuli (500 ms) after habituation training with 12 brief (50 ms) high intensity noise bursts (High group), low intensity noise bursts (Low group) or high intensity visual stimuli (Light group). The transition from habituation to defense stimuli resulted in increased blink startles in groups Low and Light, but not in group High. A cardiac defense reflex, characterised by a short and long delayed increase in heart rate, was observed in group Light, but not in groups Low and High. This pattern of results indicates that habituation to startle eliciting stimuli will impair defense reflexes elicited on subsequent test trials and suggests some interrelation between the two <b>reflex</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
