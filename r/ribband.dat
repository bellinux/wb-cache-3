2500|$|... "Thursday night, Oct. 24, at {{a quarter}} before eight o'clock, the lovers of rat-killing enjoyed a feast of delight in a prodigious {{raticide}} at the Cockpit, Westminster. The place was crowded. The famous dog Billy, of rat-killing notoriety, 26 lb. weight, was wagered, for twenty sovereigns, to kill one hundred rats in twelve minutes. The rats were turned out loose at once in a 12-feet square, and the floor whitened, so that the rats might be visible to all. The set-to began, and Billy exerted himself to the utmost. At four minutes and three quarters, as the hero's head was covered with gore, he {{was removed from the}} pit, and his chaps being washed, he lapped some water to cool his throat. Again he entered the arena, and in vain did the unfortunate victims labour to obtain security by climbing against the sides of the pit, or by crouching beneath the hero. By twos and threes they were caught, and soon their mangled corpses proved the valour of the victor. Some of the flying enemy, more valiant than the rest, endeavoured by seizing this Quinhus Flestrum of heroic dogs by the ears, to procure a respite, or to sell their life as dearly as possible; but his grand paw soon swept off the buzzers, and consigned them to their fate. At seven minutes and a quarter, or according to another watch, for there were two umpires and two watches, at seven minutes and seventeen seconds, the victor relinquished the glorious pursuit, for all his foes lay slaughtered on the ensanguined plain. Billy was then caressed and fondled by many; the dog is estimated by amateurs as a most dextrous animal; he is, unfortunately, what the French Monsieurs call borg-ne, that is, blind of an eye.-This precious organ was lost to him some time since by the intrepidity of an inimical rat, which as he had not seized it in a proper place, turned round on its murderer, and reprived him by one bite of the privilege of seeing with two eyes in future. [...] The dog BILLY, of rat-killing notoriety, on the evening of the 13th instant, again exhibited his surprising dexterity; he was wagered to kill one hundred rats within twelve minutes; but six minutes and twenty five seconds only elapsed, when every rat lay stretched on the gory plain, without the least symptom of life appearing.' Billy was decorated with a silver collar, and a number of <b>ribband</b> bows, and was led off amidst the applauses of the persons assembled." ...|$|E

6000|$|Blue was the {{favourite}} colour of the Covenanters; {{hence the}} vulgar phrase {{of a true}} blue whig. Spalding informs us, that when the first army of Covenanters entered Aberdeen, few or none [...] "wanted a blue ribband; the lord Gordon, and some others of the marquis (of Huntley's) family had a <b>ribband,</b> when they were dwelling in the town, of a red fresh colour, which they wore in their hats, and called it the royal <b>ribband,</b> {{as a sign of}} their love and loyalty to the king. In despite and derision thereof, this blue <b>ribband</b> was worn, and called the Covenanter's <b>ribband,</b> by the hail soldiers of the army, who would not hear of the royal <b>ribband,</b> such was their pride and malice."--Vol. I. p. 123. After the departure of this first army, the town was occupied by the barons of the royal party, till they were once more expelled by the Covenanters, who plundered the burgh and country adjacent; [...] "no fowl, cock, or hen, left unkilled, the hail house-dogs, messens (i.e. lap-dogs), and whelps, within Aberdeen, killed upon the streets; so that neither hound, messen, nor other dog, was left alive that they could see: the reason was this,--when the first army came here, ilk captain and soldier had a blue <b>ribband</b> about his craig (i.e. neck); in despite and derision whereof, when they removed from Aberdeen, some women of Aberdeen, as was alleged, knit blue ribbands about their messens' craigs, whereat their soldiers took offence, and killed all their dogs for this very cause."--P. 160.|$|E

40|$|Mediterranean {{shipbuilding}} {{is mostly}} known due to archaeological data {{a large part}} of which consist in wrecks of ancient sailing merchant ships. Galleys are practically never encontered in underwater excavations, which oblige us to utilise written records and iconographical data. No plan of a 17 th century galley has been discovered to this day because shipbuilding emerged from a non-graphic culture in which other existing methods enabled the form of the lower part of a hull to be designed. The first galley plans appeared in France around the 1730 s on the impulse of shipbuilders such as Reynoir the younger. When the shipbuilder proceeded by trial and error it was on paper and not on the building site. Thanks to the graphic documents, the builder preserved and exploited the experience gained dunng his career and that ofhis predecessors. The methods used in the 17 th century by the galley builders, the direct heritage of the medieval period, were very different from those used in the 18 th century. The carpenters used «technical formulas », obtained empirically, to define all the dimensions and draw theform of{{the lower part of the}} hulls. The builders used moulas and rising squares, kinds of model for the frame, as well as <b>ribbands.</b> The latter are wooden rods fixed longitudinally onto the hull after the central ribs have been placed. They enable the builder to draw the frame of the ends by means of appropriate measurements. The ribs of the central part are drawn with the help of moulds and rising squares taken from the tracing ofthe midship frame. The evolution of the forms of the lower part of the hull is obtained by moving these moulds and rising squares around over each other. The ribs of the hull's aft extremity are made by associating the <b>ribbands</b> and moulds, moving them to give the shape of the frame. The form of the ribs ofthe hull's fore part is solely defìned by a network of <b>ribbands.</b> Experience and good judgement play a determining role especially for the shaping of the fore and aft parts, the pronounced sharp bottom of the extremities is not conducive to the sole use of moulds.
