5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On June 29 the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize and The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game was highly anticipated and Zay had expected to award it the prize.

40|$|Abstract__ In this essay, I {{provide a}} {{historical}} and theoretical {{framework for understanding}} the imaginative relation between <b>the</b> liberal <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> kin-based form <b>of</b> socio-legal organization I call ‘the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clan’ – {{a classic example of}} law created ‘from below’. Specifically, I believe that a culturalist disciplinary perspective reveals that the modern liberal state and its more centralized <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law always stand in an ironic, dialectical relation to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clan as a legal form. Liberal society, that is, nurtures itself through an anti-liberal utopian imaginary. This article provides an intellectual history backdrop for theorizing that dialectical relationship by examining two contrasting ways in which nineteenthcentury British intellectuals imagined <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. Following <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Charles Taylor and, more specifically in the legal field, Paul Kahn, my goal is to depict a social imaginary of modern liberalism that has been neglected within contemporary liberal theory – and, in doing so, provide a way to appreciate <b>the</b> cultural foundations <b>of</b> liberal legality. <b>The</b> article considers the stories that nineteenth-century British intellectuals told about the relation between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clan as a way to think about <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law today. It thus tacks between three different shores: <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> legal pluralism (<b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clan), <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> nineteenth-century British analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clan and the contemporary relation between culture and modern liberal society...|$|R
