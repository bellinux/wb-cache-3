Based on these results, {{it can be concluded}} that the powder produced has favorable attributes for industrial use, and that use of these seeds would be a viable alternative to prevent various diseases and malnutrition in our country and to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural waste...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho, objetivou-se avaliar o efeito de extratos e óleos essenciais de quatorze plantas medicinais e ou nativas, conhecidas popularmente no Norte de Minas Gerais, sobre a germinação de esporos e crescimento micelial do fungo Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Foram utilizados no teste de inibição do crescimento micelial, os extratos aquosos de alecrim (Rosmarinus officinalis), erva baleeira (Cordia verbenacea), joá (Solanum sisymbriifolium), quebra-pedra (Phyllanthus corcovadensis), erva botão (Eclipta alba) e açafrão da índia (Curcuma longa) obtidos por meio do processo de infusão; óleo essencial de alecrim de vargem (Família Lamiaceae), alecrim pimenta (Lippia sidoides), alfavaca cravo (Ocimum gratissimum), lippia (Lippia citriodora), goiaba branca (Psidium guajava), capim santo (Cymbopogon citratus); óleo resina de copaíba (Copaifera langsdorffi); hidrolatos de alecrim de vargem, goiaba vermelha (Psidium guajava), lippia, capim santo, goiaba branca, alfavaca cravo; manipueira de (Manihot esculenta). Também foram testados esses mesmos hidrolatos e os óleos essenciais na germinação dos esporos do fungo. Todos os tratamentos foram realizados in vitro, cultivando-se o fungo em meio de cultura BDA acrescido de 100 &# 956;L dos compostos vegetais. No teste de inibição da germinação, todos os óleos essenciais impediram a germinação do fungo. No entanto, os hidrolatos não tiveram esse efeito. No teste de crescimento micelial, os óleos essenciais de todas as plantas inibiram completamente o crescimento do fungo, exceto o óleo da goiaba branca. Os extratos aquosos, a manipueira, o óleo resina e os hidrolatos, também não foram eficientes sobre o crescimento do patógeno. Esses resultados indicam o potencial antifúngico de alguns óleos essenciais de plantas medicinais. The {{objective}} of the work was to evaluate the effect of extracts and essential oils of fourteen medicinal and or native plants popularly known in the North of Minas Gerais, on the germination of spores and the mycelial growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides fungus. The following {{were used in the}} mycelial growth inhibition test: the watery extracts of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Cordia verbenacea, Solanum sisymbriifolium, Phyllanthus corcovadensis, Eclipta alba, and Curcuma longa obtained through the infusion process; essential oils of "alecrim de vargem" (Lamiaceae Family), Lippia sidoides, Ocimum gratissimum, Lippia citriodora, white guava (Psidium guajava), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus); copaíba oil resin (Copaifera langsdorffi) as well as hydrolates of "alecrim de vargem", <b>red</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium guajava), Lippia citriodora, lemongrass, white guava, Ocimum gratissimum; and cassava manipueira (Manihot esculenta). The same hydrolates and essential oils were also tested on the germination of the fungus spores. All the treatments were carried out in vitro, cultivating the fungus in PDA supplemented with 100 &# 956;L of the vegetal compounds. In the germination inhibition test, all the essential oils prevented the germination of the fungus. However, the hydrolates did not have this effect. In the mycelial growth test, the essential oils of all of the plants completely inhibited the fungus growth, except the white guava oil. The watery extracts, the cassava manipueira, the oil resin and hydrolates were also not efficient in preventing the growth of the pathogen. These results indicate the fungitoxic potential of some essential oils of medicinal plants. CNP...|$|E
40|$|O Rio Grande do Sul se destaca por sua riqueza florística, entretanto, muitas espécies frutíferas permanecem desconhecidas, embora possuam potencial para se tornarem competitivas com as espécies já tradicionais. Neste sentido, este trabalho visa aprofundar a caracterização de alguns frutos nativos da região, estimulando a exploração desta biodiversidade, esclarecendo a potencialidade dos produtos e sua utilização em prol dos benefícios a saúde e o avanço da economia local e nacional. Para isso, foi realizada uma caracterização bromatológica e fitoquímica, como também foi verificado o potencial antioxidante de frutos nativos tais como: araticum (Rollinia sylvatica A. St. -Hil.), araçá (Psidium cattleyanum Sabine), butiá (Butia capitata Mart. (Becc.)), gabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.), uvaia (Eugenia pyriformis Cambes.) e tuna (Cereus hildmannianus K. Schum.). A partir dos resultados, pode-se verificar que entre os frutos da família Myrtaceae, a guabiroba destacou-se por apresentar maior quantidade de compostos fenólicos (1495, 27 mg/ 100 g), carotenóides (54, 35 μg/g), e vitamina C (5, 44 mg/ g) como também um {{excelente}} potencial antioxidante (90, 26 M eq. trolox/g de fruto fresco e 906, 63 g de fruto fresco/g DPPH), indicando ser um fruto bastante promissor tanto para consumo in natura quanto para utilização tecnológica, visto que também obteve melhor relação SST/ATT (45, 12). Entretanto, esse mesmo fruto se sobressaiu com os teores mais elevados de Al (31, 27 μg/g) e Cr (1, 80 μg/g), juntamente com a uvaia (1, 56 μg/g), que demonstrou quantidades superiores de Fe (21, 27 μg/g) e Zn (60, 48 μg/g). A uvaia também se destacou pelo elevado teor de carotenóides (50, 09 μg/g). O araçá, apesar de apresentar teores de compostos fenólicos e atividade antioxidantes inferiores à guabiroba, ainda assim apresentou-se superior a muitas frutas tradicionalmente consumidas. Quanto aos minerais analisados, o araçá amarelo se destacou pelo elevado teor de Na (828, 78 μg/g) e o vermelho de Co (3, 27 μg/g). Em relação ao outro grupo de frutos estudado, de famílias botânicas variadas, o butiá e a tuna apresentaram capacidade antioxidante superior à uvaia e à muitas espécies frutíferas tradicionalmente consumidas. O butiá também se destacou com teor mais elevado em carotenóides (39, 6 μg/g) e nos minerais Cd (0, 06 μg/g) e Ni (4, 99 μg/g). A tuna apresentou maior conteúdo de compostos fenólicos totais (1337, 28 mg/ 100 g) e predomínio de Ba (7, 97 μg/g), Bi (6, 36 μg/g), Ga (6, 02 μg/g), Mg (1215, 54 μg/g) e Mn (207, 90 μg/g). O araticum se sobressaiu quanto a concentração de vitamina C (0, 32 mg/g) e no resultado para SST/ATT (41, 92), mostrando-se adequado tanto para o consumo in natura como para o processamento. Para este mesmo fruto ainda foi observada quantidade de Cu (80, 38 μg/g) acima do recomendado, assim como também teve destaque com maiores concentrações de Pb (0, 10 μg/g), Sr (28, 95 μg/g), Ca (2579, 50 μg/g) e K (11522, 03 μg/g). The Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil) {{stands out}} for its richness flora, however, many fruit species remain unknown, {{although they have}} the potential to become competitive with the traditional species. Thus, this work aimed to deepen the characterization of some native fruits of the region, encouraging the exploitation of our biodiversity, preventing biopiracy, clarifying the potential of our products and their use in support of health benefits and advancement of the local and national economy. For this, we performed a phisicochemical and phytochemical characterization, and also was determined the potential of antioxidant custard apple (araticum) (Rollinia sylvatica A. St. - Hil.), Guava (araçá) (Psidium cattleyanum Sabine) coco palm (butiá) (Butia capitata Mart. (becc.)), gabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.), uvaia (Eugenia pyriformis Cambes.) and tuna cactus (tuna) (Cereus hildmannianus K. Schum.). From the results, one can see that among the fruits of the Myrtaceae, the guabiroba stood out due to its greater quantity of phenolic compounds (1495. 27 mg/ 100 g), carotenoids (54. 35 μg/g), and vitamin C (5. 44 mg/g), as well as, an excellent antioxidant potential (90. 26 M trolox/g and 906. 63 g/g DPPH) could be a promising fruit for both fresh consumption and for use technology, since they also obtained better TSS/TTA ratio (45. 12). However, the guabiroba showed the highest levels of Al (31. 27 μg/g) and Cr (1. 80 μg/g), together with uvaia (1. 56 mg/g), which showed higher amounts Fe (21. 27 μg/g) and Zn (60. 48 μg/g). The uvaia also stood out for presenting a relevant carotenoid content (50. 09 μg/g). Yellow guava, although showing a lower phenolic compound content and antioxidant activity then the guabiroba, nevertheless showed much higher values than many traditionally consumed fruit. Regarding minerals, the yellow guava stood out high concentrations of Na (828. 78 μg/g) and the <b>red</b> <b>guava</b> Co (3. 27 μg/g). The coco palm (25. 96 trolox μM/g and 3847. 54 g/g DPPH) and tuna cactus (19. 61 trolox μM/g 3249. 77 g/g DPPH) showed higher antioxidant capacity than many fruit species traditionally consumed. In the other group of fruits studied, in various plant families, the coco palm fruit stood out due to its elevate carotenoid content (39. 6 μg/g) and minerals Cd (0. 06 μg/g) and Ni (4. 99 μg/g). The tuna cactus fruit showed the highest total phenolic compound content (1337. 28 mg/ 100 g) and predominance of Ba (7. 97 μg/g), Bi (6. 36 μg/g), Ga (6. 02 μg/g) Mg (1215. 54 μg/g) and Mn (207. 90 μg/g). Although the custard apple showed the highest vitamin C content (0. 32 mg/g) showed the best result for the TSS/TTA ratio (41. 92), and was thus adequate for both in natura consumption and for processing. This fruit was also observed amounts of Cu (80. 38 μg/g) above the recommended, as was also stood out for its high concentrations of Pb (0. 10 μg/g), Sr (28. 95 μg/g), Ca (2579. 50 μg/g) and K (11, 522. 03 μg/g) ...|$|E
