[...] Langshaw however said that the Mega Drive version was considered inferior to other versions, and because of its poor conversion rate, the game ran faster than intended on the North American Genesis console and [...] "went from unforgiving to near impossible."

40|$|Australia’s {{response}} [to {{the crisis}} in Darfur] has been slow, it has been hesitant, and, I regret to say, it has been inadequate’, <b>remarked</b> <b>Shadow</b> Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd in February 2005 (House of Representatives Hansard: 47). Since 2003, genocide in Darfur has claimed more than 300, 000 lives, with 2. 6 million more displaced by the conflict (Degomme and Guha-Sapir 2010 : 294 - 300; Reeves 2012). The international response to the crisis has been slow and lacklustre, and while {{the intensity of the}} conflict has fluctuated in the past nine years, the situation remains dire. The Australian government’s policy response to the genocide has essentially mirrored the weak international response. Australia has made some diplomatic representations about the genocide, and provided humanitarian aid. Overall, however, the genocide has not engaged the attention of many politicians, and nor has Australia’s policy response aligned with our strong commitment to genocide prevention generally. This paper will delve into the factors that shaped this policy response. As the crisis has unfolded, it {{has been the subject of}} substantial discussion within the Australian parliament. This paper will explore the central themes within Australian parliamentary discussion of the genocide in Darfur, and examine how this discussion evolved over time. It will also place the discussion within the wider context of Australia’s place and obligations within the international community, and th...|$|R
5000|$|On 21 February 2016, Work and Pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, {{who was a}} Eurosceptic {{as early}} as 1992, opined that {{remaining}} in the EU would {{make it more difficult}} to prevent terrorist attacks, because only by leaving the EU can the UK regain control of its borders. He went on to suggest that the terrorists of the November 2015 Paris attacks had travelled to France from war-torn Syria and neither France (an EU member) nor the EU itself had been able to prevent the attack. Shortly after the <b>remarks,</b> <b>Shadow</b> Home Secretary Andy Burnham deplored what he called [...] "highly irresponsible comments" [...] and [...] "inaccurate to boot" [...] as the UK is not in Schengen. Meanwhile, Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope retorted that Duncan Smith was [...] "categorically wrong about security post Brexit". Similarly, Labour MP Dan Jarvis went on to suggest that Duncan Smith's remarks were [...] "misjudged and wrong", adding [...] "This type of scaremongering should have no place in the vital debate about our country's future that will take place over the coming months". Labour MP Tristram Hunt agreed with Jarvis and called the remarks [...] "baseless scaremongering from a man who knows he's on the wrong side of the argument". Moreover, Jonathan Evans, the former Director-General of MI5, dismissed Duncan Smith's remarks, arguing once again that EU membership kept the UK safe.|$|R

500|$|Specifically, Paul H. Kocher {{argues that}} Tolkien {{describes}} {{evil in the}} orthodox Christian way as the absence of good. He cites many examples in The Lord of the Rings, such as Sauron's [...] "Lidless Eye": [...] "the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as Thomas Aquinas, [...] "whom {{it is reasonable to}} suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well". Tom Shippey makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with Alfred the Great's Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, known as the Lays of Boethius. Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: [...] "evil is nothing". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo's <b>remark,</b> [...] "the <b>Shadow</b> ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own", and related remarks by Treebeard and Elrond. He goes on to argue that in The Lord of the Rings evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the Manichaean heresy), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.|$|R
6000|$|Three hours afterwards, I {{was seated}} on the end {{platform}} of the train as it swept eastward through the gorges and thundered in tunnels of the mountains. The change of scene, the sense of escape, the still throbbing terror of pursuit--above all the astounding magic of my new conveyance, kept me from any logical or melancholy thought. I {{had gone to the}} doctor's house two nights before prepared to die, prepared for worse than death; what had passed, terrible although it was, looked almost bright compared to my anticipations; and it was not till I had slept a full night in the flying palace car that I awoke to the sense of my irreparable loss and to some reasonable alarm about the future. In this mood I examined the contents of the bag. It was well supplied with gold; it contained tickets and complete directions for my journey as far as Liverpool, and a long letter from the doctor, supplying me with a fictitious name and story, recommending the most guarded silence, and bidding me to await faithfully the coming of his son. All then had been arranged beforehand: he had counted upon my consent, and, what was tenfold worse, upon my mother's voluntary death. My horror of my only friend, my aversion for this son who was to marry me, my revolt against the whole current and conditions of my life, were now complete. I was sitting stupefied by my distress and helplessness, when, to my joy, a very pleasant lady offered me her conversation. I clutched at the relief; and I was soon glibly telling her the story in the doctor's letter: how I was a Miss Gould, of Nevada City, going to England to an uncle, what money I had, what family, my age, and so forth, until I had exhausted my instructions, and, as the lady still continued to ply me with questions, began to embroider on my own account. This soon carried one of my inexperience beyond her depth; and I had already <b>remarked</b> a <b>shadow</b> on the lady's face, when a gentleman drew near and very civilly addressed me: ...|$|R
