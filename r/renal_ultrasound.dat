METHODOLOGY: In this prospective multicenter study, <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> {{were performed on}} 54 very low birth weight infants using a 5. 0 - and 7. 5 -MHz transducer, and these ultrasounds were read independently by three radiologists. kappa coefficients were calculated to assess variability in identification of nephrocalcinosis among the radiologists. RESULTS: The kappa coefficient (+/- confidence intervals) using a 5. 0 -MHz transducer was 0. 143 (0. 108, 0. 178); using the 7. 5 -MHz transducer, the kappa coefficient was 0. 268 (0. 243, 0. 293). All three radiologists agreed in their identification of nephrocalcinosis on 3 of 54 ultrasounds using a 5. 0 -MHz transducer; a total of 6 of 54 ultrasounds obtained using a 7. 5 -MHz transducer were read as positive by all three radiologists.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the clinical significance of routine postoperative voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and renal functional {{studies in the}} postoperative management of children after a transtrigonal ureteric reimplantation. METHODS: A retrospective record review of 126 consecutive patients undergoing transtrigonal ureteric reimplantation. Inclusion criteria included primary reflux and > 5 years of follow-up. Follow-up imaging studies consisted of serial <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> (US) and one VCUG and intravenous urogram (IVU) each. RESULTS: Of 126 patients, 2 required a reoperation for contralateral reflux and pyelonephritis. In all other patients {{the results of the}} VCUG did not alter management. Dilatation seen in IVU was always visible in the renal US as well and always resolved spontaneously. No new dilatation was observed after 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative VCUG and renal functional studies are not warranted in asymptomatic patients after transtrigonal reimplantation. Only in patients with postoperative pyelonephritis did the imaging studies alter the treatment. In the majority of patients, follow-up with an early and 1 -year renal US may suffice.

5000|$|For {{incidentally}} detected prenatal hydronephrosis, {{the first}} study to obtain is a postnatal <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> since as noted, many cases of prenatal hydronephrosis resolve spontaneously. This is generally done within {{the first few days}} after birth, although there is some risk that obtaining an imaging study this early may miss some cases of mild hydronephrosis due to the relative oliguria of a newborn. Thus, some experts recommend obtaining a follow up ultrasound at 4-6 weeks to reduce the false-negative rate of the initial ultrasound. [...] A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is also typically obtained to exclude the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux or anatomical abnormalities such as posterior urethral valves. Finally, if hydronephrosis is significant and obstruction is suspected, such as a ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) or ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction, a nuclear imaging study such as a MAG-3 scan is warranted.|$|E

At this time, these recommendations are not based on the differential risk between different genetic or epigenetic causes for each syndrome, which some European centers have implemented. This differentiated approach largely represents distinct practice environments between the United States and Europe, and these guidelines are designed to be a broad framework within which physicians and families can work together to implement specific screening.

40|$|Background. Hydronephrosis {{can be a}} {{side effect}} of radical {{hysterectomy}} for cervical cancer. The incidence of clinically relevant hydronephrosis has not been studied in a large sample and the benefit of early detection of hydronephrosis is not clear. Objective. To assess the incidence of hydronephrosis, following radical hysterectomy and evaluate the usefulness of routine <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (RH). Methods. Retrospective study, January 1998 and December 2008. Cervical cancer patients (FIGO stage IBI-IIA), treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, without surgical lesion of the ureter, followed-up 6 months in the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam. Routine <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> was performed four weeks after RH, and in some on indication before or after the routine ultrasound. We documented which interventions for hydronephrosis were performed and evaluated the profile of patients at risk for hydronephrosis. Results. 281 patients were included: 252 (90 %) underwent routine <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and 29 (10 %) underwent imaging on indication before routine ultrasound. The overall incidence of hydronephrosis was 12 %. In symptomatic patients, the incidence was 21 % and 9 % in asymptomatic women undergoing routine ultrasound. Four patients were invasively treated for hydronephrosis (1 % of the total group) after imaging for clinical suspicion of hydronephrosis. Patients with hydronephrosis were significantly more often treated with radiotherapy than patients without (43 % versus 25 % (p = 0. 03). Conclusion. There is no place for routine <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> following radical hysterectomy.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityPolycythemia vera (PV) {{is a rare}} clonal blood {{disorder}} {{marked by}} an elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red cell mass. Although the etiology is unknown, PV {{is characterized by the}} proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells which creates an increased red cell mass accompanied by an expanded blood volume. Red blood cell production continues independent of increased blood viscosity. Onset is insidious and the patient may present without symptoms or complain of headache, dizziness, or pruritus. Physical examination typically reveals splenomegaly, plethora, and retinal vein engorgement. Laboratory features include leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin levels are low or absent. PV must be distinguished from relative and secondary polycythemia. Relative polycythemia causes a moderate increase in hematocrit frequently secondary to fluid contraction. The red cell mass, although not truly increased, reflects hemoconcentration. Secondary polycythemia is suspected, if an elevated hematocrit occurs without leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and splenomegaly. The red cell mass measurement and serum erythropoietin level will be increased. Tests used in the differential diagnosis of PV include red cell mass determination, erythropoietin assays, arterial oxygen saturation, and <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasounds.</b> Regular phlebotomy is the safest treatment for PV. Myelosuppressive agents may be given in addition to phlebotomy therapy. The median survival time for patients with PV is 11 to 15 years with appropriate medical treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Clinical and experimental data {{have shown that}} differences in nephron endowment result in differences in renal mass and predisposition to chronic renal failure, hypertension, and proteinuria. We hypothesized that {{a significant proportion of}} the variance in GFR, as estimated by serum creatinine, is attributable to differences in renal size in normal children. Design, setting, participants, & measurements A total of 1748 normal <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> that were performed in children older than 6 months were reviewed. For each ultrasound, serum creatinine, serum blood urea nitrogen, and systolic and diastolic office BP were recorded. Renal size was evaluated as a function of renal length and thickness. All data were normalized for height, weight, age, and gender. Results When expressed as SD scores, a significant correlation was found between kidney size and serum creatinine (P < 0. 0001) and between kidney size and serum blood urea nitrogen (P < 0. 002). When dividing kidney size data per quintiles, a difference of 0. 51 SD score in serum creatinine was observed between the lowest and highest quintile. No significant correlation was found with office BP measurements. Conclusions These data show that, even in the normal pediatric population, differences in renal function are significantly explained by differences in renal mass.
