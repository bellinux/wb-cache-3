The submersed aquatic weevil Euhrychiopsis lecontei Dietz is endemic to North Ameri-ca, but there are now source populations on the exotic Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) {{as well as on}} the weevil's ancestral host, northern watermil-foil (Myriophyllum sibiricum Komarov). This provides an opportunity to examine a host range expansion in pro-gress. To further define the host range of the weevil and to determine how population source and <b>rearing</b> <b>plant</b> in-fluence host plant preference and performance, we con-ducted a series of preference and rearing experiments with weevils from two source populations reared on northern milfoil, on Eurasian milfoil, switched late i...|$|E
40|$|Many aphid {{species have}} become virulent to host-plant resistance, which limits the {{sustainability}} of insect resistance breeding. However, when this adaptation to resistant plants is associated with fitness costs for the aphids, virulence can {{be lost in the}} absence of resistant plants. For two populations of the lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosely) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), we evaluated whether virulence to Nr-gene-based resistance was lost on a susceptible lettuce, Lactuca sativa L. (Asteraceae), and assessed possible costs of virulence. The feeding behaviour and performance of these aphids, reared and tested on susceptible and resistant lettuce, were investigated. The <b>rearing</b> <b>plant</b> affected feeding behaviour and performance of the aphids. Temporary reduction and long-term loss of virulence were found. The total duration of phloem intake was shorter after being reared on susceptible lettuce and tested on resistant lettuce. In addition, one population had a lower survival on resistant lettuce after being reared on susceptible lettuce. There were also indications of fitness costs of the virulence in both populations...|$|E
40|$|Malleable food {{preferences}} of the tobacco hornworm (larval Manduca sexta) have {{been the focus of}} decades of investigation. These previous studies have described the behavioral changes as an induction of oligophagy or as an induction of preference, both of which predict diet-induced changes in food selection but differ in the scope and mechanism associated with those changes. This project attempts to apply novel bioassays and comparisons to a seasoned topic, and in doing so add to our understanding regarding diet experience and food palatability in M. sexta. Larvae tested using a no-choice disc or no-choice emigration assay displayed an inherently high acceptability for solanaceous plants. These larvae also displayed varied, diet-dependent acceptabilities for non-solanaceous foods. Evidence for inductions of preference and inductions of specificity were observed in non-solanaceous-reared larvae. Similar changes in preference were also described for solanaceous-reared larvae tested in 2 -choice and 3 -choice assays. The data discussed supports both diet-induced changes in the palability of a <b>rearing</b> <b>plant,</b> as well as related plants, but does not support induced oligophagy.

40|$|Comparison of {{closely related}} species can {{elucidate}} adaptive differences in species characteristics. The present study compares the effect of experience on the host-finding behaviour of two Cotesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitoid species that differ in their degree of specialization. After multiple experiences with host larvae, females of the generalist parasitoid Cotesia glomerata showed a clear preference for volatiles from Pieris brassicae-infested Brussels sprouts leaves over P. rapae-infested Brussels sprouts leaves in two-choice tests (‘preference learning at herbivore level’). A single experience with a host {{did not lead to}} such preferences. Experience of adult C. glomerata with different P. brassicae-infested cabbage varieties or nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) led to preferences for the experienced plant-host complex in most cases (‘preference learning at plant level’). No effect of <b>rearing</b> <b>plant</b> (early adult learning) on plant preference was found. In contrast to the generalist C. glomerata, females of the specialist C. rubecula did not show preference learning at the herbivore level. At the plant level, experience with different P. rapae-infested cabbage varieties in no case resulted in a difference in preference between treatments. The results support the hypothesis that learning plays a more important role in searching in generalists than in specialist parasitoids. The behaviour of the generalist C. glomerata was more easily changed by experience than that of the specialist C. rubecula. ...|$|E
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar (L.)) are likely to experience multiple species diets in the field due to natural wandering and host switching which occurs with these insects. Nutritional indices in fourth and fifth instar gypsy moth larvae were studied {{in the field for}} insects that were switched to a second host species when they were fourth instars. The tree species used as hosts were northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis E. J. Hill), white oak (Q. alba L.), big-tooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michx.), and trembling aspen (P. tremuloides Michx.). Conclusions of this study include: 1) Insects which fed before the host switch on northern pin oak performed better after the host switch than did insects with other types of early dietary experience. While the northern pin oak-started insects had very low relative food consumption rates on their second host species immediately after the switch, one instar later they had the highest ranked consumption rates. During both instars they had the second highest efficiencies of converting ingested and digested food to body mass. High food consumption rates and relatively high efficiency of food conversion helped these insects to obtain the highest ranked mean relative growth rates in the fifth instar compared to the relative growth rates obtained by insects from any of the other first host species. 2) Among the four host species examined, a second host of trembling aspen was most advantageous for the insects. Feeding on this species after the switch led to higher larval weights and higher relative growth rates for insects than did any of the other second host species. The insects on trembling aspen attained excellent growth despite only mediocre to low food conversion efficiencies. The low efficiencies were offset by high relative food consumption rates. 3) Low food consumption rates often tend to be paired with high efficiency of conversion and vice versa. 4) There is no discernable tendency for the first plant species eaten to cause long-term inductions which affect the ability of gypsy moths to utilize subsequent host plants. Insects did not tend to consume more, grow faster, or be more efficient if their second host plant was either the same as their <b>rearing</b> <b>plant</b> or congeneric to it. Methods are delineated which allow values of nutritional indices to be obtained for insects on intact host plants under field conditions. These methods are useful for the purpose of answering questions about the relative effects that different diet treatments have on insect response...|$|E
40|$|Herbivore {{adaptation}} to plant resistance presents an evolutionary trade-off for plants. In {{the absence of}} plant resistance the plant is susceptible to non-adapted herbivores. However herbivores that are adapted to a particular plant resistance trait may increase {{the cost to the}} plant of expressing the trait if the herbivores use it as an attractant. The adapted herbivore escape hypothesis suggests that plants may get around this problem by only deploying the resistance when necessary in response to herbivore feeding. This hypothesis requires that adapted herbivore are able to discriminate in favour of resistant plants when making host choice decisions and that host selection is frequency-dependent such that the undamaged phenotype can escape when rare. This thesis set out to determine how host phenotype frequency affects choice by insect herbivores in both a mechanistic and a functional sense. In addition, a study was made of the conditions under which induced strategies may be evolutionary stable when under selection by adapted and non-adapted herbivores in the absence of physiological costs of defence. The role of learning and host-deprivation in the oviposition acceptance behaviour of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutridae)) was investigated. Previous experience with a host plant increased acceptance in a host-specific way. Discrimination between host plants was independent of deprivation. Existing models of insect oviposition acceptance do not adequately explain these findings. A new model- The Incremental Acceptance Model- is proposed. In laboratory trials containing mixtures of damaged and undamaged Brassica oleraceae L. and B. napus L. plants at different frequencies, a key assumption of the adapted herbivore escape hypothesis was supported. The probability of oviposition by the diamondback moth was dependent on the frequency-of the damaged state and undamaged Brassica plants were more likely to escape herbivory than were damaged plants. The larval <b>rearing</b> <b>plant</b> affected the oviposition preference of the moths for damaged plants. The evolution of plant defence strategies was modelled under frequency-dependent selection by nonadapted and adapted, or partially adapted herbivores. A stable state always arose that contained both the defended and undefended plant phenotypes, except under certain restrictive conditions. Inducibility formed a pure ESS provided the defended phenotype was not fitter than the undefended phenotype and the plant defence reduced the feeding damage by non-adapted herbivores. In contrast with previous models, induction is not necessarily favoured when herbivory is predictable or the costs of expressing defence intermediate. It is argued that frequency-dependent herbivory is a major omission from previous studies of the evolution of plant defence strategies...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a study {{investigating}} the influence of elevated CO 2 on species interactions across three trophic levels: a plant (Brassica oleracea), two aphid herbivores (the generalist Myzus persicae and the specialist Brevicoryne brassicae), and two natural enemies (the coccinellid Hippodamia convergens (ladybird) and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae). Brassica oleracea <b>plants</b> <b>reared</b> under elevated CO 2 conditions (650 ppmv vs. 350 ppmv) were larger and had decreased water and nitrogen content. Brevicoryne brassicae <b>reared</b> on <b>plants</b> grown in elevated CO 2 were larger and accumulated more fat, while there was no change in M. persicae traits. Fecundity of individual aphids appeared to be increased when <b>reared</b> on <b>plants</b> grown in elevated CO 2. However, these differences were generally lost when aphids were reared in colonies, suggesting that such changes in plant quality will have subtile effects on aphid intraspecific interactions. Nevertheless, CO 2 treatment did influence aphid distribution on plants, with significantly fewer M. persicae found on the shoots, and B. brassicae was only found on senescing leaves, when colonies were <b>reared</b> on <b>plants</b> grown in elevated CO 2. We reared B. brassicae and M. persicae in competition on plants grown at both the CO 2 concentration treatments. We found a significantly lower ratio of M. persicae: B. brassicae on plants grown under elevated CO 2 conditions, strongly suggesting that increasing CO 2 concentrations can alter the outcome of competition among insect herbivores. This was also reflected in the distribution of the aphids on the plants. While the CO 2 treatment did not influence where B. brassicae were found, fewer M. persicae were present on senescing leaves under elevated CO 2 conditions. Changes in plant quality resulting from the CO 2 treatments did not appear to alter aphid quality as prey species, as the number consumed by the ladybird H. convergens, and the number parasitised by the parasitoid wasp D. rapae, did not change. To our knowledge, this study provides the first empirical evidence that changes in host plant quality mediated by increasing levels of CO 2 can alter the outcome of interspecific competition among insect herbivores...|$|R

In May, one-year-old self-rooted plants of cvs. Arbequina IRTA-i 18, Koroneiki and Frantoio were introduced in fertigation {{and at the end of}} June were selected for uniformity of growth, distributed in the two zones and subjected to treatments: intact <b>plants</b> <b>reared</b> upright; <b>plant</b> topped at the first internode distinguishable with stem <b>reared</b> erect; <b>plant</b> cut at the base on the oldest wood. Four plants were used per treatment and cultivars distributed by blocks for each area. Similarly, fouryear-old ‘Coratina’ plants (three plants per treatment), raised on a single stem and acting on individual shoots (intact or topped) throughout the canopy, were utilized. The remarks focus on the origin of the shoots from thedifferent meristems and the growth and behavior of their lateral buds in the following season. Observations led to identification in the same bud complex of a vertical succession of two different types of buds: the “principal” bud and, in upper position, the “accessory” bud, the former with a reproductive role, the latter specialized in environmental exploitation (vegetative role). Starting from the primordia of an accessory bud, the apical meristem became “mature” growing in the time with important differences between the cultivars, acquiring only in the second year of growth for ‘Arbequina’ and ‘Koroneiki’ (early bearing cultivars) the capability to produce principal lateral buds able to develop in the inflorescences: with ‘Frantoio’ the “aging” of two years is not enough to move the principal buds to develop inflorescences. In the “mature” shoots the principal lateral buds can develop only as panicles, and the production of new bearing vegetation is limited to the central leader; all branches coming from accessory buds are dedicated to burst new vegetation.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{generate}} physiologically synchronous groups of insects {{is vital to the}} performance of investigations designed to test insect responses to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. During a given instar, the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii, increase in depth but not in length or width. A staging system to identify physiologically synchronous 4 th instar and pharate adult silverleaf whiteflies based on increasing body depth and the development of the adult eye has been described previously. This study determined the effect of host plant identity on ecdysteroid fluctuations during the 4 th instar and pharate adult stages, and on the depth, length and width dimensions of 4 th instar/pharate adult whiteflies. When grown on the pubescent-leafed green bean, tomato and poinsettia plants, these stages were significantly shorter and narrower, but attained greater depth than when grown on the glabrous-leafed cotton, collard and sweet potato plants. Thus, leaf pubescence is associated with reduced length and width dimensions, but increased depth dimensions in 4 th instars and pharate adults. For all host plants, nymphal ecdysteroid titers peaked just prior to the initiation of adult development. However, when <b>reared</b> on pubescent-leafed <b>plants,</b> the initiation of adult development typically occurred in nymphs that had attained a depth of 0. 2 to 0. 25 mm (Stage 3 - 4). When <b>reared</b> on glabrous-leafed <b>plants,</b> the initiation of adult development typically occurred earlier, in nymphs that had attained a depth of only 0. 15 - 0. 18 mm (Stage 2 Old - early 3).

Thus far, very few studies have examined interactions between genetically distinct populations of a wild plant species and associated consumers in a multitrophic framework. Here, we compared the development of a specialist (Pieris rapae) and a generalist (Mamestra brassicae) insect herbivore and their endoparasitoids (Cotesia rubecula and Microplitis mediator, respectively) on three wild populations and one cultivar of B. oleracea under controlled greenhouse conditions.

40|$|Crops {{producing}} insecticidal toxins {{derived from}} the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely planted to manage insect pests. Bt crops can provide an effective tool for pest management; however, the evolution of Bt resistance can diminish this benefit. The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis H€ubner, is a significant pest of maize and is widely managed with Bt maize in the Midwest of the United States. When Bt crops are grown in conjunction with non-Bt refuges, fitness costs of Bt resistance can delay the evolution of resistance. Importantly, fitness costs often vary with ecological factors, including host-plant genotype and diapause. In this study, we examined fitness costs associated with Cry 1 F resistance in O. nubilalis when insects were reared on three maize lines. Fitness costs were tested in two experiments. One experiment assessed the fitness costs when Cry 1 F-resistant and Cry 1 F-susceptible insects were <b>reared</b> on <b>plants</b> as larvae and experienced diapause.
