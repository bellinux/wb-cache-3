60|$|The same {{motive force}} appears in trade. There are geniuses in trade, {{as well as}} in war, or the State, or letters; and the reason why this or that man is {{fortunate}} is not to be told. It lies in the man; that is all anybody can tell you about it. See him and you will know as easily why he succeeds, as, if you see Napoleon, you would comprehend his fortune. In the new objects we recognize the old game, the Habit of fronting the fact, and not dealing with it at second hand, through the perceptions of somebody else. Nature seems to authorize trade, as soon as you see the natural merchant, who appears not so much a private agent as her factor and Minister of Commerce. His natural probity combines with his insight into the fabric of society to put him above tricks, and he communicates to all his own faith that contracts are of no private interpretation. The habit of his mind is a <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> of natural equity and public advantage; and he inspires respect and the wish to deal with him, both for the quiet spirit of honor which attends him, and for the intellectual pastime which the spectacle of so much ability affords. This immensely stretched trade, which makes the capes of the Southern Ocean his wharves, and the Atlantic Sea his familiar port, centres in his brain only; and nobody in the universe can make his place good. In his parlor I see very well that he has been at hard work this morning, with that knitted brow and that settled humor, which all his desire to be courteous cannot shake off. I see plainly how many firm acts have been done; how many valiant noes have this day been spoken, when others would have uttered ruinous yeas. I see, with the pride of art and skill of masterly arithmetic and power of remote combination, the consciousness of being an agent and playfellow of the original laws of the world. He too believes that none can supply him, and that a man must be born to trade or he cannot learn it.|$|E

Concrete musical time can be measured in an objective way, for example, through <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> of time external to the listener, such as clocks. Subjective musical time refers to the musical time that cannot be measured objectively: it depends entirely on the listener who experiences the musical work.

Chapter one defines the relationship between time and different forms of art, as well as the relationship between time and music. Chapter two defines concrete and subjective musical time. Chapter three discusses recording technology and the changes it imposes on the musical aesthetic ritual. By musical aesthetic ritual, I mean the agreed-upon physical actions which are related to the activities involving music and the experience of music.

Elution conditions {{were based on the}} chromatographic method developed by (Sander et al. 1994) with modifications. Two mobile phases were used: phase A, composed of methanol and water (96 : 4, v:v) and phase B, tert-butyl methyl ether. The flow rate was 1.2  mL min− 1 and the injection volume 40  μL. The column was thermostated at 30  °C. The separation of carotenoid standards and extracts was carried out using a linear mobile phase gradient from 50 : 50 (volume ratio, A/B) to 37 : 63 (volume ratio, A/B) in 12  min; then the system was restored to its initial condition for 5  min. The concentrations of lycopene, 13 -cis-lycopene and phytoene were calculated using response factors relative to the internal standard, β-apo- 8 -carotenal.

It is unclear what role plays Hsp 60, but our recent {{data indicate that}} it may contribute to pathogenesis as an autoantigen. Its role in the induction of cytokine production, pro- or anti-inflammatory, was not elucidated, except that we found that peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) from patients or from healthy controls did not respond with cytokine production upon stimulation by Hsp 60 in vitro with patterns that would differentiate patients from controls with statistical significance. This “negative” outcome appeared when the data were pooled and analyzed with conventional statistical methods. We re-analyzed our data with non-conventional statistical methods based on data mining using the {{classification and regression tree}} learning algorithm and clustering methodology. The results indicate that by focusing on IFN-γ and IL- 2 levels before and after Hsp 60 stimulation of PBMC in each patient, it is possible to differentiate patients from controls. A major general conclusion is that when trying to identify disease markers such as levels of cytokines and Hsp 60, <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> obtained from pooled data from many patients may be misleading.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the linkage between}} performance-based regulations and the standards that form {{a crucial part of}} the overall performance-based regulatory system (PBRS). There are many ways in which codes and standards may be linked, but generally performancerelated standards should employ a structure that is complementary to that of the code. Traditionally codes have made direct references to standards that then provide a greater level of detail on how a function is to be accomplished or verified. In a PBRS that does not require specific approaches it is not clear if direct <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> in the regulation is appropriate or whether these would be in the â€œAcceptable Solutions. â€? What then is the scope of a performance-related standard and would the standard be different if it supports the functional requirement or performance criterion as opposed to only acceptable solutions? In the Performance Codes that have been developed by various countries there are many similar objectives, functional requirements, and performance requirements. To what extent will it be possible to develop and agree on common standards on a regional or international scale? And finally, how will the standards affect the development and application of the performance codes themselves? In particular, standards have {{a significant role in the}} regulatory acceptance of compliance with code provisions, and the same would be expected under a performance system. These issues will be discussed from the international perspective of the authors and their direct involvement in the development and use of performance codes and standards in their own countries...|$|E

The structural and traditional methods are compared on a complete sample of 190 galaxies in the Coma cluster. The morphological types derived by both methods agree to within 15 or 20 %, the same rate as among traditional morphologists alone, thus showing that our morphological classes do coincide with the traditional ones. The galaxies with discrepant types are mostly faint (mag_B > 16. 0), or have features typical of spirals, but which have not been detected, noticed or taken into account by traditional morphologists. The rate of agreement is also good for galaxies in a distant cluster (z ~ 0. 4). The structural method, gives highly reproducible results, never reached by traditional estimations of the morphological type. Thus, the morphological types obtained with this method should be preferred. The advantages of the method are further demonstrated by new results on the properties of galaxies in clusters.
