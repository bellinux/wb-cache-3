5|$|The Original Six {{era of the}} National Hockey League (NHL) {{began in}} 1942 with {{the demise of the}} Brooklyn Americans, {{reducing}} the league to six teams: Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. This structure <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> for a quarter century; the era ended in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size adding six expansion teams.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the Byzantines, Khalid had {{prepared}} {{for such a}} contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims {{time to prepare for}} battle. At the center, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the center <b>remained</b> <b>stable.</b>|$|E

5|$|The third-season premiere was {{watched by}} 3.36million American viewers, an {{increase}} from the 2.42million viewers who viewed the second-season finale. Ratings <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> for the first ten episodes, and the ninth episode featured the most viewers {{of the season with}} 3.44million. Beginning with the eleventh episode, ratings dropped to a consistent viewership of a mid-2million per episode, and the final episode before the hiatus was watched by 2.66million viewers. When the series returned from its hiatus, viewers had decreased to 2.35million, and the final two episodes garnered only 1.78and 2.15million viewers respectively.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each {{letter of the}} alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change {{between the first and}} second rating. Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.|$|E
5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} centuries, the Byzantines were usually on the defensive, and avoided open field battles, preferring {{to retreat to}} their {{fortified}} strongholds. Only after 740 did they begin to launch counterstrikes of their own, but still the Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of Asia Minor. With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, the tide gradually turned. Over a period of fifty years from ca. 920 to 976, the Byzantines finally broke through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia. The last century of the Arab–Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria, but the border <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> until {{the appearance of a}} new people, the Seljuk Turks, after 1060.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, {{the capital of}} Egypt was moved with different cultures through multiple locations {{up and down the}} Nile, such as Thebes and Memphis, depending on which dynasty was in power. After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt around 331 BC, the capital became the city named for him, Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast. This situation <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> for nearly a thousand years. After the army of the Arabian Caliph Umar captured the region in the 7th century, shortly after the death of Muhammad, he wanted to establish a new capital. When Alexandria fell in September 641, Amr ibn al-As, the commander of the conquering army, founded a new capital on the eastern bank of the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{ridership}} {{increased by}} 10 percent and by 12 percent the following year. In 1971 and 1972, it saw a 20-percent increase—the latter representing {{the first year}} with InterRail tickets. By then the annual ridership had reached 175,000. In 1970, an additional train was stationed at Flåm, which {{made it possible to}} travel a round trip between Flåm and Bergen in a day. Between 1975 and 1982, NSB started running direct trains between Ål and Flåm. In 1978, the morning express trains on the Bergen Line started stopping at Myrdal, allowing better access for tourists to the Flåm Line. Traffic increased further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and then <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> through the decade.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan {{to suggest that it}} is not a receptor, but instead is involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Tommy Aldridge {{filled in}} on drums when Brian Downey was unable to, {{and became a}} full member when Downey left shortly thereafter. This line-up <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> through to 2000, when the group {{recorded}} a live album, One Night Only. The band went on to tour the US playing clubs in early 2001, but Wharton had already left the band {{by the time of}} the tour. From 2000 to 2003, Mendoza toured with Ted Nugent, and with Whitesnake in 2004. Sykes released two solo albums during 2002–03, while Gorham worked with his band 21 Guns. Thin Lizzy performed sporadically during this period, recruiting some musicians for single tours, such as bass guitarist Guy Pratt for the Global Chaos Tour of 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Losses had <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> {{since the}} 1990s at 17–20% per year {{attributable}} {{to a variety}} of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E
5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their {{recording}} career Powderfinger {{consisted of}} five members: Bernard Fanning was a vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist and harmonicist and contributed lyrics; John Collins was their bass guitarist; Ian Haug {{was their first}} lead vocalist but mostly provided backing vocals and guitar; Darren Middleton was their co-lead guitarist, keyboardist, backing vocalist and sometime lead vocalist; Jon Coghill was their drummer and percussionist. The lineup <b>remained</b> <b>stable</b> from 1992 to their disbandment in November 2010. Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies. The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy.|$|E
