5000|$|The red {{pileated finch}} (Coryphospingus cucullatus), {{also known as}} the <b>red-crested</b> <b>finch,</b> is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest. This is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as [...] "least concern".|$|E

Here we provide reproductive information on 16 active nests. This information may be valuable to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of this bird, and to design plans to manage it. Nesting activities occurred from October to February. Clutches consisted of two to three eggs (2. 06 ± 0. 25), which were laid on consecutive days. Incubation usually started the morning the females laid their last egg and lasted 11. 27 ± 0. 47 days. Hatching was synchronous, or happened at a one-day interval. The nestling stage lasted 12 ± 0. 89 days. Only females incubated the eggs and they fed the young more often than the males did. Overall nesting success, from incubation to fledging, was 28. 2 %. Nest architecture and egg color proved to be diagnostic characteristics of Coryphospingus, supporting its maintenance as a distinct genus within the recently proposed sub-family Tachyphoninae. Red-crested Finches showed a preference for certain nesting sites, i. e., forest borders or a Cerrado in late regeneration stage. This information can be useful to programs aiming to release illegally trapped individuals...|$|E
