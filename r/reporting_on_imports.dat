40|$|Yellow fever virus (YFV), as {{the first}} proven human-pathogenic virus, is still a major public health problem with a {{dramatic}} upsurge in recent years. This is a <b>report</b> <b>on</b> four <b>imported</b> cases of yellow fever virus into China identified by whole genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and {{the results showed that}} these four viruses were highly homologous with Angola 71 strains (AY 968064). In addition, effective mutations of amino acids were not observed in the E protein domain of four viruses, thus confirming the effectiveness of the YFV- 17 D vaccine (X 03700).

50|$|In this {{reporting}} period, the Government {{restricted the}} quantity of Christian literature in the Uzbek language that registered central religious organizations could import into the country. Authorities also confiscated Christian literature in Uzbek that had been legally imported into the country. In previous reporting periods, government authorities told church leaders that all Christian literature in Uzbek is considered contraband, {{even if it was}} legally imported. For historical and cultural reasons, evangelical pastors generally preach in Russian while offering limited services in the Uzbek language--the official national language and the one linked most closely to the majority Muslim population. In this reporting period, the CRA allowed some materials, such as limited quantities of Uzbek translations of some books of the Bible. The Government requires the Bible Society to file regular <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> its printing, <b>importing,</b> and translating activities.|$|R

2500|$|One way of {{attributing}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is {{to measure the}} embedded emissions (also referred to as [...] "embodied emissions") of goods that are being consumed. Emissions are usually measured according to production, rather than consumption. For example, in the main international treaty on climate change (the UNFCCC), countries <b>report</b> <b>on</b> emissions produced within their borders, e.g., the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. Under a production-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions <b>on</b> <b>imported</b> goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country. Under a consumption-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions <b>on</b> <b>imported</b> goods are attributed to the importing country, rather than the exporting, country.|$|R

50|$|The Amador Ledger {{entered the}} twentieth century with a change of ownership, but with its long-held {{politics}} in place. On January 2, 1900, the Amador County Publishing Company acquired the Amador Ledger and discontinued the Amador Republican, which it had owned for several years. The paper continued to advocate for Republican politics and to <b>report</b> <b>on</b> issues of <b>import</b> to the community in general, in particular {{the status of the}} local mining industry. Another transfer of ownership and editorship put Richard Webb {{at the helm of the}} Amador Ledger on June 8, 1901, along with “some of the wealthiest and most prominent men in the county.” Under Webb’s guidance, the Amador Ledger claimed the county’s largest circulation by the end of the decade, with the masthead touting: “It pays the business man to advertise in the Ledger.” The paper's business-friendly stance extended to its coverage of local issues, with heavy criticism of miners' efforts to unionize.|$|R

40|$|Background Malaria {{remains a}} problem for many {{countries}} classified as malaria free through cases imported from endemic regions. Imported cases to non-endemic countries often result in delays in diagnosis, are expensive to treat, and can sometimes cause secondary local transmission. The movement of malaria in endemic countries has {{also contributed to the}} spread of drug resistance and threatens long-term eradication goals. Here we focused on quantifying the international movements of malaria to improve our understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the design of mitigation strategies. Methods In this meta-analysis, we studied the database of publicly available nationally <b>reported</b> statistics <b>on</b> <b>imported</b> malaria in the past 10 years, covering more than 50   000 individual cases. We obtained data from 40 non-endemic countries and recorded the geographical variations. Findings Infection movements were strongly skewed towards a small number of high-traffic routes between 2005 and 2015, with the west Africa region accounting for 56 % (13   947 / 24   941) of all imported cases to non-endemic countries with a reported travel destination, and France and the UK receiving the highest number of cases, with more than 4000 reported cases per year on average. Countries strongly linked by movements of imported cases are grouped by historical, language, and travel ties. There is strong spatial clustering of plasmodium species types. Interpretation The architecture of the air network, historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria endemicity contribute to highly heterogeneous patterns of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites transported. With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, malaria control altering local transmission, and the threat of drug resistance, understanding these patterns and their drivers is increasing in importance...|$|R

50|$|In general, Japan has not {{imported}} {{an unusually}} large amount {{as a share of}} its GNP, but it has been highly dependent <b>on</b> <b>imports</b> for a variety of critical raw materials.
