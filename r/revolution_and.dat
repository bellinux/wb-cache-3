5|$|The historiography of Cornelio Saavedra {{is closely}} related to that of Mariano Moreno. As Saavedra had a {{conflict}} with him in the Junta, the perspectives towards him complement those about Moreno. The first liberal historians praised Moreno {{as the leader of the}} <b>Revolution</b> <b>and</b> a great historical man; Saavedra was treated either as a weak man overwhelmed by Moreno, or as a counter-revolutionary. This perspective did not acknowledge that Saavedra, as head of the Regiment of Patricians, was the most popular and influential man of the city since before the <b>Revolution,</b> <b>and</b> that he was reported to be staunch, cunning and ruthless.|$|E

5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the French Army {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin.
