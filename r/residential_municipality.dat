40|$|International audienceThis debate {{specifically}} {{focuses on}} densification as a particular dimension of (post-) suburbanization. In the introduction, we discuss densification, along with ‘compactness’ and ‘intensification’, conceptual terms {{that have become}} buzzwords within urban planning. Objectives associated with these tend to be presented in the literature within a normative framework, structured by {{a critique of the}} negative effects attributed to sprawl. The perspective here is different. It is not normative but critical, and articulated around the analysis of political and social issues, related to the transformation of wider metropolitan space. Three main themes are developed: (1) the politics of densification (the environmental arguments favouring densification are highly plastic, and are thus often used to defend projects or initiatives which are actually determined by other agendas); (2) why morphology matters (a similar number of houses or square metres can be established in many different ways, and those different ways have political and social meaning); (3) the diversity of suburban densification regimes (it is not only the landscapes of the suburbs that are diverse, but also the local bodies governing them—between the small <b>residential</b> <b>municipalities</b> of the Paris periurbs and the large inner suburbs of Toronto lies a broad spectrum) ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown the impact of individual characteristics on intergenerational proximity but has largely ignored the regional dimension of such proximity. In this paper, we examine the regional variation in intergenerational proximity in the Netherlands. We address this issue by incorporating indicators of urbanisation and regional culture {{in an analysis of}} the likelihood that adult children live within daily reach (within a distance of 5 or 20 km) of their older parents. We also depict the spatial variation in intergenerational proximity in maps. Employing logistic regression on nearly 5 million parent-child dyads extracted from register data, we find that the degree of urbanisation of the <b>residential</b> <b>municipality</b> of the two generations shows contrasting effects: a positive association for the degree of urbanisation of the parents' municipality, a negative association for the children's. Older parents living in areas in which more conservative and collectivist attitudes prevail {{are more likely to have}} their adult children living close to them. After accounting for the municipality dummies, the explanatory power of the model improves considerably. However, substantial spatial variation in intergenerational proximity remains largely unexplained after controlling for the regional characteristics.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: {{this study}} aims to {{evaluate}} parturition distribution of live-born children within the First Health Regional Administration (GERES I) {{in the state of}} Pernambuco, Brazil in 2012. Methods: live Birth Certificates were used to evaluate displacements between pregnant women's residential municipalities and birth localities. Flux maps were constructed to represent pregnant women transferred to Recife, and the estimated number of live-borns with high-risk and regular births was calculated for each municipality. Results: in 2012, only 50 % of the births of live babies in the GERES I took place at the original <b>residential</b> <b>municipality</b> of the mother. In Recife, the number of childbirths was 1. 5 times greater than expected for this year, with 56 % representing non-residents. Eleven municipalities of the GERES I have maternity hospitals, however, none of these responded to the expected number of regular risk births. Conclusions: this disruption of the obstetric network leads to the disrespecting of women's right to know beforehand the place of childbirth and to create bonds with it. Municipalities perform fewer childbirths than expected, resulting in unnecessary transfers and the overloading of maternity hospitals in Recife...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} spatial {{distribution}} of suicide incidence rate in a <b>residential</b> <b>municipality</b> {{of the state of}} Espírito Santo (ES), Brazil, from 2003 to 2007. METHODS: Ecologic study of the exploratory kind, based on secondary data. Deaths per suicide, which took place in each municipality of ES, were included in the data according to information provided by the Mortality Information System. For the spatial data analysis, a Bayesian approach was used (Global empirical and Local Bayesian ones) to correct epidemiological rates. Moran's I index was calculated to a worldwide spatial level dependence, and Local Moran (LISA) to a local spatial correlation. The following software applications were used: Excel; R 2. 6. 2; SPSS 11. 5 and TerraView 3. 3. 1. RESULTS: The geographical localization of the municipalities that showed an incidence rate characterized as the average for suicide after adjustment (EBest Global) forms a corridor in the countryside. Some common characteristics among these municipalities are: a) immigration (Italians, Pomeranians/ Germans); b) rural population (average of 53 %); c) supporting economy (agriculture, husbandry and livestock).

Several {{studies have shown}} that pesticides used in agricultural fields can contaminate the domestic environment and thus be an important source of pesticide exposure of populations residing nearby. Epidemiological studies that have examined the health effects of in utero pesticide exposure from residence near agricultural activities suggest adverse effects, but the results are inconsistent. Our purpose was to investigate the effect on intrauterine growth of such exposure due to agricultural activities in the <b>residential</b> <b>municipality.</b> Methods: A prospective birth cohort recruited 3421 pregnant women in a French agricultural region (Brittany, 2002 - 2006) through gynecologists, ultrasonographers, and maternity hospitals during routine prenatal care visits before 19 weeks of gestation. The national agricultural census in 2000 provided the percentages of the municipality area devoted to cultivation of corn, wheat, colza, peas, potatoes, and fresh vegetables. Results: Birth weight and the risk of fetal growth restriction were not associated with agricultural activities in the municipality of residence in early pregnancy. Children whose mother lived in a municipality where peas were grown had a smaller head circumference at birth than those in municipalities not growing peas (- 0. 2 cm, p = 0. 0002).

40|$|Few {{studies have}} tried to assess the {{empirical}} impact of transport cost on electoral turnout. Unfortunately, these researches suffer from different limits, especially limites related to the endogeneity of the voting station localization. Our study, based on French data, overcomes the main usual empirical difficulties. In particular, the French case provides a very valuable opportunity for testing the impact of transport cost on individual decision of turnout, because voters can be registered in another municipality than their <b>residential</b> <b>municipality.</b> As such, {{some of them have}} to travel important distance in order to cast their ballot. And this distance is totally exogenous to the electoral manipulation of places of voting location potentially made by local administration. So, we show that distance, and in fine cost of voting, have a highly significant impact on electoral turnout: at average distance (122 km) a 1 % increase of distance induces a 0. 05 % decrease at the first round of 2012 presidential election and 0. 04 % at the second round. This result is robust to many tests: if we change the empirical method carried out or the election studied or if we control for the weight of the largest distance, the results remain the same. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The current cross-sectional study examined the association between intake levels and the prevalence of eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis in Japanese children. Methods: Subjects were 23, 388 schoolchildren aged 6 - 15 years residing in Okinawa. The presence of eczema and/ or rhinoconjunctivitis was determined according to the criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. A brief diet history questionnaire for children and adolescents was administered to acquire information on dietary factors. Adjustment was made for age, sex, <b>residential</b> <b>municipality,</b> number of siblings, smoking in the household, body mass index, paternal and maternal history of allergic diseases, and paternal and maternal educational level.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that there are inequalities with regard to traffic accident risk between different social categories. This study describes the influence of the type of <b>residential</b> <b>municipality</b> (with or without deprived urban areas, "ZUS, zones urbaines sensibles"), used as an indicator of contextual deprivation, on the incidence and severity of road trauma involving people of under 25 years of age in the Rhône. METHOD: Injury data were taken from The Rhône Road Trauma Registry. The study covers the 2004 - 2007 period, with 13, 589 young casualties. The incidence of traffic injury of all severities were computed according to the type of municipality and the age, gender, and type of road user. The ratios of the incidences of deprived municipalities, compared with others were calculated. Subsequently the severity factors and incidences according to the severity level (ISS 1 - 8, ISS 9 +) were studied. RESULTS: For the main types of road users except motorized two-wheeler users, the incidences were higher in the deprived municipalities: the greatest difference was for pedestrians, where the incidences were almost twice those of other municipalities. This excess risk, constituting a health inequality topic rarely considered, was even greater in municipalities with two or three ZUSs. It was essentially observed for minor injuries among motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. CONCLUSIONS: While the incidence increased among people less than 25 years of age, the severity of road injuries was lower in deprived neighborhoods, contrary to what is suggested by other studies. This lower severity disappeared when taking into account the crash characteristics. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: The incidence of injuries as a pedestrian, cyclist or motorist is higher among young people living in deprived municipalities. These areas should therefore be the targets of dedicated education programs, as well as further investigations about urban planning...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Universal health-care {{coverage}} has attracted {{the interest of}} policy makers {{as a way of}} achieving health equity. However, previous reports have shown that despite universal coverage, socioeconomic disparity persists in access to high-tech invasive care, such as cardiac treatment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic status and care of aortic stenosis in the context of Japan's health-care system, which is mainly publicly funded. METHODS: We chose aortic stenosis in older people as a target because such patients are likely to be affected by socioeconomic disparity. Using a large Japanese claim-based inpatient database, we identified 12, 893 isolated aortic stenosis patients aged over 65 years who were hospitalized between July 2010 and March 2012. Municipality socioeconomic status was represented by the mean household income of the patients' <b>residential</b> <b>municipality,</b> categorized into quartiles. The likelihood of undergoing aortic valve surgery and in-hospital mortality was regressed against socioeconomic status level with adjustments for hospital volume, regional number of cardiac surgeons per 1 million population, and patients' clinical status. RESULTS: We found {{no significant differences between the}} highest and lowest quartile groups in surgical indication (odds ratio, 0. 84; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 69 - 1. 03) or in-hospital mortality (1. 00; 0. 68 - 1. 48). Hospital volume was significantly associated with lower postoperative mortality (odds ratio of the highest volume tertile to the lowest, 0. 49; 0. 34 - 0. 71). CONCLUSIONS: Under Japan's current universal health-care coverage, municipality socioeconomic status did not appear to have a systematic relationship with either treatment decision for surgical intervention or postoperative survival following aortic valve surgery among older patients. Our results imply that universal health-care coverage with high publicly funded coverage offers equal access to high-tech cardiovascular care...|$|E
