Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really want in a survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every now and again to <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E

In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possible with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Arch Bishop and Bishop Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that [...] "she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she {{was responsible for the}} blood of the recently executed". She officially replied the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured [...] "that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom": Troilius reported that [...] "only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best". The Arch Bishop reported, that he observed [...] "tears of rage and sorrow" [...] in her eyes.

On the railroad to Paris, I became capable of taking a sensible view of my position. I could now <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> my husband's reception of me--after the first surprise and the first happiness had passed away--might not have justified his mother's confidence in him. Admitting that I ran a risk in going back to Miserrimus Dexter, should I not have been equally rash, in another way, if I had returned, uninvited, to a husband who had declared that our conjugal happiness was impossible, and that our married life was at an end?

6000|$|It was {{therefore}} {{from her husband}} I could never remove my eyes: I beset him {{in a manner that}} might have made him uneasy. I went even so far as to engage him in conversation. Didn't he know, hadn't he come into it as a matter of course?--that question hummed in my brain. Of course he knew; otherwise he wouldn't return my stare so queerly. His wife had told him what I wanted and he was amiably amused at my impotence. He didn't laugh--he wasn't a laugher: his system was to present to my irritation, so that I should crudely expose myself, a conversational blank as vast as his big bare brow. It always happened that I turned away with a settled conviction from these unpeopled expanses, which seemed to complete each other geographically and to symbolise together Drayton Deane's want of voice, want of form. He simply hadn't the art to use what he knew; he literally was incompetent to take up the duty where Corvick had left it. I went still further--it was the only glimpse of happiness I had. I made up my mind that the duty didn't appeal to him. He wasn't interested, he didn't care. Yes, it quite comforted me to believe him too stupid to have joy of the thing I lacked. He was as stupid after as he had been before, and that deepened for me the golden glory in which the mystery was wrapped. I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions. I had above all to <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> with Vereker's death the major incentive dropped. He was still there to be honoured by what might be done--he was no longer there to give it his sanction. Who alas but he had the authority? ...|$|E
60|$|The thing I {{had been}} most {{sensible}} of in that talk with George Gravener {{was the way}} Saltram's name kept out of it. It seemed {{to me at the}} time that we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared more probable there had been on my companion's part no conscious avoidance. Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons--the simple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as for good, he said nothing to Gravener's imagination. That honest man didn't fear him--he was too much disgusted with him. No more did I, doubtless, and for very much the same reason. I treated my friend's story as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs. Saltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon's death without having had news of Miss Anvoy's return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no more of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had never TOO disconcertedly believed. I began to ask myself how people who suited each other so little could please each other so much. The charm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet superficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and grace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts. They might dote on each other's persons, but how could they know each other's souls? How could they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same horizon? Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered when, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady in the house. A passion that had brought her back across the wintry ocean was as much of a passion as was needed. No impulse equally strong indeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which, however, I reflected only long enough to <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> it was none of my business. Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the difference was not simply that of her marks of mourning. Mrs. Mulville told me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome girl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a year. This explanation indeed didn't wholly content me, not even when I learned that her mourning had a double cause--learned that poor Mr. Anvoy, giving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving next to nothing, had died a few weeks before.|$|E

40|$|Monetary {{policy has}} been dealing with {{globalization}} for centuries as the magnificent Galerie Dorée at the main headquarters of the Banque de France reminds us. The Banque de France moved into those beautiful quarters in 1808, exactly two centuries ago, and the statues in {{the four corners of}} the Gallery are said to represent the four corners of the globe: Europe, Africa, America, and Asia. I note with some trepidation that the statue in the European corner is wearing Roman legionary dress, with a sword in her hands and a globe at her feet, and is accompanied by a horse, while the American has only a bow and arrow and is accompanied by a lizard.
