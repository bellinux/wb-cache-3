5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his <b>rebounding</b> prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself {{as one of the best}} rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's <b>rebounding</b> prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about <b>rebounding,</b> but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rebound</b> of {{thoughts}} after thought suppression is widely documented. Much less {{is known about}} the effects of suppression on <b>rebound</b> of behavior. The current studies show that suppressing thoughts (Experiment 1 and 2) and suppressing behavior (Experiment 3) may cause <b>rebound</b> of behavior. In Experiment 1 suppressing thoughts of thirst <b>rebounded</b> in enhanced drinking, in Experiment 2 suppressing aggressive thoughts <b>rebounded</b> in subsequent aggression, and in Experiment 3 suppressing laughter <b>rebounded</b> in enhanced subsequent laughing. Supporting the Motivational Inference Model of postsuppressional <b>rebound,</b> the studies show that behavioral <b>rebound</b> is reduced if participants are led to believe that suppression is difficult for everybody (Experiments 1 and 2). Also consistent with this model is the finding that motivation to do the suppressed behavior mediated <b>rebound</b> (Experiment 3). The implications for <b>rebound</b> of unwanted behaviors are discussed...|$|R
5|$|White was {{the only}} player {{in the nation to}} lead his team in the five major {{statistical}} categories: points (13.4), <b>rebounding</b> (9.3), assists (5.0), steals (1.1) and blocks (0.9). He was the first cyclone since Fred Hoiberg (1993–94) and second ever to lead the team in points, rebounds and assists. His final Big 12 rankings were 2nd in both <b>rebounding</b> and field goal percentage (53.4%) as well as 5th in assists. He ranked 34th, 36th and 57th nationally in those same statistics. His 316 rebounds and 170 assists ranked 7th and 10th all time in school history for single-season totals. His single-season rebound total was the most by a Cyclone since 1978 (Dean Uthoff, 378).|$|E
5|$|Anchored by {{defensive}} stalwart Russell, {{the tough}} Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial <b>rebounding</b> champion Russell, who then either {{passed it on}} to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later succeeded in by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and <b>rebounding</b> champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.|$|E

5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and <b>rebounding</b> prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary.|$|E

After a 45-minute private workout with Pitino, where Nowitzki showcased his versatile shooting, <b>rebounding,</b> and passing skills, the Boston coach immediately compared him to Celtics legend Larry Bird; Pitino assured Nowitzki that he would draft him with the Celtics' first-round draft pick at #10.|$|E
