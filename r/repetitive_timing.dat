The authors {{manipulated}} {{the width of}} a timing target in continuous circle drawing to determine whether a more stringent spatial-timing criterion would produce an increase in participants ’ (N = 30) temporal variability. They also examined the effect of the computational method of determining cycle duration. There was no effect of spatial precision on temporal variability in circle drawing, and tapping and circle drawing were found to use the same criterion. Those findings lend strong support to the earlier view of R. B. Ivry, R. M. Spencer, H. N. Zelaznik, and J. Diedrichsen (2002), who argued that continuous tasks such as circle drawing are timed differ-ently from discrete-like tasks such as tapping. Therefore, {{the results of the present}} study provide support for the event and emergent tim-ing frameworks.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} paced {{repetitive}} movements {{with respect to}} an external beat have either emphasised (a) the form of movement trajectories or (b) timing errors made {{with respect to the}} external beat. The question of what kinds of movement trajectories assist timing accuracy has not previously been addressed. In an experiment involving synchronisation or syncopation with an external auditory metronome we show that the nervous system produces trajectories that are asymmetric with respect to time and velocity in the out and return phases of the repeating movement cycle. This asymmetry is task specific and is independent of motor implementation details (finger flexion vs. extension). Additionally, we found that timed trajectories are less smooth (higher mean squared jerk) than unpaced ones. The degree of asymmetry in the flexion and extension movement times is positively correlated with timing accuracy. Negative correlations were observed between synchronisation timing error and the movement time of the ensuing return phase, suggesting that late arrival of the finger is compensated by a shorter return phase and conversely for early arrival. We suggest that movement asymmetry in <b>repetitive</b> <b>timing</b> tasks helps satisfy requirements of precision and accuracy relative to a target event. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|E
40|$|The Wing-Kristofferson (WK) {{model of}} {{movement}} timing emphasises {{the separation of}} central timer and motor processes. Several studies of <b>repetitive</b> <b>timing</b> have shown that increase in variability at longer intervals is attributable to timer processes; however, relatively {{little is known about}} the way motor aspects of timing are affected by task movement constraints. In the present study, we examined timing variability in finger tapping with differences in interval to assess central timer effects, and with differences in movement amplitude to assess motor implementation effects. Then, we investigated whether effects of motor timing observed at the point of response (flexion offset/tap) are also evident in extension, which would suggest that both phases are subject to timing control. Eleven participants performed bimanual simultaneous tapping, at two target intervals (400, 600 ms) with the index finger of each hand performing movements of equal (3 or 6 cm) or unequal amplitude (left hand 3, right hand 6 cm and vice versa). As expected, timer variability increased with the mean interval but showed only small, non-systematic effects with changes in movement amplitude. Motor implementation variability was greater in unequal amplitude conditions. The same pattern of motor variability was observed both at flexion and extension phases of movement. These results suggest that intervals are generated by a central timer, triggering a series of events at the motor output level including flexion and the following extension, which are explicitly represented in the timing system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between timing and cognition remains poorly understood. Cognitive control is known to be involved in discrete timing tasks involving durations above 1  s, but has not yet been demonstrated for <b>repetitive</b> motor <b>timing</b> below 1  s. We examined the latter in two continuation tapping experiments, by varying the cognitive load in a concurrent task. In Experiment 1, participants repeated a fixed three finger sequence (low executive load) or a pseudorandom sequence (high load) with either 524 -, 733 -, 1024 - or 1431 -ms inter-onset intervals (IOIs). High load increased timing variability for 524 and 733 -ms IOIs but not for the longer IOIs. Experiment 2 attempted to replicate this finding for a concurrent memory task. Participants retained three letters (low working memory load) or seven letters (high load) while producing intervals (524 - and 733 -ms IOIs) with a drum stick. High load increased timing variability for both IOIs. Taken together, the experiments demonstrate that cognitive control processes influence sub-second <b>repetitive</b> motor <b>timing...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{relative}} {{timing of}} presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes plays {{a critical role}} in activity-induced synaptic modification. Here we examined whether plasticity of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex depends on stimulus <b>timing.</b> <b>Repetitive</b> pairing of visual stimuli at two orientations induced a shift in orientation tuning of cat cortical neurons, with the direction of the shift depending on the temporal order of the pair. Induction of a significant shift required that the interval between the pair fall within ± 40 ms, reminiscent of the temporal window for spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. Mirroring the plasticity found in cat visual cortex, similar conditioning also induced a shift in perceived orientation by human subjects, further suggesting functional relevance of this phenomenon. Thus, relative timing of visual stimuli can play {{a critical role in}} dynamic modulation of adult cortical function, perhaps through spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Roberts {{syndrome}} (RS) {{is associated}} with a characteristic constitutive heterochromatin anomaly, namely, at metaphase the centromeres and heterochromatic segments appear split. In addition to this cytogenetic phenomenon, known as the RS effect, several other cytological features, especially affecting mitotic chromosome disjunction, are also observed. Applying FISH to interphase nuclei, we investigated the replication patterns of homologous alphoid centromeric DNA of chromosomes 9, 11, 16 and 17 in three patients showing the RS effect and in four normal individuals. A tendency for homologous centromeres to replicate asynchronously was observed in RS patients. This tendency was more evident in chromosomes 9 and 16, with large heterochromatic blocks and particularly subject to RS effect. This asynchrony could re£ect a more generalized alteration in <b>repetitive</b> DNA replication <b>timing</b> that, in turn, would prevent the establishment of proper cohesion between sister chromatid heterochromatin, leading to the RS effect...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been upsurge of {{interest}} in the neural mechanisms of time perception. A central question is whether the representation of time is distributed over brain regions as a function of stimulus modality, task and length of the duration used or whether it is centralized in a single specific and supramodal network. The answers seem to be converging on the former, and many areas not primarily considered as temporal processing areas remain to be investigated in the temporal domain. Here we asked whether the superior temporal gyrus, an auditory modality specific area, is involved in processing of auditory <b>timing.</b> <b>Repetitive</b> transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over left and right superior temporal gyri while participants performed either a temporal or a frequency discrimination task of single tones. A significant decrease in performance accuracy was observed after stimulation of the right superior temporal gyrus, in addition to an increase in response uncertainty as measured by the Just Noticeable Difference. The results are specific to auditory temporal processing and performance on the frequency task was not affected. Our results further support the idea of distribute...|$|R
40|$|Psychometric {{intelligence}} {{correlates with}} {{performance on a}} wide range of sensory and motor tasks that involve processing of temporal information in the millisecond-second range. For some timing tasks, e. g. reaction time and discrimination of temporal stimuli in working memory, the associations with intelligence are likely to involve top-down mechanisms such as attention. However, studies on <b>repetitive,</b> automatic motor <b>timing</b> tasks indicate that correlations between intelligence and timing also may reflect bottom-up mechanisms, i. e. basic neural properties that influence both the temporal accuracy of behavior and cognitive processes. Here, we study the genetic architecture of the associations between intelligence, perceptual timing (auditory rhythm discrimination) and motor timing (finger tapping) in a large twin cohort. Specifically, we hypothesized that the associations between these tasks on the phenotypic level involve broad pleiotropic genetic effects that influence all three tasks, as well as additional genetic effects on the covariation between perceptual and motor timing. Phenotypic associations between the variables were low to moderate, with Pearson's correlations in the range 0. 17 - 0. 32. Trivariate twin modeling showed that the associations between the three variables were essentially due to shared genetic influences. In support of the hypotheses, we found evidence for pleiotropic effects on motor timing, perceptual timing, and intelligence, as well as additional genetic covariation between the two timing tasks that was not shared with intelligence. We conclude, first, that genetic factors underlying intelligence may involve genes which influence brain properties of importance for the temporal accuracy of neural processing. We discuss possible neural substrates of such effects. Secondly, the correlation between motor and perceptual timing also partly explained by genetic influences that are unrelated to intelligence...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} Clynes’s {{theory of}} “pulse” for performances of music by Mozart and Beethoven (e. g., Clynes, 1983, 1987). In three experiments that used {{a total of}} seven different compositions, an analysis-bysynthesis approach {{was used to examine}} the <b>repetitive</b> patterns of <b>timing</b> and loudness thought to be associated with performances of Mozart and Beethoven. Across performances, judgments by trained musicians provided support for some of the basic claims made by Clynes. However, judgments of individual performances were not always consistent with predictions. In Experiment 1, melodies were judged to be more musical if they were played with the pulse than if they were played with an altered version of the pulse or if they were played without expression. In Experiment 2, listeners were asked to judge whether performances of Mozart were “Mozartian” and whether performances of Beethoven were “Beethovenian. ” Ratings were highest if the pulse of the composer was implemented, and significantly lower if the pulse of another composer was implemented (e. g., the Mozart pulse in the Beethoven piece) in all or part of each piece. In Experiment 3, a Beethoven piece was played with each of three pulses: Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. Listeners judged the version with the Beethoven pulse as most Beethovenian, but the version with the Haydn pulse as most “musical. ” Although the overall results were encouraging, it is suggested that there are significant difficulties in evaluating Clynes’s theory and that much more research is needed before his ideas can be assessed adequately. The need for clarification of some theoretical issues surrounding the concept of pulse is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Home {{telemonitoring}} improves {{clinical outcomes}} but can generate {{large amounts of}} data. Automating data surveillance with clinical decision support could reduce the impact of translating these systems to clinical settings. We utilized time-motion methodology to measure the time spent on activities monitoring subjects {{in the two groups}} of a home spirometry telemonitoring randomized controlled trial: the manual nurse review (control) group and the automated review (intervention) group. These results are examined for potential workflow effects that could occur when the intervention translates to a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: Time motion is an established industrial engineering technique used to evaluate workflow by measuring the time of predefined, discrete tasks. Data were collected via direct observation of two research nurses by a single observer using the <b>repetitive</b> or snap-back <b>timing</b> method. All observed tasks were coded using a list of work activities defined and validated in an earlier study. Reliability data were collected during a 2 -h session with a secondary observer. Results: Reliability of the primary observer was established. During 35 h of data collection, a sample of 938 task observations were recorded and coded using 46 previously defined and 5 newly defined work activities. Between-group comparisons of activity time for subjects in the two study groups showed significantly more time spent on data review activities for the automated review group. Reclassification of the 51 observed activities identified 15 activities that would translate to a clinical setting, of which 5 represent potentially new activities. Conclusions: Implementing an intervention into a clinical setting could add work activities to the clinical workflow. Time-motion study of research personnel working with new clinical interventions provides a template for evaluating the workflow impact of these interventions prior to translation from a research to a clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Kv 4 {{channels}} mediate {{most of the}} somatodendritic subthreshold operating A-type current (ISA) in neurons. This current plays essential {{roles in}} the regulation of spike <b>timing,</b> <b>repetitive</b> firing, dendritic integration and plasticity. Neuronal Kv 4 channels {{are thought to be}} ternary complexes of Kv 4 pore-forming subunits and two types of accessory proteins, Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIPs) and the dipeptidyl-peptidase-like proteins (DPPLs) DPPX (DPP 6) and DPP 10. In heterologous cells, ternary Kv 4 channels exhibit inactivation that slows down with increasing depolarization. Here, we compared the voltage dependence of the inactivation rate of channels expressed in heterologous mammalian cells by Kv 4. 2 proteins with that of channels containing Kv 4. 2 and KChIP 1, Kv 4. 2 and DPPX-S, or Kv 4. 2, KChIP 1 and DPPX-S, and found that the relation between inactivation rate and membrane potential is distinct for these four conditions. Moreover, recordings from native neurons showed that the inactivation kinetics of the ISA in cerebellar granule neurons has voltage dependence that is remarkably similar to that of ternary Kv 4 channels containing KChIP 1 and DPPX-S proteins in heterologous cells. The fact that this complex and unique behaviour (among A-type K+ currents) is observed in both the native current and the current expressed in heterologous cells by the ternary complex containing Kv 4, DPPX and KChIP proteins supports the hypothesis that somatically recorded native Kv 4 channels in neurons include both types of accessory protein. Furthermore, quantitative global kinetic modelling showed that preferential closed-state inactivation and a weakly voltage-dependent opening step can explain the slowing of the inactivation rate with increasing depolarization. Therefore, it is likely that preferential closed-state inactivation is the physiological mechanism that regulates the activity of both ternary Kv 4 channel complexes and native ISA-mediating channels...|$|R
