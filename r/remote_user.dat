25|$|The {{first two}} are {{individual}} utilities that allow a user {{to take control}} of a remote computer over the network. In case of Remote Assistance, the <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> needs to receive an invitation and the control is cooperative. In case of RDC, however, the <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> opens a new session on the remote computer and has every power granted by its user account's rights and restrictions. Fast User Switching allows users to switch between user accounts on the local computer without quitting software and logging out. Fast User Switching is part of Winlogon and uses RDS to accomplish its switching feature. Third-party developers have also created client software for RDS. For example, rdesktop supports Unix platforms.|$|E

A <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> can control EDGAR with the user’s face and expressions {{displayed on the}} robot’s face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.|$|E
2500|$|Although RDS is shipped {{with most}} editions of all {{versions}} of Windows NT since Windows 2000, its functionality differs in each version. Windows XP Home Edition {{does not accept}} any RDC connections at all, reserving RDS for Fast User Switching and Remote Assistance only. Other client versions of Windows only allow a maximum of one <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> to connect to the system {{at the cost of}} the user who has logged onto the console being disconnected. Windows Server allows two users to connect at the same time. This licensing scheme, called [...] "Remote Desktop for Administration", facilitates administration of unattended or headless computers. Only by acquiring additional licenses (in addition to that of Windows) can a computer running Windows Server service multiple remote users at one time and achieve virtual desktop infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|The Security Account Manager (SAM), often Security Accounts Manager, is a {{database}} file in Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 that stores users' passwords. It {{can be used}} to authenticate local and <b>remote</b> <b>users.</b> Beginning with Windows 2000 SP4, Active Directory authenticates <b>remote</b> <b>users.</b> SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users accessing the system.|$|R
2500|$|The Support Element is {{the most}} direct and lowest level way to access a mainframe. It {{circumvents}} even the Hardware Management Console and the operating system running on the mainframe. The HMC is a PC connected to the mainframe and emulates the Support Element. All preceding zSeries mainframes used {{a modified version of}} OS/2 with custom software to provide the interface. System z9's HMC no longer uses OS/2, but instead uses a modified version of Linux with an OS/2 lookalike interface to ease transition as well as a new interface. Unlike the previous HMC application on OS/2, the new HMC is web-based which means that even local access is done via a web browser. Remote HMC access is available, although only over an SSL encrypted HTTP connection. The web-based nature means that {{there is no longer a}} difference between local console access and remote access, which means a <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> potentially has full control if authorized, allowing more flexibility for locating systems within data centers. IBM refers to the new HMC as a [...] "closed platform" [...] which does not allow the user to install software or access the command line interface to increase security and stability. The HMC is also firewalled by default with a minimal number of open ports for remote access.|$|E

Usually the only indication of failure is that, at the end of the knock sequence, the port expected to be open is not opened. No packets are sent to the <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> at any time.|$|E
50|$|The Synchronizer {{also has}} a remote office server {{capability}} to support branch office and <b>remote</b> <b>users.</b> <b>Remote</b> office servers are managed by a central Synchronizer and images are downloaded from the central server to remote servers over the WAN. These images are then cached and transmitted over the LAN to branch office and <b>remote</b> <b>users</b> to reduce WAN utilization. Backups are also done locally over the LAN for improved performance and disaster recovery.|$|R

40|$|Systems – Artificial, augmented, {{and virtual}} realities The iLight system allows <b>remote</b> <b>users</b> to draw using light {{projected}} on a real-life object or scene.

Thus <b>remote</b> <b>users</b> may annotate particular scene objects or features for local viewers, and can also display text and project arbitrary digital images. Drawn objects are pixel-aligned with the video, and unlike previous systems, there are no video feedback problems, nor are computer vision techniques required to detect objects or actions. We present two versions of the system: a lightweight, inexpensive 2 D version suitable for shared whiteboards, and version with specialized optics designed for annotating three-dimensional objects. 1...|$|R
