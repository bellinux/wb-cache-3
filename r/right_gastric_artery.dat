40|$|Background: Visceral artery aneurysms at {{the origin}} of the gastric and gastroepiploic artery are uncommon. Raptured visceral aneurysms cause high {{mortality}} and require urgent and adequate intervention and treatment.

Radiographically, we diagnosed intra-abdominal bleeding due to a ruptured aneurysm of the <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>artery.</b> Although her vital signs were relatively stable, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) could not be performed due to thrombotic occlusion of her abdominal aorta, and bilateral axillary arteries.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Conversion of {{multiple}} hepatic arteries {{into a single}} vascular supply {{is a very important}} technique for repeat hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using an implanted port catheter system. Catheterization of a replaced left hepatic artery arising from a left gastric artery using a percutaneous catheter technique is sometimes difficult, despite the recent development of advanced interventional techniques. Case presentation We present a case of a 70 -year-old Japanese man with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas in whom the replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery needed to be embolized. After several failed procedures, the replaced left hepatic artery was successfully catheterized and embolized with a microcatheter and microcoils via the <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>artery</b> through the anastomosis.

Acute abdominal pain developed on average after four HAIC courses of 5 FU-oxaliplatin, mytomycin, oxaliplatin or fotemustine. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed gastroduodenal lesions (gastroduodenitis with or without ulcerations) in all cases.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} was aimed at {{determining}} the origin, course and distribution of the celiac artery in eight adult red falcons, using a latex injection and dissection method. The celiac artery was ascertained to originate from the aorta {{at the level of}} the last 2 – 3 costae. The celiac artery was determined to split into two main branches, namely, left branch of the celiac artery and right branch of the celiac artery, in between the proventricu-lus and gizzard, and in the proximity of the lien. Prior to the indicated bifurcation, the celiac artery was observed to give off an esophageal artery and superior proventricular artery. In seven of the red falcons examined, splenic arteries, varying from two to four in number, were determined to spring from the celiac artery. Both the left and right hepatic arteries were ascertained to stem from the left branch of the celiac artery. The terminal branch of the left branch of the celiac artery, namely, the left <b>gastric</b> <b>artery,</b> was determined to have a fan-like distribution to the left surface of the gaster. The artery of the gall bladder was demonstrated to emanate from the left branch of the celiac artery in all of the red falcons examined, excluding one.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Hepatic artery aneurysms {{remain a}} {{clinically}} significant entity. Their incidence {{continues to rise}} slowly and mortality from spontaneous rupture is high. Repair is recommended in those aneurysms greater than 2 cm in diameter. It {{is not surprising that}} vascular comorbidities, such as ischaemic heart disease, are common in surgical patients, particularly those with arterial aneurysms such as these. The decision of when to operate on patients who require urgent surgery despite having recently suffered an acute coronary syndrome remains somewhat of a grey and controversial area. We discuss the role of delayed surgery and postoperative followup of this vascular problem. Case presentation A 58 -year-old man was admitted with a 5. 5 cm hepatic artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was asymptomatic and was an incidental finding {{as a result of an}} abdominal computed tomography scan to investigate an episode of haemoptysis (Figure 1). Three weeks prior to admission, the patient had suffered a large inferior myocardial infarction and was treated by thrombolysis and primary coronary angioplasty. Angiographic assessment revealed a large aneurysm of the common hepatic artery involving the origins of the hepatic, gastroduodenal, left and <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>arteries</b> and the splenic artery (Figures 2 and 3). Endovascular treatment was not considered feasible and immediate surgery was too high-risk in the early post-infarction period. Therefore, surgery was delayed for 3 months when aneurysm repair with reconstruction of the hepatic artery was successfully performed. Graft patency was confirmed with the aid of an abdominal arterial duplex. Plasma levels of conventional liver function enzymes and of alpha-glutathione- S -transferase were within normal limits. This was used to assess the extent of any hepatocellular damage perioperatively. The patient made a good recovery and was well at his routine outpatient check-ups. Conclusion There is no significant difference in cardiac risk in patients who have undergone vascular surgery within 6 months of a myocardial infarction compared with those who have had the operation in the 6 to 12 month time frame. Use of alpha-glutathione- S -transferase gives an indication of the immediate state of hepatic function and should be used in addition to traditional liver function tests to monitor hepatic function postoperatively. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Bariatric {{surgery is}} {{performed}} {{all over the}} world with close to 500. 000 procedures per year. The most performed techniques are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Despite this data, the most effective procedure, biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch, represents only no more than 1. 5 % of the procedures. Technical complexity, morbidity, mortality, and severe nutritional adverse effects related to the procedure are the main fears that prevent most universal acceptance. Aim: To explain the technical aspects and the benefits of the SADI-S with <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>artery</b> ligation as an effective simplification from the original duodenal switch. Methods: Were included all patients undergoing this procedure from the November 2014 to May 2016, describing and analysing aspects of this technique, the systematization and early complications associated with the procedure. Results: A series of 67 patients were operated; 46 were women (68. 7 %); mean age of the group was 44 years old (33 - 56); and an average BMI of 53. 5 kg/m 2 (50 - 63. 5). Surgical time was 115 min (80 - 180). A total of five patients (7. 5 %) had any complication and two (2. 9 %) had to be reoperated. There were two patients with leak, one at the duodenal stump and other at the esophagogastric angle. There was no mortality. Patients stayed at the hospital a median of 2. 5 days (1 - 25). Conclusions: SADI-S with <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>artery</b> ligation is a safe procedure with few preliminary complications. The technical variations introduced to the classical duodenal switch are reproducible and may allow this procedure to be more popular.

40|$|Ligation of the {{hepatic artery}} without {{antibiotic}} therapy {{has been associated}} with a high mortality rate in the dog. Interruption of this artery or its branches has clinical applications in humans, especially in the oncology and traumatology fields. Besides the anatomical differences between these two species, it is known that, in contrast with the man, canine liver is not sterile (Wolbach and Saiki, 1909). The present thesis has the purpose of studying aspects hitherto obscure in relation with the interruption of arterial vascularization in canine liver and its potential applications as a therapeutic strategy. Firstly, the anatomical study of the arterial hepatic vascularization was carried out, using selective angiograms and dissection. It was concluded that there is a common arterial vascular pattem, and no abhorrent vessels or alternative irrigation but the artery or its branches was found. Secondly, the laboratorial and clinical repercussions of lagation of the hepatic artery were investigated. Ligation was performed at two locations: hepatic branches and hepatic artery itself, proximal to the origin of the hehepatic branches and that of the gastroduodenal and <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>arteries.</b> Ligation of the hepatic branches resulted in death of all dogs between 12 an 80 hours after surgery, due to massive hepatic necrosis. The clinical picture, results of blood tests and histopathology of liver biopsies were all in agreement with hepatic necrosis. Conversely, ligation of the hepatic artery did not cause mortality and no significant were noticed either in clinical examination or laboratory parametrs and histopathology. Furthermore, resident bacterial flora of the hepatic parenchyma and its changes after experimentally induced hypoxia were studied in all dogs. Ligation of the branches lead to spreading of resident bacteria from the liver to the peritoneum and, sometimes, to the blood stream. These results suggesdt a leading role of the hepatic bacterial flora in the process of necrosis of the liver. Ligation of the hepatic artery, altough in an increse in the number of species of bacteria in the liver, did not interfere with the good clinical condition of the dogs, because it does not cause dissemination of the organisms. It could be inferred by the analysis of angiograms that this fact was due to prompt re-establishement of arterial circulation to the liver, through collateral vasculation from the gastroduodenal artery. It was finally conclued that, provided that the establishment of collateral circulation is facultated, the interruption of arterial blood flow to the liver can be a therapeutic method of promise in canine traumatology and oncologyAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Introduction: Arterial {{pseudoaneurysm}} is a {{rare and}} life-threatening complication of pancreatitis, seen more often in chronic than in acute pancreatitis. It involves mostly the splenic artery, while only in 10 % of the case it appears in pancreaticoduodenal and gastric artery. This case report described an asymptomatic pseudoaneurysm of the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and of the <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>artery,</b> which occurred after 13  days from the episode of acute pancreatitis and, then it was treated with vascular angioembolization. Presentation of case: A 71 year-old female {{was admitted to the}} Emergency Surgery Department for severe acute pancreatitis. After 13  days from the onset, pseudoaneurysms were detected with a control contrast-enhanced computed tomography and they were localized in a branch of the <b>right</b> <b>gastric</b> <b>artery</b> and in a branch of the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The patient underwent angiography and the pseudoaneurysms were treated with platinum coil embolization, without complications or further bleeding. Discussion: This is an unusual case because of the low incidence of arterial pseudoaneurysm as acute pancreatitis complication (1. 3 – 10 %), and the uncommon localization in the pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Conclusion: It is important to be aware of pancreatitis-related arterial pseudoaneurysms, as they have a mortality of 90 % if not recognized and treated, not only in chronic but also in acute pancreatitis, and to work out a scheduled follow-up with abdominal computed tomography or pancreatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound in order to control and prevent late onset complications...|$|E
