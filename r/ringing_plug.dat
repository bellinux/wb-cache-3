40|$|The paper {{describes}} theoretical predictions {{and experimental}} observations of solder fatigue in different Sn- 63 Pb- 37 solder joints. Experimental characterisation of solder-behaviour is performed by both thermal cycling of Surface Mount (SM) solder joints and mechanical cycling of <b>ring</b> and <b>plug</b> specimen. Detailed {{studies of the}} microstructure in solders after temperature cycling as well as after mechanical cycling have shown {{the same type of}} microstructural degradation. This degradation can be described by overall coarsening, local coarsening, recrystallisation, crack initiation and propagation. The computational method to assess the cyclic damage of solder is based upon non-linear finite element calculation results. Comparison of calculation and test results have demonstrated better predictive capabilities when the Coffin-Manson criterion takes into account creep strain distribution within the joint and not only its maximum value. It is shown that Plastic Ball Grid Arrays (PBGA) achieve a high solder joint reliability and exhibit no reliability drawbacks when compared to Plastic Quad Flat Packages (PQFP) with a similar pin count.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impalpable testis is a {{significant}} diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in adults, for both radiologist and surgeons, with few reports in literature addressing this problem in adults. Laparoscopy is a reliable and definitive procedure obviating the necessity of advance investigation and subsequent inguinal exploration in adults. AIMS: To study the utility of laparoscopy as combined diagnostic and therapeutic modality for undescended testis in adults. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective study from a single surgical unit of a large tertiary referral centre during August 2000 to January 2002. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Nine patients of unilateral undescended testis with average age 22. 7 years (range 13 - 31 years) underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and orchidectomy subsequent to detailed clinical, ultrasound and examination under anaesthesia (EUA) procedure. All patients were operated with one 10 mm umbilical camera port, one suprapubic port and 1 lateral port. RESULTS: None of the patients had palpable testis or an inguinal cough impulse on clinical examination and during EUA. In only 3 (33. 3 &#x 0025;) patients, the ultrasound could locate the testis situated at the deep ring. On laparoscopy all testes were identified, 4 were present at the deep ring, 3 were intra-abdominal and 2 had blind ending vas entering the deep <b>ring.</b> Mesh <b>plug</b> was inserted in the internal ring in these 2 patients, after dissecting the peritoneum. None of the patients had intra or post-operative complications and all were discharged on the next day.

30|$|Natural {{carbonate}} core samples {{with artificial}} fractures {{are often used}} to evaluate the damage of fractured carbonate formations in the laboratory. It is shown that the most frequent error for evaluation results directly from the random width characterized by the artificial fractures. To solve this problem, a series of simulated fractured core samples made of stainless steel with a given width of fracture were prepared. The relative error for the width of artificial fracture decreased to 1 %. The width of natural and artificial fractures in carbonate reservoirs can be estimated by image log data. A series of tests for formation damage were conducted by using the stainless steel simulated core samples flushed with different drilling fluids, such as the sulfonate/polymer drill-in fluid and the solids-free drill-in fluid with or without ideal packing bridging materials. Based on the experimental results using this kind of simulated cores, a novel approach to the damage control of fractured carbonate reservoirs was presented. The effective temporary <b>plugging</b> <b>ring</b> on the end face of the simulated core sample can be observed clearly. The experimental results also show that the stainless steel simulated cores made it possible to visualize the solids and filtrate invasion.|$|R

The final report for the group 1 describes the results of measurements of five diameter standards (one sphere, two <b>rings</b> and two <b>plugs).</b> A third plug was added for optional measurements. The main measurand was the diameter of each gauge at 20 ºC and corrected to zero force. The diameter was measured at three heights of each cylindrical gauge. As requested by the protocol, laboratories also provided the departure from roundness of the sphere. Participants were invited also to report the roundness and the straightness of the cylindrical gauges.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{overexpression}} {{studies have shown}} that lumican suppresses angiogenesis in tumors produced from pancreatic adenocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma, and melanoma tumor cells. Despite lumican’s anti-angiogenic activity, a clear correlation of differential expression of lumican in various cancers and cancer malignancy has failed to emerge. Therefore, we hypothesized that either 1.) endogenously expressed lumican is not anti-angiogenic or alternatively that 2.) lumican exhibits angiostatic activity only in limited microenvironments. Previously, lumican was shown to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis in subcutaneously injected PanO 2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, to determine if endogenously expressed lumican is anti-angiogenic we subcutaneously injected PanO 2 cells into wild-type and lumican knockout mice and compared tumor growth and vascular densities of the resulting tumors. We found that tumors grown in lumican knockout animals were larger and contained significantly elevated vascular densities compared to those grown in wild-type mice. Interestingly however lumican knockout animals did not exhibit enhanced angiogenesis in aortic <b>ring</b> assays, matrigel <b>plugs,</b> or healing wound biopsies raising the possibility that lumican suppresses angiogenesis only in tumor microenvironments. To test this possibility, we sought a tumor model wherein lumican did not exhibit anti-angiogenic activity. Utilizing the 4 T 1 breast cancer model, we found that lumican suppressed 4 T 1 tumor growth and lung metastasis, but not angiogenesis. In conclusion, these results show that the angiostatic activity of lumican is dependent on currently undefined microenvironmental cues and therefore helps to understand why differential expression of lumican does not consistently correlate with human tumor malignancy...|$|R
40|$|The Amba Dongar {{carbonatite}} complex, India is host {{to a large}} fluorite deposit. The complex {{consists of}} a small ring structure comprised of early carbonatite breccia, a large, outer lining of calcitite {{and a number of}} small ankeritic carbonatite plugs. Surrounding the carbonatite <b>ring</b> are numerous <b>plugs</b> of nephelinitic and phonolitic syenites. The complex was intruded into Late Cretaceous Bagh Sandstones and Late to Early Paleocene Deccan Volcanics. The hydrothermal history of the complex is extensive, consisting of two main systems, the first resulted in large amounts of fenitization, causing extensive K and Na metasomatism of the surrounding sandstones and the second, dealt with here, was responsible for the silicification of large amounts of the calcitite and the deposition of economic quantities of fluorite. The deposit consists of veins and vug fillings of blue, purple, white, yellow and colorless fluorite. The main ore zone, which is currently under production, and most other showings, are found near the carbonatite-sandstone contact. Chemical analyses and mass balance calculations show that the fluids responsible for silicification removed significant quantities of Ca from the rock while adding large amounts of Si, Al and F. Alteration associated with fluorite deposition involved the removal of Al from the rock and the addition of large quantities of F and Si. Fluid inclusions in fluorite point to a low temperature-low salinity ore fluid, which decreased in temperature and salinity with evolution. Crushing experiments performed on fluid inclusions in both fluorite and quartz reveal the presence of ${ approx 0. 08 }$ m of dissolved CO$ sb 2 $ in solution while analyses of leachates and decrepitate residues from fluid inclusions show significant concentrations of Ca, Al, Na, Cl and S in their fluids.

40|$|The {{main point}} of this {{research}} was работы являлось to create a stand to explore the application of short pulse radio signals in radar. The stand consists of antenna and waveguide elements. Each element out to guarantee operation in X-band with 10 percent working bank and 5 percent instantaneous bandwidth and the power output gotta be 1. 5 kW. The form of the antenna beam patten need to be similar to cosecant pattern Side-lobe level need to be less than - 25 dB. Background level got to be at least - 30 dB.

As the most easily realizing variant of such antenna cutting parabolic mirror antenna with offset irradiator was chosen. The irradiator phase centre is shifted from {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid to form a cosecant pattern. Method of physical optics is used for the analysis of antennas. Calculating pattern of horn irradiator and mirror antenna which were met the requirements was received. The construction choice was limited by the preproduction possibilities, mass and dimensions. Mirror antenna consists of skeleton framing with mirroring elements which are fixing on it. Mirroring plane is multiplex and consists off rectangular planes made by hydroforming method. Antenna was tested and adjusted at the antenna darkroom after fabricating. The results were meted requirements. Besides the mirror antenna and the horn antenna waveguide elements, waveguide bends and rotating joints were calculated, manufactured and researched.
