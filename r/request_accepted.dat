25|$|There is {{evidence}} that gender does impact a programmer’s perceived merit in the community. A 2016 study identified the gender of over one million programmers on GitHub, by linking the programmer’s GitHub account to their other social media accounts. Between male and female programmers, {{the researchers found that}} female programmers were actually more likely to have their pull <b>requests</b> <b>accepted</b> into the project than male programmers, however only when the female had a gender-neutral profile. When females had profiles with a name or image that identified them as female, they were less likely than male programmers to have their pull <b>requests</b> <b>accepted.</b> Another study in 2015 found that of open source projects on GitHub, gender diversity was a significant positive predictor of a team's productivity, meaning that open source teams with a more even mix of different genders tended to be more highly productive.|$|R

50|$|Following relegation, Berra had a {{transfer}} <b>request</b> <b>accepted</b> by Wolves. {{but this did}} not lead to any move away from the club and he remained part of the first team during the season. Then-Wolves manager Ståle Solbakken stated that Berra's game had improved and stated that he hoped the club could agree a new contract with Berra. However, Solbakken was soon fired and Berra dropped out of first team contention under Dean Saunders. At the end of the campaign, which again saw the team relegated, it was announced that Berra would leave the club. In total he made 154 appearances for the club, without scoring.|$|E
50|$|It was {{interesting}} to note that the Sultan was able to portray himself as being accommodating towards the British officials by issuing punitive fines to show his support towards the British and yet at the same time project suspicious behaviour which saw the British seeing the Sultan as being in cahoots with the rebels themselves. This delicate balancing act by the Sultan ensured that the British could never implicate him as a recalcitrant ruler. Overall, compromise, accommodation and opposition had been the changing strategies of the Sultan in his political game with Langham-Carter and other British officials. But what seems to have contributed to his eventual triumph was probably the Sultan's correct reading of the minds of his British antagonists. He would eventually get his <b>request</b> <b>accepted</b> in seeing Langham-Carter removed from his position and replaced by R.J. Farrer, a man the Sultan had requested as the British Adviser in his initial request to the Governor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present NPP – a new {{framework}} for online routing of bandwidth guaranteed paths with local restoration. NPP {{relies on the}} propagation of only aggregate link usage information [2, 9] through routing protocols. The key advantage of NPP is that it delivers the bandwidth sharing performance achieved by propagating complete per path link usage information [9], while incurring significantly reduced routing protocol overhead. We specify precise implementation models for the restoration routing frameworks presented in [1] and [2] and compare their traffic placement characteristics with those of NPP. Simulation results show that NPP performs significantly better in terms of number of LSPs accepted and total bandwidth placed on the network. For 1000 randomly selected LSP requests on a 20 -node homogenous ISP network [8], NPP <b>accepts</b> 775 <b>requests</b> on average compared to 573 <b>requests</b> <b>accepted</b> by the framework of [2] and 693 <b>requests</b> <b>accepted</b> by the framework of [1]. Experiments with different sets of LSP requests and on other networks indicate that NPP results in similar performance gains. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first polylog-competitive online {{algorithm}} {{for the general}} multicast admission control and routing problem in the throughput model. The ratio {{of the number of}} <b>requests</b> <b>accepted</b> by the optimum offline algorithm to the expected number of <b>requests</b> <b>accepted</b> by our algorithm is O((log n + log log M) (log n + log M) log n), where M is the number of multicast groups and n is the number of nodes in the graph. We show that this is close to optimum by presenting an Ω(log n log M) lower bound on this ratio for any randomized online algorithm against an oblivious adversary, when M is much larger than the link capacities. Our lower bound applies even in the restricted case where the link capacities are much larger than bandwidth requested by a single multicast. We also present a simple proof showing {{that it is impossible to}} be competitive against an adaptive online adversary. As in the previous online routing algorithms, our algorithm uses edge-costs when deciding on which is the best path to use. In contrast to the previous competitive algorithms in the throughput model, our cost is not a direct function of the edge load. The new cost definition allows us to decouple the effects of routing and admission decisions of different multicast groups...|$|R

We find substantial reduction of the uniform susceptibility and the sublattice magnetization from their classical values and appreciable renormalization of the spin-flop field at $T= 0 $. The magnetization curve varies nonlinearly at small fields and is described by a universal formula at high fields. The results are compared with numerical simulations on one-dimensional systems and measurements in the CsNiCl$_ 3 $-type compounds.
