40|$|Point Set Surfaces define smooth {{surfaces}} from <b>regular</b> <b>samples</b> {{based on}} weighted averaging of the points. Because weighting is done {{based on a}} spatial scale parameter, point set surfaces apply basically only to <b>regular</b> <b>samples.</b> We suggest to attach individual weight functions to each sample {{rather than to the}} location in space. This extends Point Set Surfaces to irregular settings, including anisotropic sampling adjusting to the principal curvatures of the surface. In particular, we describe how to represent surfaces with ellipsoidal weight functions per sample.

40|$|International audienceA time {{encoding}} of {{a random}} signal is {{a representation of}} this signal as a random sequence of strictly increasing times. The goal {{of this paper is}} the rule for testing the mean value of a Gaussian signal from asynchronous samples given by the Integrate and Fire (IF) time encoding. The optimal likelihood ratio test is calculated and its statistical performance is compared with a synchronous test which is based on <b>regular</b> <b>samples</b> of the Gaussian signal. Since the IF samples based detector takes a decision at a random time, the <b>regular</b> <b>samples</b> based test exploits a random number of samples. The time encoding significantly reduces the number of samples needed to satisfy a prescribed probability of detectio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of shear on viscoelastic polymer-clay solutions was investigated {{by means of}} small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) under shear. SANS {{was used to measure}} the shear-induced orientation of polymer and platelets. With increasing shear rate an anisotropic scattering pattern developed. At higher shear rates, the scattering anisotropy increased due to the enhanced orientation of the clay platelets in the shear field. The clay platelets aligned by the flow in an unusual direction, with the surface normal parallel to the vorticity direction. SANS on <b>regular</b> <b>samples</b> (contrast between D 2 O and solution components) measured the shear-induced orientation of polymer and platelets. However, with contrast matching the orientation of the polymer alone could be detected. With increasing shear rate, clay particles oriented first (SANS on <b>regular</b> <b>samples)</b> and then polymer chains started to stretch (SANS on contrast matched samples). Cessation of shear led to fast recovery, demonstrating the system to be highly elastic...|$|R

30|$|In summary, temperature-varied SSPL and TRPL spectra {{were studied}} for {{different}} InGaN/GaN MQWs on Si structures {{with or without}} tensile stress releasing treatments. It {{was found that the}} sample with Si δ-doping GaN layer or AlGaN inserted layer had smaller recombination rate and higher PL efficiency (up to 17 %) than the <b>regular</b> <b>sample</b> (2.5 %) or sample with InGaN inserted layer (1.6 %). Further analysis clarified that the smaller recombination rates were mainly led by smaller dominant nonradiative recombination rates (2.5  × 10 − 2  s− 1 for δ-doping sample, 3.6  × 10 − 2  s− 1 for AlGaN inserted sample compared to 3.6  × 10 − 2  s− 1 for <b>regular</b> <b>sample</b> and 4.7  × 10 − 2  s− 1 for InGaN inserted sample), which were ascribable to the suppression to the formation of dislocations or cracks. Besides smaller nonradiative recombination rates, the better PL performances were also led by the radiative recombination rates that were more stable and higher at room temperature (5.7  × 10 − 3  s− 1 for δ-doping sample, 5.8  × 10 − 3  s− 1 for AlGaN inserted sample compared to 9  × 10 − 4  s− 1 for <b>regular</b> <b>sample</b> and 7  × 10 − 4  s− 1 for InGaN inserted sample). They were also ascribable to the suppression of well thickness variations on MQW interfaces, leaving the deep radiative localization centers inside InGaN layers dominate the radiative recombination process. The above results showed a clear picture to the recombination processes of InGaN/GaN MQW LED devices on silicon substrates, which may guide the device fabrication in the future.|$|R

50|$|In particular, doubly labeled water (DLW) can be {{used for}} a method to measure the average daily {{metabolic}} rate of an organism {{over a period of time}} (often also called the Field metabolic rate, or FMR, in non-human animals). This is done by administering a dose of DLW, then measuring the elimination rates of deuterium and oxygen-18 in the subject over time (through <b>regular</b> <b>sampling</b> of heavy isotope concentrations in body water, by sampling saliva, urine, or blood). At least two samples are required: an initial sample (after the isotopes have reached equilibrium in the body), and a second sample some time later.

In small animals, the period may be as short as 24 hours; in larger animals (such as adult humans), the period may be as long as 14 days.|$|E

It is found that the SVM is proned to generate DC current in the stator windings. Furthermore subharmonic flux and current components with considerable amplitudes can also be generated in USIM.
