The first clinical cases of poisoning to be reported in the literature were in workers engaged in the production or handling of the explosive <b>roburite</b> (Nieden, 1888; Ross, 1889; Prosser White, 1889; Rohl, 1890 Spurgin, 1891), or that of aniline (Schr 6 der and Strassmann, 1891), or were due to other occupa-tional hazards (Huber, 1891). Numerous cases of in-dustrial poisoning have been reported since then (von Oettingen, 1941). They were also mostly due to exposure in the manufacture of explosives, especially in the first world war. Cases of poisoning among munition workers were again recorded during and after the second world war (Rejsek, 1944; Glahn and Schack-Schou, 1947). Owing to modern improvements in hygienic conditions, however, cases of poisoning in industry seem now to be seldom encountered. Considered retrospectively, the characteristic clinical manifestations ofm-dinitrobenzene poisoning were already well recognized by the early authors. The most comprehensive clinical descriptions and a review of the first reports were given by Koelsch (1917). Since these early descriptions little has been added to the symptomatology of intoxication by the subsequent clinical reports.
