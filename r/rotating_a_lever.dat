5000|$|Multi-port {{ball valves}} with 4 ways, or more, are also commercially available, the inlet way often being {{orthogonal}} {{to the plane}} of the outlets. For special applications, such as driving air-powered motors from forward to reverse, the operation is performed by <b>rotating</b> <b>a</b> single <b>lever</b> four-way valve. The 4-way ball valve has two L-shaped ports in the ball that do not interconnect, sometimes referred to as an [...] "×" [...] port.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>lever</b> sensor <b>a</b> {{diametrically}} magnetized {{ring magnet}} <b>rotates</b> about <b>a</b> linear hall sensor.

5000|$|The Hall sensor {{is used in}} some {{automotive}} fuel level indicators. The main principle of operation of such indicator is position sensing of a floating element. This can either be done by using a vertical float magnet or <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>lever</b> sensor.|$|R
50|$|Some {{anti-roll}} bars, {{particularly those}} {{intended for use}} in auto racing, are externally adjustable while the car is in the pit whereas some systems can be adjusted in real time by the driver from inside the car, such as in Super GT. This allows the stiffness to be altered, for example by increasing or reducing {{the length of the}} lever arms on some systems, or by <b>rotating</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>lever</b> arm from <b>a</b> stiff edge-on position to a more flexible flat-side-on position on other systems. This lets a mechanic tune the roll stiffness for different situations without replacing the entire bar.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the stove}} metaphor {{there is an}} {{illustration}} of placement {{in relation to the}} controls; however, the effect of the control in relation to its operation is Heat as a result of Rotation. Rotation does not naturally relate to heat, therefore the relationship is artifical, and a social construction. A better example would the the simple one of a privacy bolt on a toilet stall. A simple slide bolt with a knob has a very direct mapping, whereas, one with <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>lever</b> requires the understanding of the transformation of the rotation translated into the movement of the bolt horizontally. From this perspective, mapping is a characterstic of affordance. A deeper understanding of many our perceived 'natural' mapping relationships uncovers a predominately socially constructed, or cultural, underpinning. Such as <b>rotating</b> <b>a</b> volume knob to make the music volume go 'up'.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{the bolt}} {{consists}} of a tube of metal inside of which the firing mechanism is housed, and which has at the front or rear of the tube several metal knobs, or [...] "lugs", which serve to lock the bolt in place. The operation can be done via <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> bolt, <b>a</b> <b>lever,</b> cam-action, locking piece, or a number of systems. Straight-pull designs have seen {{a great deal of}} use, though manual turn-bolt designs are what is most commonly thought of in reference to a bolt-action design due to the type ubiquity. As a result, the bolt-action term is often reserved for more modern types of rotating bolt-designs when talking about a specific weapon's type of action. However, both straight-pull and rotating bolt rifles are types of bolt-action rifles. Lever-action and pump-action weapons must still operate the bolt, but they are usually grouped separately from bolt-actions that are operated by a handle directly attached to <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> bolt. Early bolt-action designs, such as the Dreyse needle gun and the Mauser Model 1871, locked by dropping the bolt handle or bolt guide rib into a notch in the receiver, this method is still used in [...]22 rimfire rifles. The most common locking method is <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> bolt with two lugs on the bolt head, which was used by the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, Model 1888 Commission Rifle, Mauser M 98, Mosin-Nagant and most bolt-action rifles. The Lee-Enfield has a lug and guide rib, which lock on the rear end of the bolt into the receiver.|$|R
50|$|To {{combat the}} L-39's immense recoil, the recoil spring is so stiff {{that it would}} be {{impossible}} to cock the weapon with a traditional charging handle. Instead, <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> crank <b>lever</b> on the right side of the gun is used to pull the bolt back. While semi-automatic in function, the L-39's bolt locks back after every shot, and the grip safety also functions to release the bolt. The entire front of the grip and trigger is protected by a large guard and a rubber buffer to protect the operator's hands from the spent casings which eject from the bottom of the gun at very high speeds.|$|R

50|$|A cam is <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> or {{sliding piece}} in a {{mechanical}} linkage used especially in transforming rotary motion into linear motion or vice versa. It {{is often a}} part of <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> wheel (e.g. <b>an</b> eccentric wheel) or shaft (e.g. a cylinder with an irregular shape) that strikes <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> at one or more points on its circular path. The cam can be a simple tooth, as is used to deliver pulses of power to a steam hammer, for example, or an eccentric disc or other shape that produces a smooth reciprocating (back and forth) motion in the follower, which is <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> making contact with the cam.|$|R

5000|$|Fred ('Freddie') W. Barnes {{was hired}} as chief {{engineer}} in 1905, and patented the [...] "Gradua" [...] variable-ratio belt drive transmission that year.

[...] The Gradua's action was controlled by <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>lever</b> atop the fuel tank, and was among the first attempts to provide multiple drive ratios for a motorcycle, at a time when very simple, direct belt-drive transmission was the industry norm. Variable drive ratios proved a significant advantage in competition, leading riders of other marques to complain the Gradua gave an unfair advantage; eventually Zeniths with Gradua gears were banned from many competitions. Zenith capitalized on this ban, adding the word [...] "Barred" [...] to their advertising and logo. The Gradua system was replaced by the now-standard gearbox and chain transmission in 1924.|$|R

50|$|However, a more {{successful}} strategy was identified by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines. He realized that <b>a</b> <b>lever,</b> pulley, and {{wheel and axle}} are in essence the same device: <b>a</b> body <b>rotating</b> about <b>a</b> hinge.

50|$|In {{behavioral}} psychology, reinforcement is {{a consequence}} that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus. This strengthening effect may be measured as a higher frequency of behavior (e.g., pulling <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> more frequently), longer duration (e.g., pulling <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> {{for longer periods of}} time), greater magnitude (e.g., pulling <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> with greater force), or shorter latency (e.g., pulling <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> more quickly following the antecedent stimulus).|$|R
50|$|The {{lifting rod}} system ran {{vertically}} up the mineshaft, either to transfer {{power to the}} individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, {{in the case of}} man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the lifting rod system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (Holzlaschen). These joints were tightly bound {{to the ends of the}} lifting rods with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (Kolbenstangen). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> cross-shaped <b>lever</b> (Kunstkreuz) was fitted to the lifting rods. Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (Kunstschloss). To balance the load it was usual to have two lifting rods.|$|R

40|$|Motor enzymes use {{energy from}} ATP dephosphorylation to {{generate}} movement by a mechanical cycle, moving and pushing {{in one direction}} while attached to their cytoskeletal substrate, and recovering by moving relative to their substrate to a new attachment site. Mainstream models assert that movement while attached to the substrate results from preexisting strain in the attached motor. The additional underlying ideas {{can be described in}} terms of three components for strain amplification: <b>a</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>lever</b> arm, multiple attached states, and elastic compliance. These components determine how energy is recovered during the mechanical cycle and stored in a strained motor. They may coexist in a real motor; the challenge is to determine the contributions of each component. Because these components can generate similar relationships between strain energy and strain, standard measurements of motor function do not discriminate easily between these components. However, important information could be is provided by observations that suggest weak coupling between chemical and mechanical cycles, observations of negative force and movement events in single motor experiments, and the discovery that two motors that move in opposite directions have very similar structures. In models incorporating changes in conformation between attached states, these observations are only explained easily if the conformational changes are tightly coupled to changes in the strength of motor-substrate binding...|$|R
