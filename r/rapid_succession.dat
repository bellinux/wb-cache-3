5|$|The {{next week}} was a 14–0 victory over VPI. Centre scored both {{touchdowns in the}} final quarter. They were scored in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> by Tanner and Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual loop, initial reports {{suggested}} {{it was two}} separate storms that developed and hit land in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it {{was identified as a}} single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} period of C-SPAN Radio's existence, {{programming}} also included coverage of local events and government hearings affecting only the Washington region. A unique part of WCSP's programming is its rebroadcast of five Sunday morning talk shows, without commercials, in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> All programs on C-SPAN Radio are broadcast commercial-free.|$|E
50|$|During <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of shots, gaseous CO2 is used up. Liquid CO2 {{will take}} some time to {{evaporate}} and rebuild the internal pressure. This process causes potentially large changes in velocity and therefore, in accuracy and range.|$|R
6000|$|Cain {{comes in}} <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of thunder-claps. The voice of Aglauros is thunder-claps {{crashing}} into one another--broken thunder. This is exceedingly fine also, and wonderful as a variation upon that awful music; but Cain is the astonishment and the overwhelmingness. If it were not, however, {{for the second}} thunder, {{we should not have}} had the two silences; for I doubt whether they are not better even than one. At all events, the final silence is tremendous.] ...|$|R
50|$|Paintball markers can use {{high-pressure}} air or N2 for propellant, {{to attempt}} to offset issues {{with other types of}} propellants. When nitrogen or HPA (High Pressure Air) is compressed, it remains a gas. When it expands, it also cools the tank, due to the Joule-Thomson effect, but at a far lower rate than liquid CO2 because it does not have to change from liquid to gas. The lack of this transition reduces the variation in pressure associated with <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of firing cycles, improving accuracy.|$|R
5|$|November 1619 – Two hurricanes strike Bermuda {{during the}} month, sinking {{at least one}} ship, {{uprooting}} large trees, ruining the entire winter corn crop, and destroying a wooden watchtower constructed seven years earlier. The <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> of two hurricanes leaves the colony with a severe food shortage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> of typhoons in 1992 {{caused a}} {{significant}} drop in tourism in Guam. During typhoons Omar and Gay, {{there was little}} communication between residents on the island. As a result, the Guam Communications Network was created to facilitate future relief efforts during storms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of regime {{dynamics}} that embeds the principal transition scenarios examined by the literature. Political systems are a priori unrestricted and dynamics emerge through the combination and interaction of transition events over time. The model attributes a key role to beliefs held by political outsiders about the vulnerability of regimes, governing the likelihood and outcome of transitions. In equilibrium, transition likelihoods are declining in a regime's maturity, generating episodes of political stability alternating with <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of revolts, counter revolts, and reforms. The stationary distribution of regimes is bimodal. The model dynamics match the data remarkably well...|$|R
50|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that copulatory calls are the adaptive solution to problems with reproductive success. In other words, copulatory vocalizations address issues that {{stand in the}} way of successfully producing offspring and guaranteeing its survival, such as the occurrence of infanticide. To prevent the killing of their offspring, female baboons employ copulatory calls in order to attract other males, allowing multiple mating acts and creating parental confusion among the males involved. The resulting uncertainty of who the father is hence reduces the occurrence of attacks, given the newly incited risk of potentially harming their own offspring. Additionally, mating in <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> also entails sperm competition, and therefore fulfills the additional function of obtaining high quality sperm. This is especially important in species that do not openly advertise good genes via honest signals.|$|R
50|$|Fortunes {{began to}} change in the 1960s when {{industry}} patterns lead to economic decline. Steel mills to the east were shuttered. Pullman scaled back production and eventually closed for good in 1981. The huge Sherwin-Williams paint factory closed for good in 1995. A period of <b>rapid</b> ethnic <b>succession</b> took place.|$|R
5|$|L'Arianna was {{followed}} in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> by three brand new Monteverdi operas, of which Il ritorno was the first. The second, Le nozze d' Enea in Lavinia ("The Marriage of Aeneas to Lavinia"), was performed during the 1640–41 carnival; Monteverdi's music is lost, but {{a copy of}} the libretto, of unknown authorship, survives. The last of the three, written for the 1642–43 carnival, was L'incoronazione di Poppea ("The Coronation of Poppea"), performed shortly before the composer's death in 1643.|$|E
5|$|Meng Huo's army marches northwards {{to attack}} Liu Bei. However, his army is swept down the Changjiang {{and end up}} in the Kingdom of Wu, ruled by Sun Jian. The Nanman resolve to take Jianye from Wu, and Meng Huo kills every member of the Sun family in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> With Jianye down, Meng Huo {{proceeds}} to attack into Wei. He captures Xuchang and kills every Wei officer, although Sima Yi's efforts to launch an attack on the Nanman supply depot cause temporary chaos.|$|E
5|$|Supplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habré rapidly reorganized {{his forces}} (now called Chadian National Armed Forces, or FANT). FANT marched north {{to confront the}} GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Abéché. Habré crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that enabled him to retake in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> Abéché, Biltine, Fada and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, {{threatening}} to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip.|$|E
5000|$|No. 3: Touches bloquées. Vivacissimo, sempre molto ritmico - Feroce, impetuoso, molto meno vivace - Feroce, estrepitoso - Tempo I: Two {{different}} rhythmic patterns interlock. One hand plays <b>rapid,</b> even <b>successions</b> of notes {{while the other}} hand 'blocks' some of the keys by holding them pressed down. This is the last étude Ligeti dedicated to Boulez.|$|R
40|$|A pseudo-spectral {{approximation}} {{is presented}} {{to solve the problem}} of pull-in instability in a cantilever micro-switch. As well known, pull-in instability arises when the acting force reaches a critical threshold beyond which equilibrium is no longer possible. In particular, Coulomb electrostatic force is considered, although the method can be easily generalized to account for fringe as well as Casimir effects. A numerical comparison is presented between a pseudo-spectral and a Finite Element (FE) approximation of the problem, both methods employing the same number of degrees of freedom. It is shown that the pseudo-spectral method appears more effective in accurately approximating the behavior of the cantilever near its tip. This fact is crucial to capturing the threshold voltage on the verge of pull-in. Conversely, the FE approximation presents <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of attracting/repulsing regions along the cantilever, which are not restricted to the near pull-in regime...|$|R
5000|$|His {{compositions}} include Rêverie mélancolique and Sérénade humoristique for orchestra, a concertino {{for three}} pianos (which has been recently {{performed in the}} USA), The Fantasmorgories Suite, Suite for Two Pianos, 6 Concert Studies after Chopin's Études, Concert Étude after Chopin's Minute Waltz, 2 Valse-Caprices on Themes of Schubert, 4 Valse-Caprices on themes of Strauss, and arrangements and transcriptions such as the Scherzo from Felix Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream for two pianos, {{and a large number}} of works by Bach transcribed for one or two pianos. His composition Feux-Follets (from [...] "Pastels For Piano", no. 3) was recorded [...] by his pupil Guiomar Novaes, a Brazilian pianist. He wrote a considerable number of transcriptions for the left hand. Philipp's compositions and transcriptions often require a high degree of finger dexterity and lightness of touch, and he liked to work in <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of double thirds, fourths and octaves in many of his pieces.|$|R
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} {{on south}} Samar on December10, Hibok-Hibok erupted {{six times in}} <b>rapid</b> <b>succession,</b> worsening the effects of both the typhoon and the volcano. Amy had also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior. Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and the washing away of bridges. Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, {{one of whom}} only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his {{control over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E
5000|$|... 1974-1975- Spurred by {{a former}} U.P. classmate, N. Carating, Roy Veneracion joined an art contest {{sponsored}} by the newly founded Miladay Art Gallery in Makati. He did not win the contest but his entry so-impressed some art enthusiasts and art professionals that he was offered a One-Man-Show in the Gallery that same year. The show was followed by other shows in <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> wherein Roy became known as an enfant terrible Abstract Expressionist. His painting style consisted of pouring liquified oil paint onto puddles of water on prepared board panels laid {{flat on the floor}} which he tilted to make the mixture flow in various directions creating rainbows of colors that coalesce into unpredictable Surreal configurations. The medium and the technique suggested the direction to take with subsequent improvisational gestures that sometimes included: soil, pebbles, nails, twigs, and print markings of the artist's body. Roy Veneracion’s art activities attracted the attention of like-minded artists, art dealers and connoisseurs.|$|R
25|$|Baphomet {{also serves}} as the main {{antagonist}} in the PC game Tristania 3D, and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France {{was the one who}} had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret will remain unearthed. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in <b>rapid</b> <b>successions.</b> Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.|$|R
5000|$|Between the show's {{segments}} are [...] "mouse spots", hand-drawn cartoons of 30 to 100 seconds {{that feature}} the orange mouse and its friends, a small blue elephant {{and a yellow}} duck. None of the characters speak. Rather, sound effects and music comprise the soundtrack as the characters interact and solve problems. The animated interludes serve to separate the segments, offering young viewers a moment to relax, avoiding sensory overload from too <b>rapid</b> a <b>succession</b> of input.|$|R
5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia and swept through Venetia, taking in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced {{difficulties}} only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns {{closer to the}} coast on the Via Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E
5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b> Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{damage was}} done on the lakes. Major shipwrecks occurred on all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession,</b> with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters also stated that the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This {{was the result of}} the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E
40|$|Under an {{appropriate}} regular variation condition, the affinely normalized partial sums of {{a sequence of}} independent and identically distributed random variables converges weakly to a non-Gaussian stable random variable. A functional version of this {{is known to be}} true as well, the limit process being a stable Lévy process. The main result in the paper is that for a stationary, regularly varying sequence for which clusters of high-threshold excesses can be broken down into asymptotically independent blocks, the properly centered partial sum process still converges to a stable Lévy process. Due to clustering, the Lévy triple of the limit process can be different from the one in the independent case. The convergence takes place in the space of càdlàg functions endowed with Skorohod’s M_{ 1 } topology, the more usual J_{ 1 } topology being inappropriate as the partial sum processes may exhibit <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of jumps within temporal clusters of large values, collapsing in the limit to a single jump. The result rests on a new limit theorem for point processes which is of independent interest. The theory is applied to moving average processes, squared GARCH(1, 1) processes and stochastic volatility models...|$|R
60|$|A {{moderate}} incline runs {{towards the}} foot of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as <b>rapid</b> a <b>succession</b> of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading one {{on the heels of}} another and with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the slope.|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{interconnect}} {{and packaging}} technologies have introduced <b>rapid</b> <b>successions</b> of new materials and processes. Environmental pressures are {{leading to the}} reduction and eventual elimination of lead in solder used for attaching chips to packages and packages to circuit boards. The overall task of this program is to provide critical metrology and methodology for mechanical, chemical, metallurgical, electrical, thermal, and reliability evaluations of interconnect and packaging technologies. The function of packaging is to connect the integrated circuit to the system or subsystem platform, such as circuit board, {{and to protect the}} integrated circuit from the environment. The increasing number of input/output (I/O) on circuits with vastly larger scale of integration is forcing ever smaller I/O pitches, the use of flip chip bonding, and the use of intermediary platforms called interposers. The integration of sensors and actuators onto integrated circuits through MEMS technology and the increasing use of low cost integrated circuits in harsh environments is increasing the complexity of the packaging task. Environmental concerns are forcing the need for development of reliable lead-free solder and other low environmental impact packaging materials. System reliability requirements demand modeling, testing methods, and failure analysis of the integrated circuits before and after packaging. Metrology is a significant component of reliability evaluation...|$|R
5|$|Having {{returned}} to active military duty, Middleton {{was assigned to}} a training regiment at Camp Wheeler, Georgia where he was quickly promoted to colonel on 1 February, and oversaw the combat training of thousands of recruits. After less than two months, {{he was given a}} <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> of assignments, including to Camp Gordon, Georgia and Camp Blanding, Florida. While at Blanding he was called to the War Department in Washington, where he was given an assignment to be a staff officer in London, but this rapidly changed when he was subsequently called to the War College, and met a classmate from Command and General Staff School, Brigadier General Mark Clark, who told him that he was being assigned to the Forty-fifth Infantry Division at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, {{heavy rains}} {{produced}} by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from the Vietnamese flood control committee indicated that 60,000hectares (148,000acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700metric tons (7,400short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000homes collapsed and 119,000others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they {{had yet to be}} verified by October12. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the <b>rapid</b> <b>succession</b> of storms, losses resulting from the three typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, the Vietnamese Government appealed for international assistance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their owned-and-operated station WCSP (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C. area with all three cable network feeds airing via HD Radio subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio. Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices. C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it does offer some audio simulcasts of programs such as Washington Journal. Unique programming on the radio station includes oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The station also compiles the Sunday morning talk shows for a same-day rebroadcast without commercials, in <b>rapid</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 69, Sporus became {{involved}} with Otho, the second of a <b>rapid,</b> violent <b>succession</b> of four emperors who vied for power during the chaos that followed Nero's death: Otho had once been married to Poppaea, until Nero forced their divorce. Otho reigned for just three months, until his suicide after the Battle of Bedriacum. His victorious rival, Vitellius intended using Sporus as victim in a public entertainment; a fatal [...] "re-enactment" [...] of the Rape of Proserpina at a gladiator show. Sporus avoided this public humiliation by committing suicide. He was probably under 20 years old.|$|R
