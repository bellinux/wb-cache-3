The Air Canada Centre holds 18,900 seats for Leafs games, with 15,500 reserved for season ticket holders. Because of the demand for season tickets, their sale is limited to the 10,000 people on the waiting list. As of March 2016, Leafs' season tickets saw a <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> of 99.5 percent, a rate that would require more than 250 years to clear the existing waiting list. With an average of US$1.9 million per game, the Leafs had the highest average ticket revenue per game in the 2007â€“08 season.|$|E
25|$|Although {{groundwater}} {{sources are}} quite prevalent, one major {{area of concern}} is the <b>renewal</b> <b>rate</b> or recharge rate of some groundwater sources. Abstracting from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed. Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems. Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{greenhouse}} ventilation model, {{based on}} the stack and wind effects (the main driving forces for natural ventilation) was adapted, calibrated and validated using measured air <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> in a three span naturally ventilated Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Crop transpiration rates were monitored using stem heat balance sap flow gauges installed on the main stems of rose plants to continuously monitor whole-plant transpiration (WPT). This allowed continuous and automatic determination of full scale air <b>renewal</b> and leakage <b>rates</b> using the water vapour balance method. The model was fitted to experimental data of ventilation rates, and discharge and wind effect coefficients were determined. The results show a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 80 and 0. 82 for winter and summer, respectively), {{although there is a}} general over-estimation of the greenhouse air <b>renewal</b> <b>rates,</b> particularly during the night. The model, nevertheless, adequately describes the natural ventilation process in the greenhouse all year round. The model {{can be used as a}} design tool to evaluate and optimise the effects of different ventilation configurations and strategies on greenhouse air <b>renewal</b> <b>rates,</b> and as a component in a greenhouse climate model in order to further evaluate the effects of ventilation strategies on the inside greenhouse and crop microclimate, and thus lead to better greenhouse climate control...|$|R

40|$|Surface active agents depress gas {{transfer}} at gas-liquid interfaces. They are present as measurable trace contaminants at all environmental and at most industrial interfaces. An experimental apparatus to concurrently measure dynamic surface tension and mass transfer was constructed and tested for single-bubble and multi-bubble experiments. In this work, the parameters describing time-dependent bubble surface contamination were characterized. The {{application of a}} Ward-Tordai transient model and of a Langmuir saturation model showed that for fine-bubbles in low molecular weight surfactant solutions the interfacial surfactant accumulation equilibrates before bubble detachment. This {{is reflected in the}} bubbles behaving as solid-spheres, which is shown in our dimensionless results. For a given contamination, interfaces with higher <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> have higher mass transfer. At higher <b>renewal</b> <b>rates,</b> the variation due to different contamination is smaller than the variation at lower <b>renewal</b> <b>rates,</b> concluding that higher interfacial flow regimes can offset contamination. Our experimental evidence shows a {{gas transfer}} reduction of 30 - 70 % of pure water values in surfactant solutions, which confirms full-scale field measurements. Results are consistent with expectations and correct previous Frossling-like dimensionless correlations for pure water systems. Our results offer a tool for mass transfer prediction from flow regime and surfactant properties. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Customer Relationship Management (CRM) theory {{suggests}} that good customer service results in satisfied customers, who in turn {{are more likely to}} remain loyal and recommend the service provider to others. Applied to real estate, this theory implies that landlords should see a return on any investment in the service they give to tenants, in the form of increased lease <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> and fewer void periods, achieved without compromising rents. This paper examines determinants of occupier satisfaction, and investigates the relationship between occupier satisfaction and property performance, using measures such as capital growth, income return, lease <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> and total return. The analysis is based upon a pilot study using occupier satisfaction responses from around 2500 interviewees based in multi-tenanted offices, shopping centres and retail warehouses on out-of-town retail parks in the UK.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. This {{dissertation}} explores {{both the}} concepts of brand loyalty and relationship marketing, specifically in a voluntary professional institutes and associations environment, {{with the assumption that}} both constructs can influence and improve the membership retention and membership <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> of these institutes and associations. The measuring instrument used is similar to the one used by Moolla in his brand loyalty study in a FMCG environment, but in this case focussing on the services sector, specifically a South African voluntary professional institute, the Institute of Municipal Administration for Southern Africa (IMASA). The 12 brand loyalty influences identified by Moolla was electronically administered to members of IMASA, with 58 members eventually responding (response rate of 31 %). The conceptual research with regard to this study starts off by explaining the tendency of people to assemble in groups due to societal and other reasons, defining group cohesiveness and how this leads to the formation of people on a professional level â€“ the birth of a professional institute and association (PIA). Then {{the concepts of}} relationship marketing and brand loyalty are defined, its relevance in a PIA environment discussed, and the 12 influences on brand loyalty also defined. The empirical analysis and results confirm that, with the exception of Culture {{and to a lesser extent}} Switching Costs, the constructs impact directly on the brand loyalty and indirectly on the <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> of the members of a PIA. The value and uniqueness of this study are founded firstly in the identification of influences that affects brand loyalty and secondly in the importance of relationship marketing in a PIA environment. The recommendations guide the management of PIAs to ensure that membership levies defaulters are minimized and <b>renewal</b> <b>rates</b> maximised and sustained over time. Master...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{residential}} buildings in temperate climates were ventilated by the daily opening of windows and by exaggerated window and door permeability. Energy conservation concerns {{have led to}} better quality windows and lower air permeability that consequently increased the risk of condensation whilst decreasing indoor air quality. Because {{of the variation in}} natural factors, such as wind speed and the stack effect, natural ventilation systems are unlikely to permanently provide ideal ventilation rates. As such, we will characterize the performance of hybrid ventilation systems (air intake through automatically regulated louvers in bedrooms and living rooms, natural exhaust in bathrooms and fan exhaust systems in kitchens) that are a possible solution to this drawback. In March of 2002 and January of 2003, we measured air change rates in a 2 -bedroom apartment using the PFT technique.
