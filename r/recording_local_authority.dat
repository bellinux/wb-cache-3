40|$|There are two {{essential}} elements to this paper. In the first instance, we explore the specific details of {{revenue and expenditure}} trends for <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> over the last decade. The analysis is framed against a longer-term political context of forty years which focuses especially on the weakness of local government in Ireland. Despite an official narrative of financial overdependence on central government, the comparative examination of budgetary <b>records</b> of <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> reveals considerable diversity in both the revenue and expenditure patterns of authorities across the state. While some authorities are heavily reliant on central government funding, others have a much stronger base of local funding, and indeed the financial crisis since 2008 may have increased these differences. The second dimension to the research is {{an exploration of the}} impact of the great recession from 2008 on local government finance in Ireland. Using a framework of new institutionalism, we identify the crisis as another critical moment for local government. We consider the political, economic and administrative variables which have brought local government to a financial crossroads, and we explore the potential for long-lasting financial change in local government, as well as speculating on the nature and outcome of that change...|$|R
50|$|Seven {{factors to}} be {{cognizant}} of at this stage are: suitability of {{the site for the}} proposed works, economic and adequacy of design, optimum method of construction with reference to potential issues due to ground and groundwater. The effect of changes to the ground and environment due to the works, and, therefore the effect on the works from these changes. Consideration of suitability on a selection of sites. And finally, the existing works and their implications. If a site has been used in the past, this is {{a major factor in the}} investigation, mining, quarrying, landfill or waste disposal, industrial usages, archaeological or ecological factors may all have a bearing on the intended works. The cost of an SI is low relative to the project cost and when conducted thoroughly can be a significant saving later.Investigations should evaluate the nature of the ground and groundwater. The size and nature of the works will have a bearing on the investigations as will its former use as a site or contamination of ground or groundwater. It will be considered in 3 stages. First a desk study to collate the information above as far as possible. Where a site is contaminated it is appropriate at this stage to plan site safety procedures for any further investigations. Planning the details of further investigations is appropriate too. Existing <b>records,</b> <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> industry, libraries, present or past OS maps and aerial photography or even anecdotal information are to be used. A site reconnaissance should also be conducted at this stage and includes a thorough visual inspection of any exposed cuttings and note taken of level of vegetation. The surroundings should also be noted. Second, a more detailed investigation is undertaken and finally a construction review - these shall be discussed later.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} {{intended}} {{to contribute to the}} debate on public employment in Belgium by analysing the most coherent possible set of statistics on its development and characteristics. According to the national accounts definition, the general government sector employed just over 800, 000 workers in 2007. The sector’s main employers are the Communities and Regions and <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> while the federal government and social security together account for only one-fifth. If the concept used is broader than general government, and includes heavily subsidised jobs (health, social work and service vouchers), public enterprises and market intermunicipal associations, there could be 1. 4 million persons in public employment. Over the long term, the variations in public employment correspond to the major fluctuations in budgetary policy. Employment in the general government sector expanded particularly strongly during the 1970 s. Following a period of virtual stabilisation from 1982 onwards, employment in the sector increased again between 1997 and 2007. The analysis reveals that this expansion was not uniform across the branches of activity. During the recent period, employment has declined in defence and in some federal government departments, such as FPS Finance. Conversely, growth has been particularly marked in transport and in administration, especially where those services come under the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> or some federal departments such as justice. All sub-sectors have shared in the employment growth <b>recorded</b> since 1995. <b>Local</b> <b>authorities</b> account for over 60 p. c. of that growth, and the Communities and Regions almost 30 p. c., the remaining 10 p. c. being due to increased employment at federal level, including social security. A more detailed analysis therefore focused on developments in the administration branch of activity at the level of both the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> and the Communities and Regions. Among other things, this showed that <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> recruitment did not relate to civil service functions but concerned social work (crèches, the CPAS/OCMW re employment programmes, etc.), the police and cultural and sports positions. Regarding the characteristics of public employment, an ever diminishing proportion of staff has civil servant status, and women are increasingly in the majority. Moreover, the standard of skills of public sector personnel is constantly improving. A more detailed study of the age pyramids showed that, taking account of current retirement and pre-retirement patterns, departures should be staggered without reaching disproportionate levels in the next five to ten years. However, the numbers leaving are expected to be greater in some branches, departments and institutions. public employment, general government sector, Belgium...|$|R
