40|$|Introduction: A <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> {{system is}} a system that {{establishes}} a common reimbursement level or <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> for a group of interchangeable medicines, i. e. the reference group. This article provides an overview of the different characteristics of the different <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> systems in Europe. Additionally, the impact of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> on price competition, generic medicine use, pharmaceutical expenditure and health outcome will be discussed. Methods: Studies relevant for this article were found by means of a literature review. A survey was carried out to document the current status of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> systems in Europe. Survey data were collected from member associations of the European Generic medicines Association {{in the context of their}} 2011 survey of European drug retail markets. Results: Many European governments have introduced <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> systems. <b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> systems reduce medicine prices but not always below the <b>reference</b> <b>price,</b> increase the use of medicines priced at or below the <b>reference</b> <b>price,</b> generate savings in pharmaceutical expenditure that tend to be limited to the short term, and do not seem to adversely affect health outcomes. Conclusion: <b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> is a popular policy for governments to contain pharmaceutical expenditures and seems to be effective in the different European countries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{analyze the}} medium- to {{long-term}} impact of generic substitution and the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> {{system on the}} daily cost of antipsychotics in Finland. The additional impact of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> over and above previously implemented generic substitution was also assessed. MethodsAn interrupted time series design with a control group and segmented regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the effect of the implementation of generic substitution and the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> system on the daily cost of antipsychotics. The data have 69 monthly values of the average daily cost for each of the studied antipsychotics: 39 months before and 30 months after the introduction of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> For one of the studied antipsychotic, the time before the introduction of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> could be further divided into time before and after the introduction of generic substitution. ResultsAccording to the model, 2. 5 years after the implementation of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing,</b> the daily cost of the studied antipsychotics was 24. 6 % to 50. 6 % lower {{than it would have been}} if <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> had not been implemented. Two and a half years after the implementation of the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> system, however, the additional impact of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> over and above previously implemented generic substitution was modest, less than 1 percentage point. ConclusionsAlthough the price competition induced by <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> decreased the prices of antipsychotics in Finland in the short-term, the prices had a tendency to stagnate or even to turn in an upward direction in the medium- to long-term. Furthermore, the additional impact of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> over and above previously implemented generic substitution remained quite modest...|$|R

In the private sector, highest- and lowest-priced medicines were 22.7 and 10.7 times more expensive than international <b>reference</b> <b>prices</b> respectively.

40|$|Within a {{horizontal}} differentiation model and allowing for heterogeneous qualities, we analyze {{the effects of}} <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> reimbursement on firms' pricing strategies.

The analysis encompasses different <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> rules: (i) <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> as the minimum of the observed prices in the market, (ii) <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> as a linear combination of firms' prices. Results show that under the "minimum policy" firms are not able to coordinate on higher prices while the "linear policy", implicitly, provides a coordination device. We have also found that, relatively to the "linear policy", when the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> is the minimum of observed prices, after policy implementation, total and private expenditures are higher and consumer surplus and firms' profits are lower.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{guidance}} within the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> literature by investigating which is the best measure of <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> for the, as yet, unstudied context of new product categories. The paper also intends to examine another <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> issue for the new product category context: whether greater price uncertainty in this context makes it worthwhile to measure consumer confidence in <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> perceptions. Design/methodology/approach – This research uses the experimental method to determine which measures of <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> are best suited to the new product context, by removing all other confounding influences. Findings – The findings confirm that consumers tend to evoke the fair price concept for new product categories and the expected price concept for existing categories. The paper also finds that confidence in <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> measures, while theoretically useful, does not add to the understanding of <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> effects in new product categories, probably because respondents tended to be overly confident in their perceptions, despite lacking in more objective measures of product category knowledge. Originality/value – Several studies in the literature have commented on the issue of fragmented measurement in the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> domain. Some studies have offered theoretical guidance on measures to use. This is the first study to provide empirically tested theory on which measures to use and is the first study to examine <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> effects in new product categories including testing the usefulness of the confidence measure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> {{systems are}} {{reimbursement}} ceilings set by payers {{in an effort}} to constrain pharmaceutical expenditure for a private or public drug benefit. In recent years, many governments have adopted <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> either as a replacement or in addition to product specific price controls. Programme administrators should consider whether these policies are providing the intended benefits or whether there may be a more effective method. This article provides a review of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> in Europe, North America and other countries. There are many similarities in the <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> policies but the markets to which they apply {{are more likely to be}} different. The European experience gives a `once-for-all' lowering effect on pharmaceutical expenditure, often at the expense of compromises on prescribing. In Germany and The Netherlands, <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> has been relatively ineffective in lowering expenditure which has led to a succession of other interventions to achieve expenditure control goals. The US also has <b>reference</b> <b>pricing,</b> but it occurs in a very competitive market which may be responsible (at least in part) for the relatively modest growth in expenditure compared with European countries. The review of countries with <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> policies suggests that such policies are less effective than competitive markets in moderating pharmaceutical expenditure. Nonetheless, governments continue to pursue <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies. Reviews-on-treatment, Health-policy, Reimbursement, Health-economics, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R

In the Eighth Plan, Benazir Bhutto, assisted by her financial advisers at the Finance ministry set target to achieve 6.9% for the GDP growth by 1995, but eventually the GDP Growth rate lowered to 5.3% and ended up at 4.30%.

40|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> {{intends to}} reduce {{pharmaceutical}} expenditures by increasing demand elasticity and stimulating generic competition. We develop a novel model where a brand-name producer competes in prices with several generics producers {{in a market}} with brand-biased and brand-neutral consumers.

However, under price regulation, we show that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> may stimulate generic entry, since a binding price cap weakens the aggressive price response by the brand-name producer.
