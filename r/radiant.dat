5|$|Circinus is the <b>radiant</b> of {{an annual}} meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors {{have an average}} velocity of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to be}} associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a <b>radiant</b> close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, Infinity Ward {{released}} the Call of Duty 2 <b>Radiant,</b> which allows {{a player to}} create their own multiplayer or single-player maps. Along with <b>Radiant,</b> the mapmaker includes Maya plug-in support, an effects editor, and an asset manager which allows custom models to be made and imported into the game, as well as custom effects.|$|E

5|$|<b>Radiant</b> Dawn began {{development}} in 2005 for the Wii after {{the success of}} Path of Radiance. Continuing the trend of developing for home consoles after a period on portable devices, {{it was intended to}} release close to the Wii hardware's release so as to boost sales for both game and hardware. <b>Radiant</b> Dawn has been positively received by critics, many of whom criticised only the game's high difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} Fire Emblem games were highly {{successful}} in Japan, selling 329,087; 324,699; 776,338; 498,216 and 106,108 copies respectively. As of 2002, total sales had reached over two million copies. Sales {{of the series}} went into a decline beginning with <b>Radiant</b> Dawn, but Awakening topped the total sales of both <b>Radiant</b> Dawn and the Mystery of the Emblem remake in its first week. It went on to sell 1.79 million copies worldwide and become the best-selling Fire Emblem title in western territories.|$|E
5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and <b>Radiant</b> Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. <b>Radiant</b> Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in battle to grant them <b>Radiant</b> Skills, permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as skills that can be performed in battle.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese astronomy, {{the stars}} {{that make up}} Andromeda were members of four {{different}} constellations that had astrological and mythological significance; a constellation related to Andromeda also exists in Hindu mythology. Andromeda is {{the location of the}} <b>radiant</b> for the Andromedids, a weak meteor shower that occurs in November.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese mythology, Auriga's {{stars were}} {{incorporated}} into several constellations, including the celestial emperors' chariots, {{made up of the}} modern constellation's brightest stars. Auriga is home to the <b>radiant</b> for the Aurigids, Zeta Aurigids, Delta Aurigids, and the hypothesized Iota Aurigids.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the <b>radiant</b> points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the <b>radiant</b> point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{energy is}} <b>radiant</b> light and {{heat from the}} Sun that is {{harnessed}} using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with items}} and money earned from battles, winning battles earns {{experience}} points which increases each party member's level and {{allows them to}} learn skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for <b>Radiant</b> Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.|$|E
5|$|As {{the three}} travel through several worlds, Terra attracts the {{attention}} of several villains who offer him the whereabouts of Xehanort in exchange for assistance in their own agendas. He eventually finds Xehanort, who instructs him to destroy Vanitas, {{the source of the}} Unversed created from the darkness extracted from Ventus' heart. Shortly afterward, the three friends reunite at <b>Radiant</b> Garden, where Aqua and Ventus confront Terra about his actions, but he dismisses them.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher <b>radiant</b> intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of years}} later, Yune and Ashera combine to again become the goddess Ashunera, creator of Tellius.

5|$|Kalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which {{fulfill the}} desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times {{children}} are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma. There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, fragrant flowers, shining lamps and a <b>radiant</b> light at night.|$|E
5|$|Pavo is the <b>radiant</b> of two annual meteor showers: the Delta Pavonids and August Pavonids. Appearing from 21 March to 8 April and {{generally}} peaking around 5 and 6 April, Delta Pavonids {{are thought to}} be associated with Comet Grigg-Mellish. The shower was discovered by Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980. The August Pavonids peak around August 31 and {{are thought to be}} associated with the Halley-type Comet Levy (P/1991 L3).|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of <b>radiant</b> energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{score for}} Vagrant Story was composed, arranged, and produced by Hitoshi Sakimoto, whose previous video game works included the soundtracks to <b>Radiant</b> Silvergun and Final Fantasy Tactics, with additional arrangement by Takeharu Ishimoto for Track 2–30 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2–31. A Japanese orchestra ensemble, Shinozuka Group, performed for the orchestral piece of Track 2–29. All synthesizing operations {{are led by}} Takeharu Ishimoto with assistance from Hidenori Iwasaki for Track 1–1 and Hirosato Noda for Track 2–18.|$|E
5|$|Wavering <b>Radiant</b> is {{the fifth}} and final {{full-length}} album by American post-metal group Isis, released by Ipecac Recordings in 2009 and produced by Joe Barresi. It stands as Isis' last full-length album, as the band split {{just over a year}} after its release. The album continues Isis' history of lengthy songwriting, yet presents a slight departure from the soft-loud dynamics and post-metal aesthetic which characterized previous releases.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings {{his body to}} the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. Back at <b>Radiant</b> Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to sink into the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier. The staff numbers, including those working on the cutscenes, went from around one hundred for Path of Radiance to around 200 for <b>Radiant</b> Dawn: half the staff worked on the game itself, while the other half worked on the cutscenes. For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from Path of Radiance the developers felt was wrong. All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E
5|$|Cheria is the {{granddaughter of}} Lhant's family butler. She was sickly {{as a child}} but is healed due to Sophie's powers. She harbors a crush on Asbel but treats him coldly after he leaves Lhant. She later reveals her sorrow in having Asbel abandon her and reconciles with him. She also becomes Asbel's wife. She is voiced by Shiho Kawaragi and dubbed by Laura Bailey. Since her debut, Cheria has ranked on the Tales {{character}} popularity polls. Game Informer listed Cheria {{as one of the}} best characters in the Tales series. Cheria is a playable character in Tales of the World: <b>Radiant</b> Mythology 3 and Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary <b>Radiant</b> AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary <b>Radiant</b> A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to <b>Radiant</b> Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The game's story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using {{a specially designed}} fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanic is the game's key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are {{the same color as}} the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the <b>Radiant</b> A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and <b>Radiant</b> Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more <b>radiant</b> than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is the <b>radiant</b> of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, {{also known}} as the December Phoenicids, were first {{observed}} on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A very minor meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower {{is referred to as the}} July Phoenicids.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the <b>radiant</b> light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids are {{normally}} a placid Class II meteor shower that {{peaks in the}} early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum zenithal hourly rate is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a <b>radiant</b> located about two degrees north of Theta Aurigae, a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.|$|E
5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects <b>radiant</b> heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star, Alpha Phoenicis, {{is named}} Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a binary system {{composed of two}} yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix Cluster—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is the <b>radiant</b> of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} member, Alpha Pavonis, is {{also known}} as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-magnitude blue-white star, but is actually a spectroscopic binary. Delta Pavonis is a nearby Sun-like star some 19.9 light-years distant. Six of the star systems in Pavo have been found to host planets, including HD 181433 with a super-earth, and HD 172555 with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains NGC 6752, the third-brightest globular cluster in the sky, and the spiral galaxy NGC 6744, which closely resembles the Milky Way but is twice as large. Pavo displays an annual meteor shower known as the Delta Pavonids, whose <b>radiant</b> is near the star δ Pav.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. <b>Radiant</b> energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.|$|E
