In order to achieve diffraction conditions, the sample under study must be precisely aligned.

The classical 3DXRD setup {{is similar to}} the conventional tomography setting used at synchrotrons: the sample, mounted on a <b>rotation</b> <b>stage,</b> is illuminated using quasi-parallel monochromatic X-ray beam. Each time a certain grain within the sample satisfies the Bragg condition, a diffracted beam is generated. This signal is transmitted through the sample and collected by two-dimensional detectors. Since different grains satisfy the [...] at different angles, the sample is rotated to probe the complete sample structure. Crucial for 3DXRD is the idea to mimic a three-dimensional detector by positioning a number of two-dimensional detectors at different distances from the centre of rotation of the sample, and exposing these either simultaneously (many detectors are semi-transparent to hard X-rays) or at different times.|$|E

The phase shifter creates straight interference fringes with regular intervals; so called carrier fringes. When the sample is placed in the other beam, the carrier fringes are displaced. The phase shift caused by the sample corresponds to the displacement of the carrier fringes. Several interference patterns are recorded for different shifts of the reference beam and by analyzing them the phase information modulo 2 can be extracted. This ambiguity of the phase is called the phase wrapping effect and can be removed by so-called [...] "phase unwrapping techniques". These techniques can be used when the signal-to-noise ratio of the image is sufficiently high and phase variation is not too abrupt.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. Bragg {{gratings}} {{are important}} components for sensing and for wavelength-division multiplexed optical communication systems. These gratings are manufactured by either side-writing of the fiber {{with a high}} intensity UV light through a phase mask, or by exposing the fiber to interference fringes through an interferometer arrangement. With one phase mask, only a small range of grating wavelengths is possible. This is achieved by pre-straining the fiber during the writing process. The limitation arises from the break strength of the fi ber, allowing a maximum range of Bragg wavelengths of only approximately 10 nm. The interferometric technique uses a beam splitter to divide a single input UV beam into two and intersecting them at the fiber. The angle at which the beams intersect will determine {{the period of the}} interference fringes and thus the Bragg grating written in the optical fiber. The Argon-ion laser is used with a 1060 nm phase mask (used to split beam) to write Bragg gratings with reflections from 1012 to 1600 nm.

40|$|Light-sheet-based {{fluorescence}} microscopy (LSFM) is a fluorescence technique that combines optical sectioning, the key capability of confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopes with multiple-view imaging, {{which is used}} in optical tomography. In contrast to conventional wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopes, a light sheet illuminates only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the detection process. Compared to confocal {{fluorescence microscopy}}, LSFM reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by up to three orders of magnitude. In LSFM, the specimen is embedded in a transparent block of hydrogel and positioned relative to the stationary light sheet using precise motorized translation and <b>rotation</b> <b>stages.</b> This feature is used to image any plane in a specimen.
