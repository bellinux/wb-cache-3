Similar degradation behavior was observed for all surfactants {{with only a}} fraction of the parent compound <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable.</b> Biodegradation, as estimated by COD removal, was initially (i. e., within 24 h) rapid, however only 40 – 70 % of the surfactant molecules were <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable.</b> Intrinsic kinetic parameters were successfully quantified for the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> component of the surfactant.

40|$|Phenol is a {{pollutant}} {{found in}} many industrial wastewaters, which diminishes biogas formation in anaerobic digesters. In this study, a two-stage (acidogenic and methanogenic) anaerobic digester (TSAD) was compared to a single stage digester (SSD), in treating a synthetic wastewater contaminated with phenol. Both systems were operated in batch-dilution and semi-continuously at 35 °C, and were loaded with a synthetic wastewater containing a constant concentration of <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> organic matter and an increasing concentration of phenol. The TSAD had greater biogas production, and its acidogenic reactor fermented the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> matter without inhibition by accumulation of phenol (up to 1 450 mg∙ℓ- 1). The acidogenic reactor also prevented inhibition of biogas formation {{in the second phase}} (methanogenic), by holding phenol and fast produced organic acids.

40|$|Includes bibliography. This {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} two problems: (1) verification of the bisubstrate concept proposed by Dold, Ekama and Marais (1980), in which the biodegradable component of wastewater consists of <b>readily</b> and slowly <b>biodegradable</b> fractions, and (2) physical separation techniques for estimating the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction. Intensive research, since 1970, into the behaviour of activated sludge systems at the University of Cape Town has culminated {{in the formulation of}} a general kinetic model, by Dold and Marais (1986). The model is highly complex, incorporating a number of different processes; however extensive simulation {{studies have shown that the}} model simulates the behaviour of activated sludge systems very closely. A crucial concept incorporated in the general model is that the biodegradable fraction of a wastewater can be subdivided into two fractions with sharply different characteristics (bisubstrate concept), a <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction which is directly utilized by the organism mass at a high rate and a slowly biodegradable fraction which requires to be solubilized extracellularly to <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> material for subsequent use by [...] the organism. Solubilization is hypothesized to be a relatively slow process. These characteristics were inferred from the oxygen utilization rate response of a system fed in a cyclic square wave fashion. No work has been done to verify if substrates of specific chemical structures can be allocated to one or the other of the fractions. One of the objectives of this {{investigation was}} to check if pure and mixtures of specific selected substrates reflected these fractions when fed to activated sludge systems. Glucose and maize starch were selected as representative of <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> and slowly biodegradable substrate respectively. Systems were run under steady state and square wave cyclic state with glucose only, starch only and glucose/starch mixtures. From the steady state response the specific yield values could be determined and the reliability of the data checked by doing mass balances on the COD. From the cyclic response the specific rate constants for growth and solubilization respectively could be determined by trial simulation using the general model and specifying the concentrations of <b>readily</b> and slowly <b>biodegradable</b> fractions equal to the stoichiometric concentrations of glucose and starch in the feed.

40|$|The process {{characteristics}} of an industrial scale trickling filter plant were quantified {{by means of}} a five day intensive measurement campaign with the use of on-line respirometry and on-line off-gas analysis. Respirometry was used to measure the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> CODst and the off-gas sensor was used to monitor the O- 2 and CO 2 content of the off-gases. To model the biodegradation in the filters, the model developed by Rauch et at. (1999) was used. It is based on the decoupling of two basic processes in biofilm systems, substrate diffusion and biodegradation. This model was extended with equations for the production and the pH-dependent liquid-phase equilibrium for inorganic carbon (IC). The measured effluent and off-gas concentrations could be followed very closely by the calibrated model. O- 2 and CO 2 measurements revealed that the system was not always oxygen limited.

40|$|Three {{continuously}} {{stirred tank}} reactors (CSTR) were operated in semi continuous mode treating swine waste using anaerobic digestion. The reactors {{were used to}} test the effect of solid retention time (SRT) on CH 4 yield, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations, % volatile solids (VS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) removal, <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentration and the denitrification potential for the effluent in a biological nutrient removal (BNR) system. During Phase I of the study, the three reactors were operated at the same 28 day SRT for 16 weeks. SRTs were then changed during the 12 week Phase II period. The SRTs studied were 14, 21 and 28 days, with the same organic loading rate (OLR) of 1. 88 ± 0. 2 kg VS/ m 3 -day. The reactor with the lowest SRT (14 days) had the highest VS and VFA removal at 73. 6 and 67. 6 % and lowest TAN concentration at 0. 78 g NH 4 +-N/L, followed by the 21 day and 28 day reactors. This was likely due to the fast microbial growth rates and substrate utilization rates in this reactor compared with the other two. The 14 day reactor had the highest CH 4 yield at 0. 33 m 3 CH 4 /kg VS added and <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentration at 0. 93 COD/L. The variations in CH 4 yield and <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentrations between the three reactors were not statistically significant. Denitrification potential for the reactors was 1. 20, 0. 73 and 0. 56 g COD/g N for 14, 21 and 28 day reactors, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant. None of the reactors achieved a denitrification potential of 5 g COD/g N, the amount required to use effluent of anaerobically digested swine waste as an internal carbon source in a BNR. This was attributed to operating conditions such as freezing and thawing of the raw swine waste that maximized CH 4 yield and lowered the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> COD concentration.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the performance of a conventional and a modified plug-flow digester for scraped dairy cattle manure based on results from 12 -month studies to characterize the performance of each design with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production and utilization. Both are full-scale digesters located on commercial dairy farms. The primary objective of this comparison was to determine if either design approach provides superior performance with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production. The modified plug-flow digester was found to provide a higher reduction in total volatile solids (TVS), 39. 6 versus 29. 7 percent, a higher biogas yield, 3. 08 versus 2. 21 m 3 per cow-day, and higher electricity production, 13, 896 versus 9, 380 kJ per cow-day. However, these differences were found to be directly related to the difference in the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction of influent TVS, 47 versus 30 percent and were reflected in the rate of electricity generated, 13, 896 kJ per cow-day from the modified versus 9, 380 kJ per cow-day from the conventional plug-flow digester design. In contrast, specific biogas and methane yields on a kg TVS destroyed basis were essentially the same for both digester designs as was the thermal efficiency of converting biogas to electricity. This comparison suggests that neither design is superior. The observed differences in TVS reduction, biogas yield, and electricity generated appear to be solely a reflection of the difference in the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction of influent TVS. This suggests that an estimate of the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> fraction of influent TVS is a necessary prerequisite for a reliable prediction of anaerobic digester performance...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} synthesis and {{characterization of}} {{a new type of}} cationic gemini surfactant, which has dodecyl tails and a spacer that contains an ester bond. The nomenclature used to describe the structure is 12 Q 2 OCO 1 Q 12, with Q being a quaternary ammonium group and the numbers indicating the number of methylene or methyl groups. Due to the close proximity to the two quaternary ammonium groups, the ester bond is very stable on the acid side and very labile already at slightly alkaline conditions. The hydrolysis products are two single chain surfactants (i. e. 12 Q 2 OH and 12 Q 1 COOH) which are less surface active than the intact gemini surfactant. 12 Q 2 OCO 1 Q 12 was found to be <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable,</b> i. e. it gave more than 60 % biodegradation after 28 days.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of regional councils' Water Quality Plans implemented under the Resource Management Act (1991), many farmers in New Zealand are now irrigating effluent farm dairy effluent. However there are situations where irrigation is not practicable and it is considered that a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treatment system may provide a highly treated effluent able to be discharged directly to waterways. The objectives of this research were to develop an SBR operating strategy to optimise biological nutrient removal from farm dairy effluent, monitor the effectiveness of a pilot-scale SBR at removing nitrogen and phosphorus, and assess whether the untreated effluent could be made more <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> by prefermentation. An operating strategy was designed to enable biological nutrient removal, with the aim of achieving low phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate effluent concentrations. The SBR operating strategy is Fill, Anaerobic, Aerobic I, Anoxic, Aerobic II, Settle, and Decant. Phosphorus is released in the anaerobic phase, using the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> carbon. The first aerobic phase is used tor nitrification and phosphorus uptake. Remaining <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> carbon is also oxidised thus the denitrification occurring in the anoxic phase depends entirely on endogenous carbon. The final aerobic phase operates as a polisher. The results show that the SBR did not achieve biological nutrient removal: there was no apparent reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the effluent. The most likely reason for the SBR's failure to operate as expected is that it was operated on settled effluent rather than raw farm dairy effluent. The prefermentation trial aimed to increase the <b>readily</b> <b>biodegradable</b> carbon to improve phosphorus removal. The results showed that the optimal time for prefermentation of raw farm dairy effluent at 20 °C was eight to ten days, when VFA oxygen demand peaked at about 2, 100 mg/L. The prefermentation trial showed a lag phase of 0 to 2 days. The VFA proportions obtained in this experiment were 1. 0 : 0. 3 : 0. 14 : 0. 08 acetic : propionic : butyric : valeric acids. The SBR is likely to operate as part of a total treatment system, designed to enhance BNR and provide a high quality effluent. It is considered that screened farm dairy effluent would be held in a prefermentation pond with a hydraulic retention time of at least 8 to 10 days. Prefermented effluent would be treated in the SBR. The effluent would then be polished using wetlands. KEYWORDS: Sequencing batch reactor; prefermentation; farm dairy effluent; nitrogen removal; phosphorus removal; volatile fatty acids...|$|R
