40|$|Abstract: Since {{telecommunications}} {{markets were}} liberalized, competition has not {{developed in a}} geographically uniform manner, {{and the introduction of}} NGA networks is likely to exacerbate these geographic differences. Geographic variations in competition have caused European regulators to consider the use of geographically segmented regulation. Unfortunately, geographically segmented regulation is complicated and requires compromises and judgment calls. As a result, there is a danger that inconsistent implementation of geographically segmented regulation by NRAs may threaten the Single European market. This paper examines the experience of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in defining <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> and in adopting geographically segmented regulation. The paper begins by sketching the statutory and regulatory framework within which the FCC must operate. It then describes the FCC's approach to defining <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> for purposes of merger review and dominance determinations. The paper then examines how the Commission has attempted to adjust regulation for geographic differences in the level of competition, both in rulemaking proceedings and in response to petitions seeking forbearance from regulation. Drawing on the U. S. experience, the paper concludes with some observations on the difficulties and tradeoffs that European NRAs are likely to face in implementing geographically segmented regulation...|$|R

40|$|Competition law is an {{area which}} is going through changes over time, {{especially}} EC competition law {{in regard to the}} ongoing process of market integration. The definition of the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> within EC competition law is of importance to define, both in case law and for undertakings and their businesses, as the law should be predictable. Before Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abusive behaviour by undertakings, is applicable the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> has to be defined. As is the case with the Merger Regulation, the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> has to be defined to make an assessment of the undertakings’ activities. The definition of the geographic market is then used as a tool in the analysis of the assessment of competition and the effects of measures carried out by undertakings which restrain competition. Thus, the definition of the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> is crucial for the purposes of Community competition law. The definition of the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> can be said to be an area where “the objective conditions of competition applying to the product in question must be the same for all traders” as established in United Brands. In Deutsche Bahn it was clarified that “ [...] . the definition of the geographical market does not require the objective conditions of competition between traders to be perfectly homogenous”. It is enough if they are similar, therefore areas in which the objective conditions of competition are different, are not considered to be a uniform market. In the Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market for the purposes of Community competition law the Commission’s work to define the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> is described as well as the evidence the Commission contemplates in its assessment. The substitutability test is relied on by the Commission. In case law from the European Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, and the Commission, different factors are scrutinized to establish the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market.</b> Such factors are e. g., the undertakings’ activities, barriers to trade, and barriers to entry. The significance of the evidence and the factors used in the definition of the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> are debatable. The factors considered vary on a case to case basis and they need to differ to make a correct assessment of the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> in every case within EC competition law...|$|E

40|$|Applying {{principles}} of merger evaluation {{to the health}} care industry in general, and to hospital markets in particular, poses several unique challenges. Definition of <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> and assessment of the consequences of changes in competition for patient and social welfare are complicated by asymmetric information and moral hazard due to health insurance. We suggest a new empirical approach to assessing the impact of hospital competition which addresses the shortcomings of existing methods.

We conclude with an illustration of how our methods can be used to assess the welfare implications of specific hospital mergers, and with some implications of our findings for antitrust policy. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop and test a model that relates the profit rates of {{multinational}} firms to market share, other firm characteristics, and industry effects where the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> are defined at the global level.

Moreover, the Fortune Global 500 firms exhibit strong industry effects. While there are a number of explanations for a positive market share effect and strong industry effects, a common interpretation is the presence of rivalry among these firms.

40|$|M 000357 merger {{simulations}} The key in {{an evaluation}} of a proposed merger is {{to determine whether the}} reduction of competition it would cause is outweighed by potential cost reductions. Traditional analysis of mergers is primarily based on industry-concentration measures. A market is defined and market shares of the rel-evant firms are used to compute a pre-merger concentration measure as well as a change in this measure due to the merger. Both the pre-merger level and the change in concentration are then compared with preset levels. The in-tuition is that, if the industry is concentrated, or if the change in concen-tration is large, then the anti-competitive effect will dominate. Using this approach to evaluate mergers in some industries is problematic for at least two reasons. In many cases the product offerings make the definition of the <b>relevant</b> product (or <b>geographic)</b> <b>market</b> difficult. Even if the relevant market can be defined, the computed concentration index provides a reasonable standard by which to judge the competitive effects of the merger only unde...|$|R
40|$|Relevant market {{definition}} {{is still a}} key element of economic analysis of competition in the gasoline market. It is particularly difficult to handle when competition is local and market power is geographically constrained like is the case in the gasoline market.

We conclude that geographic information systems can be very successfully used to define more precisely <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> in the gasoline retailing. The application to the Spanish gasoline market concludes that geographic relevant market is composed by 5 - 6 minutes of travel time.

40|$|Market {{definition}} {{is an essential}} ingredient to competitive and regulatory analysis.

Given the present debate over expanding price regulation in this sector, the importance of market definition on the expected economic effects of regulation is worth evaluating. In this article, we demonstrate that if geographic markets are “location specific” and supplied by a monopolist as the proponents of regulation claim, then price regulation reduces economic welfare in all instances. That is, even with monopoly supply, regulation offers no improvement in economic welfare, meaning the debates over the extent of competition and profit margins in such markets are irrelevant. The effect of regulation is mostly to transfer profits from sellers to buyers, so the debate appears to be largely a squabble over rents. That said, every $ 1 of transfer costs more than $ 1 to society, so regulation reduces welfare. This analysis demonstrates that the present case for regulating high-capacity services is woefully inadequate and poorly conceived...|$|E

Further the thesis intends to investigate {{if there is any}} difference in air passenger transport in accordance to more general business. The definition of the relevant market is an essential step in order to establish a breach under European competition law. The relevant market includes the relevant product market and the <b>relevant</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>market.</b> The fundamental issue in the relevant product market is whether products are considered to be substitutable and can constitute the same market. The Commission has set a notice which includes methods and criterias and serves as guidelines to courts and companies to define the relevant market. The notice is however not binding for courts. The CJ have developed implementation of the criterias which it tends to refer to even if it is a different branch, however a case-by-case based definition is needed. The definition of the relevant market is based on three main criterias: demand substitutability, supply substitutability and potential competition. Even though the supply substitutability seems not be implemented in a further extension in more general branches, it seems to be of greater importance when defining the relevant market within air passenger transport. The air passenger transport has also established a test called base of origin and base of destination which includes an analysis of price, travel frequencies, comfort of the journey, transfer time to terminals and differences in the qualities and quantities in airports.   However according to air passenger transport, travel sequences seems to be the criteria that courts focus most on...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also our}} view that Lessig and later Ninth Circuit {{decisions}} refining and applying it are {{inconsistent with the}} policy of the Sherman Act. The purpose of the Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest. Thus, this Court and other courts have been careful to avoid constructions of § 2 which might chill competition, rather than foster it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm activity is unlike concerted activity covered by § 1, which [...] "inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk." [...] Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 767-769, 104 S.Ct., at 2739-2740. For these reasons, § 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so. Id., at 767, 104 S.Ct., at 2739. The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to further anticompetitive ends is plainly not met by inquir ing only whether the defendant has engaged in [...] "unfair" [...] or [...] "predatory" [...] tactics. Such conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize, which is something more than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case also requires inquiry into the <b>relevant</b> product and <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> and the defendant's economic power in that market.|$|R
