This technique involves the interaction of various process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, powder layer thickness and scan strategy. In this study, the effects of two different scan strategies were investigated and the 17 - 4 PH stainless steel samples fabricated using these strategies, both in as-fabricated and heat-treated conditions, were characterized in terms of <b>relative</b> <b>density,</b> microstructural phase <b>composition</b> and micro-hardness. It {{was found that the}} samples printed with double scan strategy showed improvement in the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> as compared to that printed with single scan strategy. Moreover, it was observed that the samples fabricated using the double scan strategy showed higher hardness than the samples printed using single scan strategy which was attributed to the high phase distribution of martensite than the retained austenite in these samples. In addition, the heat treatment of the as-fabricated samples produced uniform distribution of tempered martensite-dominant phase with negligible retained austenite, resulting in improved hardness as comparable to the heat-treated wrought sample...|$|R

The oxide mixture CTR 2 O 3 is a solid solution formed mainly by Y 2 O 3, Er 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3 and Dy 2 O 3 with other minor constituents and is obtained at a cost of only 20 % of pure Y 2 O 3. Samples were sintered by a gas pressure sintering process at 1900 °C under a nitrogen pressure of 1. 5 MPa and an isothermal holding time of 2 h. The obtained materials were characterized by their <b>relative</b> <b>density,</b> phase <b>composition</b> and bending strength.

Both materials produced presented <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> higher than 99. 5 %t. d., b-Si 3 N 4 and Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) as cristalline phases and bending strengths higher than 650 MPa, thus demonstrating similar behaviors regarding their physical, chemical and mechanical characteristics. The statistical analysis of their strength also showed similar results for both materials, with Weibull moduli m of about 15 and characteristic stress values s o of about 700 MPa.

Co-synthesis of these phases results in an intimately mixed powder with particle sizes on the order of 10 nm. DTA/TGA of all as-synthesized compositions determined that a calcination temperature of 1000 °C was required for full reaction of the cerate components.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for texturing of lead-free piezoelectric ceramics based on sodium potassium niobate (KNN) was investigated {{with respect to}} texturing procedure and choice of materials. Material compositions that were considered include KNN with and without addition of 0. 5 mol% MnO, and KNN modified with Li and Ta (KNNLT), and Mn substituted into the A or B site of the perovskite structure. The two compositions KNN-Mn and KNNLT-Mn(A) compositions were further investigated as candidate materials for texturing. Textured samples of the two materials were made by tape casting and templated grain growth, using needle-shaped KNN particles as templates, while non-textured reference samples were made by conventional sintering of powders. Both textured and non-textured dense materials were characterized with respect to density, degree of texture and piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The non-textured materials sintered to high <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> of 93. 9 % for KNN-Mn and 96. 7 % for KNNLT-Mn(A). A converse piezoelectric coefficient of over 250 pm/V was measured for non-textured KNNLT-Mn(A), and around 200 pm/V for KNN-Mn. Texturing led to a lower <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of both <b>compositions,</b> 89. 1 % for KNN-Mn and 92. 1 % for KNNLT-Mn(A). The piezoelectric performance of KNN-Mn was not significantly affected by the texturing procedure, while the piezoelectric performance of KNNLT-Mn(A) became significantly poorer. This {{is due to the}} formation of a secondary phase in KNNLT-Mn(A) during sintering, which is probably caused by the compositional mismatch between the templates and the fine-grained matrix powder. Based on the results, and a theoretical consideration of the texturing procedure, a different choice of template particles is suggested for further work on texturing of KNN-based materials. </p...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{relative}} importance of density-dependent and density-independent factors in driving population dynamics {{is one of the oldest}} challenges in ecology, and may play a critical role in predicting the effects of climate change on populations. We used long-term observational data to describe patterns in plant population regulation for 57 forb and grass species from three different ecosystems (arid desert grassland, semiarid sagebrush steppe, and subhumid mixed-grass prairie). Using a hierarchical partitioning approach, we (i) quantified {{the relative}} influence of conspecific <b>density,</b> heterospecific <b>composition,</b> and climate on temporal variation in population growth rates, and (ii) asked how {{the relative importance}} of these drivers depends on site aridity, species growth form and life expectancy, and abundance and spatial patterns. The data from one of the sites in this analysis are presented in one of the chapters of this thesis. We found that density-dependence had the strongest effect on species. Climate often had a significant effect, but its strength depended on growth form. Community composition rarely explained significant variation in growth rates. The <b>relative</b> importance of <b>density,</b> <b>composition,</b> and climate did not vary among sites, but was related to species 2 ̆ 7 life histories: compared to forbs, grasses were more sensitive to climate drivers. Abundance and spatial clustering were negatively correlated with the importance of density dependence, suggesting that local rarity is a consequence of self-limitation. Our results show that interspecific interactions play a weaker role than intraspecific interactions and climate variability in regulating plant populations. Forecasting the impacts of climate change on populations may require understanding how changes in climate variables will affect the strength of density-dependence, especially for rare species...|$|R

It was known that mechanical properties and shear strength of sand are closely related to <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> Therefore {{it is very important to}} determine accurate <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> In this study, Portable Cone Penetration Tester (PCPT) was used to estimate the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> and the internal friction angle of sand.

An empirical formula was proposed to describe {{the relationship between the}} tearing energy per unit fracture area, and the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> and strain rate for honeycombs subjected to indentation. Crushing envelopes of honeycombs were proposed for different loading angles, <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> and loading velocity. This study will enhance the use of aluminium honeycomb not only as lightweight material but also as energy absorber in different manufacturing industries...|$|R
