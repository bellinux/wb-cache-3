25|$|A <b>running</b> <b>engine</b> is much {{hotter than}} room {{temperature}} {{and the temperature}} {{in various parts of}} the system vary widely. This affects the actual flow, fuel effects as well as the dynamic wave effects in the engine which do not exist on the flow bench.|$|E
25|$|Of less {{interest}} is mass {{flow per minute}} or second since the test is not of a <b>running</b> <b>engine</b> which {{would be affected by}} it. It is the weight of air that flows through the port in a given time. Expressed in pounds per minute/hour or kilograms per second/minute. Mass flow is derived from the volume flow result to which a density correction is applied.|$|E

25|$|When Rolls-Royce Diesels {{introduced}} their C range engine, it {{was adopted}} by locomotive builders for use in Diesel-hydraulic locomotives. These benefited from having a faster <b>running</b> <b>engine</b> (1800 rpm). Likewise, YEC used the C series engines in a new range of locomotives, {{the first of which}} was introduced in 1955 and which continued to evolve until 1965, the higher engine speed being an advantage for diesel-electric locomotives as well.|$|E
25|$|A flow bench tests ports under {{a steady}} {{pressure}} difference {{while in the}} actual engine the pressure difference varies widely during the whole cycle. The exact flow conditions existing in the flow bench test exist only fleetingly if at all in an actual <b>running</b> <b>engine.</b> Running engines cause the air to flow in strong waves rather than the steady stream of the flow bench. This acceleration/deceleration of the fuel/air column causes effects not accounted for in flow bench tests.|$|E
25|$|BMP-3F â€“ Specially {{designed}} for operations at sea, with improved seaworthiness and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the required accuracy at sea state 2. Compared {{to the basic}} model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle. A new main sight, the SOZH, which has an integrated laser range finder and an ATGM guidance channel, is installed. This version can endure continuous amphibious operation for seven hours with the <b>running</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

50|$|Anti-collision {{lights are}} {{flashing}} {{lights on the}} top and bottom of the fuselage, wingtips and tail tip. Their purpose is to alert others when something is happening that ground crew and other aircraft need to be aware of, such as <b>running</b> <b>engines</b> or entering active runways.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{issue with}} the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of {{outwardly}} rotating (at the [...] "tops" [...] of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip {{down on the side}} of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the <b>running</b> <b>engine,</b> feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load. This same design feature was present from its earliest days on both the Luftwaffe twin-engine Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, and from the fourth prototype onwards of the otherwise troubled Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|E
2500|$|However, by {{the early}} 1950s, {{overhead}} valve V8s from sister divisions Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile, {{as well as new}} overhead valve V8s from Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Corporation, made the [...] "Silver Streak" [...] all but obsolete in power, It was a quiet, smooth <b>running</b> <b>engine</b> that served the needs of the 1930s and '40s American consumer adequately for power, if not reliability or economy, but by 1954, the engine was decidedly eclipsed not only by competing auto makers, but by General Motors' own divisions' products as well. Further hamstringing the [...] "Silver Streak" [...] was the aged, but cheap to produce, flathead configuration. Interesting to note that the Strato Streak V-8 was ready to go in 1953, but was held back by the protesting Buick and Olds divisions. Evidence of this is in the details of the chassis/steering of 1953 and 1954 Pontiac's which were designed for the V-8. [...] The V8 configuration of the [...] "Strato-Streak" [...] 287-cubic-inch engine that replaced it in 1955 did away with all the crankshaft and L-head related problems, replacing the Depression era [...] "cheap 8" [...] with a truly modern, durable but yet affordable design perfectly matched to Pontiac's target market. [...] A few years later (fall of 1956), under the guidance of Bunkie Knudsen Pontiac was determined to change its image into a performance car to boost sales, this led Knudsen to look for further talent such as in Pete Estes as chief engineer (taken from Olds division) and John DeLorean as director of advanced engineering,a former Packard and Chrysler engineer. Pontiac became known as a performance division based upon the durable, well performing V8s that came later, all of them based upon the original 287 of 1955.|$|E
