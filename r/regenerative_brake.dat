The resulting three-phase current drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a <b>regenerative</b> <b>brake.</b> Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.|$|E

The hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) is considered as a new-type car with strong enforceability, which can deal with energy crisis, pressure of environmental protection and realize the sustainable development of the auto industry at present. This paper proposed that the control parameters of <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> has influence on hybrid electric vehicle(HEV). Many experiment and simulation results show that reasonable selection of the control parameters of <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> for the HEV can increase energy recovery, which is good for reducing fuel consumption and keeping SOC.

A fuzzy-logic-based <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> strategy (RBS) integrated with series <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> is developed in this paper to advance the level of energy-savings. From the viewpoint of securing car stability in braking operations, the braking force distribution between {{the front and rear}} wheels so as to accord with the ideal distribution curve are considered to prevent vehicles from experiencing wheel lock and slip phenomena during braking. Then, a fuzzy RBS using the driver’s braking force command, vehicle speed, battery SOC, battery temperature are designed to determine the distribution between friction <b>braking</b> force and <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> force to improve the energy recuperation efficiency. The experimental results on an “LF 620 ” prototype EV validated the feasibility and effectiveness of <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> and showed that the proposed fuzzy RBS was endowed with good control performance.
